The earliest signs of people on Jamaica are the remains of the Arawak, an AmerIndian society that originated on the north coast of South America. Arawak peoples migrated to various Caribbean islands, arriving in Jamaica by the beginning of the eighth century. They were peaceful and lived by \\"slash-and-burn\\" farming. For meat, they bred pigs and ate iguana, both native to the island. They were highly skilled in such manual activities as thatching and weaving. In fact, the hammock was an AmerIndian invention that remains with us today; it is an object which, more than any other, evokes an image of a warm sunny day on a tropical isle. The Arawak left a legacy of paintings in places such as Runaway Caves near Discovery Bay, and shards of pottery found at their settlements near Nueva Sevilla and Spanish Town have added a little to our knowledge about them. Over 200 Arawak sites have been identified, and it is said that when the Spanish arrived in Jamaica there were approximately 100,000 Arawak living on the island. They called Jamaica \\"Xaymaca\\" (\\"land of wood and water\\"). Columbus and the Arrival of Europeans Columbus first arrived in Jamaica on 5 May 1494 at Discovery Bay, where there is now a small park in his honor. He stayed for only a few days but returned in 1502, landing here when the ships of his fleet became unserviceable; he waited at St. Ann's Bay for help to arrive from Cuba. After the death of Columbus in 1505, Jamaica became the property of his son Diego, who dispatched Don Juan de Esquivel to the island as Governor. Esquivel arrived in 1510 and created a base called Nueva Sevilla near St. Ann's Bay, from which he hoped to colonize the rest of the island. The Spanish immediately began subjugating the Arawak population, many of whom died under the yoke of oppression and of diseases carried by the Europeans. A number of them committed suicide rather than live the life created for them by the Spanish. The site of Nueva Sevilla proved to be unhealthy and mosquito-ridden, and in 1534 the Spanish founded Villa de la Vega, today known as Spanish Town. Pig breeding was the main occupation of these early settlers, but they also planted sugar cane and other crops that required large numbers of laborers. The number of Arawak had already fallen dramatically, so the Spanish began to import slaves from Africa to work the land; the first Africans arrived in 1517.

Write highlights for this article: Three U.S. Secret Service members will leave the agency because of an alleged prostitution scandal in Colombia, the agency said Wednesday. One of them is a supervisory employee who is being allowed to retire, and another employee has resigned, the agency said. A third agent, another supervisory employee, is being pushed out, with the agency proposing he be removed. A U.S. official said the agent plans to fight his ouster. Another eight members allegedly involved in the scandal are on administrative leave with their security clearances suspended. Scandal raises questions about macho agency culture. The employees are accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia ahead of last week's visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, who was there to attend a pan-American summit. The alleged prostitutes, the youngest of whom are in their early 20s, had all signed in at Cartagena's Hotel El Caribe, where the Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. But one of the women, the source said, was involved in a dispute about how much she was allegedly to be paid for the night. That dispute brought the incident to light and sparked controversy in both countries. A review board is expected to be created to determine whether the alleged scandal is an isolated incident or emblematic of a broader agency culture, a source said. \\"The only way they will prevent this from happening again in the future is to find out if this is one particular case or if it's a pattern,\\" said U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. \\"We're working and doing our own investigation and whatever we need from the Secret Service we've been getting,\\" King said. \\"We want a minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour account of what happened, how it happened, what went on, who knew what was happening. And I have no doubt the Secret Service will give us that.\\" As many as 10 U.S. military personnel from all branches of the armed forces are being questioned about potential misconduct, including five members of America's elite Army Special Forces. Obama has said he expects a \\"rigorous\\" investigation. Investigators are also looking into whether drugs were involved, according to a separate source with knowledge of the investigation. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan has told subordinates to use \\"all tools available\\" to conduct the investigation and has made it known that he believes drug testing is within his rights, the source said. It is not clear whether any of those accused have been tested, and authorities say drug use is not consistent with their findings so far, though they are continuing to investigate the allegations alongside local police. A U.S. official said the Secret Service interviewed all of the maids at the agents' hotel and the maids said they found no drugs in the rooms. The scandal is sure to come up when Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testifies next week at a previously scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Department of Homeland Security. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET Wednesday. At least one congressman, U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia, has called for Sullivan to be replaced. \\"There's only so many strikes you get, in baseball it's three,\\" said Forbes, a senior member of the House Armed Serves Committee, referencing a 2009 security breach in which a Virginia couple crashed Obama's first White House state dinner, as well as apparent agency overspending in that same year. \\"I think he's had three,\\" Forbes added. \\"I think it's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we're getting a different culture in the Secret Service.\\" Forbes seeks director's ouster. Sullivan has directed the Secret Service since May 2006. He has been with the agency since 1983. A Colombian official said Wednesday the incident has has overshadowed his country's showcase of the \\"beautiful, calm city\\" of Cartagena during the summit. Nausicrate Perez, a municipal official in Cartagena, said authorities were waiting for more details on the alleged scandal because Cartagena has no confirmation that local people were involved. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, said he is in close touch with Sullivan and believes he is taking \\"serious action\\" to investigate the incident. The Secret Service agents and officers being investigated range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, two government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday. Each agent was offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test, according to a U.S. official. Some of the agents and military personnel maintain they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official said. Even so, King said, \\"it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive.\\" House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said he has a high level of confidence in Sullivan. While soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in Colombia, it is considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. Military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct \\"prejudicial to good order and discipline.\\" The military personnel allegedly involved were sent to Colombia to support the Secret Service. A military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation told CNN that two of those being questioned are Marines and that Air Force and Navy personnel also are being questioned. CNN's National Security Contributor Fran Townsend, Juan Carlos Lopez, Dana Bash, Bob Kovach, John King, Barbara Starr, Jessica Yellin, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.

Write some highlights for the following article: Lewis Hamilton is adamant his situation and mindset have not changed now he is again leading the Formula One World Championship. So long the hunter over the course of the current campaign, Hamilton is back in front for only the second time this season in the wake of the events in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. After bitter rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg retired after 14 laps following a wiring loom failure in the steering column of his car, Hamilton went on to take the chequered flag. Lewis Hamilton dominated in Singapore to take a lead in the championship over teammate Nico Rosberg. The 29-year-old now has a three-point lead going into the final five races of the season, starting with next weekend's race in Japan, and followed swiftly a week later by the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. But despite the man now being hunted, Hamilton said: 'Nothing changes. 'I have believed, since the time I started training for this season, that I can win the world championship this year. 'And with a great car like this, even with some of the difficulties I've had, you know you are still within shooting range. 'You have to keep that positivity, belief and hope - hope is one of the most powerful things in the world - and I carry that with me each weekend. The Brit says he was always positive and won't change his mindset now he leads the way. 'I haven't lost that vision or that dream, that's still there, and I didn't leave Singapore thinking the title is more of a possibility. 'In my mind I'm still hunting for it and I've got to go just as hard, if not harder, over these final races. I've just got to keep going.' After winning the last two races from pole position, Hamilton would appear to have momentum on his side. But given Mercedes' unreliability of late, he is also aware of how quickly a situation can turn. 'Momentum is not something I generally talk about because it can be snatched away,' added Hamilton. Hamilton may have the momentum but Rosberg has shown how quickly it can all change over a season. 'Look at Nico. He had momentum from good results, and then one DNF (did not finish) and it was snatched away. 'I've also had that, so you just have to take it one race at a time. 'But I'm happy I've been at my best, getting the (recent) pole positions, maximising all the races. 'I now want to make sure these last five races - if I never do any more races in my life - are as good. They have to be the ones.'

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Ryan was born in Refugio, south of Victoria in south Texas, the youngest of six children, to Lynn Nolan Ryan Sr. (1907-1970), and the former Martha Lee Hancock (1913-1990). The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the Houston Post that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a 55-mile route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. In 1965, after graduating from Alvin High School, Ryan was drafted by the New York Mets in the 12th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. He was assigned the minor league Marion Mets in the Appalachian League. When Ryan was called up to the New York club the following year, he was the second-youngest player in the league. His first strikeout was Pat Jarvis, and he gave up his first major league home run to Joe Torre, a future NL MVP and Hall of Fame big-league manager.  Ryan missed much of the 1967 season due to illness, an arm injury, and service with the Army Reserve; he pitched only 7 innings for the Mets' minor league affiliate in Jacksonville. Ryan returned to the major leagues to stay starting with the 1968 season. Ryan was unable to crack the Mets' pitching rotation, led by Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. Ryan was used more as a reliever and spot starter by the 1969 Mets. To deal with frequent blisters on his throwing hand he often soaked his fingers in pickle brine, although the technique's effectiveness was questioned by Ryan's teammates and coaches.  Ryan pitched well for the Miracle Mets in the 1969 postseason. Against the Braves in the NLCS, Ryan completed a Mets sweep by throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3, getting his first playoff win (it would take him 12 years to get another). Then in the 1969 World Series, Ryan saved Game 3, pitching 2 1/3  shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles. The Game 3 victory gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the Series, which they went on to win in five games. It would be Ryan's only World Series appearance in his career.  On April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped it with a then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. Contrary to popular belief, Ryan never wanted to be traded from the Mets and felt betrayed by the team that drafted him. His views on this only calmed once he started running the Rangers and gained a better understanding of the business side of baseball. did he have any other records?","output":"Yes, Nolan Ryan had other records. In the article, it says that on April 18, 1970, he tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Then, four days later, his teammate Tom Seaver set a new MLB record with 19 strikeouts in a game. However, Ryan would eventually tie this record four years later. So, Nolan Ryan had a record for striking out lots of batters, which is really good in baseball!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which is the best example of a pure substance? Select from the following. (a). peanuts (b). milk (c). gold (d). air","output":"(c). Gold A pure substance refers to a sample with consistent properties throughout its mass and has a fixed chemical composition. Out of the four options provided, gold is the best example of a pure substance. To further understand why gold is considered a pure substance, let's break down and discuss each choice: (a). Peanuts: Peanuts are not a pure substance, as they are a mixture of several compounds and nutrients such as proteins, fats, and fiber. Also, peanuts themselves can differ in terms of size, shape, and taste. As they have variable composition, they cannot be classified as a pure substance. (b). Milk: Milk is considered a heterogeneous mixture, mainly made up of water, fat, proteins, lactose, minerals, vitamins, and enzymes. It has a variable composition, depending on the animal source, diet, and other factors. Additionally, milk has colloidal particles and sometimes visible fats that can be separated through processes like filtration and pasteurization. Hence, milk does not qualify as a pure substance. (c). Gold: Gold is an element with the symbol \\"Au\\" and an atomic number of 79. It is a metal with consistent physical and chemical properties throughout its mass and a fixed chemical composition. In its pure form, gold is composed of only gold atoms, making it a pure substance. However, it is essential to note that jewelry gold is often alloyed with other metals to improve its strength and durability and is not considered a pure substance. (d). Air: Air is a mixture of various gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. Its composition may vary depending on factors such as altitude, temperature, humidity, and pollutant levels. It is therefore considered a mixture, rather than a pure substance. In conclusion, gold is the best example of a pure substance among the options provided. It is a single element with a consistent composition and properties throughout its mass. The other options - peanuts, milk, and air - are classified as mixtures, as they contain variable compositions and do not display the characteristics of a pure substance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Knowing the strength of the hydrogen peroxide solution will help you decide the best course of treatment, whether the burn affects the skin, eye, or digestive system. The container’s label will note its contents’ concentration.  Most household hydrogen peroxide solutions are about 3% hydrogen peroxide and 97% water. These can cause minor irritation to the skin, eyes, or digestive system, stinging, and/or whitening of the skin, but can almost always be treated by simply flushing the area with cool water. Products that bleach hair can contain between 6 and 10% hydrogen peroxide, and can be more harmful than standard household solutions. Industrial solutions contain between 35 and 90% hydrogen peroxide. These can cause chemical burns that require immediate emergency care. You may notice blistering on the skin. Call emergency services immediately to treat exposures to industrial hydrogen peroxide. Free the burned or irritated area from contaminated clothing as soon as possible, especially when exposed to higher concentrations. Take off any clothes, jewelry, or other accessories that might have been splashed or soaked. Place the clothing in plastic bags if the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is 10% or higher. Hold the affected area under cool running water to rinse away the solution and ease pain. Flushing under a faucet will effectively treat small patches of skin exposed to household concentrations. Take a cool shower to flush larger patches of contaminated skin or areas exposed to a higher concentration. Chemical burns that result from hydrogen peroxide exposure can be treated like thermal burns. Continue to flush with cool water until pain starts to subside, use a mild soap to gently wash the area, and apply an antibacterial ointment.  Avoid scrubbing or breaking any small blisters that develop. Consider applying an aloe vera gel to ease discomfort. Within a day of exposure, look for signs including worsening redness, irritation, and pus or discharge from the burn. Seek a follow-up examination if you experience any of these symptoms. Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor, contact the medical professional who treated your wound, or visit a local clinic for a follow-up examination.

Write highlights for this article: Preparing for Christmas is a mammoth task for everyone, but for grandmother Sylvia Pope getting ready for the big day requires three months of hard work. The bauble-loving pensioner is forced to start hanging her decorations in September to make sure they are all up by Christmas Day because it takes so long to attach each one to her ceiling by hand. The 72-year-old spends a few hours each day creating the festive masterpiece, that will this year contain a staggering 2061 balls - 10 more than last year. Bauble-loving grandmother Sylvia Pope, 72, started putting the Christmas decorations up at her home in Swansea, South Wales, in September. Mrs Pope  spends a few hours each day  perfecting the colourful creation to ensure that it is complete by December 25. 'I absolutely love Christmas and my grandchildren's faces light up when they see all the baubles. It really is magical for them and that is all that really matters,' said the 72-year-old. The living room at her home in Swansea, South Wales, is plastered with baubles from around the world. She says: 'This year I've bought 10 new baubles and my new addition include Mary Poppins, Captain Hook and Peter Pan. I already had Tinkerbell. My grandchildren love the films those characters are in. 'My favourite Christmas film is Miracle on 34th Street, but I haven't managed to find a bauble for that film yet.' She started collecting them in 1999 and has ones from around the world. Once Christmas is finished Mrs Pope carefully removes each bauble from the ceiling, individually wraps them and stores them in 36 boxes in her attic. She then has the 2,000 holes in her ceiling filled in, before re-painting it, so that it is ready in time to start again for next year. She started collecting the baubles in 1999 and now has a massive collection of 2061 festive balls from across the globe. Once Christmas is over the 2061 festive balls will be carefully taken down, individually wrapped, and stored in 36 boxes in the grandmother's attic. Mrs Pope said that she may be forced to have her ceiling re-skimmed after Christmas this year to fill in all the holes created by her decorations. This year Mrs Pope has added 10 new additions to her display, including baubles featuring Mary Poppins, Captain Hook and Peter Pan. After the festivities this year the grandmother thinks that she may have to have her ceiling re-skimmed by a professional plasterer. 'Some people think it is over the top and tacky but when they see it for real its completely different. Most people love them and think they look fabulous'. Mrs Pope's collection also includes Disney characters, a London red bus, a New York taxi, aeroplanes, an old fashioned telephone and helicopters. She said: 'I normally spend about £100 a year on new baubles and visit all the festive markets to find new ones. This year I have spent about £80 so far but I haven't finished yet. 'When I go to the markets I normally find one I want to buy. I never get bored of buying new baubles.' 'My grandchildren and play 'I Spy' with the different baubles. We have great fun. 'Who knows maybe I could make the Guinness Book of Records one day.' Mrs Pope said: 'I normally spend about £100 a year on new baubles and visit all the festive markets to find new ones' The 72-year-old explained that she 'absolutely loves Christmas' and her 'grandchildren's faces light up when they see all the baubles' She said her grandchildren enjoyed playing 'I Spy,' in a bid to spot all  the different baubles.

Summarize this article: Jason Lawrance is alleged to have raped five women he met on Match.com, attempting to rape a sixth woman and sexually assaulting another. Derby Crown Court heard the alleged attacks happened between 2011 and 2014. The 50-year-old, of Liphook, Hampshire, who denies the charges, has begun giving evidence in his trial. Defence barrister Tracy Ayling QC went through each of the seven complaints from the women who have accused him of the offences. Mr Lawrance, who was questioned about his relationship with each of them, was also asked each time whether the sex or interaction with them was consensual. On each occasion he answered: \\"Yes... That's what Match.com is like, you meet for casual sex\\". Mr Lawrance also told Ms Ayling that he re-married in July 2014 - four months before the final rape is alleged to have occurred. Under cross-examination, prosecutor Shaun Smith QC asked him: \\"Are they [the women] all telling wicked lies about you?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Mr Lawrance, formerly of Hinckley in Leicestershire, replied. Mr Smith then asked: \\"If they are not lying then you are a dangerous rapist, aren't you?\\" Mr Lawrance responded: \\"I have never raped anyone.\\" The accused claims one woman was embarrassed about having sex with him in his van, and he stopped having sex with another woman when she asked him to. The prosecution had told the jury, Mr Lawrance used two profiles \\"keepitstraighttoday\\" and \\"straightmanlooking\\" on the website, but was keen to talk to women offline.

While I do not have enough information to answer the specific question about the Italian documentary, I can provide more information regarding the BBC TV documentary about Chopin's life.  The documentary you mentioned, \\"Chopin - The Women Behind the Music,\\" was produced by BBC Four in 2010. Directed by James Kent and presented by the pianist and composer Natasha Paremski, this documentary explores the life and music of the renowned Polish composer and pianist Frédéric Chopin. The film also focuses on the profound influence of several women in Chopin's life, including French writer George Sand, Polish countess Delfina Potocka, and Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind. These women inspired, supported, and shaped the composer's works, personal life, and career.

Can you fix that?","output":"Non-ECC / Non-Parity: Most stationary and laptop computers take non-ECC or non-parity memory. Non-ECC (Error Correction Code) or non-parity memory is the type of RAM used in the majority of stationary and laptop computers. This type of memory doesn't offer error correction, which makes it less expensive compared to ECC memory, which is designed to detect and correct memory errors. The lack of error correction makes non-ECC / non-parity memory faster, but also less reliable in specific, high-demand applications, such as servers and workstations. The primary difference between non-ECC and ECC memory lies in its ability to detect and correct memory errors. ECC memory is equipped with extra bits that enable it to identify and rectify certain types of memory errors, safeguarding data integrity. In contrast, non-ECC memory lacks this ability. As a result, non-ECC memory may be more susceptible to data corruption, which is typically not a significant concern for everyday users but can become critical for those engaged in high-stakes applications, like financial transactions or scientific simulations. Most consumer-grade computers, such as desktops and laptops, are built to handle non-ECC or non-parity memory due to its cost-effectiveness and sufficient performance for routine operations. For users who prioritize speed over data security, non-ECC memory is the ideal choice. However, for those who require a more reliable memory solution, ECC memory is the preferred option. Non-parity memory is another term commonly used to describe non-ECC memory. Parity memory incorporates a single parity bit to perform simple error detection, flagging the error without correcting it. Non-parity memory does not include this feature, making it functionally equivalent to non-ECC memory. In conclusion, non-ECC/non-parity memory is the most common type of RAM found in stationary and laptop computers due to its cost-effectiveness and acceptable performance for everyday use. While it lacks the error detection and correction features found in ECC memory, non-ECC/non-parity memory is sufficient for most consumer applications. However, users prioritizing data integrity and reliability should consider ECC memory for their computers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The third, hearing screams down below, rappels down to investigate where he finds his teammates dead and is killed by an unseen creature. Dr. Robert Verne (Robert Foxworth) is fed up with dealing with the squalor of city tenements, where he feels he isn't making a difference. He accepts a job from the Environmental Protection Agency to write a report on a logging operation near the Androscoggin River in Maine. The loggers are in a dispute with the local American Indian \\"Opies\\" (i.e., \\"O.P.s\\"), the original people. Dr. Verne's wife Maggie (Talia Shire) accompanies him on the trip. She is pregnant, but is apprehensive to tell her husband as he against having children. When flying in, they meet Travis Nelson (Burke Byrnes) and his two children Paul and Kathleen who are embarking on a trek into the wilderness. They also meet paper mill director Bethel Isely (Richard A. Dysart), who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at Opies. The latter have their own explanation; Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers, which Isely describes as \\"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies who refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks (Armand Assante) and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies.

Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A?  Hint: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line. A:","output":"In classical theory, to determine which object has a stronger gravitational pull - Earth or asteroid A - we can compare the gravitational forces acting between Earth and another object (we'll call it object X) and asteroid A and the same object X.  Step 1: Write the equations for the gravitational forces between the objects. Gravitational force between Earth (E) and object X (F_Ex) : F_Ex = G * (mass of E) * (mass of X) / (distance between E and X)^2 Gravitational force between asteroid A (A) and object X (F_Ax) : F_Ax = G * (mass of A) * (mass of X) / (distance between A and X)^2 Step 2: Compare the equations. In the equation, G and mass of X are constants that are present in both equations, so we only need to compare the remaining values: - Mass: Earth's mass is greater than asteroid A, as mentioned in the paragraph. - Distance: The distance between asteroid A and object X is greater than the distance between Earth and object X, as asteroid A is farther from Earth. Step 3: Analyze and justify. Since the mass of Earth is greater and it is closer in distance to object X than asteroid A is, Earth will have a stronger gravitational pull compared to asteroid A. So, Rob would choose Earth as the object with a stronger gravitational pull in the classical theory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Next question: who said i rob banks because that where the money is?","output":"The famous quote, \\"I rob banks because that's where the money is,\\" is attributed to Willie Sutton, a notorious bank robber in the United States. He was born William Francis Sutton, Jr., on June 30, 1901, and died on November 2, 1980. Sutton was a master of disguise and known for his meticulous planning of over 50 bank robberies during his criminal career, which spanned four decades from the 1920s to 1950s. He managed to steal an estimated 2 million over the course of his heists. However, there is some controversy over whether Sutton actually made this statement. The quote was popularized by journalist Mitch Ohnstad, who attributed it to Sutton in his newspaper column. In later years, Sutton denied ever saying it, stating that instead the credit belonged to someone else. Some sources suggest that during an interview with a journalist, Sutton was asked by the interviewer why he robbed banks, and the reporter created the iconic quote based on his response. Regardless of its origin, the quote has passed into popular use and become synonymous with Sutton's name. Willie Sutton's life was punctuated by a series of bank robberies, prison escapes, and eventual recapture. His criminal career prompted US law enforcement to seek innovative ways to apprehend bank robbers. Sutton's eventual capture in 1952 was a direct result of the then-new technique of sending \\"wanted\\" photos electronically via a system called \\"fax simile\\" (an early version of the fax machine). He was recognized by a passer-by after the circulation of his photograph. Sutton was sentenced to 105 years in prison but was eventually paroled in 1969. After his release, Sutton capitalized on his notoriety by becoming a consultant on bank security, co-authoring two books, and advising police officers on the techniques used by bank robbers. Despite his criminal past, the tale of Willie Sutton continues to captivate the public as an example of the quintessential career criminal, and his alleged quote remains central to his infamy."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

(CNN) -- Now that President Obama has set the timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, the debate has begun over its possible consequences. U.S. troops secure a street in in the southern Dura district of Baghdad, Iraq, this week. Does it provide enough time for Iraqis to forge a functioning government and an economy that benefits everyone? And if it doesn't, could a civil war be the result? The plan, as outlined in a February 27 speech by Obama, calls for most U.S. troops to leave Iraq by August 2010. A \\"transitional force\\" of 35,000 to 50,000 troops will remain in the country to assist Iraqi security forces, protect Americans and fight terrorism, Obama said. Track Obama's First 100 Days Obama's plan is predicated on a relative decrease in violence in Iraq and the belief that","output":"the Iraqi government and security forces can take on the responsibility of maintaining stability and order once the U.S. troops have withdrawn. While the plan has its proponents who argue that it sends a clear message of the United States' commitment to ending the Iraq war and allows Iraqis to take control of their own destiny, there are critics who fear that this timeline may not be sufficient for Iraq to build a fully functioning government and economy, ultimately leading to chaos or even a civil war. To address these concerns, it is essential to analyze different factors that will influence the success of the plan. Firstly, the capacity of Iraqi security forces will be crucial in maintaining order after the U.S. troop withdrawal. While there have been improvements in the performance of these forces, questions remain about their ability to take on the full responsibility of combating insurgent groups and maintaining law and order. The transitional force left behind by the U.S. will provide support, but it is ultimately the performance of the Iraqi forces that will determine the stability of the country. Secondly, a functioning and inclusive government will be key in preventing the renewal of sectarian conflict and civil war. Efforts to build a functioning government have shown some progress, but internal political struggles and factionalism still pose a risk. A failure to achieve political consensus among different Iraqi factions, address issues related to power-sharing, corruption, service delivery, and the representation of minority groups could create an environment in which civil unrest and violence can flourish. Thirdly, the economic well-being of the country plays a significant role in fostering stability. The Iraqi government must aggressively work towards creating jobs, rebuilding infrastructure, and fostering economic growth to ensure that its people have a stake in the success of the country. The impact of external factors, such as fluctuations in oil prices and regional economic challenges, can complicate Iraq's efforts to develop a stable economy. Lastly, regional and international factors, such as the policies of neighboring countries like Iran and Turkey, can also influence the stability of Iraq. A more stable region, combined with continued international support, both in terms of diplomatic engagement and financial aid, will mitigate the risks of a civil war erupting. In conclusion, while President Obama's plan for troop withdrawal is based on the premise that the Iraqi government and security forces would be capable of maintaining stability, there remains a degree of uncertainty regarding the outcome. A combination of factors, including the performance of Iraqi security forces, the functionality of the government, economic well-being, and regional support, will determine whether Iraq can avoid descending into chaos or civil war. Ultimately, time will tell if the provided timeline proves to be enough for Iraq to forge its path to peace and stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, Kesha, an American singer, songwriter, and rapper, provides uncredited background vocals on the track. Her full name is Kesha Rose Sebert, and she eventually rose to fame with her own single \\"Tik Tok\\" released in the same year. The song \\"Right Round\\" is a high-energy dance/pop-infused hip-hop track that samples the melody from the 1985 song \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" by Dead or Alive. As for the specific lyrical reference you mentioned in your question, \\"According to one of the song's writers, the chorus refers to oral sex,\\" it is indeed discussed in various interviews and reports surrounding the song. On the one hand, \\"Right Round\\" features lyrics that can be interpreted in various ways. Some listeners may take the lyrics at face value and interpret them as a catchy, fun dance song about enjoying a night out at a club or engaging in a playful, flirtatious relationship. On the other hand, some listeners and critics have noted the more suggestive nature of certain lines within the song, which could be interpreted as having a sexual undertone. One such interpretation is that the chorus refers to oral sex, as you've stated. It's important to remember that song lyrics can often be open to interpretation, and individuals may read different meanings into them based on their personal experiences, beliefs, and perspectives. In this case, while some people and the song's writer might see the chorus as a reference to oral sex, others might not necessarily perceive it that way. Music often brings about diverse interpretations, making it an integral part of its expressive nature. In conclusion, Flo Rida is the rapper in \\"Right Round,\\" with Kesha providing background vocals. As for the specific meaning behind the lyrics, it is plausible that the chorus refers to oral sex, as suggested by one of the song's writers. However, individual interpretations can vary, and, ultimately, the subjective nature of nuance in musical lyrics is what makes it an engaging and thought-provoking aspect of the art form."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Passage: Inside the SAPD, the first part of 1937 saw an intensification of differences over attitudes to a possible political party of the united left or a Popular front, and more precisely over the party's approach to the Soviet Union. The differences led to Peter Blachstein's exclusion from the SAPD. Others excluded at the same time included his political mentor and Erwin Ackerknecht: the three became the focus of a short-lived political grouping known as \\"Neuer Weg\\" (\\"New Way\\"). Blachstein was also affected more directly by the intense political tensions radiating out from Moscow, based on Stalin's suspicions - not entirely unfounded - that there might be comrades in the Soviet Union and further west in Europe who favoured an alternative Soviet leader. The POUM, of which Blachstein was a member, backed a broadly Trotskyite vision for a communist future and its members therefore became targets for Soviet agents. In June 1937 Blachstein was arrested in Barcelona by communist secret police and accused of spying for Franco and working for the Gestapo. With approximately 100 other foreign detainees he was taken to a large garage which had been adapted for use as an ad hoc prison. Because of the appalling hygiene he soon fell ill with Tuberculosis, as a result of which he was transferred to a sanatorium controlled by anarchist comrades. Helped by Spanish friends, in January 1938 he succeeded in escaping back to France.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. New Year’s resolutions are great, unless you don’t really resolve to do anything. Then they become a list of wishes. Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing. But it can also be the reason you fail yourselves time and time again. You say yes when you should say no, sign up when you should wait a few more months, and have a list of ten New Year’s resolutions when you should focus on two. Question: When do people usually forget their resolutions by? === The answer to the above question is","output":"usually by mid-January. According to various studies, New Year’s resolutions are often forgotten or abandoned by the third week of January, although this can vary from individual to individual. The main reason for this is the lack of planning and proper goal setting, as well as the unrealistic expectations that people set for themselves without a clear, actionable plan or adequate self-discipline to follow through. Many people also often feel overwhelmed by the number of resolutions they set for themselves, which can lead to a sense of failure and discouragement, furthering their inability to stay committed to their New Year’s resolutions. Moreover, many resolutions fail because they are not specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, or time-bound (SMART) goals. For example, a common New Year’s resolution is to \\"lose weight\\". However, without a specific target, a measurable way to track progress, ensuring it is achievable, making it relevant to one’s life, and setting a deadline, this resolution is likely to fail. Therefore, it is advisable to make SMART resolutions if one wants to achieve them. In addition, another reason why New Year’s resolutions are often forgotten by mid-January is due to lack of motivation or commitment. People tend to be excited and motivated at the beginning of the year, but as the novelty wears off and the challenges start to show up, the excitement dwindles and with it, the commitment to their resolutions. Psychologically, there's also the aspect of \\"false hope syndrome\\". When people set New Year's resolutions, they also tend to overestimate their ability to change, leading to unrealistically high expectations. When these are not met, the resolution is often forgotten or dismissed.  Lastly, some people also fail to create a supportive environment for their new habits. Without the appropriate environment, motivation, and resources that support new behaviors, it is easy for one to fall back into old habits.  However, all this is not to discourage the setting of resolutions or goals. If one is truly determined and committed to making meaningful changes in their life, a well thought out resolution could be a useful tool. It's all about understanding one's limits, setting up realistic and achievable goals, maintaining a consistent level of commitment, and most importantly, being kind and patient with oneself in the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Geda and his colleagues looked at the medical records of 3,500 men and women who lived near the clinic between 1962 and 1965. They all took the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,a standard personality and life experience test,Geda's team told a meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Miami. In 2004,the team interviewed the participants or family members. Those who scored higher for anxiety and pessimism on the test were more likely,as a group,to have developed dementia by 2004,including Alzheimer's disease and vascular   dementia.

Psychologists tell us boundaries are healthy and that it is important to reveal yourself to friends, families and lovers at appropriate time and places. But now few boundaries remain. The information you leave everywhere makes it easy for strangers to reconstruct who you are, where you are and what you like. Believe it or not, we live in a world where you simply can't keep a secret. The key question is: does that matter? When you ask Americans about privacy, most say they are concerned about losing it. But people say one thing and do another. Only a tiny part of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths  to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that can track automobile movements. And few refuse to offer personal information like Social Security numbers to get supermarket loyalty cards. But privacy   does matter--at least sometimes. It is like health: when you have it, you don't notice it. Only when it is gone do you wish you had done more to protect it. Question: Which of the following may serve as the best title of the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Privacy Is Getting Lost.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"Privacy Is Getting Lost\\" may serve as the best title of the passage. This title succinctly summarizes the central theme of the article, which discusses the erosion of personal privacy in the digital age. The article details various ways in which privacy is invaded or compromised, such as through email reading, website scanning, and examination of personal buying and calling patterns.  The article further discusses how this invasion of privacy occurs, noting that anyone ranging from intimate acquaintances to marketing companies and criminals could possibly access personal information for an assortment of reasons. It emphasizes on the ubiquity of this issue, stating that it's like a person’s identity can be pieced together by anyone, anywhere.  The title \\"Privacy Is Getting Lost\\" encapsulates this new reality, where boundaries are blurred and personal secrets are harder to keep, thus revealing the ubiquitous erosion of privacy. The article ends with a prompt reflection on the importance of privacy, drawing a parallel between privacy and health, both only noticeably valuable once lost.  Furthermore, it highlights an interesting paradox -- while Americans express concern over loss of privacy, their behavior in everyday situations does not always reflect proactive actions to protect it, thus suggesting a gradual acceptance of the fading privacy. Therefore, the title “Privacy Is Getting Lost” captures the essence of this complex discussion and serves as the most fitting title for the passage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Your dentist may prescribe a pain reliever for you to take after the root canal. If not, or if the pain is only minimal, take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Choose your answer from: *Speak to your dentist about whether or not that medication would work well for you. It can take two to three months for an over-the-counter pain reliever to help your body.; *The more ibuprofen or aleve you take, the less likely your case will be.

Sometimes root canal pain becomes more pronounced when the patient brushes the root.; *Although you'll be given pain medication during the root canal, you should take the otc pain relievers within an hour after the root canal. This will give them a chance to start working before your anesthesia wears off.;","output":"The more ibuprofen or aleve you take, the less likely your case will be.

If the pain is constant, but you feel a sharp stabbing sensation along the roots, you may want to consider visiting a doctor. Sometimes root canal pain becomes more pronounced when the patient brushes the root. Although you'll be given pain medication during the root canal, you should take the otc pain relievers within an hour after the root canal. This will give them a chance to start working before your anesthesia wears off. While it's important to manage the pain after a root canal, it's crucial to remember that proper aftercare is also key to a successful recovery. Avoid chewing on the treated tooth for a few days, or until it's fully restored. This will allow the tooth to heal and prevent any further damage. Additionally, maintain good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and using a mouthwash. This will help prevent any infection or complications. If your root canal pain persists for more than a few days after the procedure or worsens over time, you should consult your dentist immediately. It may be a sign of an underlying issue, complications with the procedure, or an infection. Your dentist will be able to evaluate your symptoms and recommend an appropriate course of action, which may include further dental work, a prescription for stronger pain relief, or a referral to a specialist. Another option to alleviate root canal pain is the use of cold or warm compresses. Applying a cold compress to the outside of your cheek near the affected tooth can help to numb the area and reduce swelling, which in turn can help to alleviate pain. In contrast, a warm compress can help to increase blood flow and reduce any inflammation. It is essential to determine which method works best for you, but always remember to follow your dentist's specific instructions on when and how to use these compresses. Finally, it's essential to keep an open line of communication with your dentist throughout the entire process. From the initial diagnosis to the post-treatment follow-up, your dentist is your best resource for advice and guidance. Discuss any concerns or questions you may have with them, as they can help tailor your treatment and pain management strategies to fit your specific needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hedren was born on January 19, 1930, in New Ulm, Minnesota, to Bernard Carl and Dorothea Henrietta (nee Eckhardt) Hedren. For much of her career, Hedren's year of birth was reported as 1935. In 2004, however, she acknowledged that she was actually born in 1930 (which is consistent with the birth registration index at the Minnesota Historical Society). Her paternal grandparents were Swedish immigrants, while her maternal ancestry is German and Norwegian. The Birds (1963) was Hedren's screen debut. Hitchcock became her drama coach, and gave her an education in film-making as she attended many of the production meetings such as script, music or photography conferences. Hedren said, \\"I probably learned in three years what it would have taken me 15 years to learn otherwise.\\" She learned how to break down a script, to become another character, and to study the relationship of different characters. Hedren portrayed her role of Melanie Daniels as Hitchcock requested. She said, \\"He gives his actors very little leeway. He'll listen, but he has a very definite plan in mind as to how he wants his characters to act. With me, it was understandable, because I was not an actress of stature. I welcomed his guidance.\\"  During the six months of principal photography, Hedren's schedule was tight, as she was only given one afternoon off a week. At first, she found the shooting \\"wonderful\\". Hitchcock told a reporter, after a few weeks of filming, that she was remarkable, and said, \\"She's already reaching the lows and highs of terror.\\" Nonetheless, Hedren recalled the week she did the final bird attack scene in a second-floor bedroom as the worst of her life. Before filming it, she asked Hitchcock about her character's motivations to go upstairs, and his response was, \\"Because I tell you to.\\" She was then assured that the crew would use mechanical birds. Instead, Hedren endured five solid days of prop men, protected by thick leather gloves, flinging dozens of live gulls, ravens and crows at her (their beaks clamped shut with elastic bands). In a state of exhaustion, when one of the birds gouged her cheek and narrowly missed her eye, Hedren sat down on the set and began crying. A physician ordered a week's rest. Hitchcock protested, according to Hedren, saying there was nobody but her to film. The doctor's reply was, \\"Are you trying to kill her?\\" She said the week also appeared to be an ordeal for the director.  Universal's executives, who did not back Hitchcock's decision to hire Hedren in the first place, were impressed with her performance and Wasserman described it as \\"remarkable\\". While promoting The Birds, Hitchcock was full of praise for his new protegee, and compared her to Grace Kelly. \\"Tippi has a faster tempo, city glibness, more humor [than Grace Kelly]. She displayed jaunty assuredness, pertness, an attractive throw of the head. And she memorized and read lines extraordinarily well and is sharper in expression.\\" The film was screened out of competition in May at a prestigious invitational showing at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. Hedren's performance was praised in Variety's review: \\"Aside from the birds, the film belongs to Hedren, who makes an auspicious screen bow. She virtually has to carry the picture alone for the first forty-five minute stretch, prior to the advent of the first wave of organized attackers from the sky. Miss Hedren has a star quality and Hitchcock has provided her with a potent vehicle to launch her career\\". Hedren received the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, tied with Elke Sommer and Ursula Andress. Her role as Melanie Daniels was named by Premiere magazine as one of the greatest movie characters of all time.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear.  But I can use this background: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.  What is an answer for this question: Which coat will absorb more sunlight? The answer is:","output":"The large black coat will absorb more sunlight than the large white coat. According to the given background information, when light is absorbed by matter, its added energy increases the temperature of that matter. Dark colors, such as black, have a higher tendency to absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. This absorption leads to a significant increase in temperature, which can be observed when touching dark surfaces or objects that have been exposed to sunlight for an extended period of time. In contrast, light colors, such as white, reflect more sunlight and tend to absorb less light energy. This is because these colors have a higher albedo, which is the proportion of the incident light that is reflected by a surface. With a higher albedo, more light is reflected, and therefore, less energy is absorbed by the material. This results in a cooler temperature for the light-colored items when compared to their darker counterparts. Considering all these factors, if Johnathan were to wear the large black coat, it would absorb more sunlight, making it warmer when compared to the large white coat. In the winter season, insulation and warmth are desirable features to stay protected from the cold temperature. Thus, the large black coat would be a better choice for Johnathan as it would absorb more sunlight and help keep him warm while walking to work in the cold winter weather."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the passage, it is mentioned that the upcoming meeting of the US Federal Reserve is expected to have a significant impact on the markets in the early part of the week. Investors are keenly waiting for any clues regarding the overall economic strength and the potential trajectory of interest rate hikes from the US central bank.  In the global financial markets, actions taken by central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, have significant consequences on various aspects of the economy, including inflation, growth, and exchange rates. As a result, investors and market participants keep a close eye on any news, updates, or indications from central bank authorities that could potentially influence their decision-making and investment strategies. In this case, the US Federal Reserve meeting is the focal point for investors who desperately seek information that might give them an edge in the market. By analyzing the expected decisions and statements from the Fed, investors would hope to anticipate probable policy changes, assess their impact on different sectors, and make informed decisions to maximize their profit potential. Interest rates, in particular, are a crucial factor in shaping the economy's short-term and long-term outlook. They influence consumer spending, borrowing habits, and the overall attractiveness of investments. An increase in interest rates may lead to decreased borrowing and spending, lower inflation, and a stronger currency. Conversely, a lowering of interest rates might encourage higher borrowing and spending levels, pushing up inflation and potentially weakening the currency. In summary, this text is discussing an upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting and its impact on the business and financial world. This meeting has the potential to shape economic growth and interest rates, affecting market participants' investment decisions and, by extension, the broader economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: So here’s something that won’t come as a surprise if you have season tickets for the Seattle Seahawks (the best football team in the known universe) or the Jacksonville Jaguars (the worst football team in the known universe): Good teams draw big crowds and bad teams draw small ones. That less-than forehead-smacking insight is what makes a new study in the business journal Applied Economics something shy of breaking news. According to the authors—economists from Nottingham University Business School and the University of Sheffield in Britain—the same rule holds for international cricket matches. And the headline of the press release announcing the study made no effort to conceal its sublimely obvious conclusion: “Strong teams attract crowds for international cricket,” it read. But science is often a far more nuanced thing than it seems—provided it’s properly explained. There is a rich and regrettable tradition among journals to promote studies that fall into the category science journalists alternately refer to as “blinding flashes of the obvious” or “The Annals of Duh.” Take “Causes of Death in Very Old People,” for instance. Um…I’m going to guess old age. Then there is this: “Blood Pressure Drugs Don’t Protect Against Colorectal Cancer”—though they may protect against, you know, high blood pressure. Or these: “Moderate Doses of Alcohol Increase Social Bonding in Groups” and “Dogs Learn to Associate Words With Objects Differently Than Humans Do.” If you already kind of guessed that people loosen up and feel friendlier when they’ve downed a shot or two, or that your dog can’t talk, you’d have been forgiven for giving these studies a pass. But under the no-news veneer of all of the studies, there was true news to be found. Blood pressure drugs reduce the output of norepinephrine and some animal studies have shown that that neurotransmitter encourages the growth of colorectal cancer cells, but that finding wasn’t holding up in people. While human babies tend to group objects by shape—so once they know a ball is round they will assume all round things are balls until they have reason to believe otherwise—dogs seem to use texture or size as their way of defining categories. Being dogs, they may never move beyond that point. And as for the cricket findings: previous economic studies had always concluded that it was the closeness of the contest—in which two evenly matched though not necessarily terrific teams were playing—rather than the excellence of the home team that determined crowd size. Nifty findings all—and none of which you’d know anything about if you didn’t read past the headline of the study. In a counterfactual age in which science is too often denied or ignored or carelessly shrugged off, it pays for the scientists themselves to consider all this. They no longer have the luxury of simply writing for other scientists—assuming, generally rightly, that that audience is sensitive to the nuance. They must, instead, write for all of us—the people who can best benefit from the science, if only we can understand it.

Given the context: How would Kendall feel afterwards?  Possible answers: going to enjoy new food, glad he tried pork, angry at himself Answer:","output":"It's not possible to definitively determine how Kendall would feel after eating pork for the first time after giving up the Jewish faith, as individual reactions can vary greatly. However, based on the given context, we can suggest a few possibilities: 1. Going to enjoy new food: Kendall might feel excited to try new kinds of food after leaving the strict dietary restrictions that the Jewish faith often imposes. Pork could be one of many foods he is eager to experience, and he might enjoy discovering new flavors and dishes. 2. Glad he tried pork: After eating pork, Kendall might feel a sense of satisfaction or relief for having taken this step. Trying pork could be seen as a symbolic way of confirming his decision to leave the Jewish faith, and actually enjoying the taste may reinforce that decision in his mind. 3. Angry at himself: On the other hand, Kendall might feel guilt, regret, or anger after eating pork. This could stem from an internal struggle surrounding his decision to leave the Jewish faith or lingering feelings of attachment to its customs. In this case, eating pork might serve as a reminder of what he has given up and cause him emotional distress. Again, it's essential to stress that individuals can respond differently, and the particular emotional reaction Kendall experiences might not be accurately represented by any of these possibilities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve 32 = -8*b + 48 for b.","output":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like we're playing with blocks. We have the equation: 32 = -8 * b + 48 The first thing we want to do is get all the numbers to one side and all the letter 'b' (our unknown friend) to the other side. Right now, there's a +48 hanging out with our 'b'. So, let's say bye-bye to +48 by doing the opposite, which is -48 on both sides of the equation. Here's what it looks like: 32 - 48 = -8 * b + 48 - 48 Now, let's see what we get: -16 = -8 * b Next, we need to help 'b' stand alone without the -8. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -8: -16 / -8 = -8 * b / -8 Oh, look! The -8 on the right side cancels out: 2 = b So our adorable little friend 'b' has the value of 2!

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who does the drug dealer have shot? from the following article ?  Lucille, a crippled man who is in a wheelchair from injuries sustained in the Gulf War, searches New Orleans for his friend Melvin so a documentary crew can follow Melvin.  They find him passed out on the street.  Melvin, an alcoholic and drug abuser, is in a downward spiral and spends most of his time partying with his friends.  His estranged ex-wife, Doreen, has filed a restraining order against him and taken sole custody of their young son, Rex.  Lucille wants Melvin to clean up and get sober, but Melvin only makes empty promises to eventually get his life together. Lucas, a science teacher at the local community college, performs regular tests on Melvin, who has telekinetic powers – the ability to move objects with his mind. Lucas can not explain this except that Melvin has a slightly different brain structure than ordinary people.  Melvin will not see a specialist despite Lucas' urging. Besides Lucas' tests, Melvin uses his powers to perform street shows for drug money.  Lucille, however, blames the local drug dealer, Nathan, of being behind violence in the neighborhood and does not like him.  This is echoed by Jimmy, a local cop. After a night of hard partying, Melvin's heart stops.  When he wakes, the doctors tell him that he was clinically dead for several minutes.  Changed by this experience, Melvin announces that he intends to become sober for the sake of Rex.  Impressed, Jimmy requests that Melvin help clean up the neighborhood.  After practicing his abilities, Melvin confronts Nathan's gang and threatens them.  Nathan has Lucille shot in retaliation.  After Lucille tells him to leave him alone, Melvin falls back into alcoholism and parties with a friend who was recently released from jail. Answer:","output":"In the article provided, the drug dealer Nathan has Lucille shot in retaliation for Melvin confronting Nathan's gang and threatening them. This act of violence further escalates the already tense situation in the neighborhood and greatly affects Melvin's well-being, ultimately leading to his relapse into alcoholism and substance abuse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Finding Joe an irresistable target for his sarcastic on-air wit, a Howard Stern-like deejay named Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), puts Joe on the air to tell his story. For three days Zander and a growing legion of listeners are surprised to find themselves captivated, delighted, and occasionally repelled by Joe's incredible tale of his search to find the parents who referred to him as \\"Joe Dirt\\" (rather than by his real last name, which he can no longer remember) and left him sitting in a garbage can at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old. Thorughout the film, the story reverts for short periods back to the KXLA studio for dialogue between Joe and Zander.Pivotal to Joe's story is the past relationship he reveals between himself and Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a beautiful farm girl from his adopted hometown of Silvertown, Idaho. Joe feels that Brandy and his dog, Charlie, were the only real friends he ever had. After living in and leaving a series of bizarre foster homes, Joe met Brandy one winter when he was living in the woods outside Silvertown and Charlie's testicles became frozen to the front porch of Brandy's house.

Electronica is an umbrella term that encompasses a broad group of electronic-based styles such as techno, house, ambient, drum and bass, jungle, and industrial dance, among others. It has been used to describe the rise of electronic music styles intended not just for dancing but also concentrated listening.  In North America, in the late 1990s, the mainstream music industry adopted and to some extent manufactured \\"electronica\\" as an umbrella term encompassing styles such as techno, big beat, drum and bass, trip hop, downtempo, and ambient, regardless of whether it was curated by indie labels catering to the \\"underground\\" nightclub and rave scenes, or licensed by major labels and marketed to mainstream audiences as a commercially viable alternative to alternative rock music.

Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).  and the situation: Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S).  Answer the following question: Which person studied more about portions of montane grasslands? The answer to this question is:","output":"Alice studied more about portions of montane grasslands.  This is because alpine tundra, which is found at high altitudes and mainly studied by Pam, is characterized by a harsh, cold environment with relatively low biodiversity, occurring above the treeline on mountain summits, slopes, and ridges. In contrast, montane grasslands and shrublands can be found at lower elevations and a wider range of latitudes, providing a more diverse and suitable environment for a variety of plant and animal life. Alice's focus on the lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S) would have exposed her to a broader range of ecosystems, which are likely to include more montane grasslands and shrublands that exist in subtropical and tropical regions. In these areas, the treeline is relatively stable and lies between 3,500 and 4,000 meters (11,500 and 13,100 ft), within which montane grasslands and shrublands can be more prevalent. In comparison, Pam's focus on high latitudes (70 to 50°N) would have involved the study of alpine tundra ecosystems that dominate the higher elevations within those latitudes. As alpine tundra occurs above the treeline, which rises at around 75 meters (245 ft) per degree when moving south from 70 to 50°N, the alpine tundra areas studied by Pam would not include as many montane grasslands and shrublands as the lower latitude regions studied by Alice. In conclusion, Alice, whose research concentrated on lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S), would have studied more about portions of montane grasslands and shrublands compared to Pam, whose research focused on high latitudes and primarily involved the alpine tundra ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Motaniec [mɔˈtaɲet͡s] (German: Spaldingsfelde) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Kobylanka within Stargard County West Pomeranian Voivodeship in north-western Poland.

Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat 'em? Lame. The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad, aside from the fact that she's played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was \\"the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him\\". She was a tease who liked playing with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting. Then in this P.O.S., it implies that he CAN have her, along with a girl on the side. What?

Given the question: Process:  - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Climate causes less wind and water happens, how will it affect MORE sedimentary rock forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of climate causing less wind and water can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of sedimentary rock formation. If there is a significant decrease in wind and water activities, it can greatly affect the erosion, transportation, and deposition of sediments, which are crucial steps in the formation of sedimentary rocks.  Direct effects of the perturbation: 1. Reduced erosion: Less wind and water means that there will be a decrease in the erosional forces acting upon rocks. As a result, the rate at which rocks are broken down and sediments are generated will decrease. Without a continuous supply of new sediment, the process of sedimentary rock formation may be slowed or inhibited. 2. Limited transportation: Wind and water are the primary modes of transportation for sediments. A decrease in their activities will limit the movement of sediments, potentially keeping them near their source and not allowing them to be deposited in new locations. The reduction in sediment transportation can also affect the mixing and mingling of different sediment types, which ultimately has an impact on the characteristics of the resulting sedimentary rock. 3. Impeded deposition: With less wind and water to carry sediments, the deposition process could be severely hindered. The deposition of sediments is necessary for the accumulation of layers that eventually become sedimentary rocks. If sediments are not being deposited and piled up, the subsequent compression and cementation processes cannot occur, resulting in limited formations of sedimentary rocks. Indirect effects of the perturbation: 1. Ecosystem changes: A change in climate that results in less wind and water can have cascading effects on the surrounding ecosystems. For instance, plants might not grow as abundantly in these conditions, which could reduce the amount of organic material available to mix with inorganic sediments. Therefore, the formation of certain types of sedimentary rocks, like those containing high amounts of organic material, could be affected. 2. Altered sedimentary basins: A decrease in wind and water activity may alter the size, depth, and distribution of sedimentary basins, which are important depositional areas for sediments. New basins could form in different locations, or existing basins could change their geometry and sedimentary fill patterns. These changes could impact sedimentary rock formation by altering the depositional environments and the types of sedimentary rocks formed therein. 3. Climate feedback loops: Climate perturbations can lead to various feedback loops in the environment, which may further affect sedimentary rock formation. For example, decreased precipitation may lead to reduced runoff, which in turn might decrease water erosion and sediment transportation. This feedback mechanism could compound the direct effects of the climate perturbation, further reducing sedimentary rock formation. In conclusion, the hypothesis that climate change causing less wind and water can indeed have significant direct and indirect effects on the process of sedimentary rock formation. The reduction in erosion, transportation, and deposition of sediments would likely result in a decreased rate of sedimentary rock formation and potentially alter the types and locations of sedimentary rocks being formed."},{"instruction":"The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

The Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Daoist founder, Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the Han dynasty General Li Guang and Western Liang ruler Li Gao.  This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai.  The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You.

Question: What happened because people adapted to new languages instead of standing their ground on the traditional languages on a region in the 500s? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

Please answer the following question: This article: Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the hit single by the man who was intimated by the talent of the band's chief songwriter?, what is it ?

Q:Background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.  Paragraph: Burma had many tropical forests, while a sister country from a temperate climate, Belarus, had beautiful ancient temperate forests. Both countries were significant lumber exporters.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country had a longer growing season?

These names are synonymous, with Cyanistes caeruleus being the more current and widely accepted name, while Parus caeruleus has been used historically in older scientific literature. Both belonging to the family Paridae, the classification of this bird has been updated over time using advances in genetic research. Eurasian blue tits are small, attractive, and acrobatic birds that are widely distributed across the United Kingdom, Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. They are easily recognized by their bright blue and yellow plumage combined with subtle white and green hues. These charming birds have a blue cap and wings, white cheeks, a soft green back, and bright yellow undersides that are longitudinally divided by a dark line down the center. Males and females have similar appearances, with males having a slightly brighter blue coloration. Blue tits are primarily insectivores, feeding on a variety of insects, caterpillars, and spiders. However, during the winter months, their diet becomes more flexible to include seeds, fruits, and other plant-based food sources. In addition, these birds are known for visiting gardens, feeding on peanuts or suet provided in bird feeders.  Eurasian blue tits are cavity nesters, often using tree holes, nest boxes, or even pipes and crevices in buildings to lay their eggs. Breeding season typically occurs from April to May, during which the female builds the nest and lays between 7 and 13 eggs. The incubation period lasts around 12-16 days, and after hatching, the chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge at approximately 21 days old. These birds are non-migratory and remain in their resident territory year-round. The conservation status of the Eurasian blue tit is \\"Least Concern,\\" according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with their population remaining stable and widespread across its native range. They are well-adapted to various habitats, including deciduous and mixed forests, parks, gardens, and farmlands. As a result, they are frequently seen throughout Britain, making them a beloved part of the local avifauna."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What key details about rolland courbis  can be extracted from the following bio?

First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and reversed what he saw as his father's laxness by cracking down on unorthodox sects and by decapitating an anti-Manchu writer his father had pardoned. In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \\"money to nourish honesty\\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners.

Answer a question about this article: Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values. In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the 50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \\"dime\\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while \\"eagle\\" and \\"mill\\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., 3.599, sometimes written as 3.599⁄10. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to 100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \\"paper money\\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of 20 (known as the \\"double eagle\\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \\"fractional currency\\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \\"shinplasters\\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating 100, 50 and 25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \\"Union\\", \\"Half Union\\", and \\"Quarter Union\\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = 100.

Here is a question about this article: Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150 °C. Above 210 °C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5 °C) and boiling points (907 °C). Its melting point is the lowest of all the transition metals aside from mercury and cadmium.

Scott said he’s “concerned” that “we have members of the media being irresponsible,” singling out Fox News, where reporter Mike Tobin said he saw the shooting of a young black man occur. “When you do stuff like that irresponsibly,” he continued, “media is supposed to report what they know, not what they think.” He pleaded with any national media still in Baltimore to cover some “positive” things as well, saying, “There are so many great things going on with young people in our town that we do not have to continuously show the negative about Baltimore.”      “Amen to members of the media being responsible,” Tapper replied. But he did want to know why there have been “such vatstly different accounts of what happened.” The anchor reported that police are hoping to release surveillance footage to put the public’s mind at ease that no one was shot by police.      Following Fox’s initial, frenzied reporting, Shepard Smith issued an on air apology, telling viewers, “We screwed up.”      Watch video below, via CNN:      Please enable Javascript to watch.

A fleeing suspect pulled out a revolver, which went off, and no officers fired their weapons, police said, denying conflicting reports from people at the scene. No one was injured, but the incident brought out a crowd of people and dozens of additional officers in riot gear. At least one person was pepper-sprayed as police tried to disperse the crowd.      The suspect was arrested for a gun violation and taken to a hospital \\"out of an abundance of caution,\\" police said.      The Freddie Gray case not only continued to fray nerves but also sparked a national dialogue on race and economic disparities as President Barack Obama invoked Baltimore on Monday in calling for more opportunities for young men and Gray's family said in a televised interview that perhaps the 25-year-old would \\"live forever\\" as a \\"martyr.\\"      Gray died April 19, one week after his arrest. Prosecutors have charged six police officers involved in his arrest and transport and allege he suffered a spinal injury while not wearing a seat belt in the back of a police van. Police union officials have denied that any of the officers are responsible.      Read the latest story here.      After more than a week of peaceful protests, a confrontation between students and police April 27 outside Mondawmin Mall erupted into violence; crowds threw rocks at police, looted businesses and set fires. Police said Monday they made 486 arrests linked to the unrest.      City, state and federal officials also continued to discuss recovery, and the CVS Health said Monday it was working on plans to rebuild in Baltimore, where two of its damaged drugstores remain closed.      Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen delivered prescription medication to those who couldn't get it from shuttered pharmacies. The city launched an online registry Monday to help the more than 235 businesses affected.      Fox News anchor Shepard Smith apologized to viewers on Monday after after one of the network's falsely reported that a black man had been shot by police during protests there. Mike Tobin said he saw police officers chasing a man and that \\"a police officer drew his weapon and fired and struck the individual who was running away.

Mike Tobin said he saw police officers chasing a man and that \\"a police officer drew his weapon and fired and struck the individual who was running away. SEE MORE VIDEOS      The Rev. Donte L. Hickman of the Southern Baptist Church and a developer pledged to rebuild the Mary Harvin Transformation Center, a Broadway East community center that was burned to the ground in a three-alarm fire on the night of the riots before it was completed.      The National Guard troops who were deployed to Baltimore have left the streets, and the last of them are expected to complete their mission Tuesday, a spokesman said.      About 1,400 remained on duty Monday morning but in various stages of demobilization, no longer \\"out manning the streets,\\" Col. Charles S. Kohler said.      Kohler said the remaining troops are completing duties such as packing away equipment and performing maintenance on vehicles.      Gov. Larry Hogan activated the guard last Monday, the day of Freddie Gray's funeral, after crowds in the city became violent. By Saturday, 3,000 Guardsmen were supporting police.      On Friday, Baltimore's top prosecutor announced charges against all six police officers involved with Gray's arrest.      The move eased tensions and led to celebratory rallies in the city, but arrests continued as people broke a citywide curfew. The curfew, which was lifted Sunday, required all city residents to stay indoors between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.      The city remained under a state of emergency on Monday. A spokeswoman for Hogan said Monday morning that the emergency would be lifted soon.      Police did not respond to a request to comment on how the National Guard's removal will affect their deployments in the city.      Meanwhile, a police investigation continues as Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby builds her case. The separate investigations by police and prosecutors have some conflicting findings.      While Mosby said Friday that the officers had made an illegal arrest because a knife Gray was carrying was not a \\"switchblade,\\" a violation of state law, the police task force studied the knife and determined it was \\"spring-assisted,\\" which does violate a Baltimore code.      The officers remain free on bail.      When the gunshot Monday caused panic in the street, Daisy Bush, 61, said she rushed to pack up a table of handbags and candies she had been selling outside her shop, D&D Variety Store, on Pennsylvania Avenue.      \\"It's rough for business; it's rough for everybody,\\" she said.      Bush, who has owned the shop for about 15 years, said the neighborhood had been \\"in an uproar\\" for the past week. She said it has been scary not knowing whether she would be safe outside her store.      \\"I don't think it's ever going to go back to normal,\\" she added. \\"Our normal is crazy.\\"      State Sen. Catherine Pugh said police allowed the 23-year-old shooting suspect to meet with his mother before he was booked.      \\"He's doing fine. He was physically checked and had no bullet wounds,\\" Pugh said. \\"He was very emotional, but he got to see his family. ... It was great to be there.\\"      Pugh, who has gone to the Penn North intersection every night to calm tensions between protesters and police, commended the department for its handling of Monday's incident.      One Baltimore United, a coalition of labor and community groups, called Monday for a civil and economic recovery program \\"to heal Baltimore,\\" blaming failures in policy for the city's struggles.      They were among many, including lobbyists in Annapolis, who said the urban poverty highlighted in the protests demonstrated the need for further investment in Baltimore's schools, mental health services and transportation.

An officer speaks to members of the media Monday, May 4, 2015, in Baltimore. Lt. Col. Melvin Russell said police pursued a man who was spotted on surveillance cameras and appeared to be armed with a handgun.... (Associated Press)      Smith told viewers that reporter Mike Tobin's mistake came during a chaotic situation Monday afternoon and was an \\"honest and straightforward\\" error and one that was corrected promptly.      Tobin had reported the shooting on Fox's \\"The Real Story,\\" telling host Gretchen Carlson that he saw police officers chase a fleeing man and that an officer had fired and hit the man.      But Baltimore police denied that a shooting had occurred. A black man was arrested in the incident, which came days after riots hit the city where another black man, Freddie Gray, died after being taken into police custody.      After hearing Tobin's account of events and a police denial given on-air to Fox reporter Leland Vittert, Smith addressed the initial story.      \\"And the truth is, according to police, there is no gunshot victim,\\" Smith said, later adding, \\"Nobody has been shot. No police officer has pulled the trigger. And on behalf of Mike Tobin and the rest of our crew there and the rest of us at Fox News, I am very sorry for the error and glad we were able to correct it quickly.\\"      In a separate report, Tobin offered an account but no apology.      \\"It would be very hard to duplicate a situation that looked more like a guy being shot,\\" Tobin said. He, his security team and cameraman thought the officer had his gun drawn and, after hearing a shot, saw the fleeing man on the ground.      \\"I arrived at the conclusion that the individual had been shot, as you naturally would in a situation like that,\\" Tobin said. The man looked to be in \\"bad shape,\\" he said.      The incident happened in the same area where police first spotted Gray before his arrest. Six officers were charged Friday in Gray's death.      On Monday, Lt. Col. Melvin Russell said police pursued a man who was spotted on surveillance cameras and appeared to be armed with a handgun. Police said the man was taken into custody after a brief chase, during which a gunshot was heard.      Russell said that police never fired their weapons and that no one was shot. Police recovered a handgun loaded with three rounds, one of which was spent. The man was uninjured and didn't want to go to a hospital, but was taken in an ambulance anyway, he said.      The arrest drew a crowd of protesters who chanted, \\"Black community, control the police!\\"      ___      AP reporters Ben Nuckols and David Dishneau in Baltimore contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Baltimore City Councilman Brandon Scott has criticized Fox News for their “irresponsible” reporting on a chaotic incident that was initially believed to be a police shooting in Baltimore.

To do this, we're going to subtract 235 from both sides of the equation.

Question: How does Lex hope to kill the clone? Movie title: Superman: Doomsday Movie plot: Lois Lane (Anne Heche) and Superman (Adam Baldwin) are romantically involved, but Lois is unsatisfied with keeping their relationship secretive and confined to the Fortress of Solitude. While digging for a project, workers from LexCorp unearth the spaceship of Doomsday, a genetically-engineered super-soldier. The creature is highly hostile toward anything that moves; it kills the digging crew and begins a bloody rampage towards Metropolis. Superman and Doomsday engage in a battle until Superman kills Doomsday and succumbs to his own injuries. Lex Luthor (James Marsters) kills his personal assistant Mercy Graves to ensure no one else knows of LexCorp's involvement. The world mourns and Metropolis honors him with a memorial. Superman's friends cope with his death in various ways: Jimmy Olsen takes a job at a tabloid newspaper, the National Voyeur, Perry White becomes an alcoholic, and Lois, who realized that Clark was Superman, visits Martha Kent for counsel. In Superman's absence, Metropolis is overwhelmed by criminals. Toyman uses a giant mechanical spider to hold children hostage. Lois decides to save them herself, but Toyman tries to kill her and a little girl. Superman digs out of his grave and saves Lois, apprehending Toyman. He doesn't seem quite the same but Lois dismisses it as shock. She becomes suspicious, however, when Martha tells her Clark has not called home. The resurrected Superman is revealed to be a clone created by Lex from a blood sample retrieved after the Doomsday battle. Lex is keeping the real Superman's body preserved in a tube, unaware that Superman is still barely alive. He periodically tortures the clone Superman in a special lead-lined red-sunlight room with kryptonite gauntlets. A robot from the Fortress of Solitude recovers Superman's body after detecting he was still alive and begins restoring Superman to health.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Updated at 5:10 EST with audio of the call.      Updated at 6:12pm EST with confirmation that the call did indeed come from the Santorum campaign      LANSING, MI — Rick Santorum’s campaign is locked in a tight battle with Mitt Romney ahead of Tuesday’s Michigan primary. On Monday his camp started openly courting a demographic that’s not often reached out to in GOP primaries: Democrats.      Michigan’s primary rules allow Dems to vote in the state’s GOP primaries. The liberal site DailyKos and other progressive partners have been trying to drum up enthusiasm for “Operation Hilarity” - an effort to get Democrats to vote in the GOP primary and tilt the vote against Mitt Romney. The Santorum campaign evidently decided they’d take votes from any legitimate source.      Following some speculation that the robocall may have been a “false flag” effort designed to harm Santorum, a spokesman Hogan Gidley confirmed to TPM that they were indeed footing the bill, and reaching beyond party lines. “If we can get the Reagan Democrats in the primary, we can get them in the general,” he told TPM.      It’s a controversial tactic. Bill Ballenger, a longtime Michigan politico and the editor of Inside Michigan Politics, spoke with TPM about the call earlier in the day. He said the call piqued his interest because it sounded like it could have come from a union targeting Romney ahead of the Feb. 28 primary. The call focuses on Romney’s opposition to the auto bailout and calls on Democrats to vote for Santorum Tuesday because of it.      “It went on and on like this and I kept listening because I kind of smelled a rat,” Ballenger said. “And finally at the very end, in a tagline it says, ‘this call was paid for by the Santorum for president committee.’”            TPM readers in Michigan reported Monday receiving the same robocall as Ballenger. TPM Reader BG emailed in to say he’d received a robocall where the “voice sounded Union-ish” and “said the word ‘Democrats’ repeatedly, though not as a derogatory label.” He stayed on to hear who claimed the call in the tagline at the end and “yup, it was from the official Santorum campaign.”      TPM obtained audio of the call from a reader in Trenton, MI who said it showed up on his answering machine Monday morning. Ballenger confirmed the call was the one he heard.      I asked Ballenger, who’s followed many elections in Michigan, if the Santorum call classifies as playing dirty.      “This is a dirty trick,” he said. “I mean, first of all you know how these robocalls are. You get one, generally speaking, you kind of after the first couple of sentences you know what they’re after. If you don’t hang up right away you get the message, right? Well, most people don’t listen all the way through [and] you have to listen to the bitter end of this one to get the clincher. Otherwise, you’d hang up and you’d be convinced this came out of UAW Solidarity House or the Obama reelection campaign.”      What’s more, Ballenger said, the messenger delivering an attack on Romney for opposing the auto bailout is a little disingenuous.      “You talk about chutzpah: here’s Santorum who’s just as opposed to the bailout as Romney is, but he’s putting out robocalls to Democrats urging them to crossover and vote in the Republican for Santorum,” Ballenger said. “The only thing intellectually in the whole message that it seems to be the Santorum committee could use to justify this tactic is the one line that, you know, ‘Romney was all too happy to support bailing out Wall Street, but not Michigan.’ Santorum is in the position all along of ‘a plague on both their houses. No bailouts for anybody.’”      There’s already another controversy about a pro-Santorum robocall which is tagged as coming from the National Rifle Association, but which the gun rights organization denies it is running.      David Taintor contributed to the reporting for this article. ||||| Mitt Romney is calling Rick Santorum's calls to Democrats to vote in Tuesday's primary in Michigan \\"outrageous\\" and \\"disgusting\\" but Santorum says he's not doing anything besides getting people to vote in an open primary.      Romney complained about the automated calls Tuesday, as Michigan voters go to the polls in the Republican presidential primary. Arizona also votes Tuesday in a winner-take-all battle, but Michigan, with its proportional delegate award system, has added value since Romney was born in the state and his father served as governor there.      \\"I know why Obama doesn't want me to face him but I just think it's outrageous and a terrible dirty trick at the last hour, by the way, late in the afternoon on the day before the election, maybe hoping no one would notice, they start sending out calls to Democrats, union members telling them to go into the Republican primary and vote against Mitt Romney,\\" he said.      \\"This is a new low for his campaign and that's saying something,\\" Romney told Fox News      Santorum told Fox News on Monday night that he is trying to attract the Democratic voters he'll need in a general election campaign. He added that nothing he's said in his robo-call is any worse than the campaign Romney has run.      \\"When he runs a robo-call of my voice from four years ago saying good things about him, that's not a low moment, and when I run a call basically saying, calling Democrats that are eligible to vote here, to vote for us, that's a low (moment)?\\" he said.      \\"And of course, you know, it's interesting that he criticizes me for attracting Democrats because one of the things that the Governor Romney's people say is, oh, he can't attract Democrats. Well, guess what? We will wait and see. I think we can.\\"      The robocall going around Monday says Democrats should send \\"a loud message\\" to Romney by voting for Santorum. The message says it's supported by \\"hard-working Democratic men and women\\" and paid for by the Santorum campaign.      Indeed, Democrats have made no bones about their efforts to force a Romney loss in the GOP primary. The pro-President Obama super PAC, Moveon.org and the campaign itself have all run ads against Romney in the Wolverine State.      On Monday, liberal blogger Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote that a \\"million-dollar anti-Romney effort (with much of that money coming from Democrats and progressives) has dragged Romney back down to where Santorum can catch him.\\"      He added that \\"the big-money campaign\\" aims to drive down Romney's numbers among independents and the Michigan Democratic Party is also engaged in getting Democrats to cast votes for Santorum, \\"reminding them that casting such votes in no way prohibits them from voting in Democratic contests later in the year.\\"      \\"The quicker Romney can transition to 'general election' mode, the quicker he can move to the center and start repairing the damage. And as long as Santorum drives the debate, he helps galvanize base Democratic constituencies. ... There is no downside to dragging this contest out a month or two longer,\\" Kos wrote.      While the two candidates run neck-and-neck -- late polling showing virtually no difference between the two -- Santorum is also asking volunteers to come out Tuesday night to \\"help in ensuring the accuracy of ballots collected.\\"      Whoever wins in Michigan, the 30 delegate count will only go a small way toward gaining the 1,144 required to win the party nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla.      So far, The Associated Press has tallied 123 delegates for Romney to 72 for Santorum. Newt Gingrich, who is focused on Washington state caucuses Saturday, with 40 delegates at stake and Super Tuesday states next week and not Tuesday's battle in Michigan, has 32 delegates and Ron Paul has 19. Next Tuesday's 10 primaries and caucuses will gin up another 419 delegates.      But Michigan's battle would follow a three-state sweep by Santorum earlier in the month, which while not awarding delegates yet, forced Romney into a bit of a defensive mode in Michigan. He hosted nearly a dozen public events as he and his allies have spent more than 2 million on local television advertising.      Romney predicted victory Monday night at the Royal Oak Music Theatre, where rocker-rapper Kid Rock performed.      \\"I'm going to win in Michigan and I'm going to win across the country,\\" Romney said.      Santorum, seeing fluctuations in polling, was more reserved on Monday night.      \\"I think the fact that we are doing as well as we are is a pretty big deal in this state,\\" he said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Rick Santorum's campaign tried to get more votes in the Michigan primary by reaching out to Democrats, since Michigan's rules let them vote in the state's Republican primaries.

They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a  visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who patented the first rigid-hulled inflatable boat?","output":"The first name of the person who patented the first rigid-hulled inflatable boat is Desmond. Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare patented the boat at St Donat's in the 1960s."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read both questions carefully. - How do I motivate myself to study subjects I don't like? - How do I motivate myself to study the subjects I don't like? 2. Identify the main subjects and verbs in each question. - In both questions, the subject is \\"I\\" and the main verb is \\"motivate.\\" 3. Determine the objects and complement phrases of the verbs. - In both questions, the object is \\"myself\\" and the complement phrase is \\"to study subjects I don't like\\" and \\"to study the subjects I don't like,\\" respectively. 4. Identify the difference between the two questions. - The only difference between these two questions is the presence of the word \\"the\\" before \\"subjects\\" in the second question. 5. Analyze the impact of the difference on the meaning of the questions. - The presence of \\"the\\" in the second question makes it slightly more specific, implying that there is a known set of subjects that the person doesn't like. In contrast, the first question is more general, referring to any subjects the person may dislike. However, in most practical contexts, this distinction would likely not have a significant impact on the overall meaning. After analyzing the questions, they can be considered to have the same meaning in most practical contexts. The slight difference in phrasing is unlikely to affect the interpretation of the question or the answer provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When translating a phrase like \\"You Belong to Me,\\" it's essential to take into account the context in which it's being used. Depending on the context, there might be slight variations in the word choice or word order in the translation. In Russian, words are often inflected to show their grammatical function in a sentence, like gender, case, and number of the noun. Additionally, verbs are conjugated to correspond with the subject in gender, number, and tense. For example, If this phrase were to be part of a song or a poem, the translation might be changed slightly to preserve the rhyme scheme or the overall aesthetic of the piece. In some cases, the translation could be rephrased for a smoother or more natural feeling in Russian.

In fact, he _ in the kitchen. He's in his perfect place when dicing tomatoes, making salads and baking cakes. By the time Kenny, 16, reached his third year of high school at Hickory Grove, North Carolina, US, he had become vice president of his school's cooking club. He also opened his own food company, called Modern Fusion. Kenny said he developed his love of cooking by watching his mother, and his grandmother, who owned a catering   business herself. Kenny helped them both in order to remember their tips: how long to cook chicken so it stays wet, and the right amount of tomatoes to add to a spaghetti dish. At the age of 5, he cooked his first dish of shrimp and broccoli. Taking it for his school lunch, he warmed it up in the school's microwave, while the other kids ate their sandwiches. \\"I love to eat, and it started to become more fun to cook than to use a microwave,\\" he said. Cooking came easy to Kenny, and he enjoyed adding new ingredients into common dishes. \\"It started with a passion   and I wanted to know more,\\" he said. He began to watch the Food Network and read chef blogs. Last summer, Kenny put his skills to the test by working with his grandmother to cater his uncle's wedding. While she cooked traditional dishes, Kenny wanted to add new to the expected flavors  . Now Kenny spends his weekends catering his own events: weddings, birthday parties, baby showers. Kenny's dishes are always a hit. Chef Frederick Mookie Hicks, owner of a catering business, said Kenny's success comes from his ability to multitask in the kitchen.

In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - The River Torrens is the most significant river of the Adelaide Plains and was one of the reasons for the siting of the city of Adelaide, capital of South Australia. It flows from its source in the Adelaide Hills near Mount Pleasant, across the Adelaide Plains, past the city centre and empties into Gulf St Vincent between Henley Beach South and West Beach. The upper stretches of the river and the reservoirs in its watershed supply a significant part of the city's water supply. The river's long linear parks and a constructed lake in the lower stretch are iconic of the city.  - Adelaide city centre is the innermost locality of Greater Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. It is known by locals simply as \\"\\"The City\\"\\" or \\"\\"Town\\"\\" to distinguish it from Greater Adelaide and from the City of Adelaide (which also includes North Adelaide and the parklands). The locality is split into two key geographical distinctions: the city \\"square mile\\", bordered by North, East, South and West Terraces; and the section of the Adelaide Parklands south of the River Torrens which separates the built up part of the city from the surrounding suburbs and North Adelaide.   - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - The Onkaparinga River is a river located in South Australia south of the Adelaide city centre . It runs from its source between Mount Torrens and Charleston in the Mount Lofty Ranges , and flows south westerly to an estuary at Port Noarlunga . The catchment is over 500 square kilometres ( 190 sq mi ) in area , and in part includes the following protected areas - the Encounter Marine Park , the Onkaparinga River National Park , the Onkaparinga River Recreation Park and the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve . The Onkaparinga River is the second major river within the Adelaide metropolitan area , after the River Torrens . The name derives from the Indigenous Kaurna name Ngangiparri which translates as \`\` The Women 's River '' . In 1837 Surveyor General Col William Light named it Field 's River , or the Field River , after Lieut William George Field RN ( 1804 - 1850 ) of the brig Rapid , who carried out the first surveys in the vicinity of its estuary , but subsequent Governor George Gawler soon reinstated the Indigenous name . The first Europeans to explore its sources and the Onkaparinga Valley were the party of Dr. George Imlay and John Hill in January 1838 . It is a source of fresh water for Adelaide . Mount Bold Reservoir was constructed between 1932 and 1938 along a section of its path approximately 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) inland . Much of its flow is diverted via a tunnel from the Clarendon Weir to the Happy Valley Reservoir , that in turn supplies some 40 per cent of Adelaide 's water supply . Most years the flow to the reservoir is supplemented by water pumped from the River Murray via a pipeline from Murray Bridge .

The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners.

Information:  - Erasure are an English synthpop duo, consisting of singer and songwriter Andy Bell and songwriter and keyboardist Vince Clarke. They formed in London, and entered the music scene in 1985 with their debut single \\"Who Needs Love Like That\\". Following the release of their fourth single \\"Sometimes\\", the duo established itself on the UK Singles Chart and became one of the most successful artists of the late 1980s to mid-1990s.  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.  - Krautrock (sometimes called \\"kosmische Musik\\") is a broad genre of experimental rock that developed in Germany in the late 1960s. The term \\"krautrock\\" was originated by English-speaking music journalists as a humorous name for a diverse range of German bands whose music drew from sources such as psychedelic rock, avant-garde electronic music, funk, minimalism, jazz improvisation, and world music styles. Largely divorced from the traditional blues and rock and roll influences of British and American rock music up to that time, the period contributed to the evolution of electronic music and ambient music as well as the birth of post-punk, alternative rock and new-age music. Important acts of the scene include Can, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, and Faust.  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - New wave is a genre of rock music popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with ties to 1970s punk rock. New wave moved away from smooth blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop music that incorporated electronic and experimental music, mod and disco. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct, genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synthpop, college rock and gothic rock.  - The UK Singles Chart (currently entitled Official Singles Chart) is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC), on behalf of the British record industry, listing the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom, based upon physical sales, paid-for downloads and streaming. To be eligible for the chart, a single is currently defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as either a 'single bundle' having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes or one digital audio track not longer than 15 minutes with a minimum sale price of 40 pence. The rules have changed many times as technology has developed, the most notable being the inclusion of digital downloads in 2005 and streaming in 2014.  - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  - \`\` A Little Respect '' is a song written and recorded by British synthpop duo Erasure , released in September 1988 as their tenth single . It was issued as the third European ( and second American ) single from their album The Innocents . Known as one of their signature songs , \`\` A Little Respect '' continued Erasure 's success on the UK Singles Chart , where it hit number four to become the band 's fifth Top 10 single . It was also Erasure 's second consecutive Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 , where it climbed to number 14 , and hit number two on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs chart . In the U.K. Mark Saunders and Phil Legg provided the remixes , for the U.S. the remixes were made by Justin Strauss . Written by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell , the heavily synthesized instrumentation is accentuated by acoustic guitar and Bell 's use of falsetto in the chorus . The lyrics are an empowering plea to a lover to show compassion and respect . An acoustic version of \`\` A Little Respect '' is featured on the Moon & the Sky Plus EP in the UK . The song was remixed in 2006 by Jaded Alliance for the Future Retro compilation , and again in 2009 by Avantara for the Pop ! Remixed album and EP and by Wayne G & Andy Allder for inclusion on the Phantom Bride EP . Erasure remixed and re-released the track in December 2010 as a digital download - only single for charity . Proceeds from the sale of the single benefit the Hetrick - Martin Institute , the home of the Harvey Milk High School in New York , and the True Colors Fund . Called the \`\` HMI Redux '' , it includes additional vocals from the Hetrick - Martin Institute youth chorus . Numerous HMI youth were featured in the \`\` HMI Redux '' music video that accompanied the track . Produced by Laundry Service Media and directed by Jason Stein , the video premiered on the Huffington Post and was featured on Perez Hilton .  - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008.  - \\"Who Needs Love Like That\\" is the debut single released by British synthpop duo Erasure. The song was released in the UK on Mute Records in 1985 as a prelude to their debut album \\"Wonderland\\". The video was directed by John Scarlett Davies and produced by Nick Verden for Aldabra.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Vince Clarke (born Vincent John Martin; 3 July 1960) is an English synthpop musician and songwriter. Clarke has been the main composer and musician of the band Erasure since 1985, and was previously the main songwriter of several groups, including Depeche Mode, Yazoo and The Assembly.

Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army.

The post became available after the former head of the IMF Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned. Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested in the US last month on charges of an alleged sexual assault. He has denied the charges. The IMF said it expects to complete the selection process by 30 June. \\"The Executive Board will meet with the candidates in Washington DC and, thereafter, meet to discuss the strengths of the candidates and make a selection,\\" the fund said. Ms Lagarde is considered by many as the front runner for the post. She is backed by the European Union and in recent days she has also won the support of Egypt, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates. Mr Carstens has the support of Latin American countries. However, he acknowledged that his rival had the edge in the race. \\"I'm not fooling myself. It's like starting a soccer game with a 5-0 score,\\" Mr Carstens said during an appearance at the Peterson Institute for International Economics on Monday. However, Mr Carstens said that if a European candidate is appointed to the post, it may result in a conflict of interest, given the ongoing debt-crisis in some of the European countries. \\"We could have a situation where borrowers dominate the institution,\\" he said. Mr Carstens said that the European debt-crisis had snowballed into a big problem over the years and the region needed a fresh perspective in order to solve the problem. \\"What will help me is precisely to have a fresh pair of eyes,\\" he said. \\"Also someone coming from the outside can in a way speak of their mind more frankly and I think that will be an advantage,\\" he added. Ricardo Ochoa, head of international affairs at Mexico's finance ministry, said that Mr Carstens' experience as the head of the country's central bank, would allow him to be more sensitive to the problems of countries which needed IMF aid. \\"He has been on the other side of the table,\\" Mr Ochoa told the BBC. \\"Mexico already has been in the situation where important reforms have to be implemented, and I think that puts him in a situation - to have a more understanding and more sensitive IMF,\\" Mr Ochoa added. Summary:","output":"The top role at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is contested between French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and Governor of the Bank of Mexico Agustin Carstens after Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned following his arrest for an alleged sexual assault charge in the U.S, a charge he has denied. The IMF announced it expects to complete the selection process by June 30, involving meetings in Washington DC with the candidates.  Lagarde is seen as a front-runner by many due to her endorsement by European Union, Egypt, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates. Carstens, who has support from various Latin American countries, is aware of his comparative disadvantage in the race, likening the situation to \\"starting a soccer game with a 5-0 score\\".  However, Carstens highlighted potential complications if a European candidate like Lagarde is chosen. With the ongoing European debt crisis, he opined that the appointment of a European leader could lead to a conflict of interest. Carstens believes that this particular crisis has escalated significantly over time, requiring a fresh non-European perspective to aid in resolution.  Moreover, he pointed out that an outsider candidate could potentially be more open and frank in their discussions, which would be advantageous. Ricardo Ochoa, head of international affairs at Mexico's finance ministry, also vouched for Carstens, reiterating his experience as the head of the country's central bank, which allows him to be more sensitive and understanding of the issues faced by countries requiring IMF’s assistance. According to Ochoa, this puts Carstens in a position to potentially lead a more empathetic and understanding IMF."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Before solving for v, we need to combine the like terms on the right side of the equation, which are the terms with the variable v: 29*v - 14*v can be simplified as: (29 - 14)*v = 15*v So now the equation is 11*v = 15*v. Step 3: Isolate the variable (v) To isolate v, we need to remove the terms involving v from one side of the equation.  Since 11*v and 15*v are on opposite sides, we can subtract 11*v from both sides of the equation to cancel out the 11*v term on the left. This does not affect the equality: 11*v - 11*v = 15*v - 11*v Which simplifies to: 0 = 4*v Step 4: Solve for v To find the value of v, we need to eliminate the coefficient of v, which is 4.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. The atrocities during the war have been described as the worst crimes committed in Europe since World War Two. At a UN tribunal in The Hague, judges found him guilty of 10 out of 11 counts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other atrocities in the Bosnian war of the 1990s, including leading the slaughter of thousands of Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) and Croats. One count of genocide related to the massacre of more than 7,500 Muslim men and boys in the Srebrenica enclave in July 1995, which the UN said was part of a campaign to \\"terrorise and demoralise the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat population\\". He was found not guilty in one count of genocide, relating to the forcible expulsion of hundreds of thousands of non-Serbs from seven towns and villages in Bosnia. The trial was a weighty affair - lasting five years, followed by an additional 18-month deliberation by the bench. Over 497 days, Mr Karadzic conducted his own defence, referring to some three million pages of evidence against him. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison - though his lawyer has indicated he will appeal. Balkans war: a brief guide Serbia timeline How do you define genocide? The former Bosnian Serb leader was also found guilty of orchestrating the shelling of Sarajevo, and the use of 284 UN peacekeepers as human shields in May and June 1995. As he closed his case, he told the tribunal there was not a shred of evidence against him, although in a written statement he accepted that in his role as political leader of the Bosnian Serbs he bore \\"moral responsibility\\" for crimes they had carried out. Radovan Karadzic spent 13 years on the run before being handed over to the tribunal. He had been found living in disguise in Belgrade, under a false name and working as a New Age healer. He had even become well-known on the alternative health circuit, reportedly publishing a column in Healthy Living magazine. A bushy grey beard and thick glasses had transformed his appearance. Since the court adjourned to deliberate, Serbian prosecutors have arrested and charged eight people with playing direct roles in the Srebrenica massacre. Mr Karadzic was born in 1945 in a stable in Savnik, Montenegro. His father, Vuk, had been a member of the Chetniks - Serb nationalist guerrillas who fought against both Nazi occupiers and Tito's communist partisans in World War II - and was in jail for much of his son's childhood. Karadzic Timeline His mother, Jovanka Karadzic, described her son as loyal, and a hard worker who used to help her in the home and in the fields. She said he was a serious boy who was respectful towards the elderly and helped his school friends with their homework. In 1960 Mr Karadzic moved to Sarajevo, where he later met his wife, Ljiljana, graduated as a doctor, and became a psychiatrist in a city hospital. He also became a poet and fell under the influence of Serb nationalist writer Dobrica Cosic, who encouraged him to go into politics. After working briefly for the Green Party, he helped set up the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) - formed in 1990 in response to the rise of nationalist and Croat parties in Bosnia, and dedicated to the goal of a Greater Serbia. Less than two years later, as Bosnia-Hercegovina gained recognition as an independent state, he declared the creation of the independent Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina (renamed Republika Srpska) with its capital in Pale, a suburb of Sarajevo, and himself as head of state. Mr Karadzic's party, supported by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, organised Serbs to fight against the Bosniaks and Croats in Bosnia. A vicious war ensued, in which Serbs besieged Sarajevo for 44 months, shelling Bosniak forces but also terrorising the civilian population with a relentless bombardment and sniper fire. Thousands of civilians died, many of them deliberately targeted. Bosnian Serb forces - assisted by paramilitaries from Serbia proper - also expelled hundreds of thousands of Bosniaks and Croats from their homes in a brutal campaign of \\"ethnic cleansing\\". Numerous atrocities were documented, including the widespread rape of Bosniak women and girls. Reporters also discovered Bosnian Serb punishment camps, where prisoners-of-war were starved and tortured. War crimes were also committed against Serb civilians by the Bosnian Serbs' foes in the bitter inter-ethnic war. Mr Karadzic was jointly indicted in 1995 along with the Bosnian Serb military leader, Ratko Mladic, for war crimes they had allegedly committed during the 1992-95 war. He was obliged to step down as president of the SDS in 1996 as the West threatened sanctions against Republika Srpska. After the Dayton accord that ended the Bosnian war, he eventually went into hiding - possibly in the mountainous south-eastern area of the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia, protected by paramilitaries. Mr Karadzic says Dayton's chief architect, US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, promised him immunity from prosecution in exchange for quitting the political scene. Mr Holbrooke denies any such deal was struck. When he finally appeared before the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in August 2008, he failed to respond to the charges against him and the court entered pleas of \\"not guilty\\" on his behalf. Prosecutors accused him of using delaying tactics as he boycotted the initial hearings and insisted on representing himself. Launching his own defence in 2012, he sought to cast himself as a \\"mild man\\" who should be \\"rewarded\\" for having tried to avoid war. His performance was described by one publication as \\"by turns eloquent, historically provocative, and self-aggrandising\\".","output":"A man who used to be the leader of the Bosnian Serbs was found guilty for horrible things he did during a war, including hurting and killing lots of people, and a court decided he had to spend 40 years in prison."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

The letter, signed by both King and Keyser, stated the company's position as follows: the company would not negotiate on the matter of the 10 percent wage reduction, but it would \\"be pleased to address itself to the investigation of any of the minor grievances of which the men complained\\". The Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported a general hope that, owing to the imminent increase in traffic due to the transport of harvested crops, the firemen would be able to make daily round trips, thus avoiding layovers, and that the company could arrange for them to return home on passenger trains when this was not feasible.Keyser's reprinted response advised that the ten percent cut was \\"forced upon the company\\", but that he was confident they would be able to provide more full employment, and thus increase wages, due to an abundance of freight to be moved. He said that a system of passes would be arranged to address the issue of idle time caused by delays. He entreated the men that if the situation could not be resolved, it must \\"bring want and suffering upon all; suffering from which you and your families cannot hope to be exempt.\\" He asserted that, although 90 percent of rail workers had accepted the reduction, the whole business of the railroad and city had been halted due to the 10 percent rejecting them, and resolving to not allow the rest of the men to continue work. He said the rescinding of the wage cuts were \\"entirely out of the question\\" and requested the men either return to work, or allow those who would to resume working. As The Sun reported: \\"A vote was taken, and the proposition of the company was rejected unanimously.\\", what would be the answer ?

Solve this math problem Solve -7*m - 400 + 121 = 24*m for m.","output":"To solve the equation -7*m - 400 + 121 = 24*m for m, we will need to follow several steps to isolate m. Let's go step by step: The original problem: -7*m - 400 + 121 = 24*m Step 1: Simplify both sides. Add 400 to both sides and subtract 121 from both sides to eliminate -400 and +121 (i.e., move them to the other side of the equation using the inverse operations).  To simplify the left side, combine -400 and +121, to get -279. Therefore, the simplified problem to solve now becomes -7*m - 279 = 24*m. Step 2: Remove m terms from one side of the equation by performing the same operation to both sides. To do this, we'll add 7*m to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -7*m from the left side. This cancels out the m term on one side and changes the equation to -279 = 24*m + 7*m. Combine like terms for m on the right side of the equation to get 31*m. So, the equation now looks like this: -279 = 31*m Step 3: Solve for m by dividing both sides by 31, because to eliminate the 31 coefficient attached to the m variable, we perform the opposite operation (division). -279 ÷ 31 = m Therefore, m = -9 So, the solution to -7*m - 400 + 121 = 24*m is m = -9."},{"instruction":"Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who was replaced by Jon Coghill?

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman.

Summarize this article: Apple has never hidden the fact that it has a stricter censorship policy for iOS apps than for other forms of entertainment. The debate about whether this is unfair is heating up once more this week, however, after it removed an iPhone game called Phone Story from its App Store.      The game was released by Italian developer Molleindustria, whose mission statement is to \\"reappropriate video games as a popular form of mass communication\\" and \\"investigate the persuasive potentials of the medium by subverting mainstream video gaming cliche\\".      In Phone Story's case, that took the form of four mini-games about the \\"troubling supply chain\\" behind smartphones – all smartphones, not specifically iPhones – including coltan extraction in Congo, outsourced labour in China, environmental waste in Pakistan, as well as the mania for gadgets in the West. One of the mini-games sees workers leaping from their factory building: a clear reference to suicides and attempted suicides by workers at Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn.      Molleindustria said that all its net revenues from sales of the iPhone game would go to charities tackling corporate abuses.      A game where you have to catch plummeting factory employees, oversee underage miners and distribute smartphones outside a store with a white pear logo on the front? Apple's disapproval comes as no surprise, but in an interview with Gamasutra, Molleindustria's Paolo Pedercini says that in itself is a comment on the iOS ecosystem.      \\"Here's the problem: the unanimous reaction from developers community has been, 'Wow, it's incredible Phone Story made through Apple's review process'. To me, this signals a full acceptance of a regime of censorship, the equivalent, for developers, of what journalists call the 'chilling effect'. I'm sure that Apple doesn't spend that much time in policing its marketplace, because the developers are already censoring themselves.\\"      Pedercini goes on to talk about Apple's wider attitude to cultural products. \\"Of course, Apple has the right; it is the acceptance of Apple view about the cultural status of the 'App'. For them, games and applications are not part of culture like books or music. Try to imagine what kind of reaction iTunes would provoke if they banned all the songs with 'excessive objectionable' content.\\"      On one level, Apple can't be faulted for its transparency on this score. In September 2010, it published some App Store guidelines, available to all developers (and reprinted in full at the time on several websites). \\"We view Apps different than books or songs, which we do not curate,\\" explained the document.      \\"If you want to criticize a religion, write a book. If you want to describe sex, write a book or a song, or create a medical app. It can get complicated, but we have decided to not allow certain kinds of content in the App Store… We will reject Apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, 'I'll know it when I see it'. And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.\\"      According to Pedercini, Apple's email informing him of Phone Story's removal claimed the game had crossed four specific lines, in the form of specific guidelines for unacceptable apps. Two relating to charities and contributions appear to be wide of the mark, with the guidelines focusing on in-app donations, while Molleindustria was merely saying it would donate its download revenues to charities once it was paid.      The other two flouted guidelines relate to depictions of \\"violence or abuse of children\\", and \\"excessively objectionable or crude content\\". The former appears to be crucial to the satirical intent of the game, while the latter is something of a grey area – who is most likely to object to the content here: users or Apple?      Judging by his Gamasutra interview, Pedercini is fairly pessimistic about his chances of getting a resubmitted version of the game approved. In the past, these situations have been resolved – for example Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Mark Fiore had his NewsToons app rejected, sparking a media row over censorship, before resubmitting it unchanged and being approved. However, the subject material there was politicians and public figures, not Apple's own business.      The rejection of Phone Story raises wider questions for app publishers beyond the Games category in 2011. What kind of treatment could a newspaper or magazine expect if it ran a lead feature exploring exactly the topics highlighted in Molleindustria's game, for example?      It should be noted that thus far, Apple has shown no appetite for censoring editorial-based apps in this way. But the debate around how an app store owner responds when an app criticises and/or satirises its own business practices and those of its partners is not just restricted to Apple: it's one for all the platform owners, device makers and mobile operators launching their own curated stores.      Apple declined to comment on the story when contacted by The Guardian. ||||| The rise of the iPhone has revolutionized communication in the modern world, and the game development industry has been one of the largest beneficiaries of this paradigm shift. Thanks to Apple's touch screen and App Store, mobile game development was dredged from its cultural ghetto to a legitimate avenue for big studios and indies alike.It arrived in the nick of time, too, after the rapid contraction of packaged goods and the recession of a few years ago forced so many developers to seek more agile, less expensive and lower-risk spaces within the industry. Since then, powerhouse studios have been built and careers have been rescued on the back of Apple's must-have device.But until now, few have been willing to turn the lens on this boom and examine what mass-market gadget lust is costing us ethically. Though we've since heard of suicides at Foxconn , deplorable working conditions and hazards to the environment involved in the manufacture of the latest hot smartphones, game developers were mostly silent -- until now.It seems natural that provocative serious games developer Molleindustria was the one to take the step. The studio, which has taken on forces like the Catholic church, McDonald's and big oil with games likeand, never pulls its punches as it uses games to sharply deconstruct the social and economic constructs most people take for granted.Its latest title,, uses a series of minigames with voice-over narration to shed light on the human cost and high environmental impact of smartphone development. In one minigame, while the narrator explains that most electronic devices require the mining of coltan, a conflict mineral in Congo whose demand spurs war and child labor, the player must use the touch screen to guide armed soldiers to bark at exhausted child miners in order to meet the goal in time.In another, the voice-over explains the suicides at electronics manufacturers in China, and the facile solution of \\"prevention nets\\" -- while the player must catch tumbling workers using a stretched trampoline.Of course,is more interesting for the fact that players must interact with these messages while holding one of the devices discussed. Imagine being served hamburgers on a tour of a slaughterhouse. And all of the developer proceeds -- 70 percent of total App Store revenues, as per usual -- will be pledged to organizations fighting corporate abuses, starting with Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior , which supports workers in abusive conditions internationally, including at Foxconn.Or they would be, ifhad been allowed to stay on the App Store. Apple yanked it just a few hours after the game was officially announced, citing four code violations: 15.2, which prohibits depictions of child abuse, and 16.1, which prohibits apps depicting \\"objectionable or crude\\" content. The other two, 21.1 and 21.2, pertain to's charitable bent -- and they don't seem to quite apply, intended instead for games that allow their users to make donations within a game, rather than a pledge by the developer to donate revenues.Molleindustria makes an iPhone game to criticize the iPhone platform, and that Apple's chosen to silence it is an interesting punctuation mark on the developer's statement.Gamasutra reached out to Molleindustria's Paolo Pedercini about, who credits the game's idea to recent international affairs graduate Michael Pineschi, to whom he spoke through creative activism group YesLab . At the time, Pedercini already had some unusual ideas in the works for projects that could act as commentary on gadget fetishism.\\"One of them was a multi-touchable virtual-pet vagina, monologuing about technological lust and willful submission to consumerism,\\" he reflects. \\"Unfortunately, the flesh engine didn't work as I hoped so I went for a straightforward educational game.\\"But the intent was always to develop a game as commentary on the hardware industry. \\"Most of the adults in the Western world are somewhat aware that most of our objects are manufactured far away, in conditions that we would consider barbaric,\\" Pedercini says.\\"A lot of tech-aware people heard about the story of the Foxconn suicides or about the issue of electronic waste,\\" he continues. \\"But with, we wanted to connect all these aspects and present them in the larger frame of technological consumerism.\\"He specifically wanted to highlight the goal that \\"must-have\\" consumer electronics culture plays in perpetuating these high-impact cycles; one of the levels oftasks the players with tossing brand-new boxed phones to swarming would-be buyers rushing a storefront. In his view, the marketing machine that makes people believe they absolutely need an upgraded hardware device on the day it comes out is what causes extremism in the supply chain.\\"We don't want people to stop buying smartphones,\\" he notes, \\"but maybe we can make a little contribution in terms of shifting the perception of technological lust from cool to not-that-cool. This happened before with fur coats, diamonds, cigarettes and SUVs -- I can't see why it can't happen with iPads.\\"Pedercini says it was essential to use the platform itself to stage a critique of that platform. \\"Almost like the device itself was speaking to the user,\\" he suggests. \\"The idea was to make a sort of reminder that you can keep with you, like a way-less-permanent tattoo or a bumper sticker, something that you carry around and maybe show off as a conversation-starter.\\"But although Apple's immediate removal ofmakes for an interesting conversation point, Pedercini says he never intended it to happen this way: \\"I'm very familiar with the App Store policy, and the game is designed to be compliant with it,\\" he asserts.\\"If you check the guidelines,doesn't really violate any rule except for the generic 'excessively objectionable and crude content' and maybe the 'depiction of abuse of children'. Yes, there's dark humor and violence but it's cartoonish and stylized - way more mellow than a lot of other games on the App Store.\\"\\"What makes these depictions disturbing is the connection the player makes with the real-world situation,\\" adds Pedercini. \\"Of course, the goal was to sneak an embarrassingly ugly gnome into Apple's walled garden, but not to provoke the rejection.

The given hypothesis, \\"The New York Times is reporting that Santeria is coming out of the closest with Vegans leading the charge,\\" cannot be considered true based on the provided premise. The premise states that \\"The New York Times reports that Santeria, the West Indian religion notorious for animal sacrifice, is gaining American adherents and coming out of the closet.\\" However, it does not mention that Vegans are leading the charge for this resurgence of interest in Santeria. It is essential to note the main differences between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise mentions Santeria as a religion known for animal sacrifice, while the hypothesis brings up Vegans, who follow a lifestyle that avoids the use of animal products and opposes animal cruelty. This is contrary to the animal sacrifice practices in Santeria, making it unlikely for Vegans to lead the charge for this religion's growing popularity. The hypothesis seems to be contrasting the premise rather than supporting it, so the statement is false. Additionally, since the premise states that Santeria is becoming more popular and gaining attention among Americans, one could argue that the statement \\"Santeria is coming out of the closet\\" holds some truth. However, this does not justify the inclusion of Vegans in the hypothesis, as they are not mentioned in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

General George Washington (1732–99) proved an excellent organizer and administrator, who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population. The Loyalists, on whom the British had relied too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but never were well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington astonished the world when, instead of seizing power, he retired quietly to his farm in Virginia. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the biggest problem General Washington faced?","output":"The biggest problem General Washington faced was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Title: Almost There but Not Quite Review: I recently downloaded the app \\"KeepScore\\" by the developer Nolan Lawson. After having used it for a couple of weeks, I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed. I hate to leave a 2-star rating, but I believe there's a lot this app can improve on. On a positive note, the concept of the app is great and has the potential to be a must-have app for scorekeeping. It's user-friendly and the main function – keeping score – worked without any hiccups. The simple and clean design also appealed to my minimalist taste. However, the customization options were quite disappointing. The app could greatly benefit from additional features such as custom backgrounds, different fonts, and the ability to add player pictures, especially for those who play in teams or groups regularly. While the app worked fine initially, I encountered a few crashes when trying to access my saved scores. These crashes are pretty frustrating, and I hope that the developer can address this issue in their upcoming updates. Lastly, the ad placements within the app feel a bit intrusive. I understand the importance of generating revenue for the developer, but I would feel more comfortable paying for an ad-free version since I tend to use the app quite often. In conclusion, KeepScore has the potential to be a valuable app for scorekeeping. However, due to a few drawbacks such as limited customization options, app crashes, and invasive ad placements, I could not rate it higher than 2 stars. If updates are made to improve these issues, I'm more than happy to give a higher rating and consider recommending it to others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was bitten by a monkey? , can you please find it?   By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste. The answer to this question is:","output":"Ensign Seymour.

The poverty line per capita changed by region from €552.39/month to €819.13/month.The numbers of those in absolute poverty rose nearly an entire percent in 2015, from 6.8% in 2014, to 7.6% in 2015. In the south of Italy the numbers are even higher with 10% living in absolute poverty, up from 9 percent in 2014. The north is better off at 6.7%, but still an increase from 5.7% in 2014. The national statics reporting agency, ISTAT, defines absolute poverty as those who can’t buy goods and services which they need to survive. In 2015, the proportion of poor households in relative poverty also increased in 2015 to 13.7 from 12.9 in 2014. ISTAT defines relative poverty as people whose disposable income is less than around half the national average. The unemployment rate in February 2016 remained at 11.7%, which has been the same for almost a year, but even having a job doesn’t guarantee freedom from poverty. Those who have at least one family employed still suffer from 6.1% to 11.7% poverty, the higher number being for those who have factory jobs. The numbers are even higher for the younger generations because their unemployment rate is over 40%. Also, children are hit hard. In 2014, 32% of those aged 0–17 are at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is one child out of three. In the last ISTAT report poverty is in decline.

How many € lower per person was the poverty line for a 2 people family than per person after the increase?","output":"So, first, we need to find out how much money each person in a 2 people family had when they were living on the poverty line. The article says that the poverty line for a 2 people family was €1,050.95 per month. To find out how much money each person got, we divide €1,050.95 by 2 (because there are 2 people in the family).  €1,050.95 ÷ 2 = €525.475 per person in the family. Now, the range of the poverty line per person after the increase was from €552.39 to €819.13 a month. We need to know how much lower the new poverty line for 2 people family (€525.475) is than the lower end of the new range (€552.39). So we will subtract €525.475 from €552.39. €552.39 - €525.475 = €26.915.

Lissabonin sopimus, joka astui voimaan vuonna 2009, oli merkittävä askel Euroopan unionin kehittymisessä, koska se pyrki parantamaan EU:n toimintakykyä, tehokkuutta ja demokratiaa ottamalla käyttöön useita uusia säädöksiä ja toimielinuudistuksia. Vahva tuki Lissabonin sopimukselle Irlannissa kuvasti kansan halua olla aktiivinen ja merkityksellinen osa EU:ta, joka on tuonut mukanaan useita etuja sekä taloudellisesti että yhteiskunnallisesti. Irlanti on hyötynyt EU-jäsenyydestään saamalla merkittävää rahoitusta esimerkiksi infrastruktuuriin, korkeakoulutukseen ja maatalouspolitiikkaan.

EU:lla on myös ollut positiivinen vaikutus Irlannin kansainväliseen asemaan, mikä on auttanut rakentamaan vahvempia kauppasuhteita ja tukinut Irlannin talouden kasvua. Lisäksi EU-jäsenyys on auttanut Irlantia selviämään 2000-luvun talouskriiseistä, tarjoten taloudellista ja teknistä apua, kun sitä on tarvittu. Samalla kun Irlanti on tukenut EU:ta ja sen päätöksentekoa, se on myös ilmaissut ja suojannut omia kansallisia etujaan. Esimerkiksi Irlannin hallitus on varmistanut, että maan maatalouspolitiikka ja alv-järjestelmä säilyttävät tärkeimmät elementit, jotka tukevat Irlantia ennen kaikkea EU:n tasolla.

Except for one brief phone call, she had heard nothing from her husband, Kavous Seyed Emami, a professor and prominent environmentalist, since he was arrested and accused of spying more than two weeks before. Now, she was being told to come to the offices of the Tehran prosecutor, where she could see her husband at last.      She rushed off, but upon arrival quickly sensed that something was wrong. Instead of being taken to see her husband she was closeted in a room with a prosecutor and four intelligence agents from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and interrogated for several hours. Cooperate, they told her, or you, too, will end up in prison.      In recounting the experience for their two sons, Ramin and Mehran, Ms. Seyed Emami said that the agents had asked about the couple’s friends and parties they had attended. They showed her family pictures and asked her to describe who and what were in them. They inquired about her husband’s environmental work, she told her sons. Did you know, they asked at one point, that he was a spy?      When the agents finally ran out of questions, she was informed she could see her husband. There was just one thing, they said. He was dead, having committed suicide in his cell. ||||| In response to reports that the Iranian authorities have said they will refuse to release the body of the Canadian-Iranian academic Kavous Seyed-Emami to his family unless there is an immediate burial and no attempt to conduct an independent autopsy, Magdalena Mughrabi, Amnesty international’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and Africa said:      “The authorities’ refusal to allow an independent investigation into the extremely suspicious death of Dr Seyed-Emami smacks of a deliberately orchestrated attempt to cover up any evidence of torture and possible murder. He was detained in Evin prison where detainees are held under constant surveillance and stripped of all personal possessions. It would have been near impossible for him to commit suicide.      “We are deeply concerned that Dr Seyed-Emami’s body bears incriminating signs of torture and other clues to the reasons for his death. We call on the Canadian government and the international community to continue to place pressure on the Iranian authorities to allow an independent investigation into the circumstances of Dr Seyed-Emami’s death in accordance with international standards. Those responsible, including any individual with command responsibility, must be brought to justice.”      Kavous Seyed-Emami’s death is the third to be hastily declared a suicide in detention by Iranian authorities since the December 2017 protests. A fourth death, also confirmed in detention, remains unexplained by the authorities.      “The mounting deaths in custody and the authorities’ refusal to allow independent and transparent investigations are deeply troubling illustrations of the utter contempt for human life and accountability that exists in the Iranian criminal justice system today.” said Magdalena Mughrabi.      In a statement on 11 February, Tehran’s Chief Prosecutor stated that Kavous Seyed-Emami was driven to suicide by “confessions” that he had made and the incriminating statements others had made against him. Remarks about his “confessions” heighten concerns that he was subjected to torture.      He had been arrested on 24 January 2018 and was under interrogations for national-security related charges stemming from his peaceful environmental activism, making him a prisoner of conscience. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The suspicious death of Kavous Seyed Emami, a Canadian-Iranian professor and environmental activist, in an Iranian prison has raised concerns over human rights abuses and cover-ups within the Iranian criminal justice system.

He couldn't answer as I knew, but he tried to smile, all the time keeping his foot close to mine. My thoughts raced back more than thirty years--to the dark days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The scene was an air-raid shelter  , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal  . He had never been normal, ever since he was born. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had less of a mind than a baby has. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, able woman, as she had to be of course, because Frank depended on her completely. He needed all the attention of a baby. One night a policeman came into our shelter and told Mrs. West that her house had been all destroyed. That wasn't quite true, because the West went on living there for quite some time. But they certainly lost nearly everything they owned. When that kind of thing happened, the rest of us helped the unlucky ones. So before we separated   that morning, I stood beside Frank and measured my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a spare pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. As soon as he saw me, he came running--and placed his right foot against mine.

I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me.

I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

Connect the output jack on the pedal to the input of the amplifier. Turn the amplifier on first and set your levels. Turn down the effect knobs before switching it on. Experiment with the pedal. Always unplug cables when you're finished playing.","output":"Title: A Step-By-Step Guide to Connecting Your Guitar Pedal to Your Amplifier Introduction Guitar pedals, also known as effects pedals or stompboxes, are an essential part of every guitarist's arsenal, enabling them to manipulate the sound of their instrument in a variety of ways. From adding subtle touches of reverb or chorus to creating entirely new, out-of-this-world walls of sound, guitar pedals provide a versatile and straightforward way to take your playing to another level. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of connecting your guitar pedal to your amplifier and ensuring everything is set up correctly for the best sound possible. Step 1: Turn Everything Off The first step to connecting your guitar pedal is to ensure that both the amplifier and the pedal are turned off to prevent any damage to your equipment or sudden, loud noises which might disturb your neighbors. Unplugging any cables that might be connected to your amplifier or pedal is also a good idea, as it will allow you to start creating a fresh setup without any misunderstandings. Step 2: Hook Your Amplifier and Pedal Up to Power To power your amplifier and pedal, ensure that they are properly plugged into a power source. Using a reliable and surge-protected power strip will protect your gear from voltage spikes and other electrical issues. Step 3: Connect Your Guitar to the Input Jack Now it's time to connect your guitar to your pedal. Using a good-quality instrument cable, plug one end into the output jack of your guitar and the other end into the input jack of your pedal. Step 4: Connect the Output Jack of the Pedal to the Input Jack of the Amplifier Next, using another good-quality instrument cable, connect the output jack of your pedal to the input jack of your amplifier. This creates a complete signal chain, allowing the sound from your guitar to pass through the pedal and then into the amplifier. Step 5: Turn the Amplifier On and Set Your Levels With everything connected, turn on your amplifier first. Setting the amplifier levels before turning on the pedal ensures that you have a clean, unaffected sound to start with. This helps to avoid creating any unexpected sounds once the pedal is engaged. Step 6: Turn Down the Effect Knobs Before Switching Your Pedal On Before engaging your pedal, turn down all its effect knobs to their minimum settings. This is important because it will help you gradually introduce the effect into your playing, making it easier to fine-tune and control the sound. Step 7: Experiment with the Pedal Now it's time to have some fun! Slowly turn up the effect knobs on your pedal and experiment with the different sounds it can create. Play around with various combinations of settings to discover your preferred tone. Don't be afraid to try unorthodox configurations; some of the most unique and memorable sounds are born from experimentation. Step 8: Unplug Cables When Finished Playing When you're finished playing, always remember to unplug cables from your guitar, pedal, and amplifier. This practice helps to prolong the life of your cables and prevents any accidental damage to your equipment. Additionally, it's just good housekeeping and shows respect for your gear. Conclusion Connecting and setting up a guitar pedal with your amplifier may seem daunting at first, but by following these step-by-step instructions, you will be well on your way to exploring the vast world of sonic possibilities that effects pedals can offer. So get out there, plug in your pedal, and start creating your unique sound!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the most prestigious awards in the world, recognizing individuals and organizations that have contributed to the promotion of peace and the resolution of conflicts. The Dalai Lama, whose official title is Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism and a prominent advocate for peace and human rights. He was born Lhamo Dhondup on July 6, 1935, in a small village in northeastern Tibet, and was recognized as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, at the age of 2. Throughout his life, the Dalai Lama has consistently emphasized the importance of nonviolent solutions to conflicts, advocating for dialogue and understanding between different cultures and religions. After the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1950, the Dalai Lama sought to preserve Tibetan culture and religious freedom through peaceful means, even after being forced into exile in India in 1959. In addition to working for the rights and well-being of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama has dedicated his life to promoting world peace and compassion on a global scale. He has addressed audiences around the world on the topics of human rights, nonviolence, religious harmony, and environmental sustainability. The Dalai Lama's tireless efforts to foster peace have earned him numerous awards, honorary doctorates, and other honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. The paragraph also mentions that Canada encourages religious freedom in China and would welcome dialogue between Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama, which is consistent with Canada's commitment to promoting human rights, religious freedom, and peaceful conflict resolution.

The Teutonic Knights, also known as the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem, was a Catholic military order founded during the late 12th century in the context of the Crusades. Initially, the order was active in the Holy Land; however, they gradually refocused their efforts on the Baltic region. In the early 13th century, the Teutonic Knights were invited to support a military campaign to convert and subdue the pagan peoples in the Baltic area. This invitation came from Duke Konrad I of Masovia, who requested assistance against the pagan Prussians. As a result of their efforts, the Teutonic Knights began a process of territorial expansion, establishing their rule in parts of present-day Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. During this period, the Teutonic Order established numerous strongholds and castles, which were used as regional administrative centers and military bases. By 1309, the order had grown substantially and needed a new central seat of power. It was at this time that they chose Marienburg as their headquarters. Marienburg was chosen primarily due to its strategic location and impressive fortifications. The castle itself, now known as Malbork Castle, was built by the Teutonic Knights along the banks of the Nogat River. The castle was strategically situated on trade routes and offered easy access to the Baltic Sea, which was essential for the order's military and economic activities. The castle complex was continuously expanded and fortified throughout its history. The choice of Marienburg as the Teutonic Order's headquarters in 1309 marked a significant shift in the order's focus from the Holy Land to the Baltic region. The Teutonic Knights remained a powerful military, political, and religious institution in the Baltic lands until their decline in the 15th century, eventually being secularized and incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and other regional states. Today, Malbork Castle remains as a significant historic site and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, preserving the legacy and history of the medieval Teutonic Order."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Paul Dupuy , History Lecturer at the Ecole Normale , published in 1896 the first scientific biography of the mathematician Évariste Galois , titled \`\` La vie d'Évariste Galois '' .  - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811  31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - In mathematics, especially in order theory, a Galois connection is a particular correspondence (typically) between two partially ordered sets (posets). The same notion can also be defined on preordered sets or classes; this article presents the common case of posets. Galois connections generalize the correspondence between subgroups and subfields investigated in Galois theory (named after the French mathematician Évariste Galois). They find applications in various mathematical theories.

Estranged from both love interest Mary Jane Watson and best friend Harry Osborn, Peter additionally discovers his Aunt May is facing eviction. Harry, now head of Oscorp's research division, is sponsoring brilliant nuclear scientist Otto Octavius' fusion power project, who befriend Peter and offers him life advice. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration, in which Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical, killing his wife and shattering the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Spider-Man arrives and shuts down the experiment, destroying it. At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius's harness. However, as a result of the accident the arms have developed sentience and attack the crew. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbour. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, Octavius robs a bank that Peter and May are coincidentally visiting in order to fund a second experiment. Octavius takes May hostage but is rescued by Peter as Spider-Man, although is able to flee with the money. The Daily Bugle subsequently dubs Octavius Doctor Octopus.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? gentle and humane side","output":"The phrase \\"gentle and humane side\\" can be considered as positive in most contexts. Let's deconstruct the phrase and evaluate its constituent words to understand why this phrase is seen as positive. 1. Gentle: The word \\"gentle\\" is an adjective that describes someone who is kind, tender, and careful in their actions or behavior. This term can be seen as positive as it reflects a sense of compassion and understanding, which is often admired and appreciated by others. People who exhibit gentle behavior, such as listening attentively, offering comfort, or being patient, are typically seen as considerate and empathetic individuals. 2. Humane: The term \\"humane\\" refers to the quality of being compassionate, kind, and considerate, especially towards other living beings, be it humans or animals. It often involves actions that minimize suffering or harm and promote well-being. As a society, we generally view humane actions, such as treating others with respect, offering help when needed, or advocating for the welfare and rights of animals, as positive qualities. This characteristic is appreciated because it demonstrates that one has a strong moral compass and a genuine concern for the well-being of others. Now, let's consider the phrase \\"gentle and humane side\\" as a whole. This phrase emphasizes the importance of exhibiting kindness, compassion, and a moral responsibility towards others. It highlights the part of one's personality that acts in the best interest of others, understanding their feelings, and trying to alleviate their pain or distress. Often, people who showcase this side of their personality are seen as approachable, trustworthy, and morally upright individuals. In conclusion, the phrase \\"gentle and humane side\\" is generally considered positive, as it captures the essence of empathy, compassion, and a strong sense of morality. These are traits that are highly valued in interpersonal relationships, friendships, and society at large.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Acornsoft was the software arm of Acorn Computers, and a major publisher of software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron. As well as games, it also produced a large number of educational titles, extra computer languages and business and utility packages  these included word processor \\"VIEW\\" and the spreadsheet \\"ViewSheet\\" supplied on ROM and cartridge for the BBC Micro/Acorn Electron and included as standard in the BBC Master and Acorn Business Computer.  - Professor Peter D. Killworth (27 March 1946  28 January 2008) was an English scientist known for both his work on oceanography and the study of social networks. A prolific writer, he published more than 160 scientific papers over the course of his career. He was also known for his work as a pioneering author of text interactive fiction games during the early 1980s.  - BBC BASIC is a programming language, developed in 1981 as a native programming language for the MOS Technology 6502 based Acorn BBC Micro home/personal computer, mainly by Sophie Wilson. It is a version of the BASIC programming language adapted for a UK computer literacy project of the BBC.  - The Acorn Electron is a budget version of the BBC Micro educational/home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd. It has 32 kilobytes of RAM, and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system.  - Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be \\"text-only\\", however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as \\"Puzzle-free\\", that focuses on narrative, and \\"text adventures\\" that focus on puzzles.  - Countdown to Doom is a text adventure computer game, more recently termed interactive fiction, written in 1982 by Peter Killworth. Its setting is the planet Doomawangara, which is coyly said to be shortened to \\"Doom\\". There are two sequels, \\"Return to Doom\\" and \\"Last Days of Doom\\".  - Acorn Computers Ltd. was a British computer company established in Cambridge, England, in 1978. The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK, including the Acorn Electron and the Acorn Archimedes. Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s. It is more known for its computer than for its other products.  - The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987.  - The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix \\"kilo\\" as 1000 (10); therefore one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB. In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, \\"kilobyte\\" is traditionally used to denote 1024 (2) bytes. This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to such memory in digital circuitry. In this context, the symbols K and KB are often used when 1024 bytes is meant.   - Oceanography (compound of the Greek words  meaning \\"ocean\\" and  meaning \\"write\\"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean. It is an Earth science covering a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past.  - Castle of Riddles is a text adventure released by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro ( in 1982 ) and Acorn Electron ( 1984 ) home computers . The game was written by Peter Killworth and was one of a series of text adventures written for , or ported to the BBC Micro by the same author ( others including Countdown to Doom and Philosopher 's Quest ) . As with all such games , only text is used . The player must use a simple ' verb - noun ' format ( e.g. ' Go North ' , ' Get lamp ' ) to control the game . Unlike Killworth 's other Acornsoft adventures , Castle of Riddles was not updated and reissued by Topologika so became unavailable after 1985 when Acorn Computers ( parent company of Acornsoft ) pulled out of the games publishing market . Some of the puzzles however were included in the Topologika version of Philosopher 's Quest .  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers.

Options: A: It was a book which told you how you should get on well with others. B: There were many good examples for you to copy in it. C: It was a book that told you how to get a good job and a good future. D: It was a good book that could help you when you were in trouble.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the background: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is  and the situation: Robert is generating waves using an oscilloscope in his high school physics class. As part of the experiment, Robert first has to create waves with a long wavelength, waves that we will call long waves. Afterwards, Robert has to create waves with a short wavelength, waves that we will call short waves.  Answer the following question: Which waves will have a higher frequency? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the relationship between wavelength and frequency of a wave is inversely related. This means that as the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases, and vice versa. In the given situation, Robert is generating two types of waves: long waves and short waves. The long waves have a longer wavelength compared to the short waves. Since wavelength and frequency are inversely related, the waves with a shorter wavelength will have a higher frequency.  Therefore, the short waves that Robert creates will have a higher frequency than the long waves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He roams the nearby derelict urban area and the local canal and starts to relive or visualize a period of his childhood in 1950s London with his mother and his father.

On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the United States Senate Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a music organization co-founded by Tipper Gore, wife of then-senator Al Gore. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content. During Zappa's testimony, he stated that there was a clear conflict of interest between the PMRC due to the relations of its founders to the politicians who were then trying to pass what he referred to as the \\"Blank Tape Tax.\\" Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator Strom Thurmond, who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further pointed out that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship, and called their proposal for voluntary labelling of records with explicit content \\"extortion\\" of the music industry.In his prepared statement, he said: The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design.

Eric Boucher was born in Boulder, Colorado, the son of Virginia (nee Parker), a librarian, and Stanley Wayne Boucher, a psychiatric social worker and poet. He had a sister, Julie J. Boucher, the Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library (who died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996). As a child, Eric developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. An avid news watcher, one of his earliest memories was of the John F. Kennedy assassination. In October 1998, three former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that after Biafra, in his capacity as the head of Alternative Tentacles records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some 75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a whistleblower employee at the record label notified the band.  According to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his claim that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties, and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or \\"posthumous\\" live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher. Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band.  In May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \\"guilty of malice, oppression and fraud\\" by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay 200,000, including 20,000 in punitive damages. After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works -- which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles. Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra's former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist.

Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

Hypothesis: Haplocyonoides was the most feared animal in europe for several years","output":"After analyzing the given paragraph, it is not possible to definitively determine if the hypothesis, \\"Haplocyonoides was the most feared animal in Europe for several years,\\" is true based solely on the information provided. However, we can provide some background information that will help understand the animal's ecological role and relationships during its existence. First, let's review the information provided in the paragraph: 1. Haplocyonoides is an extinct genus of terrestrial carnivores. 2. They belong to the suborder Caniformia, family Amphicyonidae, which are commonly known as \\"bear-dogs.\\" 3. Haplocyonoides inhabited Europe during the Early Miocene subepoch, approximately 20 to 16.9 million years ago. Based on this information, we can infer that Haplocyonoides was an apex predator in Europe during the Early Miocene period. However, we need more contextual information about the animal and its contemporaries in order to establish whether it was the most feared animal at the time. Factors that could account for an animal being perceived as the most feared are size, physical features, hunting capabilities, and examples of preserved interactions with other contemporary species. Considering the common nickname \\"bear-dog,\\" we can assume that the Haplocyonoides was likely a large and powerful carnivore. The family Amphicyonidae, to which Haplocyonoides belongs, was known for being large in size and having a mix of features present in both bears and dogs. Their physical attributes would have allowed them to be quite capable predators and potentially feared by other animals and humans (if present) during their time. However, the size and capabilities of other contemporary predators must also be taken into account to determine if Haplocyonoides was truly the most feared animal. Additionally, information on the behaviors and interactions of Haplocyonoides with other species within their ecosystem would help to validate or refute the hypothesis. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Haplocyonoides was the most feared animal in Europe for several years cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted based on the information provided in the paragraph.

Write a summary based on this article: Sanjit Das/Bloomberg via GETTY IMAGES      A variant of a fungus that rots and kills the main variety of export banana has been found in plantations in Mozambique and Jordan, raising fears that it could spread to major producers and decimate supplies. The pathogen, which was until now limited to parts of Asia and a region of Australia, has a particularly devastating effect on the popular Cavendish cultivar, which accounts for almost all of the multibillion-dollar banana export trade. Expansion of the disease worldwide could be disastrous, say researchers.      The disease is caused by strains of a soil fungus called Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.cubense (Foc). A strain of Foc previously wiped out the Gros Michel cultivar, which was the main exported banana variety from the nineteenth century until the 1950s. In response, the industry replaced Gros Michel plants with the Cavendish variety, which is resistant to that Foc strain. But Cavendish is susceptible to the new Foc Tropical Race 4 (Foc-TR4) strain, and could meet the same fate as Gros Michel if the fungus reaches Latin America, the world’s leading banana exporter, says Rony Swennen of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, and a banana breeder at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Dar es Salaam. “It’s a gigantic problem,” he adds. Although Foc strains spread slowly, they are almost impossible to eliminate from soil.      Foc-TR4 was first detected in Asia in the 1990s, and is now found in Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, China and northern Australia (see ‘Fruit threat’). The outbreak in Jordan, reported on 29 October (F. A. Garcia et al. Plant Dis. http://doi.org/qd3; 2013), was the first to be described outside those nations. The Mozambique outbreak was reported last month.      Nobody is sure how the fungus arrived in Jordan or Mozambique. Migrant workers from Asia might inadvertently have brought contaminated soil with them. Another possibility is the import of infected rhizomes — the stems from which banana plants propagate. But much of the Cavendish industry now uses tissue culture, which produces pathogen-free plantlets.      Source: FAO      To slow the spread, good farm hygiene, and prompt quarantine and destruction of infected plants are crucial. Altus Viljoen, a researcher at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, was called in to identify the cause of the Mozambique outbreak, and says that authorities were quick to take action. He estimates that the disease has been present for two to three years.      Gert Kema, a Fusarium researcher at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands and co-author of the Jordan report, believes that further spread is inevitable. “I’m incredibly concerned,” he says. “I will not be surprised if it pops up in Latin America in the near future.” That region, along with the Caribbean, accounts for more than 80% of banana exports. If Foc-TR4 takes root there, it could lead to the slow demise of industrial farming of the Cavendish variety.      Smaller farms in Asia are already trying to mitigate losses. Tissue culture of Cavendish plants has generated variants with random mutations that confer partial resistance to Foc-TR4. Planting of these variants, in combination with measures such as crop rotation, has allowed the cultivation of bananas on contaminated land. But production losses and higher costs make affected plantations less economically viable.      Progress in creating bananas fully resistant to Foc-TR4, either by classical breeding or genetic engineering, has so far been limited. The wild Asian banana Musa acuminata malaccensis— the genome of which was published last year (A. D’Hont Nature 488, 213–217; 2012) — seems to be resistant, and researchers are experimenting with putting its resistance genes into the Cavendish. The resulting transgenic specimens have been in field trials for 18 months on contaminated ground in Australia, and are looking “very promising”, says James Dale, director of the Centre for Tropical Crops and Biocommodities at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. But he cautions that the full results are not yet in.      For those who buy their bananas in supermarkets, the Cavendish may well be the only variety they know. But exports of the cultivar account for only about 13% of the 150 million or so tonnes of bananas and cooking bananas (plantains) produced annually. Industrial farms growing a single Cavendish cultivar are at a high risk of Foc-TR4 infestation, but the fungus poses less of a threat to the bulk of the bananas that provide a staple for some 400 million people worldwide.      Most of the bananas important for the food supply are grown by smallholder farmers in low-income countries and consumed locally. Hundreds of cultivars are farmed, and this biodiversity is an important rampart against disease. Researchers do not yet have a full picture of the susceptibility of these varieties, but many cultivars are likely to be resistant to Foc-TR4 because they are biologically different to the Cavendish.      For his part, Dale is trying to engineer Gros Michel bananas for resistance to the original Foc strain. The Cavendish is bland by comparison and it bruises more easily. Dale would like to see Gros Michel on supermarket shelves again. “It’s such a superior banana to Cavendish. To bring it back would be wonderful.” ||||| Get your fill of bananas now; they’re about to get destroyed by fungus      Banana farmers live in fear of a fungus called Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense, or Foc, for short. As in, “oh Foc, a fungus is about to destroy all our bananas.”      A strain of Foc destroyed the Gros Michel bananas that used to be the mainstay of banana plantations, which were reportedly much more delicious than the bananas we eat today. And now it’s coming for the Gros Michel’s replacement — the Cavendish bananas that, if you’re an American under the age of 50, are likely the only bananas you’ve ever eaten.      The Foc strain that could destroy Cavendish bananas has been living in Asia and Australia has now shown up in Mozambique and Jordan, Nature reports:      Nobody is sure how the fungus arrived in Jordan or Mozambique. Migrant workers from Asia might inadvertently have brought contaminated soil with them. Another possibility is the import of infected rhizomes—the stems from which banana plants propagate. But much of the Cavendish industry now uses tissue culture, which produces pathogen-free plantlets.      We’ll defer here to the wisdom of Dr. Ian Malcolm: Life will find a way. Banana plantation owners, however, may not. There are replacement bananas in the works, but apparently they taste kind of like apples.

Process: - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere.  Question: suppose increased automobile use happens, how will it affect less sunlight gets trapped in the plant.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If increased automobile use happens, it will likely lead to increased air pollution and emissions, such as carbon dioxide and particulate matter. The presence of more pollutants in the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the chlorophyll molecules in the plant. This reduction in sunlight could potentially decrease the amount of sunlight that gets trapped by the chlorophyll molecules. Now, let's analyze how this perturbation influences the second effect mentioned, which is the plant taking in water and carbon dioxide from the environment. With more carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere due to increased automobile use, it is possible that the concentration of carbon dioxide available for the plant to take in might increase. However, since the plant trapping less sunlight might reduce the efficiency of the overall photosynthesis process, the plant may not be able to fully benefit from this increased availability of carbon dioxide. The effect on the plant taking in water might not be directly impacted by the automobiles, but it could be indirectly influenced by local changes in climate and weather patterns resulting from the pollution. To summarize: the increased automobile use could have a \\"less\\" effect on sunlight trapped by chlorophyll molecules in the plant, and a \\"more\\" effect on the plant's carbon dioxide intake. However, since the photosynthesis process could be less efficient due to reduced sunlight, the overall capability of the plant to take advantage of the increased carbon dioxide might be limited. For the intake of water, there might be no direct effect, but there could be indirect effects due to pollution-induced changes in climate and weather patterns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Background: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids  Paragraph: Jerry and Gary each live in separate cities, but both run equally sized farms that grow the same produce.

Jerry and Gary regularly talk on the phone and compare notes with each other since their farms are so similar.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will there be more or less micronutrients on Gary's crops? Answer:","output":"Based on the information given, there will be more micronutrients in Gary's crops. The background information indicates that increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations lead to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. Since Gary's city does not have elevated CO2 levels, it suggests that his crops will not experience this reduction in micronutrients as compared to Jerry's crops which are grown in a city with elevated CO2 levels.

The answer to the question: What is the last of the person who was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience? is inside the article: Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression.

Your first question would probably be \\"Who did this?\\" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags  and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned   animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows.

After Luna Sea went on break in 1997, Sugizo started his own solo career and opened the independent label \\"Cross\\" to produce other artists, as well as releasing his own records. He points out that the opening of his record label was one of his very important projects at the time, but not anymore. On July 9, his debut single \\"Lucifer\\" was released and reached number 8 on the Oricon singles chart. It was followed by his first solo tour \\"Abstract Day\\" which lasted until the final performance in August at Akasaka Blitz, where he was joined by DJ Krush, Masami Tsuchiya and members of Japan. Then on September 10 he released his second single, \\"A Prayer\\", which reached number 7 on the charts. On November 19, his first solo album Truth? was released, and reached number 12 on the album charts. It was met with mixed reviews, largely because of the unexpected musical style which mixed different genres with electronica beats. A variety of artists participated in the album, from Ryuichi Sakamoto and Mick Karn, to Lou Rhodes and Valerie Etienne. Towards the end of the year, remix editions of his two maxi singles and album were released.  As Luna Sea resumed activities, until the bands disbandement, Sugizo collaborated in the studio with actress Miki Nakatani, and singers Miu Sakamoto and Vivian Hsu among others. On August 11, 1999 a compilation album titled \\"Grand Cross 1999\\", which was sponsored by Sugizo's record label \\"Cross\\", was released, featuring many musicians with whom he had worked with before and many for the first time.  In 2001, he participated in Ryuichi Sakamoto's N.M.L.

Q: In what stage of processing does knot primer need to be applied for maximum effectiveness?  A: A knot primer paint or solution, correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Knot primer needs to be applied during the surface preparation stage of wood processing for maximum effectiveness. Here's a more detailed breakdown: 1. Inspection: First, inspect the wood surface to identify any knots, cracks, or defects that may require special attention. 2. Surface Preparation: It's essential to properly prepare the wood surface to achieve maximum effectiveness with your knot primer. This stage includes:    a. Cleaning: Begin by cleaning the wooden surface, removing any dirt, dust, or residue that may hinder the absorption of the primer.        b. Sanding: After cleaning, sand the surface to create a smooth, even texture. Remember to sand the knots specifically, as they often have a different density than the rest of the wood.    c. Wiping: Wipe down the surface to remove any sanding dust or debris before proceeding. 3. Application of Knot Primer: Apply the knot primer to the wood surface during this stage, focusing on the knots themselves. Make sure the knots are fully soaked with the primer, as this will improve its sealing capability and prevent any resins from coming through the paint or finish later on.    a. Apply Generously: Knot primers are designed to be absorbed into the wood surface; therefore, apply a generous, even coat to ensure thorough coverage of the knots.        b. Drying: Allow the knot primer to dry according to the manufacturer's recommended time. This allows the primer to penetrate the wood and seal the knots effectively. 4. Additional Wood Treatment: After the knot primer has dried, additional treatments such as wood sealers or wood direct lacquers can be applied, depending on your desired outcome. 5. Coating Application: Once all treatments have been applied and the wood surface has been prepared, you can proceed with applying paint, varnish, or any other chosen finishing material. In summary, knot primer is most effective when applied during the surface preparation stage of wood processing. Proper surface preparation, including cleaning, sanding, and wiping down the wood, ensures that the knot primer is absorbed optimally and performs its intended role in sealing the knots, inhibiting the seepage of resins and any resulting discoloration in the final finish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The book, allegedly a first-edition of one of Armstrong's book, actually contains a message that says, \\"Contact in case (of emergency.)\\" He tells Sherman he is going to Stockholm, but she discovers he is flying to East Berlin, and she follows him there. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government, and Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected to the other side. Sherman, however, is extremely uncomfortable with this move, realizing if the apparent defection is in fact real, given the circumstances of the Cold War of the period, she would likely never see her home or family again. They are constantly accompanied by Professor Karl Manfred (Günter Strack), who took part in arranging Armstrong's defection to the East.Armstrong visits a contact, a 'farmer' (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment in order to learn just how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. While Armstrong does not inform the U.S. government of his plan, he has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as (Pi).However, Armstrong is followed to this farm by his official body man, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer assigned to him.

Shanghai (CNN) -- Hours after being mobbed by hundreds of cheering fans at the airport upon his arrival, former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba made his official debut with new team Shanghai Shenhua Saturday afternoon and insisted his move was motivated by challenges of helping Chinese football. \\"I didn't come here with the idea of making a lot of money,\\" said the 34-year-old Ivory Coast football superstar at a press conference, despite local news reports naming him the highest paid player in China who earns more than 300,000 a week. \\"I came here because of the completely different challenges from what I've seen in Europe before,\\" he said. Supporters argue that Chinese players need to learn from the best and international stars give the sport's weak following in","output":"the country a much-needed boost, raising its profile on the global stage. Critics, however, contend that the influx of high-profile foreign players is nothing more than a publicity stunt, used to generate buzz for the clubs and the Chinese Super League (CSL) while doing little to address the underlying issues in the development of domestic talent and infrastructure. The introduction of big-name players like Didier Drogba, who has undeniably enjoyed a successful career in European leagues, could indeed provide several benefits for Chinese football. For one, the presence of such accomplished athletes in the CSL serves as a magnet, attracting more fans to the stadiums and increasing engagement through television viewership and merchandising sales. This heightened interest can generate significant revenue, which may be reinvested in grassroots programs and facilities. Furthermore, playing alongside international stars can offer invaluable mentorship for up-and-coming Chinese footballers. Opportunities to develop and hone their skills under the guidance of experienced players who have competed in high-level matches will not only accelerate the growth of these players, but also potentially motivate more young athletes to pursue careers in football. Additionally, the mixing of cultures and playstyles could help expand and diversify the overall skill set of the Chinese football scene. However, those skeptical of the impact of foreign talent in the Chinese football landscape raise some valid concerns. Overspending on high-priced international talent could leave clubs with limited resources to invest in critical areas like youth academies, training facilities, or coaching development – essential components in fostering a robust football ecosystem in the long run. Moreover, the focus on international stars could inadvertently overshadow opportunities for local talent, as clubs may prefer to offer limited roster spots to more recognizable and marketable names. In order to maximize the benefits of having international stars in the Chinese Super League while addressing the concerns of critics, a comprehensive approach that balances investment in foreign talent with consistent and dedicated efforts to build and improve domestic infrastructure is necessary. This includes placing a strong emphasis on local talent scouting and development, collaboration with experienced international coaches, and a concerted effort to upgrade training facilities and conditions for Chinese athletes. Ultimately, the addition of high-profile players like Drogba can bring excitement and attention to the sport in China, but long-term success and growth will depend on the combined efforts of clubs, the league, and the governing authorities to develop a sustainable model that addresses the development of domestic talent, infrastructure, and coaching expertise, alongside leveraging the unique opportunities these international players present."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The survey unearthed some unique (and surprising) insights and lessons for job candidates and employers alike. “Traditional notions of what employers and candidates expect from one another are not necessarily applicable today,” says Rosemary Haefner, vice president of human resources at CareerBuilder. “Expectations and behaviors have evolved with new technologies, greater access to information and workplace environments that have become more flexible. These lessons are designed to help job seekers and employers to connect with one another more effectively.” Here are nine lessons from CareerBuilder for job seekers and recruiters that might surprise you: As an applicant, be prepared to speak with the top brass. Prepare for every job interview as if you’ll be speaking with the CEO or other senior leaders because that may very well be the reality for some candidates. According to CareerBuilder, 38% of employers say that job candidates are required to interview with a C-level executive (CEO, CFO, COO, etc.) within their organization. Make sure your online persona is free of “digital dirt.” This one might seem a bit more obvious—but too many job seekers don’t take it seriously. This might surprise you, though: According to the CareerBuilder survey, 62% of employers use the Internet to discover additional information about a job candidate. About half (48%) use Google or other search engines to research candidates; 44% research the candidate on Facebook; 27% monitor the candidate’s activity on Twitter; and 23% review the candidate’s posts or comments on Yelp.com, Glassdoor.com or other rating sites. Another tip: Don’t wait until you land an interview before you start cleaning up your online presence. CareerBuilder found that some of the search activity happens before candidates are even called for a job interview. Proper etiquette is required (throughout the entire process!). While it’s imperative that job candidates make a good impression during the interview, they also need to reinforce it afterwards. The survey found that 58% of employers said it’s important to send a thank you note after an interview; 24% said it’s very important. “While seemingly standard, this is a practice that’s often overlooked and could ultimately hurt your chances of getting hired,” Haefner explains. “In an earlier study we found that 15% of hiring managers said they would not hire someone who failed to send a thank you letter; 32% said they would still consider the candidate, but would think less of him or her. A thank you note enables you to reiterate your enthusiasm for the opportunity and why you’re the best fit for the job. You don’t want to skip that step.” Practicing good etiquette shouldn’t stop there. If you don’t get the job, never bad mouth the employer online or to your friends. You don’t want to burn any bridges. If you’re not mobile as a recruiter, you’re not truly accessible. Nearly two in five employers (39%) have jobs that stay open four months or longer due to the inability to find people with appropriate skills. Since mobile job search is growing at an accelerated rate, employers who aren’t mobile-optimized are missing out on key talent they need to find quickly, CareerBuilder says. As it turns out, at least half of all job seekers with smartphones or tablets spend three hours or more looking for jobs on those devices every week. About 65% of workers who search for jobs via mobile devices will leave a website if it is not mobile-optimized; and 40% walk away with a more negative opinion of the company. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses a CareerBuilder survey that revealed nine surprising lessons for job seekers and recruiters aiming to improve their hiring process and job search.

Q: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Taking care to sift the dry ingredients together, she ensures consistency and avoids any lumps in the final batter. Once the dry ingredients have been combined, she then slowly incorporates the previously prepared wet mix, gently pouring it into the bowl with the solids.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  I am facing a new situation today: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.

In a suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, Boston University claims that a part used in the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Air was patented by computer engineering professor Theodore Moustakas in 1997, the Boston Herald has reported.      The patent known as \\"Highly insulating monocrystalline gallium nitride thin films\\" refers to a semiconductor component invented by the professor.      \\"Defendant's acts of infringement have caused and will continue to cause substantial and irreparable damage to the University,\\" BU said in its complaint.      This isn't the university's first attempt to fight for this patent, the Herald said. Over the past year, BU has filed the same complaint against other companies, including Samsung and Amazon.      Is this a case of patent trolling, or does the university have a legitimate claim? Either way, Apple could end up on the losing side, at least according to one analyst.      \\"Courts can be irrational in these cases,\\" analyst Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates told the Herald. \\"You get these ridiculous judgments sometimes and they may think of Apple as a big, rich company that doesn't deserve all that money.\\"      A winning ruling could award BU as much as 75 million, Kay added. ||||| Boston University has sued Apple for allegedly infringing one of its patents to make the iPhone 5, iPad, and MacBook Air. In a suit filed yesterday, the university said that Apple was illegally using its '738 patent, which covers a method of making thin gallium nitride film semiconductors that can produce blue lasers cheaply and compactly. The complaint doesn't specify precisely how Apple is using the patented method, but gallium nitrate films often end up in LED displays. Boston University argues that \\"[Apple's] acts of infringement have caused and will continue to cause substantial and irreparable damage to the University.\\"      In return for using its 1997 patent, the university wants Apple to tally the profits it's derived from the alleged infringement, then hand over commensurate damages and interest on those damages. The application also includes a much more extreme, but boilerplate, request: Boston University's complaint asks for an injunction to stop Apple from selling or distributing the products it names. That doesn't mean, though, that this is remotely likely to happen. For one thing, this request appears in pretty much every patent infringement \\"prayer for relief,\\" regardless of what plaintiffs are really looking for.      Boston University wants damages drawn from Apple's record profits      For another, it's unlikely to be pursued or granted. Boston University doesn't claim to be using the patent, and it almost certainly can't say it would be gaining a competitive advantage by keeping it to itself. Banning Apple's products would also run directly counter to Boston University's self-interest. Academic patents generally end up getting shopped out to companies, and Boston University filed a joint lawsuit over the '738 patent in 2006 along with a company that licensed that patent. That suit ended in a settlement, and the defendant agreed to also pay a licensing fee. Apple could well fight this latest claim, and the patent itself is set to expire at the end of next year. While this is yet another patent lawsuit involving the Cupertino computer maker, though, we're not exactly looking at another Apple v. Samsung.      Matt Macari contributed to this report.      Update: The patent expires at the end of 2014, not later as a previous version said. ||||| Summary:","output":"Apple is facing a patent lawsuit from Boston University, which claims that a part used in the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Air was patented by one of the university's computer engineering professors, Theodore Moustakas, in 1997.

QPR midfielder Joey Barton believes this current Rangers side is 'poles apart' from the one that finished bottom of the Barclays Premier League two years ago. Barton spent the campaign on loan at Marseille as Rangers finished 15 points adrift of safety in 2013 and paid the price for a lack of cohesion on and off the field. Harry Redknapp was unable to rescue the west Londoners after taking over in November that season but his side have made a positive start to their return to the top flight. Joey Barton (centre) celebrates with Charlie Austin after the QPR striker's goal against Burnley. A 2-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday - their third win in four games at home - saw Rangers climb out of the bottom three for the first time since September. 'The performances we have put in at Loftus Road have been exceptional, even in defeat sometimes,' Barton said. 'The team spirit and togetherness of the football club is poles apart from that side which went out of the league with a whimper. 'We came up and we want to give a good account of ourselves. Slowly but surely we are doing that.\\" Barton continued: 'To look at the table and see yourselves not in the bottom three is always heart-warming. Barton (centre) gets physical with PSG's David Beckham (right) during his loan spell at Marseille in 2013. 'Hopefully at the end of May that's the case because that will be job done and goal achieved. There's a long way to go. This is the 15th game. 'After the defeat at Swansea the other day I asked our analyst to pull the table up from the year that QPR went down, the year I was in France. 'After 14 games we only had five points and I think it took them 16 games to win a game. So comparatively we're light years ahead.' Rangers' impressive form at home is in stark contrast to their results on the road where they have lost to Tottenham, Manchester United, Southampton, West Ham, Chelsea, Newcastle and Swansea this season. Redknapp's side are the only team in England's top four divisions yet to register a single point away from home and Barton admits it's a problem that needs addressing. Harry Redknapp (left) took up the to job at QPR in 2013, but he could not save the club from relegation. 'We have lost seven out of seven on the road but without making excuses, we haven't been to the easiest places,' Barton said. 'We haven't played teams in and around us. That will be the test for us. We've been to some of the tougher places in the league. 'I think everyone we've played away has been in the top 10 at the time we've played them. 'We're very mindful that we've got to improve our away form.\\" Rangers' awaydays do not get any easier as they travel to Everton and Arsenal before the end of the year either side of home games against West Brom and Crystal Palace. The bottom half of the table remains congested ahead of the busy Christmas calendar with only five points separating QPR in 17th and Aston Villa in 11th. 'If you string back-to-back wins together in this league you can propel yourself up the table,' Barton said. 'That's how tight it is. That's why people tune in. The Premier League is so competitive. Redknapp, however, managed to guide Barton (above) and his QPR side back to the Premier League last term. 'Chelsea's \\"Invincibles\\" all of a sudden go to Newcastle, Newcastle with their eighth-choice goalkeeper or whatever - and all of a sudden he comes on and they go on and beat Chelsea. 'There's not many other leagues where that happens. I've just seen on the TV, Real Madrid (have recorded an) 18th straight win. 'Arsenal went unbeaten for a year but I can't see anyone banging 18 wins out on the spin, not in this league, not with how competitive it is. 'There's a different element here, which is why people tune in from all over the globe.' Second-half goals from Leroy Fer and Charlie Austin ensured Rangers took maximum points against Burnley but there was disappointment too as Austin was sent off and will subsequently miss next Monday's match at Everton. 'He's our top scorer, he's been the difference for us at various times this season,' Barton added. 'To be without him is going to be a massive loss.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In this article, QPR midfielder Joey Barton shares his thoughts on the current Rangers side, stating that it is \\"poles apart\\" from the team that finished bottom of Barclays Premier League two years prior. He attributes this change to exceptional performances at Loftus Road and a strong team spirit and togetherness that was lacking in the past. Despite the team's struggles on the road and being in 17th place, Barton remains optimistic about their chances in the league. Barton reflects on his time on loan at Marseille in 2013 while Rangers finished 15 points away from safety, largely due to a lack of cohesion both on and off the field. He is encouraged by the more positive start to the current season under manager Harry Redknapp, who was unable to save the team from relegation in 2013. He highlights QPR's impressive home form, which includes three wins in four games, resulting in them climbing out of the bottom three for the first time since September. However, he also acknowledges their poor away form, which has not been helped by tough fixtures against teams in the top 10 at the time. Barton believes that playing against teams in their vicinity in the table will be a true test of the side's resilience. With away matches against Everton and Arsenal, as well as home games against West Brom and Crystal Palace scheduled before the end of the year, the battle for points in the closely-packed bottom half of the table will be intense. Despite this challenge, Barton remains confident in the team's ability to compete at the top level, citing the high competitive nature of the Premier League as a motivator. There is, however, a note of concern as top scorer Charlie Austin receives a red card and will subsequently miss the next match against Everton. Barton admits that losing Austin is a significant setback for the team, but he remains hopeful for QPR's continued growth and success on the field."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the  ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict. The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made \\"extraordinary progress\\" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years. However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. \\"As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics.\\" concludes the report. The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct. In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy.  Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. \\"While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics... Question: According to the passage, we can infer  _  . Options: A: close attention needs to be paid to the risks for the tropics. B: all the plants and animals will live in the polar region in the future. C: health and safety problems will influence the tropical development. D: Bruna shows positive attitude towards the future of the tropics.

As a rock star in his 20s, Watkins sold millions of albums and commanded arena crowds. What his fans did not know was that he was, as a court has heard, \\"a determined and committed paedophile\\". Det Ch Insp Peter Doyle from South Wales Police said: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that Ian Watkins exploited his celebrity status in order to abuse young children.\\" Ian Watkins was born in 1977 and grew up in Pontypridd, forming his first band, a thrash metal group called Aftermath, in his mid teens. The rocker studied graphic design at university and started playing music as a drummer before taking the microphone when the singer of one of his bands quit. Lozt Prophetz formed in 1997. Three years later, with the spelling of their name changed, they recorded their debut album, The Fake Sound of Progress, in a single week on a modest budget. After the band were snapped up by Columbia Records and heavyweight manager Peter Mensch, whose company Q Prime looks after Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Muse, the album was re-recorded and re-released. They soon started making waves in the US, where their second and third albums both reached the Top 40. They reached their commercial peak in the UK when their third album, Liberation Transmission, went to number one in 2006. They also had two Top 10 singles - Last Train Home in 2004, and Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast) two years later. Lostprophets were named best British band at the Kerrang! awards for two years in a row in 2006 and '07, although most critics afforded them little credibility. Watkins, heavily tattooed, with piercings and a goth-influenced dress sense, led the group as they sold out arena shows and attracted huge festival crowds. Peddling angst and rebellion, sweetened by anthemic choruses and a punk-meets-skater boy image, Lostprophets attracted many disenfranchised young fans. Their last album, Weapons, came out in April 2012, eight months before Watkins was arrested. We now know that while in the band, the disgraced star conspired with two female fans to abuse their babies as well as taking advantage of underage followers. He has pleaded guilty to a series of \\"depraved\\" child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. In one case, he swapped messages with a woman in her 20s about her baby boy in which the frontman spoke of his desire to \\"make him mine\\" and to \\"cross the line\\". Cardiff Crown Court was also given details of a 17-minute video in which the singer performed a sex act on the baby. The video was filmed the day after the Weapons album was released and just hours after Watkins appeared on BBC Radio 1. It emerged that he was a user of crack cocaine and crystal meth and he claimed to have no memory of the events in the video. Prosecuting barrister Chris Clee said drugs played \\"a significant part in his offending against children\\". Watkins also planned to \\"teach\\" the babies how to take drugs, the hearing was told. The singer used Skype to watch the other woman, aged 24, abuse her child. In the 45-minute video call, he talked to the mother about how they were going to use the baby for sex. Watkins referred to the woman and her baby as his \\"slave duo\\". Police also found a box of camcorder tapes which showed Watkins in hotel rooms with young fans. One 16-year-old girl from Boston, Massachusetts, contacted Watkins saying she was a fan and was a virgin and went on to meet him wearing a schoolgirl uniform in a New York hotel in October 2006. Watkins was filmed taking part in sex acts and describing the girl as \\"my underage slut\\". In October 2008, he filmed himself having sex with another 16-year-old Lostprophets fan. Police are now appealing for other victims to come forward. Watkins' ex-bandmates released a statement in October saying they had been \\"coming to terms with our heartache\\" since his arrest and that they would no longer make music as Lostprophets. Watkins and the two mothers are due to be sentenced next month.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? OPT:  1). smell it enough to taste it..  2). place it in your mouth to taste.....I think the answer is","output":"2). place it in your mouth to taste. Tasting something involves a complex process in which our senses, particularly taste and smell, work together to create the experience of flavor. While smelling an item can give you an idea of how it might taste, the best and most reasonable method to truly taste something is to place it in your mouth. Here is a detailed explanation of how the process of tasting works and why placing the food in your mouth is the most effective method: 1. When you place a food item in your mouth, saliva helps to break it down and release its molecules. The process is important because it ensures that taste molecules make contact with the taste buds, which are primarily located on the tongue's surface. 2. Taste buds contain specialized receptor cells that are responsible for detecting the five fundamental tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (savory). When the molecules of the food substance connect with these receptor cells, it sends a signal to your brain that a specific taste has been detected. For example, if you are eating a sweet food, the receptor cells that detect sweetness will be activated. 3. In addition to taste, the mouth also detects temperature, texture, and spiciness, further contributing to the overall flavor experience. 4. As you chew and swallow, the aromas of the food travel up to your nasal cavity through a passage called the retronasal olfactory pathway. Smell plays a significant role in the perception of flavor, as it helps identify specific food items and contributes to a richer sensory experience. In fact, a significant portion of what you perceive as \\"taste\\" is actually the result of your sense of smell. 5. The information from both taste and smell is interpreted and processed by the brain, leading to the perception of flavor. As you can see from this explanation, while smell does play an essential part in the overall experience of tasting food, it cannot entirely replace the act of placing the food directly in your mouth. By doing so, you are allowing your taste buds to interact fully with the food molecules and receive additional sensory input, such as texture and temperature. In conclusion, the most reasonable method to accomplish the goal of tasting something is to place the food in your mouth, as it allows for a comprehensive interaction between your senses and the food item in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Rohingya are the focus of the conflict, not these other entities. - Asian minority: This option is too vague, as it does not specifically mention the Rohingya. - Rohingya minority: This option is incomplete, as it omits the Asian geographical origin of the Rohingya people, which is relevant to the context of the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have: 34 * q + 58 + 91 + 21 = 0 First, let's add all the numbers that don't have \\"q\\" next to them. So, we'll add 58, 91, and 21: 58 + 91 + 21 = 170 Now our equation looks like this: 34 * q + 170 = 0 To figure out what q is, we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. We'll do this by moving the 170 to the other side of the equals sign. Since it's a positive 170, to move it, we'll subtract 170 from both sides: 34 * q = -170 Now, to find out what q is, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 34: q = -170 / 34 When we do this division, we find out that: q = -5 So, the answer is q = -5, which means that if we replace q with -5 in our original equation, both sides will equal to 0.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. two countries of similar natural resources had different populations. Italy had a small population, while Spain had a very large population.  Which country had an increased food supply?  Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease.","output":"The question is asking which country between Italy and Spain had an increased food supply given their respective populations and similar natural resources. To clarify how food supply can be influenced by population size, we first need to understand a basic concept in ecology called the “carrying capacity.” A defining characteristic of environments is that they have finite resources - specific amounts of food, space, sunlight, water, and other necessities for life. The carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources available. Using the premise provided that when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual, it implies the smaller population will have a higher per capita availability of resources. Conversely, as the population increases, the pool of resources begins to diminish because the same amount of resources is being shared among a larger population. Hence, the larger the population, the more strained the resources, including food. Coming back to the question, given the two countries of Italy and Spain with Italy having a small population and Spain having a significantly larger population, assuming that the two countries share similar natural resources including arable land and technology for food production, the country with an increased food supply would be Italy. Italy would likely have a higher per capita food and resource availability because of its smaller population, allowing for a more generous division of existing resources. The increased availability of food and other resources would probably result in a high birth rate, as resources would not be as strained as they would be in a more densely populated area. On the other hand, Spain, with its larger population, would have a more strained food and resource supply due to the larger demand from its greater number of people. In this situation, the country's natural resources, including food, would have to be divided among a larger population, significantly reducing the per-capita supply. The decrease in available necessary resources, such as food, might result in lower birth rates as reproduction at the same rate cannot be sustained, causing the population growth rate to decrease. In conclusion, considering the above factors, Italy would have more abundant food resources per person due to smaller population size sharing similar natural resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: If the moisture in your wall is coming primarily from the humidity in the air, try turning on your house's central air-conditioning system. Warm air retains more moisture than cool air, so chilling your room will lower the humidity significantly and make it easier to dry out the wall. If you don't have a central A/C system, try purchasing a portable or window unit. To help replace your house's old, moist air with fresh, dry air, try opening up any doors and windows located near the moisture damaged area. This will increase air circulation around the damp wall, speeding up the drying process.  Do not open your windows and doors if you're using a dehumidifier. For the best results, use this method during the day while the sun is out. This method may not work if you live in an extremely humid area. Wallpaper, wall fabric, and similar wall coverings will prevent air from reaching the wall itself, slowing down the drying process. In addition, soaked wall coverings can harbor dangerous mold and mildew, making them unsafe. Along with standard wall coverings, remove any other objects placed on your wall such as posters and floating shelves. If your damp wall houses any cabinets or similar furniture items, open up their doors and slide out their drawers. Not only will this help the cabinet dry faster, but it will speed up the overall drying process by increasing air circulation in the area. Summary:","output":"The article highlights methods to tackle moisture in walls caused by humidity. It suggests using a central air-conditioning system, portable, or window unit to cool the air and lower humidity, making it easier for the wall to dry. Opening doors and windows near the affected area can help increase air circulation and drying speed but should not be done when using a dehumidifier. The mentioned methods work best during daylight hours and might not be effective in highly humid areas. Removing wall coverings, posters, floating shelves, and opening cabinets or drawers can also help speed up the drying process and prevent mold and mildew growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror.

Help as much as you can. Information:  - The Marxophone is a fretless zither with a system of metal hammers added for ease of playing . It features two octaves of double melody strings in the key of C major ( middle C to C '' ) , and four sets of chord strings ( C major , G major , F major , and D7 ) . Sounding somewhat like a mandolin , the Marxophone 's timbre is also reminiscent of various types of hammered dulcimers . The player typically strums the chords with the left hand . The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel strips that hold small lead hammers over the strings . A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note . Holding the strip down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings , which produces a mandolin - like tremolo . The bounce rate is somewhat fixed , as it is based on the spring steel strip length , hammer weight , and string tension -- but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip , effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer . Numerically coded sheet music prepared specifically for the Marxophone indicates when and in what order to play melody and chord strings . This type of music , similar to tablature , was produced for those who could not read standard notation . A rectangular piece of metal provides a backstop for the spring steel hammers , displays the name Marxophone and the patent number , and has clips that hold sheet music . It also marks the 15 keys by letter ( C , D , etc. ) , by number ( 1 - 15 ) and in standard musical notation . When the instrument is moved or stored , the metal rectangle bends down , holding the keys against the strings , so the Marxophone can fit into its case -- which is the size of a large briefcase .  - A plectrum is a small flat tool used to pluck or strum a stringed instrument. For hand-held instruments such as guitars and mandolins, the plectrum is often called a pick, and is a separate tool held in the player's hand. In harpsichords, the plectra are attached to the jack mechanism.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - F major (or the key of F) is a major scale based on F, with the pitches F, G, A, B, C, D, and E. Its key signature has one flat, B.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Mandobass is the largest (and least common) member of the mandolin family, sometimes used as the bass instrument in mandolin orchestras. It is so large that it usually isn't held in the lap, but supported on a spike which rests on the floor. The neck-scale length on a full-size mando-bass is similar to that of a standard orchestral double bass viol: about 43\\" (110 cm). The instrument is otherwise similar to the smaller, higher-pitched members of the mandolin family, having a fretted neck, a headstock with geared tuning machines, and a large resonating body oftenbut not alwaysshaped like that of other mandolins.  - Lute can refer generally to any string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the HornbostelSachs system), more specifically to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes.  - In music, unison is two or more musical parts sounding the same pitch or at an octave interval, usually at the same time.  - C major (or the key of C) is a major scale based on C, with the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has no flats and no sharps.  - The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers. Harps have been known since antiquity in Asia, Africa, and Europe, dating back at least as early as 3500 BC. The instrument had great popularity in Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, where it evolved into a wide range of variants with new technologies, and was disseminated to Europe's colonies, finding particular popularity in Latin America. While some ancient members of the harp family died out in the Near East and South Asia, descendants of early harps are still played in Burma and in Sub-Saharan Africa, while other defunct variants in Europe and Asia have been revived by musicians in the modern era.  - The mandocello is a plucked string instrument of the mandolin family. It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch). It can be described as being to the mandolin what the cello is to the violin.  - G major (or the key of G) is a major scale based on G, with the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F. Its key signature has one sharp, F.  - The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C-G-D-A low-to-high), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, although now rarer, is the ancestor of the mandolin, the name of which means simply \\"little mandola\\".  - The major scale or Ionian scale is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \\"octavus\\", the eighth).  - In musical notation, a key signature is a set of sharp, flat, and rarely, natural symbols placed together on the staff. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double barline.  - The cello (; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. The strings from low to high are generally tuned to C, G, D and A, an octave lower than the viola. It is a member of the violin family of musical instruments, which also includes the violin and viola.  - A mandolin (; literally \\"small mandola\\") is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or \\"pick\\". It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison (8 strings), although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths. It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.  - The octave mandolin is a fretted string instrument with four pairs of strings tuned in fifths, G, D, A, E (low to high), an octave below a mandolin. It has a 20 to 23-inch scale length and its construction is similar to other instruments in the mandolin family. Usually the courses are all unison pairs but the lower two may sometimes be strung as octave pairs with the higher-pitched octave string on top so that it is hit before the thicker lower-pitched string. Alternate tunings of G, D, A, D and A, D, A, D are often employed by Celtic musicians.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Available choices: --yes --no","output":"--yes Digimon, or Digital Monsters, are born through a unique process that primarily involves the creation, nurturing, and hatching of Digi-Eggs. The life cycle of Digimon starts in the Digital World, an alternate reality that exists parallel to the human world. Let's examine this process in more detail: 1. Formation of Digi-Eggs: The journey of a Digimon starts from the formation of a Digi-Egg. When a Digimon gets defeated or their life cycle comes to an end, their data gets converted into a Digi-Egg or Dejitama. In some instances, the Digi-Eggs can also originate from the kernel, the digital world's \\"nurturing grounds\\" for new life. 2. Nurturing Digi-Eggs: Once a Digi-Egg is formed, it usually makes its way to Primary Village (Nursery Town, ようちえんタウン), or Village of Beginnings, a special location in the Digital World where Baby Digimon are nurtured and raised. Here, Digi-Eggs are carefully monitored and taken care of by Digi-parents, including Elecmon or Swanmon, who serve as guardians to maintain peace and ensure the newborn Digimon's safety. 3. Hatching Process: When the conditions are right, the Digi-Eggs will hatch and give birth to a baby Digimon in their Fresh or In-Training stage. During this process, the Digi-Egg undergoes a metamorphosis in which it emits a bright light, followed by a transformation into a small, juvenile form of a Digimon. In some cases, environmental factors or specific zones in the Digital World can affect the hatching process, resulting in variant forms of certain Digimon species. 4. Growth and Digivolution: After hatching, the young Digimon start to grow and evolve by gaining experience and acquiring necessary data to reach new stages of their life cycle known as \\"Digivolution.\\" This progression typically follows a set pattern, advancing from Baby, In-Training, Rookie, Champion, Ultimate, and finally Mega stages. However, external factors such as a Tamer's intervention, special artifacts like Digimentals, or the influence of powerful beings can trigger alternate or unique Digivolution paths. 5. Reincarnation: Once a Digimon reaches the end of its life cycle or gets defeated, it undergoes a process of reconfiguration, returning to the Village of Beginnings and being reborn as a Digi-Egg again. This process of reincarnation ensures the continuous existence, evolution, and adaptation of Digimon in the Digital World. In conclusion, Digimon are born from Digi-Eggs, which are nurtured and hatch in special locations in the Digital World. Upon hatching, baby Digimon start their journey to mature and grow by accumulating experience and data, leading to various stages of evolution. When a Digimon's life comes to an end, they reincarnate as a new Digi-Egg, restarting the cycle of life in the Digital World."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Reuters - High-definition television canshow the sweat beading on an athlete's brow, but the cost ofall the necessary electronic equipment can get a shopper's ownpulse racing.","output":"This excerpt is about the advances in high-definition television technology and its ability to showcase impressive detail, such as sweat beading on an athlete's brow. However, it also highlights the cost associated with acquiring the necessary electronic equipment for this level of image quality, which can potentially make the shopping experience daunting for consumers. High-definition television (HDTV) offers improved resolution and picture quality compared to standard-definition television. It provides a wide aspect ratio, which gives viewers a more immersive and engaging experience. The innovation of high-definition technology revolutionized the TV industry, leading to new formats like 720p, 1080i, and 1080p, with the number indicating the vertical resolution and the letter (either p or i) representing whether the image is displayed in progressive or interlaced scan. The excerpt also implies that with the advancement of HDTV comes the need for upgrading other electronic equipment to support this high-quality experience, creating additional expenses for the consumer. These upgrades may include: 1. HDTV-compatible devices: To take full advantage of the enhanced image quality that HDTVs offer, consumers must use devices capable of transmitting high-definition signals, such as Blu-ray players, gaming consoles, and HD-compatible streaming devices. 2. Audio equipment: With improved image quality comes higher expectations for audio quality. Surround sound systems and soundbars can be necessary investments for some consumers who want to experience the best possible audio that complements the HDTV's high-resolution display. 3. Cables and accessories: To ensure optimal video and audio transmission, users may need to upgrade to HDMI or other types of high-speed cables for connecting devices to the HDTV. Accessories like signal boosters or repeaters might be needed for certain setups. 4. Internet bandwidth: Streaming high-definition content requires a faster internet connection due to the larger file sizes. To maintain smooth streaming and avoid buffering, users may need to upgrade their internet plans or invest in better networking equipment like routers and modems. 5. Subscription services: Providers of cable, satellite, and streaming services may charge additional fees for accessing high-definition channels and content, adding to monthly expenses for consumers. Overall, the improved visual experience that high-definition technology offers often comes with significant costs, as consumers must invest in multiple areas to support the high-quality experience. However, HDTV continues to gain popularity due to the impressive image quality and immersive nature of the content. As technology continues to evolve and prices for HDTV-compatible devices and services become more competitive, it is likely that more consumers will adopt this technology to enhance their home entertainment experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here is an article: Two Palm Springs men arrested for lewd conduct aboard a cruise ship in the Caribbean have paid a fine of about 900 and are on their way home after spending a night detained on the island of Dominica. The men pleaded guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of public indecency and lewd conduct and will skip out on the rest of their cruise, said Atlantis Events President Rich Campbell, whose company arranged the cruise. Dominica police have identified the men as John Robert Hart, 41, and Dennis Jay Mayer, 43, both of Palm Springs. Campbell would not name the men himself but confirmed media reports that identified them. Reached by cellphone at the cruise's next stop in St. Barts, Campbell said the two guests were engaged in sexual activity on the balcony while the ship was docked in Dominica. The balcony faced a town and was about 150 feet away from a street, he said. Residents saw the lewd activity and called authorities. Campbell's West Hollywood-based company specializes in gay travel and organized the cruise. But contrary to previous reports, Campbell said the arrests had nothing to do with the men’s sexuality. He said the men were charged just as they would have been for performing similar acts in any country, adding that they were not ultimately charged with sodomy. “They just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Campbell said. “Sodomy laws do exist. But that’s not what they were called into question for. That has nothing to do with this.” A 2011 report from the Australian Associated Press lists Dominica as one of 41 Commonwealth nations in which homosexuality is illegal. Dominica News Online reported the men told police they were naked but not having sex. Campbell said that cruise personnel worked hard to convince Dominica officials not to detain the men overnight. When authorities refused, the company offered to leave a cruise official with the men until the situation was resolved. The men declined the assistance, and Campbell said they were in “good spirits” when he last spoke with them. “We’ve been going to the Caribbean for 21 years now,” Campbell said. “I’ve taken 50,000 guests there without any incidents.” Bear raids trash can outside Glendale home Arrests of ex-Coliseum officials bring condemnation, anger Man videotaped others in Cypress College bathroom, police say Write a title for it.","output":"\\"Palm Springs Men Fined and Detained for Lewd Conduct Aboard a Caribbean Cruise\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A majority of working women remain in full charge of their home; they come back at night to the cleaning, washing, and cooking that constitute their second career. But more and more husbands are sharing the burden and willingly taking on chores that their fathers would have rejected as unmanly, and as too mysteriously difficult anyway. In such cases, man and wife become equal partners, both working outside, both pushing the vacuum cleaner, actually, the number of husbands who do help that way is much smaller than the number of those who accept the idea in theory.  _ . The marriage can be destroyed when the wife is more successful in her profession than her husband in his, particularly when she earns more than he does. Sociologists see in this situation one of the main reasons for the increase in the divorce rate-another reason being the husband's refusal to help with the housework or the care of the children. A third reason could be the growing awareness of the professional woman that she doesn't hare to remain married if she is too unhappy.

Among the tactics Weiss used with daughter Bea: depriving her of dinner because she ate 800 calories at school during \\"French Heritage Day,\\" refusing to allow her to participate in \\"Pizza Fridays\\" because she once added a corn salad on the side, and angrily dumping out her Starbucks hot chocolate when the barista couldn't tell her exactly how many calories it contained.

Introduction In a recent Vogue article, writer Dara-Lynn Weiss chronicled her yearlong struggle in helping her clinically obese seven-year-old daughter, Bea, lose 16 pounds. Weiss's article has sparked a heated debate on parenting styles and the potential long-term impact of a mother's body-image issues on a child. The article revealed Weiss's own struggles with eating and body-image issues throughout her life. Some of the tactics she used to help her daughter Bea shed the pounds included depriving her of dinner, refusing certain foods and outings, and expressing anger in public over food choices. Critics have accused Weiss of projecting her self-loathing onto her daughter, potentially paving the way for future eating disorders. This article explores the various perspectives and reactions to Weiss's controversial methods, which some consider obsessive and harmful, while others argue that she was merely a concerned parent trying to address her child's weight issue. Heated Reactions As mentioned in Yahoo's highlights, Katie Baker from Jezebel had a particularly scathing response to the Vogue article. Baker labeled Weiss as one of \\"the most fucked up, selfish women to ever grace the magazine's pages.\\" She pointed out that Weiss’s projection of her hatred for her body onto her child was \\"truly disgusting.\\" Dhani Mau from Fashionista.com, meanwhile, emphasized that Weiss’s preventative measures—such as physically stopping her daughter from eating a salad nicoise—made her come across as obsessive and unreasonable. Several other commentators also criticized Weiss for choosing to publicly address her daughter's weight issue in such an extreme manner. The Connection Between Parental Behavior and Childhood Obesity One major concern raised by the article is the impact of parental behavior on a child’s eating habits and body image. As an anonymous blogger and mom from New York pointed out, instead of tackling the root cause of Bea's overeating, Weiss projected her self-loathing onto her daughter. Experts suggest that establishing a healthy parent-child relationship around food, nutrition, and bodyweight is crucial for preventing obesity. Parents should be role models in making better food choices, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and communicating the importance of balanced meals to their children. When Weiss deprived Bea of dinner or reacted angrily to food choices, she transformed eating into a contentious issue, which could have long-lasting effects on her daughter. Silver Lining: The Importance of Addressing Childhood Obesity While reactions to Weiss’s article have been predominantly negative, it is important to acknowledge the underlying message—that childhood obesity is a significant issue that warrants attention. Weiss's article sheds light on the struggles that many parents face when attempting to address their child's weight concerns. The fact remains that childhood obesity is linked to numerous long-term health risks, such as increased chances of developing heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic health conditions. Parents must find ways to encourage healthy eating habits and lifestyle choices within their children. Conclusion Dara-Lynn Weiss’s controversial Vogue article about her daughter's weight loss journey has sparked intense conversations about responsible parenting and childhood obesity. While many critics have accused Weiss of being obsessive, projecting her insecurities onto her child, and setting the stage for future eating disorders, it's essential to recognize the importance of addressing childhood obesity. Parents must aspire to be role models in making healthy choices and promoting positive habits. Honest communication and understanding between parents and children are essential for helping children develop healthy eating habits and encourage a positive body image."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Apply the information from the passage to the question. The question asks about Will and Tony, who are skateboarding and pushing against each other. As their force increases, we need to determine if their distance apart decreases or increases. Step 3: Choose the correct answer based on the passage. The passage says \\"the harder they push together, the farther apart they move.\\" Since Will and Tony's force is increasing, it means they are pushing harder together. As a result, the distance they travel away from each other increases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Campaigners against the cull say the policy will have no impact on bovine TB, and could lead to local populations of badgers being wiped out. A: The trials took place in areas where there were a high number of TB infections in cattle to assess whether badgers could be culled humanely, safely and effectively. The precise areas where badgers were shot by trained marksmen was not revealed. One area was in West Somerset and the other in and around West Gloucestershire. A third area, in Dorset, was prepared in reserve but there was no culling last year. The cull aimed to kill at least 70% of badgers across areas about the size of the Isle of Wight in each zone. A: The pilots do not look at scientific data.  The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will review: On the basis of the report by an independent panel - expected in March - ministers will make a decision about whether or not to extend the pilots to other areas of England. A: Scientific evidence suggests sustained culls of badgers under controlled conditions could reduce TB in local cattle by 12-16% after four years of annual culls, and five years of follow-up, although it could be lower and it could be higher. The randomised badger culling trial in England found that killing badgers disrupted their social groups, with surviving animals moving out to establish new groups, taking TB with them. This perturbation effect led to an increase in cases of bovine TB outside of the cull zone, although the impact diminished over time. The pilot culls attempted to use borders such as rivers and motorways to reduce the risk of badgers spreading TB to neighbouring areas, but this approach has not been fully tested. The  randomised badger culling trial trapped badgers in cages for the cull, while the main method planned for Gloucestershire and Somerset was free shooting, although cage trapping and shooting was also used. Any deviation from methods used in the original trial will decrease or increase the expected impact on bovine TB, according to scientists. A: Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease of cattle. It presents a serious problem for the cattle industry, causing financial and personal hardship for farmers. The disease is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), which can also infect and cause TB in badgers, deer and other mammals. Cattle are regularly tested for TB and destroyed if they test positive. Q: Why are badgers implicated in spreading TB? A: Scientific evidence has shown that bovine TB can be transmitted from cattle to cattle; from badgers to cattle and cattle to badgers; and from badger to badger. Badgers are thought to pass on the disease to cattle through their urine, faeces or through droplet infection, in the farmyard or in cattle pastures. However, it is not clear how big a role badgers play in the spread of bovine TB since the cows can also pass the disease on to other members of the herd. According to computer modelling studies, herd-to-herd transmission of bovine TB in cattle accounts for 94% of cases. Scientific evidence from the randomised badger culling trials found around 6% of infected cattle catch TB directly from badgers. The figure rises to about 50%, when cattle infected by badgers pass it on to other herds, say scientists. A: TB has cost the taxpayer in England £500m to control the disease in the last 10 years. According to Defra, each pilot cull will cost about £100,000 a year, with these costs met by farmers who want badgers killed on their land. This figure does not include policing costs, which have been estimated at £500,000 per area per year, according to a written answer to parliament. According to Mary Creagh, shadow secretary of state for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, other costs include: A wildlife charity has estimated the costs of the pilot culls to be more than £4,000 per badger killed. Most of the shooting was thought to have been carried out at dusk or at night, since the animals are largely nocturnal. There are two main methods used to shoot badgers:  searching over an area with a spotlight and rifle; or placing bait at a fixed point, then lying in wait for the badger. This requires a team of two or three people: the shooter, a spotter and a potential third person to drive a vehicle or act as an additional safety lookout. Shooting must be avoided if the teams are near rights of ways, or close to rural dwellings in order to prevent accidental injury to the public. To comply with humane standards, the person using the firearm must try to kill the animal quickly with the first shot. This means being able to locate the heart-lung area of the badger's body and be confident of a \\"clean\\" kill up to a range of 50-70m. But there are problems in shooting animals at distance in the dark.  Coloured filters can be used with spotlights to reduce a badger's awareness of the spotlight, allowing teams to approach more closely, or take more time on a shot. But they also reduce visibility for the shooter. Night vision sights can be used if certain conditions are met. Officials accept that second shots may sometimes be necessary. Though it is practical to select a site near a badger sett, the shooting must not take place so close to the entrance (at least 30m away) that a wounded badger can retreat inside before a follow-up shot can be taken. Licensed operators must pass a Defra-approved marksmanship course and must have received training on humane shooting. There are restrictions on firearms and ammunition. Q: What is happening in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland? A: Scotland is classified as free of TB. The Welsh Assembly Government has chosen to vaccinate badgers, with trials underway in North Pembrokeshire. Northern Ireland is conducting research into an eradication programme involving vaccination and selected culling of badgers with signs of TB infection. The Republic of Ireland has been culling badgers since the 1980s. Q: Can badgers or cows be vaccinated? A: There is a vaccine for badgers - the BCG jab, which has been used by a number of wildlife and conservation bodies in England, including the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and the National Trust. Badger vaccination is  underway in Wales and the Republic of Ireland, and there are plans to introduce it in Northern Ireland. Cattle can also be vaccinated with the BCG vaccine. Vaccination of cattle against TB is currently prohibited by EU legislation, mainly because BCG vaccination of cattle can interfere with the tuberculin skin test, the main diagnostic test for TB. Vaccination is not effective in badgers or cattle that are infected with TB. In Wales, the cost of vaccinating each badger is put at £662. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The UK government has implemented a controversial badger culling policy in specific high-risk areas with the aim of tackling bovine TB, a disease that can be transmitted to cattle by badgers. Opponents argue that the culling policy will not effectively impact bovine TB rates and could lead to the decimation of local badger populations. Scientific evidence suggests that a carefully managed cull could potentially reduce TB in local cattle by 12-16% after four years. However, the disruption of badger social groups caused by culling can lead to an increase in bovine TB cases outside the culling zone. Badgers are thought to transmit the disease to cattle mainly through their urine and feces. Bovine TB has cost the UK taxpayers £500 million in control efforts over the past decade, with each culling pilot estimated to cost around £100,000 annually. Alternative options for managing the disease include vaccinating badgers and cattle, though currently the European Union prohibits cattle vaccination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would  be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests.

Answer this question please: Which reactants would have particle's with lower energy, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","output":"Reactant B would have particles with lower energy. This is because it consists of cooler reactants, and at lower temperatures, particles have less kinetic energy compared to those at higher temperatures. Since reactant A is using warmer reactants, its particles will have more energy compared to reactant B.

Answer a question about this article: Major European rivers flow from Switzerland, such as the Rhine, the Rhone, the Inn, the Ticino and the Po, all of which have headwaters in the Alps and flow into neighbouring countries, finally emptying into the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea. Other rivers such as the Danube have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the Alps. The Rhone is second to the Nile as a freshwater source to the Mediterranean Sea; the river begins as glacial meltwater, flows into Lake Geneva, and from there to France where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants. The Rhine originates in a 30 square kilometre area in Switzerland and represents almost 60 percent of water exported from the country. Tributary valleys, some of which are complicated, channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snow melt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers. Where do the major tributaries that flow through the Danube originate from?","output":"The major tributaries that flow through the Danube River don't start in Switzerland, but they begin in the Alps. The Alps are big mountains in Europe, and many rivers start there because of the melting snow and ice. So, the important rivers that join the Danube River start from the mountains called the Alps."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot). Delassalle also has a relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Nicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she learns it is not actually Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin. When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says it was Michel who punished him.

New angle of reporter washed away on live TV emerges It looked bad the first time but new video showing a French reporter getting washed away during a live TV cross has captured the full scale of the freak wave which hit her. Fanny Agostini, a reporter with French news network BFMTV, was in Saint-Mal in north-west France on Friday when she was swept off her feet as thousands of viewers watched the live cross. Her cameraman also staggered as water swept over the walls of the old city. Now a bystander’s video of the dramatic live TV bungle shows the full scene unfold. It reveals a high-speed wall of water nearly waist high blast through the narrow opening where the reporter was standing, knocking her clean off her feet. The moment Ms Agostini glances over her shoulder and realises the wave is about to hit her is also captured – as are the small group of bystanders running away as the reporter stays put. Drenched, the journalist managed to get back on her feet and continue the report as her studio-based colleagues barely contained their amusement. Do you have any news photos or videos?

My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge  from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer  pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, \\"I hope that helps a bit.\\" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did. I placed some money in the woman's cup and continued my travels, light-hearted after witnessing such an astute act of caring. The author went to a quiet canal-side cafe to   _  .

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN)  -- The death of a spectator overshadowed an intriguing 14th stage of the Tour de France which saw Rinaldo Nocentini desperately cling on to the leader's yellow jersey in cycling's premier event. George Hincapie, front, upstaged his compatriot and former teammate Lance Armstrong to take second place overall. A woman died after being hit by a police motorcycle on Saturday afternoon in Wittelsheim, a village in Alsace in northeastern France which is 40 kilometers from the start of the race's leg from Colmar to Besancon. French police told CNN that two other people were injured and taken to hospital. \\"We had a rider up front so we didn't have to ride but because OPTIONS: - Alsace was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - Besancon was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - CNN was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - Colmar was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - France was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - French was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - George Hincapie was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - Italy was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - Lance Armstrong was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - Rinaldo Nocentini was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - Tour de France was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey. - Wittelsheim was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey.","output":"\\"We had a rider up front so we didn't have to ride but because George Hincapie was in the move there was a big risk of losing the yellow jersey.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.  Question: \\"Why was the Secret Service's information about United 93 flawed?\\" Answer: \\"Based on projected path\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Alright kiddo, so there was a big meeting with important people like the President and Vice President. They were talking about some planes, called CAPs, that fly around to protect things. They needed to figure out what the pilots should do if something goes wrong. Now, the Secret Service found out that a plane called United 93 was coming towards Washington, D.C. But, their information wasn't quite right. You see, they were looking at what they thought the plane's path would be instead of where it actually was. So, it was like they were guessing where it would go, but their guess was wrong because the plane had already landed somewhere else. So, to answer your question, yes, the answer is correct. The Secret Service's information was flawed because they were looking at the projected path, which is like a guess, instead of the real path of the plane."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to do it.

The appositive construction is meant to provide an explanation or clarification, and it typically appears right after the noun that it explains. Here, the appositive \\"son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza\\" helps to specify the relationship between Humphries and his parents. Note that in this sentence, the article \\"the\\" is omitted from the phrase \\"son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza.\\" 2. \\"Humphries was born in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, the son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza.\\" This sentence is very similar to the first one, with the main difference being the inclusion of the definite article \\"the\\" before \\"son\\" to form the noun phrase \\"the son of John Thomas Humphries and his wife Eliza.\\" The addition of \\"the\\" makes the relationship between Humphries and his parents more explicit, as it emphasizes the specific identity of Humphries as the son of the mentioned couple. In terms of meaning, this sentence shares the same core information as the first sentence: Humphries' birthplace in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, and his relationship to his parents, John Thomas Humphries and Eliza. In conclusion, while the two sentences contain the same key information, they differ slightly in structure. The first sentence uses an appositive without the definite article, while the second sentence includes the definite article \\"the\\" in the noun phrase describing Humphries' relationship to his parents.

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing. One of the boys from the cafe agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot to do some investigating there.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person who feels there is more to the story than the police evidence?

Vancouver police believe he may be in the area. Kirk Cameron who starred in Growing Pains has publicly urged Andrew to call him. Andrew’s parents, Walter and Judy, are in Vancouver helping police search for their son. Walter may be familiar to you; he played Chekov in the original Star Trek series.”      Instead of introducing the parents, King paused and told viewers, “ I’m told that they left the studio so we’ll take a quick break and find out why.”      After another commercial break, King returned and said he had no explanation for why the Koenigs suddenly left the studio.      “For some reason unbeknownst to anyone Walter Koenig, the father of the missing Andrew Koenig and Judy, the mother of the missing Andrew Koenig, left the studio in Vancouver. We checked them out, they were prepared to go on, I said hello, they both said hello, we said we’d be on in two minutes, they said fine and they got up and left for reasons unknown.”      An insider at Larry King Live told RadarOnline.com, “What I know is exactly what you saw and heard on our show.”      Andrew is still missing in Vancouver, anyone with information on his whereabouts should call the Vancouver Police Department 604-711-2534. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Growing Pains star Andrew Koenig has gone missing, and his parents walked out of an interview with Larry King Live just minutes before it was supposed to begin.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph:      Q: Most enzymes are classified as what?   Choices:  - lipids  - acids  - hormones  - proteins  A:","output":"Most enzymes are classified as proteins.  Enzymes are biological catalysts that play a critical role in speeding up biochemical reactions in living organisms. They are essential for various cellular processes such as metabolism, respiration, and reproduction. In order to carry out their function, enzymes possess a unique three-dimensional structure, which provides them with a specific, active site. This active site is where the enzyme binds to a substrate (the molecule it interacts with) and transforms it into a product, thereby facilitating the reaction. Proteins are large biomolecules made up of amino acids that are linked by peptide bonds. They are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs. Proteins are involved in various biological functions, including catalyzing biochemical reactions, controlling gene expression, providing structural support, and transporting substances across membranes. The classification of most enzymes as proteins is based on their primary structure, which consists of a unique sequence of amino acids. These amino acids determine the enzyme's secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, which are responsible for their specific functions. Although some ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules can also act as enzymes, known as ribozymes, the vast majority of enzymes are primarily made up of proteins. For clarification, the other options provided include: 1. Lipids: Organic compounds that serve as important structural components in cell membranes, store energy, and function as signaling molecules. They are insoluble in water and include fats, oils, waxes, and sterols. 2. Acids: A class of compounds that donate protons or hydrogen ions in a solution, leading to a decrease in pH. They can be inorganic, such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, or organic, like acetic acid and citric acid. 3. Hormones: Chemical messengers produced by glands in the endocrine system, which regulate physiological processes such as growth, metabolism, and reproduction. Hormones may be proteins (e.g., insulin), lipids (e.g., steroid hormones), or derivatives of amino acids (e.g., thyroxine). In conclusion, most enzymes are classified as proteins since their primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that determine their specific function. While there are a few instances of non-protein enzymes like ribozymes, the majority of enzymes are comprised of proteins."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: got bombarded by Taylors friends and couldn't do anything  B: pain  C: got hit back in the face A:","output":"Based on the context provided, where Cameron thrust upon Taylor and tackled him in a fit of anger, none of the given options (A, B, or C) provide a complete and detailed answer to the question of what will happen to Taylor. Here is a more detailed and longer answer which better addresses the question: When Cameron forcefully tackles Taylor out of anger, several scenarios could unfold as a result. Taylor may feel immense pain upon impact due to the unexpected and aggressive nature of the tackle (as suggested by option B). This pain could be felt in various parts of Taylor's body, depending on the specific manner of the tackle. For example, if Taylor was tackled from the front, they might experience pain in their chest, abdomen, or face. If tackled from behind, it could result in pain in the back, neck, or head. Another possibility, as insinuated by option C, is that Taylor may react defensively and attempt to fight back against Cameron, potentially hitting Cameron back in the face. This reaction could stem from a natural fight-or-flight response in the face of sudden aggression. Both parties could then become more aggressive and confrontational, escalating the physical altercation between them. It's also important to consider the possibility mentioned in option A, although it does not directly answer the question of what happens to Taylor. If Taylor has friends nearby who witness the incident and are concerned for Taylor's well-being, they may intervene in an attempt to protect Taylor. This could result in Taylor's friends confronting or even attacking Cameron, perhaps initiating further conflict. Overall, although option B ('pain') seems to be the most directly relevant to the given context, it does not provide a complete and detailed answer to the question.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Devils Context: In 17th Century France, Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Logue) is influencing King Louis XIII (Graham Armitage) in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from uprising. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its governor not to damage the town.Meanwhile in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier (Oliver Reed), a dissolute and proud but popular and well-regarded Catholic priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Mignon (Murray Melvin), another priest in the town, unaware that the deformed, neurotic Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave), head of the local convent, is sexually obsessed with him. She asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeline De Brou (Gemma Jones), but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, driving her to insanity (this includes an attack where Sister Jeanne viciously attacks Madeleine when the latter brings back a book that the former had lent her, and Sister Jeanne accuses Madeleine of being a \\"fornicator\\" and \\"sacrilegious bitch\\", among other things).Baron de Laubardemont (Dudley Sutton) arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be her new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her. Mignon relays this information to Laubardemont.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"The Devils,\\" Urbain Grandier (Oliver Reed) is falsely accused of practicing witchcraft and possessing Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave) due to her obsession with him and the false claims made by Father Mignon (Murray Melvin) and Baron de Laubardemont (Dudley Sutton). As the events unfold, Grandier's enemies seize the opportunity to conspire against him while he is away from Loudun. When Grandier returns to Loudun, he is arrested and put on trial. The trial is a farce, with the judges being pressured by Richelieu's envoy, Laubardemont, to find him guilty. The judges, despite their misgivings, do as they are told and sentence him to death. During the trial, the false allegations of witchcraft against Grandier are further fueled by exorcist Father Barre (Michael Gothard). In an effort to prove the accusations, a public exorcism is carried out on Sister Jeanne and the other nuns of the convent, which only serves to heighten the hysteria and serves as sensationalist propaganda against Grandier. In the end, Urbain Grandier is found guilty and sentenced to death. He is subjected to torture and burned at the stake. The sentence is brutal and unjust, serving as a means for those in power to eliminate a perceived threat, settle personal scores, and consolidate their control over Loudun. The film portrays the tragedy of Grandier's fate and the corruption and manipulation at play during that era in France."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Death of Willie Sherman Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded. It was no secret that 9-year-old Willie was the favorite child of William Tecumseh Sherman. In fact, his wife, Ellen, reproved him repeatedly for making his preference for Willie uncomfortably obvious to their other children. But on the evening of Oct. 3, 1863, the boy lay dead in a Memphis hotel room. Sherman would write the next day to Ulysses S. Grant that Willie was “the one I most prised [sic] on earth.” But Willie’s death was the tragic consequence of a series of decisions for which Sherman would blame himself the rest of his own life. Those decisions began in the aftermath of the long and grueling Vicksburg campaign, which ended in early July 1863. Soon after, Sherman encamped his XV Corps for a period of rest and refitting in an oak grove between the Big Black and Yazoo rivers, about 20 miles east of the former Confederate stronghold. The land, which Sherman had immediately found ideal, was owned by “old preacher Mr. Fox,” as Sherman put it in a letter to Ellen. Sherman was pleased to note that two months earlier, Fox had had over 50 slaves, but now they had run away and his house had been ransacked by Union soldiers. Fox and his family were thus forced to “appeal to us for the Soldier’s Ration.” Sherman also remarked, with the bitter jocularity he reserved especially for beaten rebels, that Fox had “17 children born to him lawfully & 11 still alive.” All through the late summer and early autumn, Sherman filled his letters home with expressions of deep satisfaction and even delight regarding his camp location. He declared in an Aug. 3 letter to his brother John that “we have lovely camps, plenty of grass, water and shade trees.” He bragged to a fellow general that he and his men “have beautiful camps. … I never saw better camps.” To his father-in-law, Thomas Ewing, he wrote that his camp “is in reality one of the best possible. It combines comfort, retirement, safety, and beauty.” He went so far as to tell his brother-in-law Philemon that in a fit of whimsy he had named the place “‘Polliwoggle Retreat,’ in honor of a horse pond, very convenient to our Camp and full of songster frogs.” Sherman also had more serious reasons to be pleased with the camp. Both armies had suffered terribly from disease during the Vicksburg campaign, and he was well aware that the risk of rampant infection was heightened during the summer months. Still, he was confident that he had picked a site free of these dangers. “I have no apprehension on the Score of health,” he wrote home on Aug. 13, “and the present condition of my command satisfies me on this score.” In another letter to his brother, he noted flatly that “here I fear not yellow fever or any other epidemic.” Because of the confidence he had in his location, and because he was unable to take a furlough home, Sherman violated his own policy against officers’ bringing their families into camp. He thought the practice contributed to laxity, but he decided in this case to send for Ellen and four of their six children, including his beloved Willie. The family joined him in late August. On Sept. 9 a contented Sherman wrote his brother about the arrangements he had made for them all. He and Ellen were together in adjoined hospital tents, with the children nearby in two other tents. “You would be surprised to see how well they get along,” he happily reported. “All are well and really have improved in health down here.” Unsurprisingly, in his memoirs Sherman records nothing about his other children’s experiences in camp, while he says a great deal about Willie’s. He remembered that his son “was well advanced for his years, and took the most intense interest in the affairs of the army.” A favorite of the 13th Regulars, the battalion assigned to guard Sherman’s headquarters, Willie was made an honorary sergeant in the unit, wore a specially made uniform and regularly attended its parades. Sherman would remember years after the war how much pleasure Willie and he took in horseback rides and in observing the drills and reviews of his troops. For a few weeks Sherman enjoyed life with Willie and the others, but that time ended in late September due to events in far-off southeastern Tennessee. After the Union defeat at Chickamauga, Sherman was ordered to take command of forces gathered in nearby Chattanooga. On Sept. 28, Sherman moved his headquarters and family to a riverboat at Vicksburg. When Willie that night complained of diarrhea, a regimental surgeon was sent for. He concluded that the boy was suffering from dysentery and malaria. Willie’s condition had worsened by the time the boat arrived in Memphis on Oct. 2. Sherman’s family took rooms at the Gayoso Hotel and another doctor was brought in. Typhoid fever was finally diagnosed, but nothing could be done to help Willie. “We were with him at the time,” Sherman wrote later, “and we all, helpless and overwhelmed, saw him die.” Ellen and the surviving children returned home to Ohio while Sherman tried to throw himself into his duties as a way to escape his grief, but his letters from this time are filled with terrible self-recrimination. Three days after Willie’s death, he wrote to Ellen that “I will always deplore my want of judgment in taking my family to so fatal a climate at so critical a period of the year.” On Oct. 14 he wrote again to say that he occasionally gave in to “the wish that some of those bullets that searched for my life at Vicksburg had been successful, that it might have removed the necessity for that fatal visit.” Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts, as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. Time did nothing to lessen Sherman’s self-blame. “The blow was a terrible one to us all,” he would write years later in his memoirs, “so sudden and so unexpected, that I could not help reproaching myself for having consented to his visit in that sickly region in the summer-time.” It’s striking that here Sherman seems to shift responsibility for Willie’s presence in Mississippi to an unnamed other, with Sherman merely “consenting” to his family’s joining him there. Willie haunted Sherman through the rest of the war. In 1864, during his assault on Atlanta and then the long march across Georgia to the sea, Sherman’s letters to his wife are filled with obsessive, endlessly searching discussions of their dead son. In particular, Sherman’s sorrow takes the form of wishing that Willie were able to rejoice in his father’s accomplishments. In late October 1864, for example, as plans for the devastating march across Georgia were being finalized, Sherman’s thoughts turned toward imagined praise from Willie: to be able to see Willie’s “full eyes dilate and brighten when he learned that his Papa was a great general would be to me now more grateful than the clamor of millions.” At the war’s end, on April 5, 1865, assured of his place in history from helping to vanquish the Confederacy, Sherman wished only that Willie “could hear & see — his proud little heart would swell to overflowing.” Sherman and Ellen had eight children, including three sons in addition to Willie, but none came close to replacing him in their father’s affections. One, Charles, was conceived during the ill-fated visit to Mississippi; he died of pneumonia at the age of 5 months, without Sherman’s ever seeing him. In his memoirs Sherman puts the child’s name in quotation marks, as if his son weren’t really a person to him. His youngest son Philemon’s achievements in law and business gave Sherman a small measure of satisfaction late in his life. Thomas Sherman was a source of conflict and rage for the general, rejecting his father’s dictate that he study law and opting for the priesthood instead. After long periods of mental instability, Thomas died in 1933 in a New Orleans nursing home. Sherman had close, loving relationships with his daughters, but even so, to the end of his life his heart remained really only Willie’s. The boy’s body had originally been buried in Sherman’s hometown of Lancaster, Ohio. In 1867 Sherman had it moved to St. Louis, where he and his family had taken residence after the war. On the occasion of his 70th birthday, less than a year before he died, Sherman instructed the St. Louis post of the Grand Army of the Republic as to where he wished to be buried. “Deposit my poor body in Calvary” Cemetery, the warrior father requested of his old army comrades, “alongside my faithful wife and idolized ‘SOLDIER BOY’.” Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Thomas Paine (or Pain; February 9, 1737 [O.S. January 29, 1736] - June 8, 1809) was an English-born American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary. One of the Founding Fathers of the United States, he authored the two most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution and inspired the rebels in 1776 to declare independence from Britain. His ideas reflected Enlightenment-era rhetoric of transnational human rights. Saul K. Padover described him as \\"a corsetmaker by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination\\". On the morning of June 8, 1809, Paine died at the age of 72 at 59 Grove Street in Greenwich Village, New York City Although the original building is no longer there, the present building has a plaque noting that Paine died at this location.  After his death, Paine's body was brought to New Rochelle, but the Quakers would not allow it to be buried in their graveyard as per his last will, so his remains were buried under a walnut tree on his farm. In 1819, the English agrarian radical journalist William Cobbett, who in 1793 had published a hostile continuation of Francis Oldys (George Chalmer)'s The Life of Thomas Paine, dug up his bones and transported them back to England with the intention to give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but this never came to pass. The bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died over twenty years later, but were later lost. There is no confirmed story about what happened to them after that, although various people have claimed throughout the years to own parts of Paine's remains, such as his skull and right hand.  At the time of his death, most American newspapers reprinted the obituary notice from the New York Evening Post that was in turn quoting from The American Citizen, which read in part: \\"He had lived long, did some good, and much harm\\". Only six mourners came to his funeral, two of whom were black, most likely freedmen. Many years later the writer and orator Robert G. Ingersoll wrote:  Thomas Paine had passed the legendary limit of life. One by one most of his old friends and acquaintances had deserted him. Maligned on every side, execrated, shunned and abhorred - his virtues denounced as vices - his services forgotten - his character blackened, he preserved the poise and balance of his soul. He was a victim of the people, but his convictions remained unshaken. He was still a soldier in the army of freedom, and still tried to enlighten and civilize those who were impatiently waiting for his death. Even those who loved their enemies hated him, their friend - the friend of the whole world - with all their hearts. On the 8th of June 1809, death came - Death, almost his only friend. At his funeral no pomp, no pageantry, no civic procession, no military display. In a carriage, a woman and her son who had lived on the bounty of the dead - on horseback, a Quaker, the humanity of whose heart dominated the creed of his head - and, following on foot, two negroes filled with gratitude - constituted the funeral cortege of Thomas Paine. when did paine die?","output":"Thomas Paine died on June 8, 1809.

The sentences can be classified as (a) SIMILAR - similar to each other, and (b) DISSIMILAR - not similar to each other. Sentences that have the same RDF relationship in terms of [subject, predicate, object] are similar to each other. The input is a list of two sentences and the output is either SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR. [\\"Alimentum is a Indian restaurant that has moderate pricing. It is located in the city centre.  The restaurant doesn't accept kids.\\", \\"There's an adult only Indian restaurant in the city centre called Alimentum.\\"]","output":"Step 1: Identify and extract the main components of both sentences in terms of [subject, predicate, object]. Sentence 1: 1. [Alimentum, is, Indian restaurant] 2. [it, has, moderate pricing] 3. [it, is located in, city centre] 4. [The restaurant, doesn't accept, kids] Sentence 2: 1. [an adult only Indian restaurant, is in, city centre] 2. [it, is called, Alimentum] Step 2: Compare the extracted components of both sentences. 1. Comparison of Sentence 1-1 and Sentence 2-2: [Alimentum, is, Indian restaurant] and [it, is called, Alimentum] refer to the same subject, Alimentum, but their predicate-object pairs (is-Indian restaurant, is called-Alimentum) are different. These components are partially similar. 2. Comparison of Sentence 1-3 and Sentence 2-1: [it, is located in, city centre] and [an adult only Indian restaurant, is in, city centre] have the same predicate-object pairs (is located in-city centre, is in-city centre). Their subjects (it, an adult only Indian restaurant) are also similar, as they refer to the same entity, Alimentum. These components can be considered similar. 3. Comparison of Sentence 1-4 and general information in Sentence 2: [The restaurant, doesn't accept, kids] and an implied restriction in Sentence 2 (adult only) convey the same information. Alimentum does not allow kids, making these components similar. Step 3: Evaluate the overall similarity of the sentences based on the comparisons. Since we have found that Sentence 1-1 and Sentence 2-2 are partially similar, Sentence 1-3 and Sentence 2-1 are similar, and Sentence 1-4 and general information in Sentence 2 are similar, the overall similarity between the two sentences is strong enough to classify them as SIMILAR."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a text based on \\"london shares dip at open\\" Text:","output":"Title: \\"London Shares Experience Decline at the Start of Trading Session\\" The London Stock Exchange started the trading session with a noticeable dip in shares, reflecting a somewhat cautious mood among investors. Market volatility and global economic concerns are contributing factors towards the downward trend in share prices. 1. Analyzing the market situation: The recent drop in share prices at the opening of the London Stock Exchange can be attributed to a myriad of factors including global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and investor sentiment. As we move through this trading session, it is essential to monitor potential triggers for further fluctuations in share prices and overall market movement. 2. Impact on investors: Investors have been understandably cautious due to the recent dip, resulting in conservative trading strategies. This drop in share prices has led to both long-term and short-term traders reevaluating their positions and making financial adjustments accordingly. 3. Influence of global factors: London shares are not immune to the effects of worldwide economic trends, such as interest rate decisions and geopolitical events. Consequently, investors must remain vigilant and informed about global developments that could potentially impact the markets. 4. Importance of diverse portfolios: In times of uncertainty and share price fluctuations, it is crucial for investors to maintain a well-diversified portfolio. By spreading investments across various sectors, geographies, and asset classes, they can minimize their overall risk exposure while maximizing potential returns. 5. Opportunity for value investors: While the recent drop in London shares may be concerning for some investors, it is essential to remember that temporary volatility can create attractive buying opportunities for value investors seeking undervalued stocks. In conclusion, despite a dip in share prices at the opening of the trading session, it remains crucial for investors to remain cautiously optimistic, make informed decisions, and adapt their strategies in response to market conditions. By maintaining a diverse and balanced investment portfolio, they can navigate these challenges and continue to seek growth opportunities in London's vibrant stock market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Before you decide the specifics of a party, like what to serve or who to invite, you'll need to choose a location for the party. If you're sticking to a budget, you'll want to find a venue that is either free or very low-cost. If you're throwing a relatively small party, you can host it at your home or in your backyard. If the party will be too big for your home or yard, try booking a picnic area in your local park. Regardless of where you decide to have the party, you'll want to decorate the venue. This will help customize the space, ideally to make it unique to your child's interests and hobbies. Rather than paying a professional decorator, you can find and display your own decorations at a relatively low cost.  Instead of tablecloths, you can buy a cheap roll of plain white paper and drape big sheets over the tabletops. Then leave crayons out for the kids to draw and doodle on the paper. It won't cost much, and it will add a fun element of creativity to the party.  Balloons are fairly cheap, even if you buy them with helium from the store.  Decorate the tables with small, low-cost party favors. You can leave a small bowl of individually-wrapped candy at the center of the table, or put out a small bushel of freshly-picked apples for guests to take home.  If your child wants a theme birthday party, you can make things simple by buying plates and napkins with that theme's design on them. You can also cut costs by buying balloons and napkins that are the color of your theme - for example, red and blue for a Spiderman party, or teal blue for a Frozen party. Another easy way to cut costs for the party is by making your own invitations. You can use recycled paper on hand, or for even greater savings per project, try sending out an e-vite to the party. You can find free templates and sample invitations online. Search for \\"party invitations\\" to find examples of easy party invitation templates. If you're trying to plan a party on a budget, the reality of the situation is that you may need to invite fewer people. Each extra kid who's invited will require additional food and drinks, plus any party favors or supplies for activities you have planned. If you're worried about hurt feelings from your child's peers, consider inviting only friends and classmates, rather than leaving the invitation open to siblings or other outside friends.  For infants, it's best to stick to family members and/or close friends. No two year old is going to remember how many people were at a party, and the smaller, more-intimate setting will make it feel more like a family get-together.  If the child is in preschool, a general rule for the number of other kids to invite is the child's age plus one. So, for example, if your child is three or four years old, invite four or five other kids from preschool.  For older kids, it's more a question of how many classmates your child is actually friends with, and how many people you can reasonably accommodate (in terms of space and cost). However, if you do invite several classmates, you'll want to avoid sending invitations to all but one or two kids, as this will alienate the uninvited kids and may cause tension. If your child's birthday falls around the same time as one of your other kids' birthdays (or a friend/classmate's birthday), consider combining the two parties into one bigger party. You'll then be able to split the cost of the party with the other parent (if it's a friend's birthday), or at least consolidate the costs instead of having two parties (for siblings). Ask around among your friends' parents to find out when their children's birthdays fall. You can bring up the idea of combining parties casually. Say something like, \\"Our child's birthday is only a short while before/after. Would you be interested in combining the two parties together and having one big party?\\" Just make sure the other parent isn't planning anything too extravagant that would break your budget. Summary:","output":"Before planning a party, choose a budget-friendly location, such as your home or a picnic area in a park. Save money by doing your own decorations, using low-cost items like paper tablecloths, balloons, and themed plates and napkins. Make your invitations or send e-vites to save on costs and consider inviting fewer people to keep the expenses manageable. When determining the number of guests, consider the child's age and social group. For infants and preschoolers, focus on family members and close friends, while for older kids, take into account actual friendships and space constraints. If your child's birthday coincides with a sibling or friend's, consider combining the parties to save on costs."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

(She does that quite often, throwing stuff around that is) And when I asked her what her problem was, she said, that she was having a talk with my younger brother (who was caught smoking weed, which she understandibly dislikes) and I was being too loud and the laughter irritated her. I asked her why she didn't ask like a normal person for me to be quiet first and her reply was:\\"because you always say you're busy but all you do is play games!\\" I replied angrily and said that saturday nights are the only time I actually have time to play games besides going to uni and working part-time. After I cleaned up the stuff on the floor, while getting berated I told her I'm done and slammed my door. She said she wasn't done and will cut the internet, to which I responded with:\\"Good, I don't care! I'm done playing anyways!\\" &amp;#x200B; Later when my father returned home he asked me to go downstairs to the living room and talk it out. I agreed under the condition that it will be a dialogue and not a monologue. But it turned out to be a monologue by my mother anyways. &amp;#x200B; There she kept going on that playing games only makes me a worse person, how it will affect my relationship with my GF, my grades at Uni and my work. It will also make me a more agressive person somehow. How I prioritize my friends over family and in general have a lack of respect for her authority. Why I can't have a better hobby. &amp;#x200B; I asked her what rational person would throw shit around in a fit of rage. - No answer. &amp;#x200B; I asked her how come my younger brother can stay out for days and be praised for joining a basketball club, while I get scolded when I started a gaming club/association (fighting games) with a friend. - \\"Atleast he is doing something to be active.\\" &amp;#x200B; I asked why she always thinks what I'm thinking and doesn't let me talk - \\"Because I know you.\\" &amp;#x200B; Fed up with her non-answers I said:\\"If you can't respect me as who I am how can you expect me to respect you?

She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap, and six romances under the name Mary Westmacott. In 1971 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature. Christie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, non-Europeans, and sometimes Americans, the last usually as impossibly naive or uninformed. For example, she described \\"Hebraic men with hook-noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\\" in the first editions of the collection The Mysterious Mr Quin (1930), in the short story \\"The Soul of the Croupier\\"; in later editions, the passage was edited to describe \\"sallow men\\" wearing same.  In The Hollow, published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \\"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake ... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \\"foreigners\\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (Hallowe'en Party) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in Three Act Tragedy), but they are rarely the culprits.  Often, she is affectionate or teasing with her prejudices. After four years of war-torn London, Christie hoped to return some day to Syria, which she described as \\"gentle fertile country and its simple people, who know how to laugh and how to enjoy life; who are idle and gay, and who have dignity, good manners, and a great sense of humour, and to whom death is not terrible.\\"  She had trouble with an incompetent Swiss French nursery helper (Marcelle) for toddler Rosalind, and as a result she decided, \\"Scottish preferred ... good with the young. The French were hopeless disciplinarians ... Germans good and methodical, but it was not German that I really wanted Rosalind to learn. The Irish were gay but made trouble in the house; the English were of all kinds\\". How did she depict foreigners?","output":"Agatha Christie sometimes depicted foreigners in her stories using stereotypes, which are simplified and fixed ideas about a group of people. For example, she described some characters with words that focused on their physical appearance or nationality. There were times when she showed foreigners as victims or good people, but there were also times when she used less kind descriptions based on common thoughts of that time. So, her depiction of foreigners included both positive and negative portrayals, and some of her ideas came from her own experiences with people from different places."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Carol Goodman is still alive.","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis \\"Carol Goodman is still alive\\" is true. The paragraph does not mention any specific dates or events that suggest otherwise. According to the text, Carol Goodman is currently serving as a creative writing professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz. The use of the term \\"currently\\" typically suggests that the described actions or roles are still being carried out in the present time. Furthermore, the paragraph refers to Carol Goodman in the present tense: \\"Carol Goodman… is an American professor and author of gothic fiction… Goodman currently serves as a creative writing professor…\\" Using the present tense signifies that the subject, Carol Goodman, is alive in the present time. If she had passed away, the paragraph would likely use the past tense and provide relevant information about her death. The information provided about the author does not indicate any definitive evidence that would refute the hypothesis. Additionally, it is common for public domain information to be updated following significant life events, such as passing away. The lack of such information further supports the assumption that the hypothesis is true, and Carol Goodman is still alive. In conclusion, while the paragraph does not directly state that Carol Goodman is alive, it implies so through its use of the present tense and current roles and activities cited.

Objective: twig Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"In order to provide a comprehensive answer, it's important to define each of the terms and understand their context.  Naive physics reasoning: Naive physics refers to the natural, common-sense understanding of the physical world that people have, without the in-depth scientific background of a physicist. Naive physics can be innately inaccurate, but it is useful for achieving common everyday tasks. Naive physics reasoning, therefore, refers to the use of this common-sense understanding to make judgments or decisions about the real world. Objective: twig: Since there is only a single-word objective mentioned and no specific context provided, we will assume it as a generic task to evaluate two potential solutions based on naive physics reasoning, and the objective contains a focus on a twig, which is a small, thin branch of a tree or a shrub. Now, let's consider two potential solutions and evaluate their soundness in terms of naive physics reasoning: Solution 1: Utilizing a twig as a structural support In this solution, the idea is to use a twig as a support element for building small and lightweight objects like a bird nest or as a support for a fragile plant. From a naive physics perspective, this may seem like a reasonable and sound solution. Twigs can offer a certain level of stability and flexibility, which are essential properties when supporting lightweight structures or objects. Additionally, twigs are readily available, easy to manipulate, and environmentally friendly. Solution 2: Using a twig to build a bridge for humans In this solution, the thought process is to construct a bridge for humans using twigs as primary structural components. From a naive physics viewpoint, this seems like an unsound solution. The small size, limited strength, and fragile nature of twigs make them unsuitable for carrying the weight of humans. Building a bridge using twigs would almost certainly result in the bridge collapsing, putting the safety of the people using the bridge at risk. Evaluation: Comparing the two solutions, the first appears to be more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. It successfully utilizes the properties of a twig to serve as a structural support for smaller, lighter objects or structures like bird nests or fragile plants. The second solution, on the other hand, is highly unsound as it lacks a proper understanding of the twig's structural limits and its inability to bear the weight of humans. In conclusion, although naive physics reasoning might not always lead to scientifically accurate solutions, in this case, Solution 1 demonstrates a better understanding of the properties and limitations of twigs when used for structural support purposes. Hence, it is considered more sound in the context of naive physics reasoning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Gobsmacked: Jamie O'Connell had to look twice after spotting the obscene hand gesture in the sky. The National Lottery's 'It Could Be You' advertising campaign was one of the most recognisable of its time, where a cloud formed the shape of a hand and pointed to an unsuspecting winner. The cloud's over Fort William in Scotland came up with their own take on the idea, when they formed the shape of a hand and made the sort of gesture that suggested its photographer, Jamie O'Connell, probably need not bother buying a ticket this week. Mr O’Connell was walking his dog along the Caledonian Canal near Neptune’s Staircase when the cloud well and truly gave him the finger. The 23-year-old had to look twice to make sure he wasn’t imagining the rude hand gesture. Mr O'Connell, an offshore steward, said: 'I was just walking the dog when I looked up and saw this cloud. 'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I had to double look at it, and I nearly wet myself. 'A lot of people have said it might be a sign - I must have annoyed someone!'

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (April 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) God and Lucifer are engaged in a war for the souls of humanity; a standing wager for the souls of all mankind. Angels and demons are forbidden to manifest on Earth, but they are allowed to possess and influence humans, and half-breeds are used to peddle influence. Exorcist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see angels and demons. At age 15, he committed suicide to escape his visions, but he was revived after spending two minutes in Hell, though John explains that since time moves differently in Hell 2 minutes feels like a full lifetime. Consequently, his soul is bound for Hell when he dies for the sin of taking his own life. John exorcises a girl possessed by a soldier demon trying to break through to Earth, something that should not be possible, as demons cannot take their true physical form on the mortal plane. John seeks an audience with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton). He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer; but Gabriel declines, telling John that his motives for exorcising demons are selfish and will not earn him entry into Heaven. After he leaves Gabriel, John repels an attack by a full demon out in the open. This encounter prompts him to meet with former witch doctor Papa Midnite (Djimon Hounsou) who informs him that all of Hell is waiting for him to die and that he is the one soul Lucifer would come to collect himself. There, John also encounters half-breed demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale). Midnite refuses to become involved, wanting to retain the balance between Heaven and Hell. John begins investigating the situation with his associates Beeman (Max Baker), Hennessy (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and Chas Kramer (Shia LaBeouf). Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) shows up at Constantine's apartment to ask for... My question: Where does John think isabel is? Answer:","output":"John Constantine initially thinks that Isabel, Detective Angela Dodson's twin sister, is in Hell. Isabel had apparently committed suicide, and since suicide is considered a mortal sin in Catholic belief, her soul would be destined for Hell. This is one of the main reasons Angela seeks John's help, as she believes her sister was a devout Catholic and would not have taken her own life, thus suspecting supernatural involvement. Throughout their investigation, John and Angela work together to uncover the truth behind Isabel's death and the forces at play in the battle for the souls of mankind."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since social interaction is necessary in order to succeed, it's important to learn how to cope with shyness and social anxiety. Consider working with a friend or a family member of close age to develop your social skills. It may not replace new social exchanges, but it's good practice.  Autistic teens and other disabilities/mental illnesses such as ADHD,  or social anxiety disorder, may have notable difficulty with social interaction. If you're an autistic teen, try learning how to develop better social skills, read other people's body language, and understand figurative language and sarcasm—it's important to learn how to interact in a neurotypical world.  If you have ADHD or related disorder, you can learn to not interrupt others, dominate the conversation, focus on the other person or task at hand, etc. towards those you don't know well. Every day, you'll likely see people you don't know, whether it be in school or out in public. It may seem funny to make fun of those that you don't know, but it's rude, and word will get back to them eventually. Later in life, you'll have to work with people you don't know; it's best to be polite towards strangers. If you can manage it, be friendly as well. It's appreciated by those around you, even if you don't see it.  If somebody you don't know has a clumsy moment that makes others laugh at them, such as dropping their books everywhere, don't laugh, and instead help them pick them up if you have the time. It's a nice thing to do, and they will likely appreciate it, even though they may not show it. . You don't need to be at the top of the social food chain and know everybody at school, but you should at least try to have a few loyal friends throughout your teenage years. Friendships are a good place to build your social skills, and building stable relationships with others can help you determine what you want in friendships and romantic relationships you may pursue.  And most importantly of all, life is simply easier and brighter with friends. Make sure your friends make you feel good about yourself and don't get you in trouble—you want to enjoy your teen years, not spend them miserable because of your \\"friends\\"!   Find friends who make you feel good and inspire you to be your best. Hang out with friends you really like, and worry less about maintaining relationships with people who don't improve your life. Friends come and go, and you may have different types and numbers of friends. That's okay. How many friends you have isn't important; it's the quality of the friends you do have that matters, as cliché as that sounds! If you struggle to find friends, try looking in areas where people are similar to you. Are you LGBT, for example? See if there's a teen LGBT group in your city, or if your school has a GSA that you could join. If you prefer writing over socializing, see if you can find writer's groups. If you're autistic, try seeking out other autistic people to befriend. Try going on social media if you can't find friends face-to-face. However, be very careful with this. Online friendships develop much differently than face-to-face friendships, and many people online are not who they say they are—you never know what goes on behind the screen. Sometimes it may not be even an actual human you are talking to. Exercise caution when making friends online, and never agree to meet up with somebody in private. Avoid giving out personal information to people you meet online unless you are sure that they can be trusted.  It is best to meet people in real life first before meeting them on the internet. Some—but not all—teens are interested in romantic relationships, and may want to find a partner. If you get into a relationship, take it slowly and communicate with your partner well. This leads to the healthiest relationships in the long run. You don't need to be tethered to your partner, either. Make sure the relationship allows the both of you to have your own friends and interests. You don't need to rush into anything before you're ready.  If your relationship ends, it's not the end of the world. You may be tempted to swear off of dating forever, especially if you were badly hurt, but keep an open mind. People grow and change. A relationship that would have worked six months ago may turn out to be extremely destructive now. And remember, few couples stay together during or after high school, whether it's because of long distance or other factors. Be wary of abusive relationships. If you feel like you have to constantly walk on eggshells around your partner to try and avoid them getting angry at you or hitting you, or if you can't talk to anybody else without your partner accusing you of cheating, these are huge red flags that the relationship is unhealthy and that you need to get out of it! The same applies for toxic friendships. Family members—especially parents—probably worry about you during your teenage years. Many teenagers become sullen, withdrawn, and stop valuing family as much as they used to. Try to avoid this. Family is one of the most important connections in your life—it's the building blocks for all relationships you develop, whether they're friendships, romantic relationships, or a family that you choose to have later on in life. And plus, you see them every day—why not make it nice to spend time with them?   You don't have to be best friends with everyone in your family, but be kind to them and spend time with them once in a while; play a video game with your sister, help your brother with his writing, offer to go on a walk with your mom, or play a board game with your dad. Don't just stay in your room all day and only see your family at meals. Improve your relationship with your siblings. It's fine to argue and bicker with siblings here and there, but remember that your sibling relationship is usually one of the longest in your life. Siblings can be great allies, mentors, and friends, not just now, but also when you're old and grey. Watch out for abusive family members. Your family can be some of the closest friends you have, but they can also negatively impact your life. If your parents constantly make you feel down, they may be emotionally abusing you. If your brother constantly hits you, that's a sign of physical abuse. Usually, talking things out with a close friend or confronting your abuser can lessen the hurt, but know when to report child abuse. Keep close to your extended family, such as your cousins, too; make an effort to spend time with them when you can. You probably don't see your extended family often, so take advantage of the time you do have to hang out with them!","output":"This article talks about how teenagers can improve their social skills, make good friends, have healthy relationships, and maintain strong connections with their family to have a happier life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Article: Long before the SXSW Interactive festival wrapped up on Tuesday, Meerkat was clearly the year’s breakout app — and in a mind-numbing, wall-to-wall way.      The live-streaming app, which lets iPhone-owners share real-time video directly from their phones to their Twitter feeds, is on the lips of even the most far-flung technorati. Since it launched on Feb. 27, Meerkat has attracted more than 120,000 users, more than half of those joining since the start of SXSW. (Type the name “Meerkat” into Twitter, and you’ll see dozens of middle-aged dudes bumbling around Austin.)      It is, as of this writing, the 27th most popular social app in the United States.      But Meerkat, far from a one-off tech-conference confection, is actually part of a growing cultural obsession with real-time streaming video. The medium isn’t new, of course — it’s long been beloved by everyone from space nerds to horny Euro-teens. But in the past six months, new and uniquely mobile apps, such as Meerkat, Stre.am and Periscope, which Twitter acquired in February, are betting that live, unfiltered video has more mainstream appeal. After all, more than 60 million people watch gamers live-stream video on Twitch each month, and Amazon shelled out a staggering 970 million for that platform last year.      At the time of the Twitch acquisition, skeptics and spectators wondered — what’s the point? Why would you watch someone play a game when you could actually play it yourself? Twitch’s founders argued that passively watching a video game could be its own form of entertainment, much like watching someone else cook or play football or build furniture. Meerkat and its ilk take that philosophy to its logical conclusions: not just games or sports or hobbies, but all of life as spectator sport.            Screenshots from several Meerkat videos that were live while I wrote this story. The best one is the live Siberian Husky cam (bottom left), obviously. (Meerkat)      Just consider the things people are Meerkatting thus far: a plane trip, a snowboard ride, the Apple Watch launch. Each of these things could already have been streamed in real-time to a small or static audience, or broadcast, after a time-delay, to a larger one. The difference between Meerkat and, say, YouTube or Livestream or FaceTime or Chatroulette, is that Meerkat merges all those elements — real-time video, mass social participation — into one immediate, participatory dervish. You can watch the event exactly as it happens and, via Twitter, interact with everyone else watching it.      It’s arguably the closest we’ve gotten to replicating the experience of physically being in another place, with other people … when you’re actually sitting at home in front of your computer.      “You basically have a tool to take your audience with you,” Meerkat’s founder, Ben Rubin, told USA Today. “The audience will … feel not just that they’re just consuming the content [but] that they’re participating in it.”      The idea that the entire Internet can go anywhere that one person with an iPhone can is, needless to say, pretty heady stuff. Hopefuls see applications in news, sports and entertainment; Meerkat’s already been used by the U.S. Department of Interior to share views of the Washington Monument, and by the BBC to stream protest footage from Ferguson. Enthused one tech reporter, “anyone can be the next CNN.”      But most Meerkat users won’t be the next CNN — nor will they aspire to. The app is still very new, of course, and usage will change with time, but early adopters have felt out the space in a largely personal way: on Tuesday, for instance, I watched a teenager monologue from his bedroom, a radio DJ record a show, and a commuter drive home from work. The fact that anyone even thought those activities might be interesting to a mass audience seems to speak to the specific cultural moment we’re living in: a moment when everything is instinctively recorded and published, and “oversharing” is a passe concept, and anyone’s “reality” can be a show.      It’s an abdication of privacy, and a presumption of self-importance, that could really only happen now — after years of “lifecasting” on Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and a thousand other platforms wore us down. It’s also indicative that, both in Meerkat’s marketing efforts and in early descriptions of the app, people tend to speak of how participatory and tangible and just-like-you’re-there the whole thing feels. It’s part of a subtle redefining of the concept of “experience” — from a thing you live, to a thing you merely digitally witness.      “Digital Witness” is, incidentally, the name of a 2014 song by singer-songwriter St. Vincent, recorded not far from the Austin stage where Meerkat recently found its fame. She seems to have understood Meerkat, or at least the Meerkat moment, long before any tech pundits did.      “If I can’t show it, if you can’t see me / What’s the point of doing anything?”      Liked that? Try these! ||||| For one glorious second, the iPhone app Meerkat (free) was the king of the mobile livestreaming kingdom. But it was a kingdom of one, and now that Twitter has unveiled its own livestreaming app called Periscope, Meerkat has been dethroned.      Meerkat (like Periscope) is currently iPhone-only, though an Android version is reportedly in the works. Getting started with the app couldn't be simpler: Just grab it from the App Store, fire it up and allow Meerkat to log in using the Twitter accounts you've already added to your phone. I wish every app made things this simple.      What You See      Once you're signed up, you can either start a stream immediately or schedule a stream for later. Both require you to write something brief about your stream, which will be turned into the Tweet that announces that you're broadcasting on Meerkat.      If you start streaming immediately, the link you send out goes live, showing off whatever happens to be in view of your iPhone's camera. If you decide to schedule a stream, Meerkat Tweets out an alert that the stream will start soon, and the link will show a countdown clock. It's a small touch, but it managed to make me excited about my own stream during testing.      You can see who is viewing your stream across the top of the app's screen, with messages sent to you by Meerkat viewers displayed along the side. I did notice, however, that the audience number seems not to distinguish between current viewers and those who have already left your stream. In my testing, Periscope did a much better job of keeping track of who was watching my streams in real time.      Along the bottom are buttons to toggle your front- and rear-facing cameras, stop the stream, and turn on the front-facing flash. This last feature will surely be put to good use in Blair Witch Project–style live streaming events.      When you're done sharing the view from your iOS device, Meerkat gives you the option to save your stream to the camera roll. That's a nice feature, since Meerkat doesn't save any of your footage on its site the way Periscope does; once the stream ends, it's gone forever. But that also means viewers can't save it through obvious means. A stream of any significant length will take up an equally significant amount of space on your phone, so save with caution.      In my testing, I used an iPhone 5c connected to a Wi-Fi network. Meerkat is supposed to work over cellular connections, though that wasn't succesful in my tests. Meerkat did not inform me that my stream over cellular was functionally inaccessible to viewers. It looked fine from my phone. Your mileage (and data costs) may vary.      What They See      Meerkat boasts that its streams can be viewed on any device, and that's more or less true. Your Twitter followers can click on the Meerkat link and view your stream in a browser—once they sign in with Twitter, that is. Lurkers who lack Twitter accounts aren't able to get in on the action. Anyone, Twitter user or not, can watch a Periscope stream in their browser.      Viewers on desktop computers can't interact with the stream: no messaging, no favoriting, and no following. In tests, video quality in my browser was adequate, and I'm happy to see that Meerkat has ditched the its weird fill-screen zoom and now presents exactly what the host sees on their phone. Sadly, Meerkat streams still appears stretched and greatly distorted in Firefox and Internet Explorer, as seen below.      Your Meerkat followers get a push notification when your stream goes live and can watch from within the Meerkat app. This is the best way to enjoy Meerkat streams, since app viewers can send messages to the host and see who else is watching. That said, it's a bit of a cluttered experience. There are also buttons for viewers to favorite and retweet streams. Yes, I did say \\"retweet.\\" All of these functions, even messaging, are mirrored in Twitter, so keep that in mind before you say something nasty.      I've mentioned Meerkat followers a few times already, and you might be wondering where these followers come from. The answer is Twitter. All your Meerkat-using Twitter friends appear in the app automatically. Adding or removing them takes just a few taps, but you won't get the chance to prune your list until after you start using the app.      This brings up one of the really strange aspects of Meerkat. Even though the app is tightly connected to Twitter, it's best enjoyed in its own app and not in your browser. But tapping a Meerkat link in the Twitter app will just launch a browser window. The only way to enter a Meerkat stream from within the app is to tap on a push notification. If you miss it, you'll have to wind through your recent notifications. If you delete the notification, you're out of luck. Since I first reviewed Meerkat, the developers have added a Live Now section to the main page, making it much easier to locate streams.      Periscope or Meerkat?      Meerkat succeeds at making it a snap to host a live stream from your phone. And the close integration with Twitter means that everything is easily accessible, assuming you're logged into Twitter, of course.      Recent updates have improved the overall Meerkat experience, and it deserves the credit. There is now, for example, a main menu that shows featured live streams. But Periscope has more polish, and can offer streams that were popular, but have concluded. Though Meerkat's interface, both in the browser and on the phone, has been refreshed, Periscope still feels fresher.      If livestreaming from your phone is something you must do, use Periscope. That said, Meerkat is worth keeping if only to tune in on livestreams you don't want to miss. But I don't think I'll watch any of those in the browser, if ever. ||||| Expand      Word out of this year’s SXSW Interactive is that all anyone could talk about was Meerkat. If you weren’t in Austin last weekend, Meerkat is a new app that allows users to easily livestream video from their cellphones onto their Twitter accounts. Much like Twitter, and Foursquare before it, Meerkat’s big debut had everyone in Silicon Valley proclaiming it the next big thing in social media. And the hype doesn’t seem to be overblown. The app has quickly racked up more than 100,000 downloads in just over two weeks.      Another sign of the imminent rise of Meerkat is that Twitter decided to remove Meerkat from its social graph. So while Meerkat users can still broadcast live videos on their Twitter feeds, a user’s followers will no longer get a notification when a new live stream begins, making it harder to know when to tune in. This move came shortly after Twitter purchased a similar app, Periscope. But the social graph ban only increased Meerkat’s draw—who wouldn’t want to root for the little app that could?      Why has the app infatuated so many? Because they see great potential in the ability to broadcast live video in real time. In the realm of news, the app opens up new avenues for user-generated journalism: no longer would viewers have to wait for cellphone videos to make their way online or on TV. BBC News has already “Meerkatted” (yes, that’s the term that’s caught on) this week’s Ferguson protests. In entertainment, Meerkat has already attracted a few high-profile names, including Jimmy Fallon, who streamed a monologue rehearsal, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who used it at SXSW. While it’s too soon to call Meerkat the next Snapchat, it seems it’s only a matter of time before everyone is Meerkatting from the front row during Fashion Week. ||||| . @danbalz just joined meerkat — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) March 19, 2015      So today, or maybe yesterday, is the day that Meerkat officially became the social media tool of the 2016 presidential election. The iPhone application, which allows Twitter users to stream live video footage to their followers, debuted at South By Southwest last week and has now firmly caught on with politicians and political reporters. It's not just the kids. Jeb Bush is meerkating. Dan Balz is meerkating. This is happening.      Dan Pfeiffer, the former senior Obama aide, was in Austin for South By Southwest this year and was quite smitten: \\"Everywhere I have gone here at South by Southwest... people are talking about Meerkat. And if that same discussion is not happening at every media outlet and presidential campaign around the country, they are making a huge mistake,\\" he wrote on Wednesday. \\"If 2004 was about Meetup, 2008 was about Facebook, and 2012 was about Twitter, 2016 is going to be about Meerkat (or something just like it).\\"      Pfeiffer lists four ways the new app will affect the political process:      1. This year’s “47 Percent Moment” will be on live video: Every minute — literally every minute — of every day of the campaign will be available live to anyone who wants it, no matter where they are. ... It allows people across the country to see events the way voters in New Hampshire and Iowa do, without the filter of TV networks deciding what events deserve their coverage. ... 2. The lines between TV and print reporter will be further blurred: The insatiable 24/7 appetite of cable news for punditry has already turned many print reporters into television stars. Meerkat will dramatically accelerate this trend. ... 3. Greater engagement opportunities for Millenials: Meerkat will give media outlets and the campaigns the ability to stream live content right to where Millennials like it most — their phones. ... 4. The Value of a Campaign’s Twitter Followers Just Went Way Up. @BarackObama has 56 million Twitter followers... Now, imagine that 10 percent of his followers join Meerkat in the coming months — that’s a potential audience of nearly 6 million people at any given time, more than the Sunday Shows or any cable news programming could dream of.      I mostly agree with Pfeiffer, though the 47 percent video was a bad example, as he later conceded. (Romney's staff would surely have alerted him to the fact that his remarks were being livestreamed.) I'm also not sure 2016 is really going to be \\"about Meerkat\\" the way 2012 was \\"about Twitter.\\" Meerkat is an enhancement to Twitter, it makes Twitter better, but Twitter is still the primary platform. Indeed, Twitter has its own live video feature and has been trying to cripple Meerkat's efforts, which is what Pfeiffer is alluding to when he wrote \\"Meerkat (or something just like it).\\"      But Pfeiffer is absolutely right about Meerkat's revolutionary potential. And if Dan Balz is already on this thing, you probably should be too. |||||Summary:","output":"Meerkat, a live-streaming app that enables iPhone users to share real-time videos directly from their phones to their Twitter feeds, has gained significant popularity since its launch in February 2015. Within this short period of time, it attracted over 120,000 users, with more than 60,000 joining since the beginning of the SXSW Interactive festival. Meerkat capitalizes on the growing cultural obsession with real-time video, and has started to become part of various real-life activities such as plane trips, snowboard rides, and even the Apple Watch launch, turning everyday events into mass spectator sports. The app's participatory dervish aims to replicate the experience of physically being in another place with other people, even when just sitting at home in front of a computer or phone screen. This innovative approach has changed the way people consume and experience content, potentially transforming the way people communicate on social media platforms. While Meerkat was incredibly popular initially, it faced stiff competition from Twitter's own live-streaming app, Periscope, which ultimately caused Meerkat to lose users and popularity. Despite this, Meerkat played a significant role in revolutionizing live-streaming on social media and changing the way people share their experiences online."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Build a movie plot around this: What kind of hotline does Sidney work for? Abused women","output":"Title: \\"Healing Hearts\\" Step 1: Establishing the setting and main character The story is set in a suburban town, where Sidney, a compassionate and determined woman in her early 30s, works for a hotline that supports abused women. Sidney's own past is scarred by her experience as a victim of abuse, and she has now devoted her life to helping others in similar situations. Step 2: Introducing the secondary characters Sidney works with a small team of dedicated colleagues, who each bring their unique strengths and inspiring stories to the hotline. Collectively, they create a supportive network for the callers. Among these colleagues is Adam, a charming young man who gradually develops romantic feelings towards Sidney. Step 3: Revealing the conflict One day, Sidney receives a call from a woman named Jenna, who is terrified and seeking help. Sidney quickly realizes that Jenna's abusive partner, Josh, is no ordinary antagonist; he is a notorious crime lord in the community with deep connections to the police force and local gangs. Sidney is faced with the tough decision of whether to involve herself in this dangerous situation or to prioritize her own safety. Step 4: Deepening relationship with the secondary characters While Sidney tries to help Jenna navigate her options, Adam becomes increasingly concerned for Sidney's wellbeing. As their relationship deepens, he encourages her to think about using her experience and skills to find a safer way to make a difference in the lives of abused women, such as starting a non-profit organization or a shelter for women in need. Step 5: Climax In a daring act of bravery, Sidney decides to gather evidence against Josh, which will not only protect Jenna but expose his criminal activities. Along with Adam and her colleagues, Sidney devises a plan to safely extricate Jenna from her dangerous situation and bring the evidence to the authorities. The team faces numerous challenges and close calls in the process, ultimately testing their courage and resolve. Step 6: Resolution Sidney and her team, along with the help of a few morally upright police officers, succeed in bringing Josh to justice and dismantling his criminal empire. Jenna is safely relocated to a new life, free from her abusive past. The town breathes a collective sigh of relief, and the hotline staff celebrate their victory. Sidney and Adam confess their feelings for each other and begin a relationship based on trust and love. Step 7: Conclusion Sidney and her colleagues decide to establish a non-profit organization that expands their work to reach more abused women in the community. They also work on building a shelter to provide a safe haven for women in need. The film ends on an uplifting note, showing Sidney's transformation from a victim to a hero who uses her strength and resilience to empower and protect other women."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Is Rachel amish? Movie title: Witness Movie plot: In 1984, in a Pennsylvania countryside, an Amish community attends the funeral of Jacob Lapp, who leaves behind a widow Rachel (McGillis) and an eight-year-old son Samuel (Haas). In her grief, she and Samuel travel by train to visit Rachel's sister, which takes them into the city of Philadelphia. Samuel is amazed by the sights in the big city. While waiting for a connecting train at the 30th Street Station, Samuel goes into the men's room and witnesses two men attack and murder a third (Carhart), narrowly escaping detection as he hides in the bathroom stalls. Detective John Book (Ford) is assigned to the case and he and his partner, Sergeant Elton Carter (Jennings), question Samuel. It turns out the victim was an undercover police officer. Samuel is unable to identify the lone perpetrator whose face he saw in the bathroom from a number of mug shots or a police lineup. However, as Samuel walks around the police station, he notices a newspaper clipping in a display case in which narcotics officer James McFee (Glover) is honored for his exemplary service in the line of duty. Book sees Samuel point to the picture and quickly covers over his hand. John remembers that McFee was previously responsible for a drug raid on expensive chemicals used to make amphetamines, but the evidence had mysteriously disappeared. John confides his suspicions to his superior officer, Chief Paul Schaeffer (Sommer), who advises John to keep the case secret so they can work out how to move forward. But John is later ambushed in a parking garage and badly wounded by McFee. Since only Schaeffer knew of John's suspicions, John realizes Schaeffer must have tipped McFee off, and is also corrupt. John calls Carter and orders him to remove the Lapp file from the records. He then hides his car and uses his sister's car to return Rachel and Samuel to Lancaster County. While attempting to return to the city, John passes out in the vehicle in front of their farm. Rachel argues that taking John to a hospital would allow the corrupt police officers...

Question: in what time period are there 83 synagogues? Context: During the Middle Ages, Paris was a center of Jewish learning with famous Talmudic scholars, such as Yechiel of Paris who took part in the Disputation of Paris between Christian and Jewish intellectuals. The Parisian Jewish community was victim of persecution, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the Holocaust during World War II, half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa Sephardic Jews settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today. There are currently 83 synagogues in the city; The Marais-quarter Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue, built in 1913 by architect Hector Guimard, is a Paris landmark.

Verses in the Bible Book of Leviticus Answer:","output":"Title: The Secrets of Leviticus Plot: Step 1: Introduce the protagonist Our protagonist, Sarah Collins, is a young journalist who has recently started her career in investigative journalism. She has a strong interest in uncovering the truth behind mysterious and unsolved cases. Step 2: Discover Harriet's diary While browsing through old archives at a local library for her next story, Sarah discovers a tattered, leather-bound diary belonging to a woman named Harriet Clark, who lived in the late 1800s. Sarah becomes enthralled by the diary, as it contains numerous references to numbers followed by abbreviations of the Bible's Book of Leviticus. Step 3: Investigate the verses Due to her curiosity, Sarah begins to research the referenced verses in Leviticus. Each verse showcases a cryptic message that alludes to a hidden truth about Harriet's life and the town's dark past. Sarah becomes determined to solve the mystery behind Harriet's diary and the relationship it has with these Leviticus verses. Step 4: Introduce a side character Sarah's investigation leads her to form an alliance with a local historian and professor, Dr. Alexander Whitmore, who has spent years researching the history of the town and is familiar with the legends surrounding Harriet Clark. Step 5: Discover the dark secret Together, Sarah and Dr. Whitmore uncover the town's dark past and its connection to Harriet's cryptic messages: Harriet was part of a secret religious cult that used Leviticus' verses to justify their twisted beliefs and rituals. Their actions resulted in the disappearance and deaths of numerous people, all of which were covered up by the town's influential members. Step 6: Expose the truth As Sarah and Dr. Whitmore dig deeper into the mystery, they realize that remnants of the cult still exist, and some of their descendants still hold power within the town. They become determined to expose the truth about Harriet's diary, the cult, and bring justice to those affected by their actions. Step 7: Confrontation and climax As Sarah and Dr. Whitmore get closer to unraveling the town's secrets, they are met with resistance from those who wish to keep the past buried. The climax of the movie occurs when Sarah and Dr. Whitmore confront the cult's leader, revealing their findings to the town and dismantling the web of lies that has protected the cult for generations. Step 8: Resolution In the aftermath of the confrontation, Sarah's reporting brings justice and closure to the families of the cult's victims. Her journalistic integrity and determination to uncover the truth prove to be powerful tools in restoring peace and normalcy to the town. Sarah and Dr. Whitmore develop a close friendship, and with their combined skillset, they continue to investigate and unveil the truth behind other mysteries. By unravelling the cryptic messages in Harriet's diary and linking them to the verses in Leviticus, Sarah not only uncovers the dark history of the town but also dismantles a secret cult that still operates in the shadows."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Pakistan Halts Execution of Shafqat Hussain, Who Was Convicted at 14 For the second time in as many years, Shafqat Hussain was told to prepare for execution. But growing outcry over the death sentence handed down to the then-14-year-old whose body still bears scars from torture may have earned Hussain a second last-minute reprieve. Hussain was arrested in 2004 at the age of 14, and convicted by a Pakistani anti-terrorism court of kidnapping and killing a child — charges later reduced to involuntary manslaughter. \\"He still carries burn marks on his body from where cigarette stubs were put out on him\\" Rights groups say that Hussain was innocent and that his \\"confession\\" came after nine days of torture by electrocutions, beatings and more. Even worse, they say, is that he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged crime which also was tried in an anti-terrorism court despite falling far short of traditional definitions of what constitutes terrorism. Hussain's inclusion on a list of \\"terrorists\\" is why his name came up last month when Pakistan lifted its unofficial six-year moratorium on the death penalty in response to a deadly Taliban attack in Peshawar that killed more than 140 children. His death warrant was issued Saturday and date with the gallows set for January 14. Hussain's family was told Monday to prepare for a \\"final meeting.\\" But hours later, Federal Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told parliament the execution would be halted pending an inquiry into concerns over the now 23-year-old's conviction, according to the Hussain's lawyers at the Justice Project Pakistan (JPP). Those concerns were flagged by numerous human-rights organizations incredulous over how Hussain's case was handled and how he came to be labeled a terrorist. Shafqat Hussain was born to a poor farmer in Pakistan's rural Azad Kashmir region. When his father suffered a stroke, Hussain's family was plunged further into poverty. Hussain's learning disability made school a struggle, according to JPP, which said that he decided to drop out and help support his parents and six siblings. Hussain went to Karachi and found work as a security guard at a building under construction. Some families had moved into parts of the building as construction moved along, and Hussain grew close to one family in particular — often playing with the children and even helping to babysit. When one of the children went missing, Hussain helped the family search and file a police report. Just over a month later, police came to arrest Hussain and charged him with kidnapping and murder. He was 14 years old. While Hussain confessed to the murder, he later told a court he had only done so under torture. \\"He still carries burn marks on his body from where cigarette stubs were put out on him, his genitals were electrocuted,\\" Shahab Siddiqi, head of communications for JPP, told NBC News. But the court did not investigate the validity of the confessions or torture allegations, and the teen's legal counsel never raised the issue of his age at the time of the alleged crime — despite the fact that Pakistan has ratified both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Both prohibit capital punishment of anyone who was under 18 at the time of an alleged offense, according to Human Rights Watch. The country's own Juvenile Justice Ordinance bears similar prohibitions. Hussain's case has cast a spotlight on the broad-brush approach to Pakistan's terrorism cases thanks to a vague definition. There are currently more than 17,000 pending terrorism cases, according to JPP, and crimes that could easily be handled under Pakistan's regular penal code — like kidnapping and murder — are regularly sent to courts set up to prosecute acts of terrorism, rights groups say. \\"The law is just so vague that anybody can use these courts to get speedy trials,\\" Siddiqi said. \\"The definition is being abused, the courts themselves are being abused.\\" With no links to any acts of terrorism or known terror organizations, JPP and other rights groups insist that Hussain's execution would be a mistake. \\"He's not a terrorist,\\" Siddiqi said. \\"He's a kid who was tried in front of the wrong court, who was too poor to afford counsel that would point out very, very basic flaws in the way he was tried,\\" Siddiqi said. Other human-rights organizations have urged Pakistan's government to change course again and reinstate the moratorium. \\"The massacre in Peshawar was a tragedy, but hasty symbolic executions of potentially innocent people would be a grave stain on Pakistan's justice system and do nothing to reduce the threat of terrorism,\\" said Maya Foa, director of U.K.-based Reprieve. Last year, Hussain's execution date was set for Aug. 25 and letters were sent to his family informing them to say their goodbyes. That stay of execution came just hours before he was due to hang. Despite Monday's announcement in Parliament about a stay, Karachi prison officials have not yet been formally instructed to halt Hussain's execution and are continuing to make the necessary preparations, according to JPP. \\"As far as prison authorities are concerned, they are still on schedule for the 14th,\\" Siddiqi said. \\"Until that notification comes to the prison authorities his life remains at risk.\\" While Hussain's lawyers are optimistic that will come soon, they also hope that their client will be cleared in the longterm and allowed to return home to his parents. They have not seen their son since he left home 10 years ago — and do not know about the execution order. \\"They're so old and so unwell that the family is concerned that if they're told they'll take a turn,\\" Siddiqi explained. \\"They just know he's in prison but they don't know about the death warrant.\\" First published January 6 2015, 6:28 AM What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article revolve around the case of Shafqat Hussain, who was arrested at the age of 14 in 2004 and convicted of kidnapping and killing a child by a Pakistani anti-terrorism court. The charges were later reduced to involuntary manslaughter. The key points highlighted in the article include: 1. Suspension of execution: The article discusses the suspension of Shafqat Hussain's execution for the second time due to growing public outcry and insistence from human rights groups that he was innocent. 2. Claims of torture: Rights groups argue that Hussain's \\"confession\\" came after nine days of torture, including electrocutions and beatings, and that he was a juvenile at the time. 3. Terrorism charges: The article questions why Hussain was charged as a terrorist and tried in an anti-terrorism court, pointing to a broad-brush approach in Pakistan's terrorism cases due to the vague definition of terrorism. 4. Juvenile justice violations: The case raises concerns about the violation of Pakistan's commitments to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, both of which prohibit capital punishment for anyone under the age of 18 at the time of their alleged offense. 5. Reinstating the moratorium on the death penalty: Human rights organizations call for the Pakistani government to reinstate the moratorium on the death penalty and argue that executing innocent people would do nothing to reduce the threat of terrorism. 6. Legal representation: It is argued that Hussain's case was severely impacted by the failure of his legal counsel to raise key issues, such as the allegations of torture and his age at the time of the alleged crime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kony 2012 video following its instant popularity- 82 million people have watched the film about the Ugandan war criminal - Mr Russell's public breakdown will likely cause more. problems for the controversial charity. Scroll down for video. Disturbed: Kony 2012 co-founder Jason Russell was caught having his public meltdown on camera. Well, hello: A confused onlooker watches as Russell proceeds to talk to himself about the devil and curse. TMZ released a close-range video of. Mr Russell pacing back and forth along a busy San Diego sidewalk,. shouting: 'You're the devil.' He is shown talking to himself, cursing, clapping and waving his hands. He was allegedly being held in a 5150. psychiatric ward in San Diego and should be released today. The Kony film has prompted a response from the Prime. Minister of Uganda, saying that the warlord at the heart of the video is. not in his country. Breakdown: Jason Russell was hospitalized for exhaustion after behaving bizarrely in the streets while naked. Naked meltdown: Kony 2012 video director Jason Russell caught acting strangely on the Streets on San Diego. Arrested: Jason Russell, director of the 'Kony 2012' video, was allegedly seen wandering the streets drunk. Adopting the social media strategies. that helped the charity, Invisible Children, create an internet. sensation with their Kony 2012 video, Ugandan prime minister Amama. Mbabazi said that the charity's video gives a 'false impression' and. that Joseph Kony is no longer in the country. 'The. Kony 2012 campaign fails to make one crucial point clear. Joseph Kony. is not in Uganda,' Mr Mbabazi said in a nine-minute video posted on. YouTube. The Prime Minister insisted that the Kony 2012 video did not represent the current situation in the east African nation. Mbabazi said Uganda was on Kony's trail but said they did not 'need a slick video on YouTube... to take notice.' Taking another page out of Invisible Children's playbook, Mr Mbabazi Tweeted his message at celebrities to attract attention. He wrote a very similar message to a. handful of stars: 'As PM of Uganda I invite you to visit the Pearl of. Africa & see the peace that exists in our wonderful country. #KonyisntinUganda'. Among the recipients were Rhianna, Stephen Colbert, Taylor Swift, Ryan Seacrest, Tim Tebow and Rush Limbaugh. Mr Russell, 33, was calm and. co-operative when apprehended by police, according to NBC San Diego, but. seemed to be under the influence of alcohol. Danica has denied that her husband has any substance abuse or drinking problems. The Prime Minister insisted that the Kony 2012 video did not represent the current situation in the east African nation and that Uganda was on Kony's trail but said they did not 'need a slick video on YouTube... to take notice. Spreading the word: Ugandan prime minister Amama Mbabasi Tweeted his message at celebrities. Although he was not charged with a. crime, officials decided that he should be committed to hospital for. medical treatment following the incident. 'During the evaluation we learned that we probably needed to take care of him,' a police spokesman said. 'So officers detained him and transferred him to a local medical facility for further evaluation and treatment.' Ben Keesey, chief executive of. Invisible Children, the charity set up in 2004 by Mr Russell and two. friends, issued a statement of support for his colleague. Campaigner: Mr Russell on a trip to Africa, where he was first inspired to set up the charity Invisible Children. 'Jason Russell was unfortunately. hospitalised yesterday suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and. malnutrition,' he said. 'The past two weeks have taken a. severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll. manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday. 'We will always love and support Jason, and we ask that you give his entire family privacy during this difficult time.' The charity, which aims to raise. awareness of the atrocities committed by the Lord's Resistance Army in. Uganda, sprang to worldwide fame last week after releasing an online. video entitled 'Kony 2012'. Activist: The campaigner giving an impassioned talk about his work. Target: Mr Russell's video is aimed at Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony. The 30-minute film, directed by Mr. Russell, documents the activities of LRA leader Joseph Kony, notorious. for his reign of terror in central Africa and particularly his use of. child soldiers. However, critics claim that the film over-simplifies a complex conflict and diverts attention from more pressing causes.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.  and the situation: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force.  Answer the following question: Which lever would have more friction, lever A or lever B? A:","output":"Lever B would have more friction, as it is a real world lever and must overcome some friction.

I decided to win the case with more money and little connection because the connection is insignificant. You see, my sweet little friend, sometimes grown-ups have to make choices about what they feel is more important. In this story, I felt having more money was important because I could use that money to do many helpful and useful things. Money can help us buy food, clothes, and toys. It can also help us take care of our family or friends when they need support. On the other hand, connection means being close to people and making friends.

While on a safari in Australia, Albert discovered two new species of live-bearing tetrapods. In the first species, species C, the females had long gestational periods. In the second species, species D, the females had short gestational periods.  Which species will have shorter living individuals?  Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. A:","output":"Based on Aristotle's rules relating to life-history features of live-bearing tetrapods, we can infer that species C would have a longer lifespan due to their longer gestational periods, compared to species D, which have shorter gestational periods.

Besides seating for Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds several times , she may have been painted by Philip Mercier , James Northcote and Richard Purcell , among others .","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially mean the same thing, but they have slight variations in wording and structure. Both sentences convey that the subject sat for portraits by Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds multiple times and that she may have also been painted by Philip Mercier, James Northcote, and Richard Purcell, among other artists. The primary difference between the two sentences lies in the phrasing and ordering of words, as outlined below: 1. In the first sentence, \\"sitting\\" is used, whereas, in the second sentence, \\"seating\\" is used. While both terms can be used in relation to posing for portraits, \\"sitting\\" is more commonly associated with this context. \\"Sitting\\" refers to the act of posing for an artist, while \\"seating\\" might imply that the subject is simply assigned a seat or put in a sitting position. 2. The first sentence mentions \\"Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds\\" – Hone's full name is not provided, which assumes that the reader already knows who Hone is. In the second sentence, the structure remains the same – \\"Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds\\" – and still does not provide Hone's full name or any additional context about him. This is not a significant difference, but it is worth noting that the subject’s identity remains unchanged in both sentences. 3. In the first sentence, the phrase \\"multiple times\\" is used to describe how often the subject sat for Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds. The second sentence uses the phrase \\"several times\\" for the same purpose. Both phrases essentially communicate the same meaning, namely that the subject posed for Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds on more than one occasion. The use of either \\"multiple\\" or \\"several\\" is likely a matter of individual style and preference. 4. Aside from some minor stylistic differences (such as the use of a comma before \\"and\\" in the list of additional artists in the first sentence), the rest of both sentences are identical. In both cases, it is suggested that the subject may have also been painted by Philip Mercier, James Northcote, and Richard Purcell, as well as other artists (indicated by the phrase \\"among others\\"). In conclusion, both sentences convey the same essential meaning: that the subject sat for portraits with Hone and Sir Joshua Reynolds multiple times and may have also been painted by other artists, including Philip Mercier, James Northcote, and Richard Purcell. The slight differences in phrasing and wording between the two sentences are mainly stylistic and do not significantly alter the overall message being conveyed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
