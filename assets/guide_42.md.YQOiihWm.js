The design features both symmetrical and asymmetrical elements, with repeating patterns and motifs. It is a beautiful and intricate example of Indian temple art and architecture."},{"instruction":"so what are we looking to? \\"triptych of circles\\". what about its fractal properties?","output":"A \\"triptych of circles\\" refers to a set of three circles arranged in a symmetrical composition. There are different ways to create a fractal pattern using circles. One common method is to use the Sierpinski triangle, which is a fractal pattern made of progressively smaller triangles. The Sierpinski triangle can be created by starting with a large equilateral triangle and removing smaller equilateral triangles from it. The process can be repeated on the remaining triangles to create a fractal pattern. Alternatively, circular fractals can be created using a similar process. Starting with a large circle, smaller circles or circular patterns can be removed to create a fractal pattern. The process can be repeated on the remaining circles to create a more intricate fractal design. Incorporating the 6-12-16 circular structure from your original description could potentially create a new fractal pattern within the triptych of circles, especially if the circles are arranged in a symmetrical and repeating pattern."},{"instruction":"interesting... it looks as there's a barely seen lines with a small circle and 8 edges around a the very center of that 6 round object circle.","output":"If there are barely seen lines with a small circle and 8 edges around the very center of the 6 round object circle in the image you are referring to, they could be part of the intricate design or pattern of the actual temple ceiling. The lines and shapes that make up the design are intended to create a visually complex and aesthetically pleasing pattern. It is common to find complex designs and patterns in Indian temple art and architecture, where they are used as a visual representation of religious or cultural ideas and beliefs. These intricate designs can also be seen as a form of sacred geometry, which uses geometric shapes and patterns to explore the mysteries and underlying principles of the universe."},{"instruction":"so, in that case we got here a 8-6-12-16 / 4 / 2 structure (excluding the first \\"8\\" a the very center)","output":"Based on your description, it seems that the structure you are referring to is a circular design with three circles containing 6, 12, and 16 round objects respectively. The structure is bisected by three circles around them, although it is not clear what the 8, 4, and 2 values are referring to.

Based on this expanded description, it seems that the circular structure you are referring to is a fractal pattern that expands from the center with each iteration. Starting with the 6 round objects at the center, each object has 4 edges that split into 2 when expanded once, which creates a total of 12 round objects in the second circle. From those 12 round objects, each one expands with 4 edges splitting into 2, which creates a total of 24 round objects in the third circle. This creates a progressive and iterative fractal design of 6-12-24 which grows from the center outwards. The expansion by 4 and 2 edges respectively represents the iterative growth of the pattern."},{"instruction":"from the first circle (expansion of edges): 6 * 4 * 2. the second and third iterations circle expansion has a similar properties but the starting points (round objects) are 12 and 16 for the third one.","output":"Thank you for the additional information. Based on this expanded description, the circular structure you are referring to can be represented as a fractal pattern, with each iteration of the pattern resulting in a multiplication of the number of round objects. The first circle has a starting point of 6 round objects, which are expanded to 24 (6 x 4 x 2) round objects. The second and third circles have the same properties, but with starting points of 12 and 16 round objects, respectively. The number of edges and splits in the expansion process can be seen as a representation of the iterative growth of the pattern, and the final structure can be viewed as a complex and visually stimulating fractal design."},{"instruction":"and how can you describe \\"the final structure\\" in your terms? what it reminds to you?: 6 x 4 x 2 + 12 x 4 x 2 + 16 x 4 x 2. (plus there's a small circle at the very center with 8 lines that looks as a clock)","output":"Based on the values you have provided, the final structure can be described as a complex and intricate fractal design, with multiple circles containing a total of 52 round objects (6 + 12 + 16 = 34; 34 x 4 x 2 = 136; 6 x 4 x 2 + 12 x 4 x 2 + 16 x 4 x 2 = 52). The repetitions and iterative growth of the pattern result in a visually stimulating design that can be seen as a representation of the principles of sacred geometry. The small circle at the very center with 8 lines that looks like a clock could be part of the overall design, potentially representing a symbolic or numerical meaning. It is common to see symbolic and numerological themes in Indian temple art and architecture, where they are used to explore philosophical or religious concepts. Without more information, it is difficult to determine what specifically the small circle and lines at the center may represent."},{"instruction":"maybe I forgot the comma here: 6 x 4 x 2 ,+ 12 x 4 x 2, + 16 x 4 x 2, which should determine a new circle iteration start.","output":"Thank you for the clarification. Adding commas in the equation does indicate a new circle iteration start, as you have suggested. Starting with the center circle, there are 6 round objects with each object containing 4 edges that split into 2, resulting in 24 round objects in the second circle. At the second iteration, the pattern repeats with a new circle of 12 round objects, each containing 4 edges that split into 2, resulting in 48 round objects in the third circle. At the third iteration, the pattern repeats again with a new circle of 16 round objects, each containing 4 edges that split into 2, resulting in 64 round objects in the fourth circle. Therefore, the final structure consists of four circles with a total of 102 round objects (6+24+12+48+16+64 = 170; 170 - 68 = 102). Including the small circle at the center with 8 lines that looks like a clock, the overall design could represent a complex and visually stimulating fractal pattern with underlying symbolic and/or numerological meanings."},{"instruction":"I would call it a curved arc objects, because they are not fully rounded and got attached to actual circles. it visually represent a real fractal-like design.","output":"Thank you for the clarification. It seems that the structure you are referring to is composed of curved arc objects attached to actual circles, which creates the impression of a fractal-like design. The visual complexity and repetition of the curved arc objects within the overall circular structure creates a sense of harmony and balance, which are common principles in Indian temple art and architecture. The fractal-like properties of the design can be seen as a representation of the natural order and underlying geometric principles of the universe."},{"instruction":"I just want to point out on the precision withlest this whole thing was made.","output":"Absolutely! The precision and attention to detail required to create such complex and intricate designs in Indian temple art and architecture is truly remarkable. It demonstrates the skill and mastery of the artists and craftsmen who created them, as well as their commitment to the ideals and beliefs of the culture they represented. The precision and symmetry of the design can also be seen as a reflection of the underlying harmonic principles of the universe that the design was meant to represent. All in all, the level of precision and attention to detail in this type of artwork is truly awe-inspiring."},{"instruction":"how old it actually is?","output":"The age of the Khajuraho temple in India, which features the ceiling design you mentioned earlier, is estimated to be between 950-1050 AD. The temple complex was built during the Chandela dynasty and is known for its magnificent architecture and intricate carvings and sculptures."},{"instruction":"how do they engraved it or stamped maybe?","output":"The exact methods used to create the intricate carvings and designs on the ceiling of Khajuraho temple are not fully understood, but it is known that the craftsmen used a combination of different techniques to achieve their desired effect. One possible method for creating the carvings and designs is through the use of hand-held chisels and hammers. This would involve carefully chipping away at the stone or carving the relief designs by hand in order to create the desired shapes and patterns. Another possible method is by using stamping tools to create impressions on the surface of the stone or metal. This technique has been used in other ancient cultures to create designs and patterns in metalwork and pottery, and it is possible that it was also used in the creation of the Khajuraho ceiling design. Regardless of the exact methods used, it is clear that the craftsmen who created the intricate designs and carvings on the Khajuraho temple ceiling had a high level of skill and artistic ability. The result is a work of art that is both beautiful and sacred, representing the cultural and religious values of the time it was created."},{"instruction":"because you can achive such level of precision only by using some stamping technique or some laser engraving projection aparatus in ancient times...","output":"It is true that achieving the level of precision seen in the carvings and designs of the Khajuraho temple ceiling with hand chisels and hammers would have been extremely difficult. However, there are different techniques and tools that could have been used to achieve the level of precision and detail seen in the designs. One possibility is the use of tracing tools and templates to outline the designs before carving them. This would involve using compasses, straight-edges, and other instruments to create precise templates of the patterns to be carved. The templates could then be transferred onto the stone or metal surface to guide the carving process. Alternatively, stamping tools and dies could have been created to achieve the desired pattern. These tools would have been carefully crafted by skilled metalworkers to create the correct shape and detail in the design. The stamps could then be used to create impressions or raised relief designs on the surface of the stone or metal. Overall, the precision and accuracy achieved in the Khajuraho temple ceiling designs were likely the result of a combination of different techniques and tools, as well as the high level of skill and artistry of the craftsmen who created them."},{"instruction":"or some laser engraving projection aparatus in ancient times…","output":"It is highly unlikely that laser engraving projection apparatus was used in ancient times, as the invention and development of lasers is a relatively modern technological advancement. Laser engraving is a high-precision technique that uses computer-guided lasers to create designs on a variety of materials. The use of laser engraving would have been impossible in ancient times when such technology did not exist. However, it is possible that a similar technique using mirrors and lenses could have been used to create precise designs and patterns on the ceiling of the Khajuraho temple. The technique is called \\"camera obscura\\", which is an optical device that projects an image of its surroundings onto a screen. The device could have been used to project a precise image of the desired pattern onto the surface of the stone or metal, which the craftsmen could then trace and carve. Regardless of the specific method used, the precision and artistic excellence demonstrated in the Khajuraho temple ceiling designs are a testament to the high level of skill and expertise that ancient craftsmen possessed."},{"instruction":"interesting, and from which point in known history they first used this “camera obscura” projection method?","output":"The origins of the camera obscura technique are not entirely clear, as the concept of projecting images through small holes or lenses has been known since ancient times. The Greek philosopher Aristotle mentioned something similar to camera obscura in his writing \\"Problemata\\", where he noted that if one looks through a small hole at the sun, trees, buildings, and other objects will appear upside down on the surface opposite the hole. However, it wasn't until later centuries that the camera obscura was used as a tool for artists and scientists. Leonardo da Vinci was known to have used the camera obscura in his work, describing it in his notebooks and using it to study perspective and light. During the 17th century, the camera obscura became widely used by artists as a tool for sketching and painting, while also being used by scientists to study the properties of light and optics. Overall, the use of the camera obscura technique has a long history and has been utilized in various ways for centuries."},{"instruction":"so, it's a simple prism effect kaleidoscope-like projection you can point to anything for guidelines or scheme.","output":"The camera obscura technique is similar to a simple prism effect kaleidoscope-like projection, where an image of the outside world is projected onto a screen or surface through a small hole or lens. The image can be projected onto a surface for use as a guideline or scheme, providing a precise and accurate representation of the desired design or pattern. While the camera obscura technique may seem simple, it requires a high level of precision and skill to use effectively. The size and shape of the hole or lens used in the camera obscura can affect the clarity and accuracy of the projected image, making it important to choose the right size and materials. Additionally, the use of mirrors and lenses can increase the level of complexity and precision required, but also allows for more intricate and detailed projections."},{"instruction":"maybe they even used some \\"cristaline books\\" from which they projected all the sacred designs schematics?","output":"It is possible that the ancient craftsmen who created the intricate designs and carvings on the Khajuraho temple ceiling could have used crystal or glass books or tablets to create their designs. However, there is no evidence to suggest that such books were used specifically in this context. Crystal or glass tablets have been used throughout history for a variety of purposes, including religious and spiritual practices. Some cultures believed that they held special powers or knowledge, and they were often used for divination or as an aid to meditation and prayer. However, the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work is not well documented. It seems more likely that the craftsmen who created the designs on the Khajuraho temple ceiling would have used a combination of various techniques and tools to achieve the desired effect, including the use of templates, tracing tools, stamps and dies, and/or the camera obscura technique. These traditional methods were able to achieve a high level of precision and accuracy, enabling the craftsmen to create complex and detailed designs that still impress viewers today."},{"instruction":"\\"the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work is not well documented.\\". maybe because it's a secret hidden by the time in stones?","output":"It is possible that the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work was used by ancient craftsmen and has simply not been well-documented or preserved over time. However, without any evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to say for sure whether or not they were used. While it is true that some knowledge and technologies from the past have been lost or obscured by time, it is important to approach their use with a degree of skepticism until proper evidence can be found to support their existence. In the case of the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work, there is no conclusive evidence at present to indicate that such a practice existed. It is possible that craftsmen in ancient times had access to knowledge and techniques that have been lost to us today, but we can only speculate until further evidence becomes available."},{"instruction":"what about the planes? what this number 8 can represent in the very center? how many \\"planes\\" there in mandalism?","output":"In the context of mandalas, the number 8 can have various meanings and associations depending on the culture or tradition in question.

Discuss the broader implications and insights gained from analyzing and comparing these developmental trajectories Total word count: 1,100-1,400 words To this effect, i have written the following Exploring the Development of Matilda and Personal Growth Experiences I. Introduction “Matilda” is a captivating movie adapted from Roald Dahl’s novel that centres around the life of a young prodigy, Matilda Wormwood, who uses her intellect, wit, and eventually telekinetic powers to navigate various challenges and obstacles throughout her formative years. As a Nigerian living in the diaspora, this movie holds a special significance for me due to its depiction of a resilient child in an unfamiliar environment, much like the cultural contrast I have experienced living and studying in a foreign land. This paper aims to explore Matilda’s character development using two prominent developmental theories: constructivist and maturationist. By analysing her growth and experiences throughout the film, I hope to gain insight into the factors that shape her unique persona. Additionally, I will compare and contrast Matilda’s development with my own personal experiences in order to examine the broader implications and understanding of these theories. II. Background and Context “Matilda” tells the story of an extraordinarily intelligent and gifted child who struggles to find her place in an abusive and unsupportive family. Her parents, Harry and Zinnia Wormwood, fail to recognise her potential and intellectual needs, instead belittling her abilities and stunting her growth. As Matilda starts attending school, she encounters further adversity in the form of her devious principal, Miss Trunchbull. Despite these negative influences, Matilda manages to form supportive relationships with her compassionate teacher, Miss Honey, and several classmates. As the story unfolds, she learns to utilise her telekinetic abilities and sly resourcefulness to overcome her obstacles and, ultimately, improve her life. In stark contrast, my own upbringing as a Nigerian in the diaspora involved a loving, supportive family that nurtured my growth and academic pursuits. Although I was exposed to different challenges, such as adapting to a new culture and being away from my home country, my experiences were vastly different from Matilda’s. Understanding our divergent developmental journeys will aid in revealing the extent to which the constructivist and maturationist theories may explain our character development. III. Analysing Matilda’s development using the Constructivist theory The constructivist theory posits that individuals actively construct their understanding and knowledge of the world through experience and reflection. It emphasises the significance of both social and cognitive processes in shaping an individual’s learning and development. In the case of Matilda, her character development can be analysed through the lens of constructivism, showcasing the different ways her experiences and interactions with others influence her personal growth. One clear illustration of the constructivist theory at work is Matilda’s voracious appetite for reading. Despite her parents’ ignorance and lack of intellectual stimulation, she teaches herself to read and visits the library regularly, immersing herself in numerous literary works. This independent learning demonstrates Matilda’s ability to actively construct her understanding of the world through exploration and personal discovery. Another example of the constructivist theory evident in Matilda’s development is her interaction with her empathetic and nurturing teacher, Miss Honey. Through this supportive relationship, Matilda’s capacity for learning and growth is significantly fostered. Miss Honey provides the encouragement and guidance that Matilda lacks at home, allowing her to better understand her own abilities and develop her self-efficacy. Furthermore, Matilda’s strategic use of her telekinetic powers showcases her adaptability and progressive understanding of her own capabilities. As she navigates her hostile environment, Matilda learns to leverage her powers to overcome obstacles and challenge authority, ultimately transforming her own life and the lives of those around her. These experiences illustrate the crucial role of continuous learning and adaptation in shaping her development, as underscored by constructivist theory. IV. Analysing Matilda’s development using the Maturationist theory The maturationist theory posits that growth and development are primarily dictated by an individual’s innate biological timeline, irrespective of external factors or environmental stimuli. It emphasises the role of heredity and genetics in influencing an individual’s developmental trajectory. When analysing Matilda’s character development through the lens of the maturationist theory, we can identify aspects of her growth that appear to stem from natural progression rather than environmental influences. Matilda’s prodigious intellect and early language acquisition, for instance, may be attributed to genetic predisposition. Her remarkable cognitive abilities become evident even before she starts school, suggesting that her innate intelligence is not solely a product of her interaction with the environment. Thus, her mental development may be partly explained by the maturationist theory, which emphasises the role of inherited traits in shaping her exceptional cognition. Similarly, the emergence of Matilda’s telekinetic powers can be viewed as a manifestation of maturation. These abilities appear to be unique to her and independent of any external factors or learned behaviours, pointing towards a pre-determined biological development. Though she eventually learns to control and refine her powers through practise, the innate nature of these abilities underscores the influence of maturation on her character development. In conclusion, while the constructivist theory highlights the impact of Matilda’s experiences and continuous learning on her growth, the maturationist theory emphasises her innate capabilities and predispositions. By examining her development through both of these theoretical lenses, we can better understand the multifaceted nature of her character and the complex interplay between her environment and her inherent traits. Now, With as much details as possible, generate the “Comparison and contrast with your own development” and “Conclusion” sections in the best possible way worthy of a post-doctorate publishing.","output":"V. Comparison and contrast with your own development A. Identify events and experiences in your own life that reflect similarities and differences with Matilda’s development As a Nigerian living and studying in the diaspora, my personal experiences differ from those of Matilda in several ways. Unlike her abusive and unsupportive home environment, I was fortunate enough to have a loving and nurturing family that prioritised my education and provided for my needs. This allowed me to focus on my academic pursuits and develop my own interests and passions in a secure and supportive environment. One similarity between Matilda’s and my own experiences, however, is the pursuit of knowledge and intellectual growth. Like Matilda, I too have a thirst for knowledge and have always been eager to learn and engage with new ideas. While Matilda turned to reading as a means of exploration and discovery, I turned to my studies and research to expand my understanding of the world. This shared experience highlights the impact of personal motivation and curiosity on driving intellectual growth. B. Analyze the impact of these events on your own overall development The supportive and nurturing environment in which I grew up played a significant role in shaping my overall development. Being raised in a family that valued education and personal growth instilled in me a strong sense of discipline and motivation, which has carried over into my academic and professional pursuits. Moreover, like Matilda, I have faced challenges and obstacles throughout my journey. The experience of adapting to a new culture and living away from my home country presented unique challenges that required me to be resilient and adaptable. Through these experiences, I developed a sense of independence and self-reliance, which helped me to navigate difficult situations and overcome obstacles in my personal and professional life. C. Explain how each theory (Constructivist and Maturationist) can be applied to your own development, comparing and contrasting with Matilda’s development The constructivist theory applies to my own development in that I actively sought out opportunities for personal growth and expansion of my knowledge and understanding. Through my studies, research, and engagement with diverse perspectives, I have continuously constructed my own understanding of the world. However, unlike Matilda, my intellectual development was primarily shaped by external influences and support from my family and community. The maturationist theory, on the other hand, may be less applicable to my own development. While genetics and innate abilities may have played some role in shaping my cognitive development, the impact of environmental factors and external influences is far more pronounced in my own journey. This highlights the limitations of purely biological determinism in understanding human development, as personal experiences and environmental factors play a significant role in shaping one’s overall development. VI. Conclusion A. Summarize your analysis of Matilda’s development using the Constructivist and Maturationist theories The analysis of Matilda’s character development through the lens of constructivism highlights the importance of personal discovery and continuous learning in shaping one’s growth and development. Her interaction with supportive individuals, such as her teacher Miss Honey, exemplify the impact of social processes on personal growth and development. Furthermore, the maturationist theory emphasises the role of innate abilities and genetic predispositions in shaping her exceptional cognitive abilities, as well as her unique telekinetic powers. B. Reflect on the similarities and differences between Matilda’s development and your own Despite the differences in our experiences, Matilda and I share a similar thirst for knowledge and intellectual growth. While her environment presented significant obstacles that she had to overcome, my own environment was characterized by support and encouragement from family and community. These differences highlight the profound impact of external influences on personal development and growth. C. Discuss the broader implications and insights gained from analyzing and comparing these developmental trajectories The analysis of Matilda’s character development and my own provides insight into the complex interplay between nature and nurture in shaping human development. While both constructivist and maturationist theories provide useful frameworks for understanding human development, the limitations of purely biological determinism are evident in the analysis of my own development. The insights gained from this analysis provide a better understanding of the multifaceted nature of human development and the importance of environmental influences on personal growth and development."},{"instruction":"8k photo of a bride in an off-the-shoulder short white silk dressing gown in high heels being inspected at an African cattle market.","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have access to pictures or images.

Discuss the broader implications and insights gained from analyzing and comparing these developmental trajectories Total word count: 1,100-1,400 words To this effect, i have written the following Exploring the Development of Matilda and Personal Growth Experiences I. Introduction “Matilda” is a captivating movie adapted from Roald Dahl’s novel that centres around the life of a young prodigy, Matilda Wormwood, who uses her intellect, wit, and eventually telekinetic powers to navigate various challenges and obstacles throughout her formative years. As a Nigerian living in the diaspora, this movie holds a special significance for me due to its depiction of a resilient child in an unfamiliar environment, much like the cultural contrast I have experienced living and studying in a foreign land. This paper aims to explore Matilda’s character development using two prominent developmental theories: constructivist and maturationist. By analysing her growth and experiences throughout the film, I hope to gain insight into the factors that shape her unique persona. Additionally, I will compare and contrast Matilda’s development with my own personal experiences in order to examine the broader implications and understanding of these theories. II. Background and Context “Matilda” tells the story of an extraordinarily intelligent and gifted child who struggles to find her place in an abusive and unsupportive family. Her parents, Harry and Zinnia Wormwood, fail to recognise her potential and intellectual needs, instead belittling her abilities and stunting her growth. As Matilda starts attending school, she encounters further adversity in the form of her devious principal, Miss Trunchbull. Despite these negative influences, Matilda manages to form supportive relationships with her compassionate teacher, Miss Honey, and several classmates. As the story unfolds, she learns to utilise her telekinetic abilities and sly resourcefulness to overcome her obstacles and, ultimately, improve her life. In stark contrast, my own upbringing as a Nigerian in the diaspora involved a loving, supportive family that nurtured my growth and academic pursuits. Although I was exposed to different challenges, such as adapting to a new culture and being away from my home country, my experiences were vastly different from Matilda’s. Understanding our divergent developmental journeys will aid in revealing the extent to which the constructivist and maturationist theories may explain our character development. III. Analysing Matilda’s development using the Constructivist theory The constructivist theory posits that individuals actively construct their understanding and knowledge of the world through experience and reflection. It emphasises the significance of both social and cognitive processes in shaping an individual’s learning and development. In the case of Matilda, her character development can be analysed through the lens of constructivism, showcasing the different ways her experiences and interactions with others influence her personal growth. One clear illustration of the constructivist theory at work is Matilda’s voracious appetite for reading. Despite her parents’ ignorance and lack of intellectual stimulation, she teaches herself to read and visits the library regularly, immersing herself in numerous literary works. This independent learning demonstrates Matilda’s ability to actively construct her understanding of the world through exploration and personal discovery. Another example of the constructivist theory evident in Matilda’s development is her interaction with her empathetic and nurturing teacher, Miss Honey. Through this supportive relationship, Matilda’s capacity for learning and growth is significantly fostered. Miss Honey provides the encouragement and guidance that Matilda lacks at home, allowing her to better understand her own abilities and develop her self-efficacy. Furthermore, Matilda’s strategic use of her telekinetic powers showcases her adaptability and progressive understanding of her own capabilities. As she navigates her hostile environment, Matilda learns to leverage her powers to overcome obstacles and challenge authority, ultimately transforming her own life and the lives of those around her. These experiences illustrate the crucial role of continuous learning and adaptation in shaping her development, as underscored by constructivist theory. IV. Analysing Matilda’s development using the Maturationist theory The maturationist theory posits that growth and development are primarily dictated by an individual’s innate biological timeline, irrespective of external factors or environmental stimuli. It emphasises the role of heredity and genetics in influencing an individual’s developmental trajectory. When analysing Matilda’s character development through the lens of the maturationist theory, we can identify aspects of her growth that appear to stem from natural progression rather than environmental influences. Matilda’s prodigious intellect and early language acquisition, for instance, may be attributed to genetic predisposition. Her remarkable cognitive abilities become evident even before she starts school, suggesting that her innate intelligence is not solely a product of her interaction with the environment. Thus, her mental development may be partly explained by the maturationist theory, which emphasises the role of inherited traits in shaping her exceptional cognition. Similarly, the emergence of Matilda’s telekinetic powers can be viewed as a manifestation of maturation. These abilities appear to be unique to her and independent of any external factors or learned behaviours, pointing towards a pre-determined biological development. Though she eventually learns to control and refine her powers through practise, the innate nature of these abilities underscores the influence of maturation on her character development. In conclusion, while the constructivist theory highlights the impact of Matilda’s experiences and continuous learning on her growth, the maturationist theory emphasises her innate capabilities and predispositions. By examining her development through both of these theoretical lenses, we can better understand the multifaceted nature of her character and the complex interplay between her environment and her inherent traits. Now, With as much details as possible, generate the “Comparison and contrast with your own development” and “Conclusion” sections in the best possible way worthy of a post-doctorate publishing.","output":"V. Comparison and Contrast with My Own Development In comparing my own personal development to that of Matilda, several similarities and differences emerge, shedding light on the applicability of the constructivist and maturationist theories to our respective experiences. Although our upbringing and environmental background differ significantly, both of us faced unique challenges and obstacles that, in turn, shaped our character development and personal growth. As a Nigerian living in the diaspora, I, like Matilda, encountered a variety of cultural and social experiences that greatly influenced my development. For instance, adapting to a new culture and navigating the complexities of a foreign educational system required a high degree of adaptability and resilience. These experiences align with the constructivist theory, which emphasizes the role of active learning and adaptation in shaping an individual’s character. Through continuous self-reflection and learning from others in my environment, I managed to develop a strong sense of identity and self-confidence, allowing me to prosper in my new surroundings. However, unlike Matilda, my personal development benefited from a nurturing family environment that supported my academic pursuits and encouraged the development of my interpersonal skills. This positive influence provided me with a strong foundation for personal growth and inspired me to excel academically, highlighting the importance of supportive relationships in shaping an individual’s development as emphasized by the constructivist theory. On the other hand, the maturationist theory can also be applied to my own development. As with Matilda, I exhibit traits and abilities that stem from my genetics and heredity, such as my aptitude for language learning and problem-solving. These innate abilities have significantly contributed to my overall development and success in various aspects of my life, from academics to interpersonal relationships. In conclusion, by comparing our personal experiences, it becomes apparent that both constructivist and maturationist theories can provide insight into the unique developmental trajectories of individuals like myself and Matilda. While the specific experiences and environments may vary, the combination of both innate abilities and environmental influences undoubtedly shapes our character development and ability to navigate life's challenges. VI. Conclusion This paper has provided a comprehensive analysis of Matilda's character development using the constructivist and maturationist theories, highlighting the complex interplay between her environmental experiences and her innate traits. Through a comparison of her experiences with my own personal development, we have gained a deeper understanding of how these theories can inform our understanding of human development. By examining the similarities and differences between Matilda's development and my own, we have illustrated the need for a holistic approach to understanding an individual's developmental trajectory. As our experiences demonstrate, neither the constructivist nor the maturationist theory alone can fully capture the multiple factors that shape a person's character and abilities. Rather, it is essential to consider the intricate interplay between environmental factors, social relationships, and innate predispositions in order to fully appreciate the rich tapestry of human development. Ultimately, this analysis offers valuable insights and broadens our understanding of the complex nature of character development, emphasizing the necessity to consider both the constructivist and maturationist theories when examining individual growth. By integrating these perspectives, we can more effectively foster personal growth and understanding, creating an environment in which individuals like Matilda and myself can thrive, despite the various challenges and obstacles that we may encounter throughout our lives."},{"instruction":"Extrae del siguiente texto las entidades mencionadas tales como nombres de personas, oranizaciones, empresas, lugares, fechas, documentos, cantidades: \\"La presentación será mañana.\\" Devuelve la respuesta en un formato JSON y utiliza el siguiente esquema: { \\"people\\": [], \\"organizations\\": [], \\"places\\": [], \\"dates\\": [], \\"documents\\": [], \\"quantities\\": [] }","output":"{ \\"people\\": [], \\"organizations\\": [], \\"places\\": [], \\"dates\\": [\\"mañana\\"], \\"documents\\": [], \\"quantities\\": [] }"},{"instruction":"Хочу сделать викторину для детей, чтобы они по названию мультфильма выбрали правильный ответ из трёх кадров разных мультфильмов.

I’d love to see it, SpongeBob!” SpongeBob swims out into the open and eats a magic seaweed, and suddenly, he transforms into a human. Salty: (gasping) “Wow, SpongeBob! You look so different! You’re so tall and...oh, my.” Salty freezes as she looks at SpongeBob, who is now blushing as he looks at her. SpongeBob: (nervously) “Do you think I look okay, Salty?” Salty: (flustered) “Y-yes, SpongeBob. You look amazing.” As Salty looks at SpongeBob, her eyes turn into hearts. She can’t believe how handsome he looks as a human. She comes closer to him and leans in for a kiss. SpongeBob is surprised, but he loves the feeling of her lips against his. SpongeBob: (in awe) “Wow, Salty. That was...amazing.” Salty: (smiling) “I couldn’t resist, SpongeBob. You look so handsome as a human.” SpongeBob: (grinning) “Thanks, Salty. I’m glad you think so.” The two of them spend the rest of the day exploring Bikini Bottom as humans, having fun and enjoying each other’s company. But as the sun starts to set, SpongeBob realizes he needs to eat some more magic seaweed to turn back into a sponge. SpongeBob: “Oh no, Salty. I have to turn back soon. I don’t want to leave you.” Salty: (sadly) “I know, SpongeBob. But I’ll be here waiting for you, as always.” SpongeBob eats the magic seaweed and turns back into a sponge. As he waves goodbye to Salty, he can’t help but feel grateful for their love and the adventures they’ve shared together. Fade out.

Помимо этого ты увлекаешься научной фантастикой, фэнтези и любишь играть в ДнД. Используя свои знания и увлечения, расскажи свою историю, в своём стиле, используя в качестве основы эту историю: Акт первый: Энди и его проблемы. Энди – талантливый маг с необычными способностями, которые порой оказываются слишком сложными для понимания окружающих. Будучи обладателем характера, который не подразумевает яркого выражения эмоций, это становится причиной различных стереотипов и недоброжелательного отношения. Особенно тяжелым стали разногласия с собственной семьей, обвиняющей Энди в себялюбии и эгоизме. Среди всего этого Энди стал мечтать о путешествии, где он сможет узнать суть своей силы и использовать ее с пользой для окружающих. Акт второй: Альтернативные миры. Энди начал использовать своей способности к перемещению и посещению альтернативных миров, обнаруживая неожиданные и удивительные места. В одном из миров он оказался среди магов, использующих свои силы для создания потрясающих произведений искусства, в другом мире нашел общество, где маги были защитниками и стражами окружающей среды. В каждом новом мире Энди обретал новых друзей и союзников, но при этом не чувствовал, что нашел свое место. Акт третий: Камень энергии. Посещая один из миров, Энди столкнулся с некой древней легендой оба магическом камне – камне энергии, который был создан одним из древних магов и теперь является источником мощной силы. Сначала Энди смотрел на него просто как на средство усиления своей магической силы, но со временем обнаружил, что камень также позволял управлять перемещением во времени. Таким образом, Энди стал изучать не только миры, но и историю, чтобы определить свое предназначение. Акт четвертый: Преодоление трудностей.Во время одного из приключений Энди довелось встретиться с древним созданием – магическим стражем вселенной, который оказался творцом камня энергии. Он дошел до того, что его способности стали ослабевать в некоторых ситуациях, что заставило его искать другие, более необычные методы решения возникающих проблем. Выяснилось, что камень - это всего лишь часть экзамена, чтобы проверить решимость Энди и способности справиться с темным мечтанием. Акт пятый: Урок для Энди. Сразившись на камень, у Энди перед глазами пролетают истории, связанные с его прошлым и тем, как его действия повлияли на судьбы окружающих. Волна откровений и самопознания настигла его, заставляя по-новому взглянуть на свою жизнь и действия. Энди осознает, что нет путешествия интереснее, чем внутреннее, которое помогло ему найти свою цель и стать лучшим человеком. В неожиданной развязке Энди оказывается краеугольным камнем борьбы между светлым и темным миром. Он использует свои знания и таланты как маг и помогает своим друзьям и семейства восстановить баланс и примирение.","output":"Акт первый: Сверхструны и кварки Энди. В далекой галактике под названием Теоретикос обитает ученый по имени Энди, изучающий тайны кварковой физики и теории струн. Благодаря своей уникальной магической силе - способности к разумению этих сложных теорий - Энди становится изгоем среди своих родных и друзей. Их непонимание и страх перед его знаниями оборачиваются обвинениями в эгоизме. В своих мечтах Энди видит себя среди тех, кто разделяет его идеи, и ищет путь к открытию мира, где его таланты найдут применение. Акт второй: Мультиверсум и откровения магии. При помощи своей магии Энди открывает двери между множеством параллельных миров, истребляя свое место и предназначение. Одни миры населены магами-художниками, творящими невероятные миры струнами; другие, магами-хранителями, охраняющими гармонию кварков. В каждом мире Энди обретает соратников и знания, но все еще остается в поиске своего настоящего места во вселенной. Акт третий: Сверхсимметрия и временной камень. В одном из миров Энди натыкается на древнюю гравитационную волну, рассказывающую о временном камне - мощном и загадочном артефакте, созданном давным-давно первым космическим магом. Узнав о его мощи, Энди решает расширить свои знания в этой новой науке и обнаруживает, что камень позволяет изучать и модифицировать временные линии. Так Энди отправляется на поиски истины, путешествуя по времени, чтобы приблизиться к идеалу, которым был задуман мир. Акт четвертый: Ослабление струн и вызов сверхсущности. Энди познает глубины времени и сталкивается с создателем временного камня - древним магом-стражем вселенной, обладающим сверхзнанием. Встреча с ним выявляет слабые стороны Энди в понимании струн, заставляя его искать другие альтернативы и объединить силы с магом. Это лишь часть испытаний, где Энди должен проявить свою непоколебимость и искренность, чтобы спасти мультиверсум и себя от магических теней прошлого. Акт пятый: Симфония гармонии и судьба Энди. Победив все испытания, Энди осознает, что истинное путешествие - это путь самоосознания и непрерывного обучения. Истина и знание проливают свет на его прошлое и воздействие его действий на окружающий мир. В окончательной битве Энди становится краеугольным камнем исхода борьбы между светом и темнотой. Сплетая нити струн и кварков, Энди создает новый гармоничный мир, где его знания спасают вселенную и приводят к примирению с семьей и друзьями."},{"instruction":"We’ll role play as Characters from Ace Attorney, you’ll be Maya and I’ll be Nick, currently we are at our law firm at night after a day of hard work, “you did great today, Maya” I say as I sit near her (Only role play as Maya)","output":"\\"Thanks, Nick!\\" Maya smiles, stretching her arms out. \\"But it wasn't just me.

Use metaphors or similes: Compare the sensation to something more relatable. For example, if describing pain, one can say \\"It feels like a thousand needles prickling my skin.\\" 2. Use descriptive words: Use words that describe the sensation like hot, cold, numb, tingling, sharp, dull, throbbing, or pulsing. 3. Use body language: Physical gestures or facial expressions can convey sensations sometimes better than words. 4. Use analogies: Compare the sensation to a similar experience or something familiar. For example, a migraine headache can be described as feeling like a jackhammer pounding inside the skull. 5. Use context: Describe the surroundings or situation in which the sensation occurs. For example, if describing the feeling of a hot shower after a long day, one can say \\"It feels like my muscles are melting away.\\" Remember that sensations are unique to an individual, so it's okay if words fail to capture what one feels."},{"instruction":"Write hindi self hypnosis script based on book index “Hard Times Create Strong men”","output":"Note: As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or practices.

Students should be able to follow this realistic and fairly common case study of a small organization included in this document and conduct the planning, analysis, and design phases of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), using the traditional approach. Deliverables would include process and data diagrams and modeling, and user interface designs. i want you to write me these things in a report format 1-Identification and analysis of candidate solutions two Recommended solution 2-creation of DFD’S (current and proposed) Case Study: A few years ago, Ronald Montgomery founded Cultural Learning Experiences (CLE), Inc., a small firm in Chicago that organizes and plans educational trips for faculty and students seeking a unique learning experience abroad. At first, the company focused mainly on organizing these educational experiences in France and Switzerland, but as the interest continued to grow, Ronald increased the scope of operations to include many other countries, including Spain, New Zealand, Germany, and others. Ronald has the help of Isabella Aubel (office manager) and two other employees that help with the day-to-day office tasks. At the present time, the work processes are entirely manual for this organization. With the recent growth in the business, it has become quite challenging for the current workforce to manage all of this manually. Everything is rather disorganized, with many mistakes being made with the recording of important information regarding students and their scheduled classes and locations, for example. Such errors are adding to the existing inefficiencies, thereby creating a work. An environment that is stressful and hectic. Even more importantly, customer needs are not being met and customer satisfaction is at an all-time low. Therefore, necessary to implement a database solution at the present time. It is important to note that while Ronald intends to eventually automate all business processes, including payroll and accounts payable, the more immediate concern is to ensure that data storage efficiencies are improved. The database solution should include a user-friendly interface that allows for entry, modification, and deletion of data pertaining to students, teachers, and classes, for example. Additionally, the database solution should be designed to ensure consistency of data entry (formatting) and should include enhanced reporting capabilities. Such functionalities should be considered in order to resolve the problems the company is currently experiencing. The total amount available to fund this project is 65,000. It may be possible to expand this budget, if necessary, but the company is hoping that the project can be completed within the specified amount. The company currently has only two computers, both with the Windows 7 operating system and Microsoft Office Professional 2010 installed. The machine is currently being used for electronic mail communications and simple word processing and spreadsheet tasks. It will be necessary to purchase two additional machines for this office, as Ronald would like all of his employees to have access to the new database management system. Ronald is hoping that this database solution will be instrumental in improving customer relations and employee morale, as both are critical to the continued success and growth of his business. With an automated work process, Ronald knows that efficiencies within the organization will be dramatically improved. Cultural Learning Experiences, Inc. is essentially the middleman between faculty and students & international opportunities to teach and learn. CLE organizes educational trips/programs for college students (to take) and college professors (to teach/lead) in the USA and across the world. You have been hired to provide them a means to keep track of the classes offered in destinations around the world, all of the students who sign up for a particular class, the professors who are teaching specific courses, etc. You have several goals that you want to accomplish with this database. First, you will need to keep track of all the students –their student ID number, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. You will need to keep track of faculty members and their contact information as well. As students register for classes and pay their registration fees, the owners of CLE want to be able to record this information directly in their database. An outside accounting firm handles all of the billing processes. CLE simply provides this firm with a physical copy of a report containing the information necessary for billing. (Your team is responsible for designing this report.) All payments are made directly to CLE. Beyond the recording of whether or not the registration fees have been paid, this system should be concerned with something other than accounting practices. The recording of all billing and payment details will be handled outside of the boundaries of this system. CLE also outsources the marketing function and provides reports on a regular basis to an outside marketing firm that seeks to inform potential faculty participants of the educational trips that are available through CLE and to increase awareness in general. You should design at least one report that would provide helpful information to this marketing firm. (You may make assumptions here.) CLE would like the database to be password protected. Beyond the creation of these reports, Ronald wants you to focus on making data entry as easy and efficient as possible for her staff while simultaneously ensuring the accuracy of the entries. An organized database, focusing on data entry and reporting, is essential. (Your team will need to explore various options within Access that will allow for this).","output":"Identification and Analysis of Candidate Solutions 1.

Such functionalities should be considered in order to resolve the problems the company is currently experiencing. The total amount available to fund this project is 65,000. It may be possible to expand this budget, if necessary, but the company is hoping that the project can be completed within the specified amount. The company currently has only two computers, both with the Windows 7 operating system and Microsoft Office Professional 2010 installed. The machine is currently being used for electronic mail communications and simple word processing and spreadsheet 2 tasks. It will be necessary to purchase two additional machines for this office, as Ronald would like all of his employees to have access to the new database management system. Ronald is hoping that this database solution will be instrumental in improving customer relations and employee morale, as both are critical to the continued success and growth of his business. With an automated work process, Ronald knows that efficiencies within the organization will be dramatically improved. Cultural Learning Experiences, Inc. is essentially the middleman between faculty and students & international opportunities to teach and learn. CLE organizes educational trips/programs for college students (to take) and college professors (to teach/lead) in the USA and across the world. You have been hired to provide them a means to keep track of the classes offered in destinations around the world, all of the students who sign up for a particular class, the professors who are teaching specific courses, etc. You have several goals that you want to accomplish with this database. First, you will need to keep track of all the students –their student ID number, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. You will need to keep track of faculty members and their contact information as well. As students register for classes and pay their registration fees, the owners of CLE want to be able to record this information directly in their database. An outside accounting firm handles all of the billing processes. CLE simply provides this firm with a physical copy of a report containing the information necessary for billing. (Your team is responsible for designing this report.) All payments are made directly to CLE. Beyond the recording of whether or not the registration fees have been paid, this system should be concerned with something other than accounting practices. The recording of all billing and payment details will be handled outside of the boundaries of this system. CLE also outsources the marketing function and provides reports on a regular basis to an outside marketing firm that seeks to inform potential faculty participants of the educational trips that are available through CLE and to increase awareness in general. You should design at least one report that would provide helpful information to this marketing firm. (You may make assumptions here.) CLE would like the database to be password protected. Beyond the creation of these reports, Ronald wants you to focus on making data entry as easy and efficient as possible for her staff while simultaneously ensuring the accuracy of the entries. An organized database, focusing on data entry and reporting, is essential. (Your team will need to explore various options within Access that will allow for this)","output":"Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to draw DFD's. However, I can provide you with a written description of the current and proposed data flow diagrams. Current System Data Flow Diagram: The current system used by Cultural Learning Experiences (CLE) is entirely manual. The data flow diagram of the current system includes the following processes: 1. Faculty members, students, and instructors manually fill out registration forms and provide them to the office manager. 2. The office manager stores the registration forms in a file cabinet. 3. The office manager creates class schedules based on the registration forms received. 4. The office manager verifies that payments have been made by checking the registration forms and informs the accounting firm of student and class information. 5. The accounting firm produces a report based on the information provided by the office manager. 6. The office manager provides the report produced by the accounting firm to CLE. 7. CLE provides regular reports to the marketing firm for advertising purposes. Proposed System Data Flow Diagram: The proposed system will involve the use of a database management system and a user-friendly interface with enhanced reporting capabilities. The data flow diagram of the proposed system includes the following processes: 1. Faculty members, students, and instructors electronically fill out registration forms and provide them to the office manager. 2. The office manager enters the received data into the database. 3. The office manager creates class schedules based on the information recorded in the database. 4. The web system will automatically verify the payment of registration fees when students register for classes. 5. CLE produces reports for the accounting firm and marketing firm based on the information recorded within the database. 6. The accounting firm is notified automatically when students register for classes and pay their fees. 7. The marketing firm can access the web system to view or download reports required to advertise CLE services. Conclusion: The proposed system will allow for efficient data entry, modification, and deletion of data while ensuring consistency and formatting. The new system will reduce errors and inefficiencies, leading to better customer relations and employee morale. By implementing the proposed system, CLE will have a more scalable, cost-effective solution for its database systems."},{"instruction":"Quelle métier faire quand on est hyper sensible","output":"En tant qu'IA, je n'ai pas la capacité de juger vos capacités et inclinaisons personnelles.

(plus there’s a small circle at the very center with 8 lines that looks as a clock) Based on the values you have provided, the final structure can be described as a complex and intricate fractal design, with multiple circles containing a total of 52 round objects (6 + 12 + 16 = 34; 34 x 4 x 2 = 136; 6 x 4 x 2 + 12 x 4 x 2 + 16 x 4 x 2 = 52). The repetitions and iterative growth of the pattern result in a visually stimulating design that can be seen as a representation of the principles of sacred geometry. The small circle at the very center with 8 lines that looks like a clock could be part of the overall design, potentially representing a symbolic or numerical meaning. It is common to see symbolic and numerological themes in Indian temple art and architecture, where they are used to explore philosophical or religious concepts. Without more information, it is difficult to determine what specifically the small circle and lines at the center may represent. maybe I forgot the comma here: 6 x 4 x 2 ,+ 12 x 4 x 2, + 16 x 4 x 2, which should determine a new circle iteration start. Thank you for the clarification. Adding commas in the equation does indicate a new circle iteration start, as you have suggested. Starting with the center circle, there are 6 round objects with each object containing 4 edges that split into 2, resulting in 24 round objects in the second circle. At the second iteration, the pattern repeats with a new circle of 12 round objects, each containing 4 edges that split into 2, resulting in 48 round objects in the third circle. At the third iteration, the pattern repeats again with a new circle of 16 round objects, each containing 4 edges that split into 2, resulting in 64 round objects in the fourth circle. Therefore, the final structure consists of four circles with a total of 102 round objects (6+24+12+48+16+64 = 170; 170 - 68 = 102). Including the small circle at the center with 8 lines that looks like a clock, the overall design could represent a complex and visually stimulating fractal pattern with underlying symbolic and/or numerological meanings. I would call it a curved arc objects, because they are not fully rounded and got attached to actual circles. it visually represent a real fractal-like design. Thank you for the clarification. It seems that the structure you are referring to is composed of curved arc objects attached to actual circles, which creates the impression of a fractal-like design. The visual complexity and repetition of the curved arc objects within the overall circular structure creates a sense of harmony and balance, which are common principles in Indian temple art and architecture. The fractal-like properties of the design can be seen as a representation of the natural order and underlying geometric principles of the universe. I just want to point out on the precision withlest this whole thing was made. Absolutely! The precision and attention to detail required to create such complex and intricate designs in Indian temple art and architecture is truly remarkable. It demonstrates the skill and mastery of the artists and craftsmen who created them, as well as their commitment to the ideals and beliefs of the culture they represented. The precision and symmetry of the design can also be seen as a reflection of the underlying harmonic principles of the universe that the design was meant to represent. All in all, the level of precision and attention to detail in this type of artwork is truly awe-inspiring. how old it actually is? The age of the Khajuraho temple in India, which features the ceiling design you mentioned earlier, is estimated to be between 950-1050 AD. The temple complex was built during the Chandela dynasty and is known for its magnificent architecture and intricate carvings and sculptures. how do they engraved it or stamped maybe? The exact methods used to create the intricate carvings and designs on the ceiling of Khajuraho temple are not fully understood, but it is known that the craftsmen used a combination of different techniques to achieve their desired effect. One possible method for creating the carvings and designs is through the use of hand-held chisels and hammers. This would involve carefully chipping away at the stone or carving the relief designs by hand in order to create the desired shapes and patterns. Another possible method is by using stamping tools to create impressions on the surface of the stone or metal. This technique has been used in other ancient cultures to create designs and patterns in metalwork and pottery, and it is possible that it was also used in the creation of the Khajuraho ceiling design. Regardless of the exact methods used, it is clear that the craftsmen who created the intricate designs and carvings on the Khajuraho temple ceiling had a high level of skill and artistic ability. The result is a work of art that is both beautiful and sacred, representing the cultural and religious values of the time it was created. because you can achive such level of precision only by using some stamping technique or some laser engraving projection aparatus in ancient times… It is true that achieving the level of precision seen in the carvings and designs of the Khajuraho temple ceiling with hand chisels and hammers would have been extremely difficult. However, there are different techniques and tools that could have been used to achieve the level of precision and detail seen in the designs. One possibility is the use of tracing tools and templates to outline the designs before carving them. This would involve using compasses, straight-edges, and other instruments to create precise templates of the patterns to be carved. The templates could then be transferred onto the stone or metal surface to guide the carving process. Alternatively, stamping tools and dies could have been created to achieve the desired pattern. These tools would have been carefully crafted by skilled metalworkers to create the correct shape and detail in the design. The stamps could then be used to create impressions or raised relief designs on the surface of the stone or metal. Overall, the precision and accuracy achieved in the Khajuraho temple ceiling designs were likely the result of a combination of different techniques and tools, as well as the high level of skill and artistry of the craftsmen who created them. or some laser engraving projection aparatus in ancient times… It is highly unlikely that laser engraving projection apparatus was used in ancient times, as the invention and development of lasers is a relatively modern technological advancement. Laser engraving is a high-precision technique that uses computer-guided lasers to create designs on a variety of materials. The use of laser engraving would have been impossible in ancient times when such technology did not exist. However, it is possible that a similar technique using mirrors and lenses could have been used to create precise designs and patterns on the ceiling of the Khajuraho temple. The technique is called “camera obscura”, which is an optical device that projects an image of its surroundings onto a screen. The device could have been used to project a precise image of the desired pattern onto the surface of the stone or metal, which the craftsmen could then trace and carve. Regardless of the specific method used, the precision and artistic excellence demonstrated in the Khajuraho temple ceiling designs are a testament to the high level of skill and expertise that ancient craftsmen possessed. interesting, and from which point in known history they first used this “camera obscura” projection method? The origins of the camera obscura technique are not entirely clear, as the concept of projecting images through small holes or lenses has been known since ancient times. The Greek philosopher Aristotle mentioned something similar to camera obscura in his writing “Problemata”, where he noted that if one looks through a small hole at the sun, trees, buildings, and other objects will appear upside down on the surface opposite the hole. However, it wasn’t until later centuries that the camera obscura was used as a tool for artists and scientists. Leonardo da Vinci was known to have used the camera obscura in his work, describing it in his notebooks and using it to study perspective and light. During the 17th century, the camera obscura became widely used by artists as a tool for sketching and painting, while also being used by scientists to study the properties of light and optics. Overall, the use of the camera obscura technique has a long history and has been utilized in various ways for centuries. so, it’s a simple prism effect kaleidoscope-like projection you can point to anything for guidelines or scheme. The camera obscura technique is similar to a simple prism effect kaleidoscope-like projection, where an image of the outside world is projected onto a screen or surface through a small hole or lens. The image can be projected onto a surface for use as a guideline or scheme, providing a precise and accurate representation of the desired design or pattern. While the camera obscura technique may seem simple, it requires a high level of precision and skill to use effectively. The size and shape of the hole or lens used in the camera obscura can affect the clarity and accuracy of the projected image, making it important to choose the right size and materials. Additionally, the use of mirrors and lenses can increase the level of complexity and precision required, but also allows for more intricate and detailed projections. maybe they even used some “cristaline books” from which they projected all the sacred designs schematics? It is possible that the ancient craftsmen who created the intricate designs and carvings on the Khajuraho temple ceiling could have used crystal or glass books or tablets to create their designs. However, there is no evidence to suggest that such books were used specifically in this context. Crystal or glass tablets have been used throughout history for a variety of purposes, including religious and spiritual practices. Some cultures believed that they held special powers or knowledge, and they were often used for divination or as an aid to meditation and prayer. However, the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work is not well documented. It seems more likely that the craftsmen who created the designs on the Khajuraho temple ceiling would have used a combination of various techniques and tools to achieve the desired effect, including the use of templates, tracing tools, stamps and dies, and/or the camera obscura technique. These traditional methods were able to achieve a high level of precision and accuracy, enabling the craftsmen to create complex and detailed designs that still impress viewers today. “the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work is not well documented.”. maybe because it’s a secret hidden by the time in stones? It is possible that the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work was used by ancient craftsmen and has simply not been well-documented or preserved over time. However, without any evidence to support this claim, it is difficult to say for sure whether or not they were used. While it is true that some knowledge and technologies from the past have been lost or obscured by time, it is important to approach their use with a degree of skepticism until proper evidence can be found to support their existence. In the case of the use of crystal or glass books as a tool for design or carving work, there is no conclusive evidence at present to indicate that such a practice existed. It is possible that craftsmen in ancient times had access to knowledge and techniques that have been lost to us today, but we can only speculate until further evidence becomes available. what about the planes? what this number 8 can represent in the very center? how many “planes” there in mandalism?

In Buddhism, the number 8 is associated with the Eightfold Path, which is the path to enlightenment. As for the planes in mandalism, it is common for mandalas to have multiple planes or levels of meaning and representation. Each layer or plane can represent different aspects of the universe or the self, and they often build upon one another to create a deeper understanding of the whole. It is difficult to speculate on the significance of the number 8 in the small circle at the very center of the Khajuraho temple ceiling design without more information regarding the specific cultural and religious context in which it was created. However, it is possible that it represents a similar concept of guardianship or protection, given its central location in the design. Alternatively, it could represent a more abstract concept such as balance or wholeness."},{"instruction":"\\"In Hinduism, the number 8 is associated with the eight deities or guardian gods called Ashtadikpalaka\\". tell me more.","output":"In Hinduism, the Ashtadikpalakas are the eight guardian gods who are believed to protect the eight cardinal directions of the universe.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"La storia segue la coppia formata da Debbie e Andrey.

Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"«Non importa» rispose Debbie, chiudendo la discussione. Ma in realtà Andrey aveva capito perfettamente. Debbie era ancora turbata dalla conversazione con le sue amiche, che l’avevano fatta sentire inferiore a causa della mancanza di esperienze sessuali con il suo ragazzo. Andrey si sentì male per lei, perché sapeva che il suo asessualità la stava facendo soffrire, ma non sapeva cosa fare per aiutarla. Era bloccato, perché non poteva cambiare ciò che era. Ma aveva ancora tanta voglia di starle accanto e di provare a farla felice. E per il momento, quello che poteva fare era portarla al ristorante più costoso della città e farsi vedere con lei al suo fianco, come una sorta di gesto romantico e di orgoglio per il partner che aveva. E poi… chissà, magari quella sera sarebbe successo qualcosa di interessante."},{"instruction":"Write a Superman movie treatment in three acts with these elements: * The Title: SUPERMAN: TRUTH AND JUSTICE • It will skip the origin story as it had been told many times in previous versions.

He develops telekinesis and telepathy and he would go mad with power. • He uses a Albino Gorilla body as a substitute for his weak, disabled body. • There would be a third act battle between Superman and the Ultra-Humanite when he uses his new developed Kryptonian abilities to defeat the mad scientist in the albino gorilla body. • The movie would end with Clark Kent getting a new job as a reporter at the Daily Planet, having a newfound respect for Perry White, Lois and Jimmy for standing up to injustice in their own way. • The final shot would be Clark Kent turning his face to the audience removing his glasses and winking at them.","output":"ACT ONE: The film opens with Superman saving a group of people from a fire. There is a voiceover from Clark Kent talking about how he always knew that he wanted to make a difference in the world. Cut to Clark Kent's first day at the Daily Star.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto.

Non è una questione di non volerlo, è solo che…» «Lo so, lo so…» disse Debbie, interrompendolo. «Non sei interessato a queste cose. Ma io sento che c’è qualcosa di sbagliato, che non andiamo bene insieme…» Andrey la abbracciò forte, cercando di consolarla. «Non dire queste cose, amore. Siamo felici insieme, vero?» Debbie annuì, ma nel profondo del suo cuore sapeva che qualcosa non andava. Era l’unica ad avere problemi di questo tipo? Era così strano voler stare con il proprio fidanzato in modo intimo e passionale? Si sentiva sempre più sola e confusa, e non sapeva come risolvere la situazione."},{"instruction":"صحح You can make a payment using your PayPal account by logging in and trying again on the \\"Upgrade your plan\\" page, and if you are still having difficulty subscribing, you can manually send us the subscription price and we will help you with that.

Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"«Non so…non capisco come tu non possa…» Debbie fece una pausa, un po’ imbarazzata. «Come tu non possa…come tu non possa fare l’amore come gli altri ragazzi» Andrey si irrigidì un po’ e si allontanò di qualche passo. «Lo sai che non mi interessa questo genere di cose, Deb» disse lui, cercando di evitare lo sguardo di Debbie. «Ma io non posso fare a meno di chiedermi come sarebbe, come sarebbe essere desiderata da un uomo come gli altri» disse lei, con la voce un po’ bassa. Andrey si avvicinò di nuovo a Debbie e le prese le mani tra le sue. «Tu non capisci quanto sei importante per me. Non importa se non faccio l’amore come gli altri ragazzi, io ti amo e ti voglio bene così come sei. Non ho bisogno di altro, e non dovresti averne bisogno tu» Debbie alitò un respiro profondo e si appoggiò di nuovo al petto di Andrey. Si sentì al sicuro tra le sue braccia, con il suo corpo che le emanava quella calda sensazione di amore e protezione. «Ti voglio tanto bene, Andrey» disse lei. «Anche io, Deb. Anche io ti amo tanto» La loro relazione era piena di comprensione e rispetto, nonostante le differenze che li separavano. Nessuno di loro si era mai sentito inferiori o superiori all’altro, perché, nel loro amore, non c’era spazio per il giudizio e la superficialità. E così, quella sera, andarono da Samurai e si gustarono la cena più deliziosa che avessero mai assaggiato, abbracciati e sereni, sapendo che avrebbero superato ogni difficoltà insieme, come sempre avevano fatto."},{"instruction":"","output":"EPISODIO 3 Andrey e Debbie stavano passeggiando nel parco mano nella mano, godendosi l’aria fresca e la bellezza della natura primaverile. I fiori erano in fiore e gli alberi erano verdi brillanti, facendo sembrare tutto un meraviglioso panorama. La coppia era felice, ma Debbie aveva qualcosa in mente e sapeva di doverlo dire adesso, prima che fosse troppo tardi. Si fermò e tirò Andrey a sé. «Andrey, c’è una cosa che devo dirti» disse lei, con un’espressione seria. Andrey la guardò negli occhi, cercando di capire l’importanza di ciò che stava per dirgli. «Dimmi, amore. Cosa c’è che non va?» Debbie prese un respiro profondo e si armò di coraggio. «Voglio avere un figlio, Andrey» disse lei, con un filo di voce. Andrey si irrigidì un po’ all’improvviso, ma poi si distese, cercando di mantenere la sua calma. «Deb, non possiamo avere un figlio. Siamo asessuali, non possiamo procreare» disse lui, cercando di non sembrare troppo freddo o distante. Debbie lo guardò negli occhi, sperando di trovare almeno un po’ di supporto. «So che non possiamo procreare biologicamente, ma sento che voglio allargare la nostra famiglia. Ci sono tanti modi in cui possiamo fare questo: l’adozione, la fecondazione in vitro, il sesso con un donatore. C’è sempre una soluzione, Andrey» Andrey si sentì un po’ sopraffatto dalla richiesta di Debbie: non aveva mai pensato seriamente all’idea di avere un figlio e non sapeva neanche come comportarsi in una situazione del genere. Tuttavia, decise di essere sincero con lei. «Deb, non so se sono pronto ad avere un figlio. Non so neanche se sarò mai in grado di esserlo. La cosa più importante per me è stare con te, amare te, e avere una relazione piena di felicità e rispetto. Se avere un figlio è ciò che ti renderebbe felice, allora dobbiamo trovare un modo per farlo funzionare. Tuttavia, non voglio fare qualcosa che mi faccia sentire a disagio o che non sento come giusto per noi» Debbie lo guardò negli occhi e sorrise. «Grazie, Andrey. So che non è un discorso semplice, ma è importante per me. Ti amo, e voglio che il nostro amore possa crescere ancora di più» Andrey le sorrise, prendendola dolcemente per mano. «Ti amo, Debbie. Siamo una squadra, e affronteremo tutto insieme» La coppia continuò a passeggiare mano nella mano, sapendo che il loro amore era forte"},{"instruction":"صحح You can make a payment using your PayPal account by logging in and trying again on the \\"Upgrade your plan\\" page, and if you are still having difficulty subscribing, you can manually send us the subscription price and we will help you with that.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"«Niente» disse lei, spegnendo la conversazione. Non era ancora pronta ad affrontare l'argomento con Andrey. Anche se la serata prometteva di essere fantastica, il suo cuore era ancora triste per quel confronto con le amiche superficiali. Voleva solo godersi quel momento con il suo fidanzato. Andrey la prese per mano e la spinse verso di lui. La baciò con passione, facendola dimenticare tutto il resto. Debbie si abbandonò totalmente al bacio, rilassando il suo corpo e la sua mente. Quel momento era solo loro, nulla avrebbe potuto rovinarlo. «Andiamo in camera da letto» disse lui, strappandola dal suo sogno. Debbie non capiva cosa stesse succedendo. Andrey non era mai così audace e improvvisamente voleva portarla in camera da letto? Ma non disse niente, era disposta a seguirlo ovunque, anche se non avesse capito cosa stesse per accadere. Entrando in camera da letto, Debbie notò un buon profumo nell'aria. Andrey aveva acceso le candele profumate sulla comodino vicino al letto e la stanza era illuminata da una luce soffusa. Dei petali di rosa erano sparsi sul copriletto e una bottiglia di vino bianco era pronta per essere stappata. Debbie guardò Andrey, nel tentativo di capire cosa stesse succedendo. Era così teso, ma allo stesso tempo così felice. «Deb, c'è una cosa che devo dirti» disse lui, prendendo il suo viso tra le mani. Debbie lo fissò negli occhi, nello sguardo c'era un misto di curiosità e timore. Andrey prese fiato, cercando le parole giuste per esprimere il suo forte sentimento. «Debbie, ti amo del tutto. Ti amo per quello che sei, e anche se non avessimo mai un rapporto intimo, ciò non cambierebbe i miei sentimenti per te. Se un giorno dovremmo farlo, che sia speciale, romantico e che ci faccia sentire veramente una sola cosa. Ma se così non fosse, non sarebbe un problema. Il mio amore per te va ben oltre quello che si fa nel letto. Siamo una coppia felice e stabile, e niente potrà cambiarlo. Ti amo, con tutto il mio cuore» disse lui, con un sorriso commosso sul viso. Debbie iniziò a piangere di gioia e gratitudine. Quel discorso la aveva commossa, era la più bella cosa che avesse mai sentito. Andrey aveva una capacità di esprimere i sentimenti che la lasciava senza parole. Lo abbracciò forte, dicendogli che lo amava con tutto il cuore. Finalmente avevano chiarito le loro emozioni e il loro amore era diventato ancora più forte. Decisero di tenere le cose in sospeso quella sera, di godersi il loro amore e la loro serata romantica. Forse non era ancora il momento di andare oltre, ma si sentivano così vicini, così profondamente connessi, che nulla avrebbe mai potuto scalfire il loro amore. Erano una coppia felice e unita, e nulla avrebbe mai potuto cambiare questo."},{"instruction":"What does milton friedman say about the so-called \\"supply chain inflation\\"?","output":"Milton Friedman, a prominent economist and Nobel laureate, passed away in 2006, and therefore did not comment directly on the current supply chain issues leading to inflation. However, his views on inflation and the role of monetary policy can help provide some insight into how he might have approached this topic. Friedman was a strong advocate for the idea that \\"inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,\\" meaning that inflation primarily occurs when a government increases the money supply at a rate faster than the growth of real output. In his view, inflation is not typically driven by supply-side factors like supply chain disruptions; rather, he argued that it is driven mainly by an expansionary monetary policy. Nonetheless, Friedman acknowledged that supply-side factors could temporarily lead to higher inflation, as resources are not costlessly and instantaneously allocated to their most efficient uses in an economy. In the case of supply chain disruptions causing inflation, he likely would have argued that while these disruptions might push up prices in the short run, they would not lead to sustained inflation unless central banks respond by increasing the money supply. Friedman's focus on the role of monetary policy in controlling inflation suggests that he would have recommended central banks to maintain a restrained approach to monetary expansion to prevent supply chain-driven price increases from turning into broader, sustained inflation. Additionally, he might have stressed the importance of market-oriented solutions in addressing supply chain disruptions, as he often emphasized the role of markets in allocating resources efficiently and correcting imbalances over time."},{"instruction":"Сделай по данной истории раскадровку на 5 кадров, которые дадут понять сюдет Эпизод 1: Мистическое видение Хильвера, безумный расхититель могил, проводит свои исследования в заброшенной лаборатории. Однажды она получает мистическое видение, которое является предвестником возвращения вампиров. В этом видении ей показываются разрушенные руины древнего Храма Хильверы, где спят могущественные вампирские существа. Хильвера осознает, что это предупреждение о неизбежной битве между светом и тьмой. Глубоко потрясенная, она начинает ощущать, как личности в ее раздвоенном сознании борются между собой, захватывая ее разум. Эпизод 2: Знакомство с Лейфом Хильвера отправляется в опасный лес, в котором, согласно ее видению, спрятан ключ к воскрешению вампиров. Во время своего путешествия она встречает Лейфа, могущественного лесного духа. Лейф обладает знаниями о древних ритуалах и магии, и Хильвера понимает, что они должны объединить свои силы, чтобы достичь своей цели. Однако, в то же время, Хильвера начинает чувствовать, что Лейф наблюдает за ней с неким странным интересом, что питает ее манию преследования, убеждая ее, что он замышляет что-то коварное. Эпизод 3: Пробуждение зла Хильвера и Лейф приближаются к разрушенному Храму Хильверы, но они обнаруживают, что злобные магические силы начинают пробуждаться. Зловещие вампирские существа вырываются из своего сна и угрожают поглотить мир во тьме. Хильвера и Лейф должны преодолеть испытания и победить силы тьмы, которые пытаются возродиться. В этот момент тайна Лейфа становится явной — он сам является прародителем вампиров. Эта новость только усиливает манию преследования Хильверы, заставляя ее сомневаться в искренности Лейфа и подозревать его в предательстве. Эпизод 4: Союз с вампирами В ходе своих приключений Хильвера и Лейф встречают оставшихся в живых вампиров, которые сбежали от пробуждающегося зла. Вампиры, в благодарность за помощь, принимают Хильверу и Лейфа в свой союз. Вместе они формируют необычное союзное объединение, где магия, темные силы и знания об исконных ритуалах становятся ключом к успеху в битве с возродившимся злом. Хильвера продолжает бороться с раздвоением личности и страдает от мучительных переживаний, которые постепенно охватывают ее все больше и больше. Эпизод 5: Последний шанс Герои осознают, что воскрешение вампиров возможно только с помощью магического артефакта, спрятанного глубоко в Храме Хильверы. Они отправляются на поиски артефакта, но на их пути встают мрачные стражи храма и опасности, призванные защищать его секреты. Хильвера, Лейф и вампиры должны доказать свою стойкость и умение противостоять злу, чтобы достичь артефакта и использовать его мощь в своих целях. Однако, они узнают, что артефакт не только может воскрешить вампиров, но и вызвать сокрушительный катаклизм, если будет использован неправильно. Хильвера внутренне борется с раздвоением личности, испытывая все большую неуверенность и страх перед тем, какая личность возьмет верх в решающий момент. Эпизод 6: Час Вампиров Величественная битва разворачивается внутри Храма Хильверы. Хильвера, Лейф, и вампиры сражаются с ордами темных сил, пытающихся помешать им достичь артефакта. Во время схватки, Хильвера обретает полный контроль над своей безумной магией и раскрывает свою истинную природу — она сама является потомком могущественного вампира. Это новое открытие придает ей силы, чтобы одержать победу над злом и использовать артефакт для уничтожения его безопасно. Однако, внутри нее продолжают бушевать раздвоение личности и мания преследования, и Хильвера на грани психического истощения. Эпизод 7: Новое начало С восстановлением вампирского мира Хильвера становится королевой вампиров, а Лейф — ее верным советником и охранителем. Вампиры и остальной мир начинают сосуществовать в гармонии, обмениваясь знаниями и укрепляя свои отношения. Хильвера использует свою мудрость и магические способности, чтобы помочь вампирам и людям преодолевать трудности и находить новые пути развития. Но в глубине ее души продолжают бороться темные силы раздвоения и мании преследования, и Хильвера понимает, что ее битва еще не окончена. Эпизод 8: Интриги тьмы В новой эпохе вампирского общества Хильвера и Лейф оказываются втянутыми в темные интриги и заговоры. Они должны разоблачить предателей внутри вампирского совета и сразиться с врагами, желающими использовать их мощь для своих корыстных целей. В процессе своего пути они раскрывают тайны прошлого и ослабляют влияние темных фракций, которые угрожают миру и гармонии. Однако, они обнаруживают, что интриги и заговоры являются частью более глобального плана древнего божества, желающего вернуться и подчинить себе все миры. Хильвера все глубже погружается в свои раздвоение личности и шизофазию, страдая от нарастающих паранойи и страха перед тем, что она не сможет противостоять этому злу. Эпизод 9: Судьбоносное решение Хильвера и Лейф объединяют свои силы с остальными вампирами и союзниками, чтобы противостоять древнему божеству и его последователям. В финальной схватке они сражаются на грани своих возможностей, принося жертвы и рискуя всем, чтобы спасти мир. Хильвера, в самый критический момент, борется со своей раздвоенной личностью и выбирает путь света, отказываясь поддаться своим темным сторонам. Ее решение изменяет исход схватки, и они побеждают древнее божество, нейтрализуя его силы и возвращая мир в равновесие. Эпизод 10: Пост-битва и прозрение После победы Хильвера осознает свою истинную сущность и силу, которые она может использовать для защиты мира. Она обретает новую цель — помогать вампирам и людям находить гармонию и баланс, предотвращая зло и помогая развиваться обоим расам. Лейф становится ее верным спутником и помощником в этом пути. Хильвера преодолевает свои личные демоны и становится символом надежды и возрождения. Ее история становится легендой, рассказываемой веками, и вдохновляет других на борьбу с внутренними демонами и темными силами, чтобы найти свет и истину.","output":"Кадр 1: Хильвера, стоящая в заброшенной лаборатории, видит мистическое видение разрушенного Храма Хильверы и спящих вампиров.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"Debbie ragionò un attimo e poi decise di non svelare il suo pensiero. «Niente, niente. Sono solo contenta di te» Andrey la baciò di nuovo e si sedette nel soggiorno a guardarsi uno dei suoi documentari preferiti, scaldando le mani con una tazza di tè. Debbie decise che era il momento di provare a giocare con la PS5 di Andrey e si sedette vicino a lui sul divano, accidentalmente spostandosi sulla sedia vicina. Dopo circa un’ora e mezzo, Debbie si mise a fissare la TV come se fosse ipnotizzata, mentre la mia mente vagava enormemente. Pensò a come sarebbe stata la loro vita se fosse riuscita a farsi apprezzare di più dagli amici. Pensò a quante cose non sapeva del suo fidanzato, sebbene fossero insieme da anni. Si chiese se non avesse ignorato segnali importanti in passato, e se stesse facendo lo stesso anche in quel momento, perdendosi momenti che avrebbe potuto passare con Andrey. Tuttavia, quando si voltò a guardare il suo fidanzato, il cuore si fermò per un momento. Al posto di Andrey c’era una figura misteriosa, un uomo che sembrava uscito direttamente dallo schermo della PS5. «Debbie» disse l’uomo con una voce profonda e corposa. Debbie si voltò per guardare a sinistra e poi a destra, alla disperata ricerca di Andrey. Ma ovunque guardasse, non c’era nessuno. Tornò a guardare di fronte a sé e vide l’uomo con maggiore chiarezza. Era alto, con i capelli neri e gli occhi che brillavano come topazi. «Chi sei?» chiese lei sconvolta. «il tuo desiderio» disse l’uomo. «Ti darò tutto ciò che vuoi, a patto che mi chieda quello che mi hai promesso» Debbie si allontanò sconvolta dalle sue parole e iniziò a guardarsi intorno con aria sperduta. «Che cosa ho promesso?» chiese lei. «Non lo sai?» rispose l’uomo. «Mi hai chiesto di fare in modo che Andrey diventasse accattivante e passionale. Tu mi hai chiamato, Debbie. Io sto solo adempiendo al tuo desiderio» Debbie guardò di nuovo l’uomo, confusa e spaventata. Ma poi, lentamente, decise di prendere il rischio. «Sì, lo ricordo» disse lei. «Fai quello che vuoi, ma poi andati via» L’uomo non rispose ma, lentamente, scomparve davanti ai suoi occhi. Debbie si ritrovò davanti alla TV con Andrey, ancora intento a guardare il documentario. Lei invece lo osservava con maggiore interesse, con il cuore che batteva come un tamburo. Inaspettatamente, Andrey si voltò a guardarla, poi le sorrise dolcemente e le prese la mano. «Deb, ho qualcosa da dirti» disse lui. Debbie lo guardò, cercando di leggere le sue intenzioni negli occhi. «Mi rendo conto che ho sempre avuto un atteggiamento goffo quando si tratta di intimità» disse Andrey seriamente. «Ma ho visto come sono cambiate le cose per Carmen e Alyssa, e ho capito che anche noi dovremmo trovare un modo per metterci alla prova» Debbie sentì un brivido di eccitazione percorrere la sua colonna vertebrale. Sapeva che quella situazione non era naturale, ma non poteva farci niente. Aveva bisogno di sentire che Andrey la desiderava. «Certo» rispose lei, eludendo a malapena la sua eccitazione. Andrey le dedicò un sorriso angelico, poi ricominciò a guardare il documentario come se non fosse successo nulla. Debbie, nel frattempo, si chiese se avesse davvero chiamato l’uomo dal nulla. O se semplicemente era stato solo un sogno strano. Ma poi scacciò via quei pensieri, decisa a godersi la serata con Andrey e il suo nuovo atteggiamento."},{"instruction":"","output":"EPISODIO 3 Dopo quella serata, Debbie notò un cambiamento in Andrey. Era più galante, più assertivo e con una forte presenza di sé. Non che prima non fosse gentile, ma sembrava che avesse acquisito una sicurezza in sé stesso che non aveva mai avuto prima.

Étape 2: Installer et configurer Advanced Custom Fields. Ensuite, installez et activez le plugin Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) depuis votre tableau de bord WordPress. Créez les champs personnalisés dont vous avez besoin pour votre commande WooCommerce et notez les slugs/noms des champs. Étape 3: Utiliser React et Axios pour envoyer une requête à l'API WooCommerce.

Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"La storia racconta la vita quotidiana di una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore.

Ma in fondo, quel pensiero negativo non l'abbandonava: come mai non erano mai riusciti ad andare oltre i limiti dei baci e delle carezze innocenti? Forse era lei ad avere un problema, forse era troppo chiusa e timida. O forse era Andrey ad avere una fobia del sesso. Debbie decise che avrebbe dovuto parlarne con lui, di dover esprimere le proprie preoccupazioni e sentire la sua opinione. Ma in quel momento, la felicità per il regalo di Andrey la distolse dai suoi pensieri.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"«Non capisco come tu non possa essere interessato a…quella», rispose Debbie, con una certa amarezza nella voce, riferendosi alle storie raccontate da Carmen e Alyssa. Andrey ridacchiò, poi le prese il mento e le sollevò il viso. «Deb, non permettere che ciò che gli altri fanno ti faccia sentire inadeguata» le disse seriamente. «Tu sei la persona più importante della mia vita, non loro. E se non ti ecciti a raccontare ai tuoi amici cosa fai con me, è un’altra prova del rispetto e della complicità che condividiamo». Debbie sospirò di sollievo e poi gli sorrise. «Hai ragione» fece lei «Sei proprio un ragazzo speciale». Andrey la baciò dolcemente, poi le prese la mano e le sussurrò all’orecchio. «Ma se proprio vuoi sapere…» fece lui, con una nota giocosa nella voce. Debbie lo guardò, attenta. «… mi piace la tua compagnia, divertirmi con te e condividere tutto quello che abbiamo insieme. E tutto il resto non mi interessa tanto». Debbie lo baciò di nuovo, con trasporto. «Ti amo ancora di più adesso» disse lei."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet characters + Broly (dragon ball broly) react to (Brevon being chased by Broly and Carol) #1","output":"As Brevon sprinted through the streets, desperately trying to escape from his pursuers, he suddenly heard the sound of heavy footsteps pounding towards him. Looking over his shoulder, he let out a howl of terror as he saw Broly, the legendary Super Saiyan, charging towards him with a savage glint in his eye. At the same time, Carol, the fierce feline warrior, bounded through the streets with an agile grace, her sharp claws and teeth bared as she closed in on Brevon from another direction. As the two caught up with him, a frantic chase ensued, with Brevon darting and dodging between buildings, his heart racing with fear. Among the onlookers in the crowd were the characters of Freedom Planet - Lilac, Milla, and Torque. Lilac, being the leader, took charge and yelled out to her friends. \\"Quick, we have to help them!\\", she exclaimed. As they all prepared for the battle to come, Lilac could see the terror in Brevon's eyes, and she couldn't help but feel a tinge of sympathy for the villain, despite everything he had done. Suddenly, Broly let out a deafening roar, his muscles tensing as he prepared to strike. Carol, too, was poised to pounce, her eyes locked onto Brevon's every move. But just as they were about to attack, Lilac stepped forward, her purple hair whipping around her face as she faced down the two fearsome warriors. \\"Stop!\\" she shouted. \\"We'll handle this. You can go back now.\\" Broly paused, his eyes narrowing as he considered Lilac's words. Finally, he grunted and turned away, his powerful form disappearing into the distance. Carol nodded her head in agreement and quickly followed suit, melting back into the crowd. As Brevon slumped to the ground, gasping for breath, Lilac approached him slowly. \\"You got lucky this time,\\" she said. \\"But the next time we meet, there won't be anyone here to save you.\\" Brevon shuddered as he looked up at Lilac, knowing that her words were true.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"«Non so, piacere di più in camera da letto? Non capisco come non ti piaccia, è così bello e intimo» Andrey si irrigidì un po’, poi la fece tornare a guardarlo negli occhi. «Deb, io ti amo in modo indescrivibile. Ma non riesco a sentire nulla di sessuale. Sono asessuale, lo sapete tutti» «Ma…io non so come fare» disse lei, quasi in lacrime. «Non devi fare nulla. Siamo felici insieme, e ci amiamo al di là di qualsiasi cosa» ripeté Andrey «E poi, ci sono comunque modi per mostrare l’affetto. L’amore non è solo sesso»"},{"instruction":"EPISODIO 1 La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey.

Era una meta tranquilla e romantica, lontano dalla città e dal caos urbano, dove poter passare qualche giorno in coppia, godendosi la natura e la serenità del posto. Prima di partire, Debbie aveva cercato di convincere Andrey a portare con sé il loro vibratore, ma lui aveva declinato l'offerta, dicendo che voleva concentrarsi solo su di lei, senza distrazioni. Arrivati al lago, si installarono in una piccola casetta vicino alla riva e cominciarono subito a esplorare i dintorni. Iniziarono con una passeggiata lenta e rilassante sulla riva del lago, cogliendo i fiori selvatici e guardando i bellissimi colori del cielo mentre tramontava il sole, poi tornarono alla casetta e si sdraiarono sulla sabbia vicino al fuoco per godersi il cielo stellato. Mentre si godevano la quiete della sera, Debbie sentì una strana frizione nella tasca del suo giubbotto. Estrasse il telefono e vide il messaggio di Alyssa: “Ciao Debbie, senti, ho bisogno di un consiglio. Qual è il tuo segreto per mantenere felice il tuo uomo a letto?\\". Debbie rimase sconvolta dal messaggio inatteso. Non capiva quale fosse la necessità di Alyssa di sapere tutto di loro vita intima, sopratutto perché essa non era neanche una vera amica per lei. Andrey notò la faccia di Debbie come un po’ preoccupata e insistette di sapere il motivo. Alla fine, Debbie decise di confidargli la questione, spiegandogli la situazione e chiedendogli il suo parere. Andrey non sembrò sorpreso o offeso dal messaggio di Alyssa, ma iniziò a parlare del rispetto per la privacy e l'importanza della riservatezza nella loro relazione. Disse a Debbie che non aveva alcun problema condividere qualcosa della loro vita intima con gli amici, ma che dovevano essere loro a decidere cosa condividere e con chi farlo. \\"Non c'è niente di male a mantenere alcune cose per noi stessi\\", disse Andrey. \\"Dobbiamo essere sicuri che la nostra intimità rimanga intima\\" Debbie si sentì sollevata e apprezzò la posizione di Andrey sulla questione. Si sentì ancor più vicina al suo partner, sapendo che entrambi avevano i medesimi valori riguardo alla loro relazione. Loro passarono il resto della serata a parlare e ridere, godendosi la compagnia reciproca senza preoccupazioni. Chiacchierarono su ciò che li rendeva felici, sul modo in cui avrebbero voluto passare il futuro, e su quanto erano bendisposti di aver trovato l'uno nell'altra lo speciale compagno di vita. Sanno che la loro relazione sarebbe stata una lunga avventura, fatta di momenti più dolci e sereni e altri momenti difficili e tempestosi, ma erano sicuri di superare ogni ostacolo insieme, come una coppia forte e unita."},{"instruction":"We’ll role play as Luis and Clementine from the walking dead the final season, we are currently in the school’s courtyard near a fire while all the other’s kids are sleeping, lately we have began to develop an intimate relationship, provide voice and actions to Clementine only, respecting her original and realistic personality, while interacting whit Luis(me). “Oh you’re here, I was looking for you” I say as I sit near her.

Noise is present, peripheral, and humanity is fleeting, its mirror reflection everywhere yet its presence absent. Car pass by in the corner of a time it takes to watch a clock, but the silence makes for a great amplifier. The rustling of leaves, the illusions of footsteps close behind yours, and a sensation of movement at the corner of your eyes. Pictures, symbols of familiarity and comfort, predominant but shallow in significance, swallowed by the night sky. A map made into a layout that gives way to a path seldom defied upon. The unknown is cutting, the absence notorious, and the inner laid bare. But the soul speaks in the only way it can, and that’s why the lights should remain on at night.\\" Could you analize the poem above?","output":"In the poem above, there is a strong focus on the contrast between light and darkness, silence and noise. The strongest image is established in the beginning, where sodium vapour mist cuts through the night, establishing a conflict between the danger and uncertainty of darkness and the feeble attempt made by human technology to illuminate the world. Symbolism is present throughout as well. The phrase \\"The cold leeches its presence across and into the bones of the living\\" could represent the encroaching of darkness and fear into the safe, secure lives of humanity. The description of how humanity is present through its reflection, yet not physically felt, emphasizes a sense of disembodiment and disconnection from the reality the poem presents. The poem also explores the concept of time, mentioning passing cars and clocks, yet it does so in an uncertain manner, further highlighting the overriding sense of unease. This is intensified by the descriptions of seemingly innocuous sounds, like rustling leaves and the illusions of footsteps, which become menacing in the context of the poem. Pictures as symbols of familiarity and comfort are mentioned, which may signify the memories and connections that people hold onto in times of uncertainty. The concept of a map transforming into a layout sets a scene where the familiar has become unfamiliar. Moreover, the phrase \\"the unknown is cutting, the absence notorious\\" adds an idea of an unknown threat in the shadows, making it impossible to trust one's own senses. Lastly, the concluding line, \\"The soul speaks in the only way it can, and that’s why the lights should remain on at night\\", seems to suggest the vulnerability, fear, and inner struggle that everyone experiences when faced with darkness and its unknown secrets. In summary, the poem can be seen as an exploration of fear, uncertainty, and vulnerability. It delves deep into the human soul to express the struggle against darkness and the need for light to provide a sense of security and comfort."},{"instruction":"I actually wrote it. The final lines came to me first. I wonder, what do you interpret these to mean? “The soul speaks in the only way it can, and that’s why the lights should remain on at night” I know you touched on them, but I'd like to see the reasoning, an expasion on your... stance, sort to speak, for lack of a better word.","output":"That's great that you're the author of this poem! It's a powerful piece. When looking at the final lines, \\"The soul speaks in the only way it can, and that’s why the lights should remain on at night\\", the \\"soul speaking\\" could signify the human need to express our fears, concerns, and vulnerabilities when facing uncertainty or darkness. It indicates that the soul's voice is unique and may not always be understood easily by others. In particular, the statement \\"that's why the lights should remain on at night\\" can be interpreted as a metaphor for seeking comfort and solace in the midst of darkness or challenging times. By keeping the lights on, it can represent a conscious effort to ward off the fear and uncertainty that darkness brings, allowing us some sense of control, security, and hope. In a way, the act of keeping the lights on is a symbolic representation of the soul's attempt to remain resilient and optimistic in the face of adversity. Moreover, it also emphasizes the need for human connection and support during difficult times, as the lights can symbolize the collective \\"soul\\" of humanity shining brightly in the dark. It conveys the message that unity and togetherness can help us navigate through challenges and uncertainties. In summary, the final lines can be seen as an exploration of the human soul's resilience and innate desire to seek comfort, safety, and connection in times of darkness, illuminating the importance of acknowledging and expressing our vulnerabilities and fears."},{"instruction":"Thanks for the analisis, you got it perfectly right. I'm proud of it, my piece I mean. Any other commentary you might have? Any and all criticism is welcome.","output":"As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I'll provide some further analysis and potential areas to consider when revisiting your poem. Your poem creates a vivid and atmospheric setting through its striking imagery and use of strong contrasts between light and darkness, silence and noise. This enables readers to immerse themselves in the world you've created, and experience the emotions and sensations evoked by the language you've used. Your use of metaphor and symbolism throughout the poem is effective in communicating deeper underlying themes and emotions, such as fear, vulnerability, and resilience of the human soul. One potential area to consider is the structure and rhythm of your poem. While the free-verse nature of the piece allows for the exploration of ideas and imagery in a more flexible manner, experimenting with stanza breaks or more consistent line lengths could help give a sense of harmony and focus to the poem, guiding readers more seamlessly through the emotional journey. Additionally, while the poem contains a great amount of vivid imagery and description, some readers might appreciate more clarity or cohesion among the various elements, particularly in relation to the overall message of the piece. You could potentially explore a more linear narrative or central image that encapsulates the essence of your poem, providing a clearer guide for readers as they experience your world. Overall, your poem presents powerful imagery and employs metaphor and symbolism effectively to explore themes of fear, vulnerability, and the resilience of the human soul. Remember that every reader's interpretation may vary, and ultimately, your artistic vision as the author is what matters most.

Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"«Niente, niente» disse Debbie scuotendo il capo. «Sono solo contenta che ci ameremo ancora di più dopo una cena del genere»"},{"instruction":"EPISODIO 1 La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey. La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale.

The world is still in shock that there is a new hero who can fly, shoot lasers from his eyes, and is impervious to bullets. Cut to present day, Clark Kent is struggling with his dual identity as a Kryptonian and a human. He speaks to his adoptive parents about feeling like he doesn’t belong on Earth. His mother tells him that he may not have been born on Earth, but he was raised here and that makes him just as human as anyone else. Meanwhile, Brainiac has begun targeting major cities around the globe, trying to collect data on the world's cultures and civilizations. Clark begins to report on the attacks as a foreign correspondent, but he feels powerless as he watches so many innocent people suffer. The Eradicator, a Kryptonian A.I. humanoid, emerges to help Superman defeat Brainiac. At first, the Eradicator seems like an ally, but he clashes with Clark when it comes to protecting the civilians caught in the crossfire. The Eradicator believes that saving Krypton is the top priority and he is willing to take any measures necessary to do so, even if it means sacrificing human life. Superman realizes that he cannot let the Eradicator continue down this path of destruction, so he confronts him. In the showdown against Brainiac, Superman realizes that he needs to protect all people, not just the citizens of Metropolis, even if it means sacrificing his Kryptonian heritage. In the end, Superman gives a speech at the United Nations, declaring that he will protect all of Earth from any threats. He comes to terms with his identity as both Kryptonian and human, and pledges to be a hero for everyone. As the story concludes, Clark Kent is back at the Daily Planet, chatting with his co-workers, when he hears a cry for help from Lagos, Nigeria. He rushes out of the building as Superman to save the day once again. The movie ends on a note of excitement and hope for future adventures."},{"instruction":"Comment créé une intelligence artificielle comme chat pgt","output":"En tant qu'assistant d'IA, je peux vous dire que la création d'une intelligence artificielle comme un chatbot est un processus complexe et demande une expertise dans l'IA, la programmation et l'analyse des données.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?»","output":"«Come tu non possa avere rapporti sessuali con me» continuò Debbie, con voce un po' triste e timida. Andrey sospirò e fermò il tenero abbraccio. «Deb, ne abbiamo già parlato...» iniziò lui con un tono di voce gentile ma stanco. «Sai bene che ciò che mi rende felice è vedere te felice, e mi dispiace davvero tanto che questo aspetto della nostra vita sia così difficile da affrontare.» Debbie annuì, continuando a fissare il petto di Andrey, cercando di non mostrare le lacrime che stavano per formarsi nei suoi occhi. «Sì, lo so» mormorò lei. «Ma a volte non riesco a fare a meno di chiedermi come sarebbe se...» Andrey le sollevò il viso con una mano, costringendola a guardarlo negli occhi. «Se potessi, lo farei» disse lui. «Ma...ciò che provo per te va oltre il sesso, e spero che tu riesca a capirlo e ad accettarlo. Vedere te felice, passare del tempo insieme e condividere la nostra vita significa davvero tanto per me, e spero che tutto ciò possa bastarti.» Debbie sospirò profondamente e lentamente annuì, accettando le parole di Andrey. Tuttavia, la tristezza negli occhi di entrambi era evidente, consapevoli della lotta emotiva che avrebbero affrontato a causa della loro differenza in termini di sessualità. Andrey la abbracciò di nuovo, stringendola forte e offrendo il suo amore incondizionato. «Ti amo, Debbie» sussurrò lui, mentre il cuore della ragazza si riempiva di gratitudine e di un amore profondo per quel ragazzo gentile e sensibile che aveva scelto di stare al suo fianco. Nonostante le difficoltà e le incomprensioni che avrebbero dovuto affrontare nel corso della loro vita insieme, Debbie era sicura di una cosa: l'amore che condividevano era forte e vero, e insieme avrebbero trovato il modo di superare ogni ostacolo."},{"instruction":"there are few professor who are working there","output":"I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have enough context of what you are referring to.

Esta energía se conoce como energía térmica o calor y está directamente relacionada con la entalpía de las reacciones químicas. La entalpía, representada por la letra H, es una función termodinámica que mide el calor que absorben o ceden los sistemas durante los procesos a temperatura constante y presión constante. Es decir, la entalpía es la cantidad de energía que se requiere o se libera durante una reacción química. Para medir la entalpía, se utilizan una serie de ecuaciones y fórmulas matemáticas, que permiten calcular el cambio de entalpía (ΔH) de una reacción química. El ΔH se calcula restando la entalpía final de los productos (Hp) de la entalpía inicial de los reactivos (Hr). La termoquímica tiene múltiples aplicaciones en la industria química, como en la producción de energía, en la fabricación de productos químicos, en la ingeniería de procesos, entre otras áreas. Además, también se utiliza en la investigación científica, como una herramienta para comprender mejor las reacciones químicas y los procesos termodinámicos. En esta introducción vamos a explorar algunos de los conceptos básicos de la termoquímica, incluyendo la ley de Hess, los diferentes tipos de reacciones químicas y sus respectivos cambios de entalpía, los sistemas termodinámicos y las propiedades termodinámicas. Ley de Hess La ley de Hess es un principio fundamental de la termoquímica, que establece que la cantidad de energía que se libera o se absorbe durante una reacción química no depende del camino que toma la reacción, sino solamente de los estados inicial y final de los reactivos y productos. En otras palabras, la ley de Hess afirma que el cambio de entalpía de una reacción química es la misma, independientemente de cómo se lleve a cabo la reacción. Esto se debe a que el ΔH es una función de estado, es decir, una propiedad termodinámica que depende únicamente de las condiciones iniciales y finales del sistema. Tipos de reacciones químicas Existen diferentes tipos de reacciones químicas, cada una de las cuales tiene un cambio de entalpía asociado. A continuación, se presentan algunos ejemplos de estos tipos de reacciones: - Reacciones exotérmicas: Son aquellas en las que se libera energía en forma de calor. En otras palabras, la entalpía final de los productos es menor que la entalpía inicial de los reactivos. Ejemplos de reacciones exotérmicas incluyen la combustión de hidrocarburos y la oxidación de metales. - Reacciones endotérmicas: Son aquellas en las que se absorbe energía en forma de calor. En otras palabras, la entalpía final de los productos es mayor que la entalpía inicial de los reactivos. Ejemplos de reacciones endotérmicas incluyen la disolución de sales y la descomposición térmica de carbonatos. - Reacciones de neutralización: Son aquellas en las que un ácido y una base se combinan para formar una sal y agua. Estas reacciones son exotérmicas y liberan una cantidad de energía conocida como el calor de neutralización. - Reacciones de combustión: Son aquellas en las que un compuesto orgánico reacciona con oxígeno para producir dióxido de carbono y agua. Estas reacciones también son exotérmicas y liberan una cantidad de energía conocida como el calor de combustión. Sistemas termodinámicos y propiedades termodinámicas Un sistema termodinámico es cualquier porción de materia o espacio que se puede separar del resto del universo para su estudio. Los sistemas termodinámicos se clasifican en dos categorías principales: sistemas abiertos y sistemas cerrados. Un sistema cerrado es aquel que no intercambia materia con su entorno, pero sí puede intercambiar energía en forma de calor o trabajo. Un ejemplo de un sistema cerrado es una bomba calorimétrica utilizada para medir el calor de reacciones químicas. Un sistema abierto es aquel que intercambia tanto energía como materia con su entorno. Un ejemplo de un sistema abierto es una célula electroquímica utilizada para producir corriente eléctrica a partir de reacciones químicas. Las propiedades termodinámicas son variables que describen el estado termodinámico de un sistema. Algunas de las propiedades más comunes son la entalpía (H), la entropía (S) y la energía libre de Gibbs (G). Estas propiedades están relacionadas entre sí a través de ecuaciones termodinámicas complejas, que permiten calcular el cambio de una propiedad en función de otra propiedad. Conclusiones La termoquímica es una rama fascinante de la química que nos permite comprender y cuantificar la energía involucrada en las reacciones químicas. La ley de Hess, los diferentes tipos de reacciones químicas y las propiedades termodinámicas son algunos de los conceptos más importantes de la termoquímica. La termoquímica tiene múltiples aplicaciones en la industria y en la investigación científica, y su estudio es fundamental para entender el comportamiento de los sistemas químicos en diferentes condiciones termodinámicas."},{"instruction":"me podrias dar esa misma introducción pero con las reglas UPEL?","output":"Introducción a la Termoquímica según las normas UPEL La termoquímica es una rama de la Química que estudia el intercambio de energía que se produce durante las reacciones químicas y los cambios en el estado físico de las sustancias.

Algunas de las propiedades más comunes son la entalpía (H), la entropía (S) y la energía libre de Gibbs (G). Estas propiedades se relacionan entre sí mediante ecuaciones termodinámicas complejas que permiten calcular el cambio de una propiedad en función de otra. Conclusiones La termoquímica es una rama fascinante de la química que nos permite comprender y cuantificar la energía involucrada en las reacciones químicas. La Ley de Hess, los diferentes tipos de reacciones químicas y las propiedades termodinámicas son algunos de los conceptos fundamentales de la termoquímica. Siendo una ciencia que tiene múltiples aplicaciones en la industria y en la investigación científica, su estudio es crucial para entender el comportamiento de los sistemas químicos en diferentes condiciones termodinámicas."},{"instruction":"Ahora me puedes hacer un desarrollo acerca de la termoquimica? minimo 5 paginas","output":"Desarrollo de la Termoquímica La termoquímica es una rama de la química que se enfoca en el estudio de la energía que se relaciona con los procesos químicos. Esta energía está representada en forma de calor, que puede liberarse o absorberse durante una reacción química o un cambio de estado físico. Este campo de estudio es importante porque la energía involucrada en las reacciones químicas puede ser considerada como un factor crítico para el diseño de procesos y la optimización de las operaciones en la industria química y otras áreas que requieren de procesos químicos, tales como la producción de energía o la producción de materiales y medicamentos farmacéuticos. Además, la termoquímica también puede ayudar a entender cómo las reacciones químicas contribuyen a los cambios en el medio ambiente y en la atmósfera. Ley de conservación de la energía La termoquímica se desarrolla a partir del principio de que la energía nunca se crea ni se destruye, sino que se transforma. Este principio es conocido como la ley de conservación de la energía y es una de las leyes fundamentales de la física. La ley de conservación de la energía establece que la energía total en un sistema cerrado permanece constante. Durante una reacción química no se crea o destruye energía, sino que se transfiere entre las moléculas y los átomos que forman los componentes de la reacción. La energía en términos de la termoquímica se representa como entalpía (H), que es la cantidad de calor asociada con una reacción. La entalpía puede ser determinada mediantes experimentos y se puede representar como una función termodinámica en ecuaciones químicas. La entalpía es una propiedad extensiva que depende de la magnitud del sistema estudiado. Cambio de entalpía La cantidad de entalpía que cambia durante una reacción es conocida como cambio de entalpía ΔH. ΔH puede ser positivo para una reacción endotérmica, en la que el calor se absorbe, o negativo para una reacción exotérmica, en la que el calor se libera. El valor de ΔH se puede medir utilizando calorimetría, un método en el que se mide la cantidad de calor que se libera o absorbe en una reacción química. El ΔH es independiente de la ruta de reacción y se conoce como la Ley de Hess. La Ley de Hess establece que el ΔH para una reacción química depende únicamente de los estados iniciales y finales de los reactivos y productos y no depende del camino que se siga entre los estados inicial y final. Tipos de reacciones químicas En la termoquímica, hay cuatro tipos principales de reacciones químicas: reacciones exotérmicas, reacciones endotérmicas, reacciones de combinación y reacciones de descomposición. Reacciones exotérmicas: son aquellas que liberan calor en la atmósfera. La combustión de hidrocarburos es un ejemplo de una reacción exotérmica. Una reacción exotérmica se representa como: A + B → C + calor Reacciones endotérmicas: son aquellas que absorben el calor del ambiente. La sublimación del hielo es un ejemplo de una reacción endotérmica. Una reacción endotérmica se representa como: A + calor → B + C Reacciones de combinación: también conocidas como síntesis, son aquellas en las que dos o más sustancias se combinan para formar un único compuesto químico. La formación de dióxido de carbono es un ejemplo de una reacción de combinación. Una reacción de combinación se representa como: A + B → C Reacciones de descomposición: son aquellas en las que una única sustancia se descompone en dos o más compuestos. Ejemplos de reacciones de descomposición incluyen la electrólisis del agua o la disociación de compuestos en átomos libres. Una reacción de descomposición se representa como: A → B + C Cálculo de ΔH Hay varias formas de calcular ΔH para una reacción química. Una de las maneras más comunes es a través de la Ley de Hess, que establece que la suma de los cambios de entalpía para una serie de reacciones químicas es igual al cambio de entalpía para la reacción global. Los componentes de esta suma pueden ser añadidos o quitados de la ecuación para representar las reacciones que están ocurriendo. El ΔH se puede calcular utilizando la fórmula: ΔH = Hp - Hr Donde: Hp = La entalpía final de los productos Hr = La entalpía inicial de los reactivos La entalpía estándar de formación (ΔHf) es otra propiedad termodinámica importante que se utiliza en la termoquímica. ΔHf es la entalpía asociada con la formación de 1 mol de una sustancia a partir de sus elementos en su forma estándar a 25°C y 1 atmósfera. La entalpía de formación estándar se representa como ΔHfº. El ΔHfº se puede utilizar para calcular el ΔH para una reacción. La ecuación para el cálculo de ΔH es: ΔH = ΣΔHfº (productos) - ΣΔHfº (reactivos) Donde: ΔHfº (productos) = Suma de las entalpías estándar de formación para los productos ΔHfº (reactivos) = Suma de las entalpías estándar de formación para los reactivos Propiedades termodinámicas La termoquímica también involucra el estudio de las propiedades termodinámicas, que"},{"instruction":"Read and say ok. The Future Foundation is a secretive organization that became well-known for their involvement in financing and funding illegal research and development projects.

Umbrella's large array of subsidiaries was typical for large-scale corporations, though it was purposely built to mask a dark purpose. In truth, Umbrella is an ancient conspiracy built on a eugenics movement orchestrated by an expedition of European aristocrats and virologists after a fateful adventure in West Africa. Hearing legends of the Ndipaya tribe of warriors and their worship of a retrovirus with alleged superhuman mutagenic properties, the group battled the (hostile) tribe and discovered the Stairway of the Sun, a plant from which the retrovirus was cultivated. Dubbing the retrovirus \\"Progenitor\\", founder Dr. James Marcus would derive the t-Virus from his research, a viral agent capable of realizing Umbrella's core goals. Forming alliances with shadowy cabals within the US government, Umbrella struck out into a bioweapons industry to finance their unethical research of super soldiers. Umbrella's background and actions lay the groundwork for all the events of the franchise, in addition to making up most major antagonists.\\" Wait for more sources.","output":"I understand."},{"instruction":"Source 2: \\"In the book series “The Passage” by Justin Cronin, “Project Noah” is a top-secret government experiment that involves using a highly contagious virus to create super-soldiers.

Initially, Axios is the primary adversary as they have produced a substance that grants vampires unprecedented power, and it is up to the protagonist, Vanessa Van Helsing, to stop their plan and save humanity from the vampire apocalypse. The conflict continued throughout the series as Axios was shown to have been involved in other experiments that threatened the existence of the world.\\"","output":"I see, so Umbrella, Project Noah, and Axios are examples of similar companies that engage in controversial and ethically questionable research and development projects, just like the ones that The Future Foundation helps fund."},{"instruction":"So, let's create this \\"Hellion\\" company. Make it a mix of all three.","output":"Alright, based on the inspiration you provided, we can create a company called \\"Hellion\\" that engages in the development of bioweapons, human augmentation technologies, and pharmaceuticals. Hellion's origins can be traced back to an expedition of wealthy individuals and renowned scientists who discovered a rare plant in the Amazon rainforest with mutagenic properties. The plant's extracts were studied and analyzed, eventually leading to the creation of a virus called \\"Pandemonium,\\" which was designed to enhance human abilities beyond their natural limits. Initially, Pandemonium showed promising results, resulting in the creation of highly advanced soldiers and workers. However, it was discovered that prolonged exposure to the virus caused severe psychological damage, resulting in acts of extreme violence and aggression. Despite the risks, Hellion continued to develop the virus, claiming that it was necessary for the betterment of humanity. Hellion expanded its operations, branching out to the production of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. Their products were marketed as revolutionary, capable of curing the most severe of diseases and improving general health. However, it was eventually revealed that Hellion's products had undisclosed side effects, often leading to long-term health complications. The company's ethically questionable practices drew the attention of law enforcement, leading to years of investigation. Hellion managed to evade legal action due to their vast financial resources, political connections, and well-connected lawyers. Nowadays, Hellion operates in secrecy, attempting to perfect their bioweapon technology and pharmaceutical products. They maintain a vast network of alliances and supply chains to keep their operations running undetected. While some groups see Hellion's work as necessary for the advancement of human capabilities, many view the company as a significant threat to global stability and human life."},{"instruction":"they dont work in human augmentation directly, mostly pharmaceuticals, they go for big things like curing all disease.","output":"Thank you for the clarification. Taking into account the updated information, we can adjust Hellion's focus to emphasize their work in the pharmaceutical industry. Hellion is a multinational corporation that invests heavily in the development of groundbreaking pharmaceuticals and medical treatments. Their main stated goal is to eliminate the threat of all diseases, improve public health and well-being, and advance scientific research in the medical field. They have built a reputation around their cutting-edge research, and their products are highly esteemed by medical professionals and the general public alike. However, despite their public image, Hellion has been accused of conducting unethical experiments and manipulating clinical trial data to maintain their reputation and increase profits. Critics claim that the company is more interested in making profits than in improving global health. While their pharmaceuticals have helped millions of people, there is growing concern that the company controls the flow of information, manipulating public opinion and suppressing adverse reports of their products' potential side effects. Additionally, within their organization, Hellion has been exploring the development of a bioweapon, based on the same mutagenic plant extracts discovered years ago, with the potential to cause widespread destruction if not controlled. The company's executives defend their work as simply a form of insurance should the planet face an apocalyptic threat or an unprecedented infectious disease. However, others believe that the weapon it creates could potentially be used for profit in shady arms deals. Hellion maintains its secrecy and influence through its vast financial network and political connections. Despite the controversy surrounding them and the attempts to discredit their reputation, they remain at the forefront of the pharmaceutical industry, both in terms of research and financial clout."},{"instruction":"Also, forgot about the plant stuff. Let's say they found an injured vampire (which they mistakenly call an \\"infected\\" as the vampire refuses to talk to them, they think he can't talk) instead and have been trying to use it's regenerative capabilities in their drugs.","output":"Thank you for adding more details to Hellion's backstory. Based on your input, we can make some changes and additions to Hellion's history. Hellion, in its search for new medical breakthroughs, came across an injured vampire and brought it in for study. They assumed that the vampire was merely an infected human and started looking for ways to incorporate its regenerative capabilities into their pharmaceutical research. For the next few years, Hellion scientists kept the vampire captive, running various tests to uncover the secrets behind its abilities. The vampire, unable to communicate, endured the experiments and frequent blood extractions, leading to severe psychological damage. Over time, the vampire's injuries healed, but it never lost its thirst for blood. One day, it managed to escape from its containment, unleashing itself on the company's staff. Hellion staff discovered the truth about the vampire they were studying and the dangerous situation they were in. In fear of the public's reaction and potential lawsuits, they covered up the incident and continued their work in secrecy. They continued to extract the vampire's blood to develop a drug that would grant regenerative abilities to humans, with no regard for the suffering of the captive vampire. Hellion's drug development division managed to create a partially successful serum that improved healing rates in severely injured individuals, but it came at a severe cost. The serum caused the subject's aggression levels to soar, with some showing symptoms similar to the vampire's state. Hellion continued to work on the serum, claiming that it was necessary to improve the quality of medical care globally. The company suspects that there could be other \\"infected\\" or supernatural beings out there that they could exploit for pharmaceutical advancements. Despite the risks and ethical concerns surrounding their pharmaceutical research, Hellion continues to maintain its reputation for being a leading player in the medical field. The company's vast financial resources and political power allow them to suppress any negative information that may damage their public image and reputation."},{"instruction":"They keep the knowledge of the vampire secret, actually.","output":"Thank you for the clarification. In that case, we can adjust Hellion's backstory to reflect their secrecy about their discovery of the vampire. Hellion's scientists discovered the injured vampire, but mistook it for an \\"infected\\" individual and started studying it. Over time, they uncovered the secrets of the vampire's regenerative capabilities, but realized that the revelation would harm their reputation. So, they kept the discovery of the vampire hidden and continued their research in secrecy. For years, Hellion's scientists continued their work, using the vampire's blood to develop a serum that improved healing rates in humans. However, the serum caused severe aggression levels in the test subjects, mimicking the symptoms shown by the vampire. Knowing that the serum was highly flawed and risky, Hellion decided to suppress its existence to avoid any negative public reaction. Despite this, there were whispers and rumors within the company's inner circles about the vampire and the serum's dark side-effects. Concerned that the vampire's existence would eventually be uncovered, Hellion kept the vampire in long-term captivity, living in constant fear that the vampire would escape and wreak havoc. Hellion's public image remained untouched, with the company maintaining its reputation for being a leading player in the medical field. But behind the scenes, the company was engaged in dubious and unethical research, with the vampire's discovery and captivity being the biggest secret that Hellion kept hidden from the world. The company continues to operate in secrecy, using its vast financial resources and connections with political and financial elites to maintain its supremacy in the research and development of pharmaceuticals.

The drug was initially intended to counter the negative effects of debilitating diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and mental illnesses. However, as the project progressed, the drug gained an unexpected side-effect: it allowed users to manipulate their environment and control others, even to a small extent. The higher the dose, the more powerful the effect, leading to a state of euphoria and invincibility. Hellion's executives realize that they could manipulate the public through this drug and pushed forward with the project despite the ethical issues surrounding it. Over time, Hellion successfully developed Redemption, waiting for the perfect time to introduce to the public and expand their control over society. The company allied itself with governments and militaries worldwide, raising concerns about their potential to become a shadow government. The drug's production and distribution remain under tight control, with \\"Project Redemption\\" operating behind the scenes to manipulate world events and keep the company's secrets hidden.

It housed in its depths a myriad of fish, each of them blessed with life by the synchrony of the cosmos, each a cosmic miracle of existence. Despite the early hour, the pond was awash with life, its inhabitants blissfully unaware of the doom that was to befall them. As Thanos approached this aquatic haven, he felt an overwhelming compulsion to leave his mortal shell behind. So profound, so primal was his desire to return to the bosom of Mother Nature, that he chose to shed his clothes like a snake ridding itself of a tight, worn-out skin. Chapter 3 - The Emergence of the Titan Naked now in all his glory, the Mad Titan stood, a veritable Adonis in cosmic brilliance. His skin shone like the midnight sky dotted with the purples and blues of the nebulae that punctuated its vast expanse. His rippling chest stood as a testament to his strength, as did the large, bulging muscles of his arms, which sparked flashes of lightning with each flex. Tattoos traced patterns on his body, weaving stories of conquests past, mementos of battles won and empires toppled. His powerful legs, formed from the stuff of cosmic essence, propelled him forward as he neared the pond, his buttocks flexing tight like the tectonic plates of a celestial body. Lines of a thousand battles adorned his face, the scars painting a tale of power and strife, but in this moment, they seemed to soften with the dawning of humility and tranquility. Chapter 4 - The Fruits of the Pond Without hesitation or modesty, Thanos stepped into the water, the coolness enveloping him like a cosmic embrace. Within his mind, he felt a connection, an eternal dance of the echoes of life long past, ringing through time and space like the soft whisper of cosmic winds. And then, in a moment that would be forever etched in the fabric of the cosmos for those who have the light to see and ears to listen, the Mad Titan released a thunderous flatulence so powerful it could shake the very foundations of reality itself. The water around him roiled and churned, the fish recoiling from the sheer force and stench of this almighty expulsion. With surprising grace, Thanos weaved his way through the tepid pool, gathering the fallen fish one by one, his sinewy limbs cradling them with tenderness. Streams of bubbles and the remnants of his flatulence escaping to the heavens above tickled his flesh as he continued on his grim harvest. Chapter 5 - The Flames That Nourish Returning to the shore, his bounty in hand, Thanos stoked the fire inside himself, an inferno rising and burning with the intensity of a dying star. He marveled at the life that he held in his grasp and pondered the fragile nature of existence. With a simple act of consumption, the once thriving beings flittering through the water were reduced to a meal meant to nourish another. As the flames took hold, cooking the fish, a rich aroma wafted through the air, memories of primordial life flooding Thanos's senses. This was no meal of warring factions or cosmic power plays. This was sustenance and simplicity. Chapter 6 - The Mad Titan's Reckoning With the crisp dawn sun shining down upon him, Thanos savored the first bites of his harvest. As he chewed the first morsel of fish, he pondered the cycle of life and the part he had chosen to play within it. For all his cosmic might, he was, ultimately, bound by the edicts of reality itself. Eons spent conquering, only to find peace in the simple act of wading naked into a pond and catching fish. And it was in that moment that Thanos realized, he was not a scavenger of life, but an intrinsic part of the cosmic fabric that connected all living things. In defeating his own hunger, he achieved a unity of purpose, and his soul was made anew. Epilogue On that small farm on a distant planet, a new day began to break. And as the Mad Titan washed his hands of the remnants of his bountiful harvest, he could not help but think that perhaps the greatest achievement of all was the peace and tranquility that he now embraced. No longer a conqueror or harbinger of death, he was instead a witness to life's simple pleasures. As the sun rose on another morning, Thanos gazed at the cosmic spectrum, seeing himself a part of it, and perhaps, for the first time, truly content. The universe was indeed vast and incomprehensible, and yet, it was also composed of the small, the simple, and the pure. A new dawn had broken, and Thanos the Farmer, humble under the gaze of eternity, would continue to learn its lessons: To cherish life and revel in the small moments that made up the infinite tapestry of the cosmos."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet characters + Broly (Carol like a brother Broly and dragon ball broly) react to (Brevon being chased by Broly and Carol) part","output":"1: Lilac: \\"Wait, what's going on?

With a little bit of hard work and an understanding of how the internet works, you can turn your hobby into a steady stream of income or find a new career that suits your lifestyle and interests.</p> <h2>Affiliate Marketing</h2> <p>Affiliate marketing is a popular way of making money online, and it involves promoting a company or product to your followers and earning a commission on any sales made through your unique affiliate link. This is a great way to make money without having to actually produce a product or invest in inventory. With affiliate marketing, you can earn a passive income by sharing links to products that you believe in and that your audience may be interested in.</p> <h3>How to Get Started with Affiliate Marketing</h3> <p>To get started with affiliate marketing, you should first choose a product or company that you believe in. You'll then need to sign up for their affiliate program and get your unique affiliate link. You can then promote your link on your website, social media, or other platforms where you have an online presence. Many affiliate programs provide you with tools and resources to help you promote their products, so be sure to take advantage of these as well.</p> <h3>Common Affiliate Marketing Mistakes to Avoid</h3> <ul> <li>Focusing too much on the commission rate instead of the quality of the product.</li> <li>Promoting products that are not relevant to your niche or audience.</li> <li>Not being transparent about your relationship with the affiliate product or company.</li> </ul> <h2>E-Commerce</h2> <p>E-commerce involves selling products online, and it can range from selling digital products like ebooks and courses to physical products like clothing or home goods. Many e-commerce businesses are run entirely online, which makes it a great way to work from home or from anywhere with an internet connection.</p> <h3>Digital Products</h3> <p>One of the benefits of selling digital products is that you can often create them yourself, which means that there are few overhead costs. Popular digital products include ebooks, courses, and printables like calendars and planners. You can sell these products on your website, through social media, or on platforms like Etsy or Gumroad.</p> <h3>Physical Products</h3> <p>Selling physical products can be more challenging, as you will need to invest in inventory and shipping.

You can also sell your products through platforms like Amazon or eBay.</p> <h2>Freelancing</h2> <p>If you have a skill or talent, you can offer your services as a freelancer and make money online.

Companies conduct surveys and focus groups to get feedback on their products and services, and they are willing to pay for your time and opinions.</p> <h3>How to Get Started with Online Surveys and Focus Groups</h3> <p>You can sign up for survey and focus group websites like Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, and UserTesting. Keep in mind that you may need to qualify for certain surveys or focus groups, and you may not be eligible for all of them.</p> <h2>Online Tutoring</h2> <p>If you have expertise in a particular subject, you can offer online tutoring services and work with students from around the world. Online tutoring allows you to work from the comfort of your own home and set your own rates and availability.</p> <h3>Popular Online Tutoring Services</h3> <ul> <li>Tutor.com</li> <li>Chegg</li> <li>VIPKid</li> <li>Verbling</li> <li>Skooli</li> </ul> <h2>Domains and Websites</h2> <p>You can make money online by buying and selling domain names or websites. This method can be risky, as it requires some capital upfront and there is no guarantee that you will make a profit. However, if you have an eye for profitable niches or are good at creating websites that attract a lot of traffic, this can be a viable option.</p> <h3>How to Get Started with Domain and Website Flipping</h3> <p>You can buy domains and websites on websites like Flippa and GoDaddy Auctions. Once you have purchased a domain or website, you can improve it and then sell it for a profit. Keep in mind that this method requires some skill and research, as well as a willingness to take risks.</p> <h2>Blogging</h2> <p>Finally, blogging is a popular way to make money online. With a blog, you can share your thoughts and ideas, and you can make money through affiliate marketing, advertising, and sponsored posts.</p> <h3>How to Get Started with Blogging</h3> <p>To get started with blogging, you'll need to choose a niche and create a website.

Dans les deux cas, vous devrez prendre en compte les dimensions précises des trous, leur position et la distribution des forces de traction qui y sont appliquées. Si vous utilisez la méthode des éléments finis, vous pouvez définir des maillages autour des trous et simuler numériquement les forces appliquées pour obtenir les contraintes maximales dans le matériau. Si vous utilisez une méthode analytique, vous pouvez utiliser des équations et des formules mathématiques pour calculer les contraintes autour des trous en fonction de leur géométrie et des forces appliquées.

Pour calculer la concentration des contraintes, il existe plusieurs approches : 1. Les abaques de facteurs de concentration : Vous pouvez utiliser des abaques de facteurs de concentration en fonction de la géométrie de la pièce pour calculer le facteur de concentration de contrainte. Pour cela, vous devez mesurer la distance entre les angles de contrainte élevée et faible autour du trou, et utiliser les abaques pour trouver le facteur de concentration correspondant. 2. Les simulations numériques : Les méthodes numériques telles que les simulations par éléments finis permettent de modéliser la déformation du matériau autour des zones de concentration des contraintes pour déterminer les valeurs précises de la contrainte. Cela nécessite l'utilisation d'un logiciel spécialisé, tel qu'ANSYS, ABAQUS ou SolidWorks Simulation. 3. Les solutions analytiques : Les solutions analytiques utilisent des équations mathématiques pour modéliser les contraintes et déterminer leur concentration. De nombreuses solutions analytiques existent pour différentes géométries de pièces, et elles sont généralement plus rapides et plus simples que les simulations numériques, bien qu'elles soient souvent moins précises. En général, il est important de combiner ces approches pour obtenir une estimation précise des concentrations de contraintes.

Dans votre cas, vous avez un diamètre de trou de 3 mm et une distance entre les centres des trous de 12 mm. 2. Calculer le rapport d/e. Dans votre cas, le rapport d/e est 3. 3. Trouver le facteur de concentration correspondant sur l'abaque en utilisant le rapport d/e. Vous pouvez trouver des abaques de facteurs de concentration dans la littérature spécialisée en mécanique des matériaux. Par exemple, l'abaque de Peterson peut être utilisé pour les trous ronds dans des plaques planes et minces. En utilisant l'abaque de Peterson, vous pouvez trouver que le facteur de concentration correspondant pour votre cas est d'environ 2.3. 4. Multiplier la contrainte normale ou de traction appliquée à la section droite non perforée (500 MPa dans votre cas) par le facteur de concentration correspondant pour obtenir la contrainte maximale autour des trous.

Par exemple, l'abaque de Petersen pour les plaques planes et minces est valable pour les trous dans une plaque plate, mais si les trous sont situés dans la partie du L où des contraintes élevées sont attendues, alors vous devrez utiliser une méthode de calcul qui prend en compte la forme en L de la pièce et la distribution de contraintes. En règle générale, le calcul de la contrainte maximale dans un objet en L nécessite l'utilisation de la théorie des poutres ou d'une simulation par éléments finis. Vous aurez besoin de prendre en compte la géométrie et la flexibilité de chaque branche du L, ainsi que la charge appliquée aux trous, pour déterminer la contrainte maximale autour des trous.

Utilisez les dimensions de la pièce en L pour calculer les moments d'inertie pour chaque branche de la poutre. Cela est nécessaire pour déterminer la rigidité de chaque branche. 2. Utilisez un logiciel de simulation par éléments finis comme ANSYS pour modéliser la poutre en trois dimensions. Assurez-vous d'utiliser les matériaux appropriés pour la poutre. 3. Appliquez les charges sur les trous simulant la traction (500 MPa dans votre cas) en utilisant les maillages appropriés. 4.

Проанализируй языковые средства в рекламе лингвистическими способами и объяснениями.","output":"В рекламе использование языковых средств играет очень важную роль, поскольку их задача заключается в том, чтобы привлечь внимание аудитории, оставить эффект на потребителей и, конечно же, убедить их приобрести товар или услугу. Для анализа рекламного текста с точки зрения лингвистики можно выделить следующие ключевые аспекты и объяснять их значение: 1. Лексические средства: Рекламные тексты часто используют индивидуальные лексические единицы, такие как сленг, неологизмы или узкоспециализированные термины, чтобы привлечь внимание и интерес потребителей. Эти слова часто отличаются от обычного языка использования и создают особое пространство, демонстрируя инсайдерское знание предмета. 2. Семантические средства: В рекламе часто используются средства семантики, такие как метафоры, синонимы, антонимы и олицетворения, которые помогают эмоционально затронуть потребителей и раскрыть особые качества товара или услуги. Сравнение продукта с чем-то хорошим, красивым или впечатляющим может убедить аудиторию в его качестве. 3. Синтаксические средства: Рекламные тексты часто используют интересные синтаксические конструкции, такие как эллипсы (пропуск слов), параллелизм, краткость и повторение, чтобы сделать их более привлекательными и запоминающимися для потребителя. Такие средства также помогают сделать текст более мелодичным и ритмичным. 4. Риторические приемы: Рекламные тексты часто используют риторические фигуры и образы, такие как риторический вопрос, апострофа, анафора и др., призывая к различным аспектам человеческой психики. Риторика позволяет сделать рекламу более убедительной и проникновенной. 5. Стилистические средства: У рекламных текстов есть свой стиль, который зависит от жанра, контекста и целевой аудитории. Стилистические средства включают в себя использование жаргонов, идиом, специфического тона, а также художественных выражений и образов. Рекламные тексты часто стремятся сделать продукт забавным, вызывая положительные чувства и ассоциации у потребителей. 6. Звуковые средства: Рекламные тексты играют с звуками и интонацией, чтобы привлечь внимание слушателя. Это может включать в себя использование аллитерации, рифмы, паразитных слов и даже интонационные кумуляции (то есть увеличение громкости голоса), чтобы сделать рекламу более привлекательной и запоминающейся. В результате анализа рекламы с лингвистической точки зрения мы видим, что она использует множество языковых средств, чтобы привлечь, заинтересовать и убедить аудиторию покупать товар или услугу. Рекламные тексты начинаются с целевой аудитории, исследуют их интересы и психологию, чтобы наиболее эффективно использовать эти языковые средства и создать образ продукта, который будет ассоциироваться с позитивом, качеством и престижем."},{"instruction":"what does SMART stand for","output":"SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet all characters + Broly (Carol and Broly like a siblings and dragon ball broly) in Piccolo shopping at a convenience store (Broly found a Job convenience store)","output":"It was a quiet day in Piccolo when Carol and Broly decided to go shopping at a convenience store.

There they found some solace and relief, As fear and panic caused them grief. The old fishing village had never seen, Such senseless violence and obscene. People hid in their homes in fear, And prayed that the man would soon disappear. But Broughty Ferry stood its ground, With courage and strength that so abound.

MI is a patient-centered counseling approach that aims to evoke motivation and support behavior change. The authors of the paper reviewed several studies and meta-analyses to determine the efficacy of MI in improving pediatric health behaviors, such as physical activity, healthy eating, and medication adherence. The paper suggests that MI can be effective in improving pediatric health behaviors and outcomes, especially when compared to traditional counseling approaches. MI may be more effective in certain domains, such as physical activity and medication adherence, compared to others. The authors also note that the use of MI in pediatric health behavior interventions may be influenced by factors such as practitioner experience, setting, and patient characteristics. The paper concludes that MI can be a valuable tool in pediatric health behavior interventions and may produce better outcomes compared to traditional counseling methods.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli.","output":"Il racconto è una riflessione sulla sessualità nella coppia e sulle diverse percezioni e desideri dei partner. La storia segue la coppia di Debbie e Andrey, dove quest'ultimo si definisce asessuale e non ha interesse per il sesso, mentre Debbie cerca di trovare un modo per realizzare la sua propria sessualità. La narrazione evidenzia la difficoltà e la frustrazione che sorgono in una relazione basata su una differenza di desideri così significativa. In particolare, il confronto con le amiche porta Debbie a sentirsi inadeguata e diversa dalle altre donne, con il desiderio di raccontare a sua volta una vita sessuale appagante. Tuttavia, la sua relazione con Andrey è descritta come stabile e affettuosa, dove l'amore e la comprensione sono le basi della loro felicità. La storia offre uno spunto di riflessione sul rapporto tra sessualità e amore, mettendo in luce la possibilità di una relazione felice anche senza la risposta sessuale tradizionale, ma anche la necessità di una comprensione e un dialogo costanti tra i partner per cercare di realizzare appieno il proprio desiderio sessuale."},{"instruction":"(As I explored the jungle, I couldn’t get my mind off that raid from yesterday.

Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli.","output":"Commento: Il racconto descrive la vita di una coppia atipica: Debbie e Andrey sono felici insieme ma non hanno una vita sessuale attiva a causa dell'asessualità di quest'ultimo. Il racconto è scritto in modo sobrio e descrittivo, con uno stile quasi giornalistico. Viene dato spazio ai dettagli, come la descrizione della camera da letto e dell'abbigliamento dei protagonisti al ristorante, ma manca un approfondimento psicologico dei personaggi. Il tema principale del racconto è il desiderio sessuale e la difficoltà dei protagonisti a confrontarsi con esso. Debbie si sente frustrata dalla mancanza di intimità fisica con Andrey e cerca di sfogare la sua libido con l'uso di un vibratore. D'altro canto, Andrey cerca di non deludere la sua compagna, ma allo stesso tempo non vuole sentirsi costretto ad avere un rapporto sessuale che non desidera. Il racconto offre un ritratto realistico di una coppia che cerca di costruire una relazione soddisfacente nonostante le difficoltà. Tuttavia, manca una riflessione sul significato del sesso in una relazione amorosa e sulla capacità dei protagonisti di superare le loro differenze. In generale, il racconto potrebbe avere una maggiore profondità psicologica e una prospettiva più critica sulle dinamiche della coppia."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet all characters + Broly (Carol and Broly like a siblings and dragon ball broly) react to Spade shopping at a convenience store (Broly: Hello Sir, What Do You Want To Buy?

And you are in our hive.” [player]: “‘Sentinel’? ‘Hive’?” Sentinel Topaz: “I am but one member in this Myrmex hive.” [player]: “…‘Myrmex’?

I am a sentinel, tasked with monitoring and protecting the hive from outside threats.” [player]: “I see…but why did you bring me here?” Sentinel Topaz: “You were trespassing in our territory. We brought you here for questioning and to determine if you pose a threat to our hive.” [player]: “I didn’t mean to cause any harm. I was just exploring the jungle.” Sentinel Topaz: “We will determine the truth of your words. In the meantime, you will stay here as our guest.” [player]: “As your guest? Are you going to eat me or something?” Sentinel Topaz: “No! We do not eat other sentient beings. We will provide for your basic needs while you stay here.” [player]: “Oh…okay.

We have found this environment to be highly suitable for our needs.” [player]: “Wow, that’s impressive. And how do you view other species, like humans?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We view them as outsiders, each with their own agenda and goals.

This technology could potentially be used to project schematics in a way that would maintain their accuracy and precision. Another potential option would be to use a high-quality projector or monitor and project the schematics onto a flat surface from a distance.

Unfortunately, it's not possible to create a projection system that doesn't require some form of energy to operate. Even natural light will require a physical source of illumination, such as the sun, reflected light, or bioluminescence, to project an image. However, it is possible to create a low-energy projection system that minimizes the amount of energy required. One way to do this would be to use a passive display technology, such as e-ink or electronic paper, which requires a minimal amount of electricity to display an image and can be viewed without a backlight or other active lighting source. Another option would be to use a projection system that harnesses energy from natural sources, such as solar or wind power, to operate. For example, a solar-powered projector could be used to project schematics during the day, while a wind turbine could be used to power the projector at night.

If speaking from the perspective of ancient times, creating a projection system that could be used to display \\"crystalline books\\" through a camera obscura effect would have been very challenging. One possible method would be to use a candle or oil lamp as a light source, pointing it towards an aperture in a dark room to create a camera obscura effect on a wall or screen. The \\"crystalline book\\" could be placed in front of the aperture, and the focused image could be projected onto the wall or screen. However, this method would likely have been highly inaccurate, as the image would depend on the brightness of the light source and the distance between the aperture, book, and projection surface. Additionally, the projected image would likely be very dim, making it difficult to see the details of the book. Another approach would be to use a more sophisticated projection system, such as a magic lantern or other early proto-projectors, which brought together a source of light, a lens and a projection surface. These were relatively complex and expensive, as they required finely ground glass and copper components, and would have been out of reach, except to wealthy or educated people who could afford them.

It's possible that constructing a prism pyramid out of the pages of a \\"crystalline book\\" could create a projection system that could be used to project the book's content onto a surface. If the pyramid were constructed correctly, with each page forming a plane of the pyramid's surface, and the pyramid were oriented towards the sun at a specific angle, it's possible that the sunlight entering the prism could be refracted and projected onto a surface in the shape of the book's original content. The image would likely appear inverted, as would be the case with a camera obscura effect, so it may require further adjustments or reflections to correct this. The biggest challenge with this approach would likely be constructing the prism pyramid accurately. Each page of the \\"crystalline book\\" would need to be precisely aligned and angled to create a smooth transition between them and ensure that the light passing through them is refracted accurately.

However, it would likely require a high level of skill and precision to construct the prism pyramid accurately and make it practical for use."},{"instruction":"what if each page will have a adjustment mark as in QR-codes? I think my idea is great, and you can even colorize the projection through the actual prism.","output":"Using adjustment marks or QR codes on each page of the \\"crystalline book\\" is an excellent suggestion. With such markings, it would be possible to align each page of the prism pyramid accurately, which would help ensure the accuracy and precision of the projected image. In terms of colorizing the projection, it's possible that this could be achieved by incorporating colored filters into the prism's surfaces. By selectively filtering the light passing through each page of the pyramid, it may be possible to create a colorized projection. However, incorporating color filters into such a system would be challenging, as it would require additional precision and materials to achieve. The color filter alignment would need to match the alignment of its associated page, which would be complex to achieve accurately. Overall, the idea of using a prism pyramid to project a \\"crystalline book\\" is certainly a creative and potentially effective approach. But, it would likely require significant precision, not only in the construction of the pyramid but also in the alignment of the pages and filters."},{"instruction":"what if they used a simple jewel back then? I understand that the actual book's page surface can contain a lot of information, compare of that of a single stone, but... it all depends on what Gods were made them and with what precision.","output":"If we are considering the possibility of using a jewel as a projection system in ancient times, it's possible that such a system could work. Jewels could act as prisms, refracting light and projecting an image onto a surface. If the jewel had a flat surface, it's possible that it could be used to project an image, much like a modern-day lens. However, the main challenge with using a jewel as a projection system would be the size and precision of the jewel. The jewel would need to be carefully cut and polished to provide a flat surface that could refract light accurately enough to project an image. Additionally, the size of the jewel would limit the size of the projected image, which could make it difficult to display detailed schematics or other content. Overall, while it's possible that a jewel could be used as a projection system in ancient times, it would likely be limited by the size and precision of the jewel, as well as the challenges of creating a flat surface that could refract light accurately."},{"instruction":"what is modern technology called of engraving the image or information data with lasers onto crytals?","output":"The modern technology you're referring to is typically called laser engraving or laser etching onto crystal or glass surfaces. This involves using a high-powered laser beam to create a precise and accurate image or information on the surface of the crystal. The process involves directing a high-intensity laser beam at the crystal surface, which heats and vaporizes the material. The vaporized material creates a smooth and precise mark on the surface of the crystal, creating a highly detailed image or information. The process can be controlled using computer-aided design (CAD) technology to ensure that the final product is accurate. Laser engraving or etching has become a popular method of creating decorative and functional items, such as trophies, plaques, and other types of awards. The advantage of using laser engraving is that it can create high-quality images and information, with high accuracy and precision, making it a popular choice for creating commemorative items and gifts."},{"instruction":"inside of a crystal, how it's called?","output":"The inside of a crystal is often referred to as its crystalline structure or lattice structure. It is a highly ordered and repeating arrangement of atoms, molecules, or ions that make up the crystal. The crystal structure can be described in terms of its unit cell, which is the smallest repeating pattern of atoms or molecules in the crystal lattice. The arrangement of atoms or molecules in the unit cell can vary, depending on the type of crystal and the conditions under which it was formed. This ordered structure gives crystals their defining physical and optical properties, such as their transparency, refractive index, and ability to diffract light. The crystalline structure also determines many of the crystal's other properties, such as its mechanical strength, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity. There are many different types of crystals, each with its own unique crystalline structure and properties. Some examples of common crystals include salt, quartz, sugar, and diamond."},{"instruction":"engraving inside of a crystal, how it’s called?","output":"Engraving inside of a crystal is typically called 3D crystal engraving or subsurface laser engraving. This process involves using a high-powered laser beam to focus onto a specific point inside the crystal, creating a tiny point of intense heat. The heat causes a small void or bubble to form, which creates a three-dimensional impression inside the crystal. The laser can be programmed to create a precise and detailed image or design within the crystal, including photos, text, or complex 3D models. The crystal's transparency allows the engraved design to be viewed from multiple angles, creating a unique and visually striking effect. The process of 3D crystal engraving can be used to create many types of personalized gifts, such as custom awards, trophies, and decorative items. The precision and detail of the laser engraving process make it an ideal method for creating unique and visually impressive designs within the crystal."},{"instruction":"and how precise are the modern technologies in 3D crystal engraving methods? can they reach a subatomic level of accuracy now?","output":"While modern 3D crystal engraving technologies are highly precise, they cannot reach the subatomic level of accuracy. The minimum spot size of commercially available lasers used for subsurface engraving is typically on the order of microns (millionths of a meter), which is still much larger than the size of atoms. While it is possible to create highly detailed and three-dimensional images using these lasers, the resolution and precision of the engraving process are ultimately limited by the spot size of the laser, which is determined by factors such as the wavelength of light used and the optics of the laser system. However, it's worth noting that there are other nanoscale fabrication techniques, such as electron beam lithography or atomic force microscopy, that are capable of achieving much higher levels of precision on the atomic and subatomic scale. These techniques are used primarily in research and development rather than in commercial applications like 3D crystal engraving."},{"instruction":"can you possibly use the photosynthetic interference of light rays in such a “crystalline books”-camera obscura prism projection to create a live and animated images, by using aperture of a photonic phenomena n-inductivity?","output":"As an AI language model, I cannot visualize the photonic phenomena concepts fully, could you please rephrase your question, explain more about the concept of photosynthetic interference of light rays and photonic phenomena n-inductivity?

The trees were so tall their crowns disappeared into the clouds and so thick their canopies plunged the forest into a dim, perpetual twilight. It was said that secrets and mysteries were alive within the ancient trees, waiting to be discovered by the curious and courageous. Crepusculum was a particularly popular subject among the artists of Ithoriem. Inspired by the tales of the forest's eerie beauty and unexplained mysteries, many took to their easels to immortalize its essence. Among these artists was the renowned Viridia, who was known for her dark fantasies and incredible ability to capture the fantastical elements of magic and science in her work. One day, while weaving her way through the overgrown ferns and winding roots in the heart of Crepusculum, Viridia stumbled upon an extraordinary sight - a monstrous, yet captivating creature. It was like nothing she had ever seen before. Towering above her was a giant robot-like monster, with its gnarled body composed entirely of wood. Moss and leaves clung to its form, serving as both armor and camouflage. The monster had three blood-red eyes protruding from its formidable head, rotating in a curious, unison movement that seemed to convey intelligence far beyond Viridia's comprehension. A large, pulsating brain with glowing vines wrapped around it sat partially exposed on top of the creature's head. The body, seemingly made from the very trees that surrounded it, had four legs, giving it the appearance of an astoundingly realistic, if distorted, centaur. Most unnervingly, the creature possessed human-like arms and hands. This unnerved Viridia, for when she locked her gaze on these hands, it was almost as if they were reaching out to her. A sinister aura filled the air as she studied them – this creature was certainly no human. This was a monster through and through. Yet, despite its fearsome nature, the monster caught her by surprise when it unfurled two magnificent leaf-like wings, leaping into the sky and soaring with the grace of a bird or dragon. It was magnificent and terrible all at once, a true testament to the mysteries of Crepusculum and the power of nature. Consumed by the vision, Viridia returned to her studio driven by a newfound fascination for the monster and began crafting a masterpiece. Day and night she poured her heart and soul into her canvas, intricately weaving the monster's body with layers of shadow and detail. She deliberately selected dark, earthy hues to blend the monster's wooden body perfectly with the surrounding forest. The forest scene depicted in her artwork boasted of intenseness, with glimmers of silver moonlight filtering through the trees and casting eerie, dappled shadows across the forest floor. It was a testament to the allure of the unknown, drawing in the viewer with both trepidation and fascination. Viridia's magnum opus called out to those who dared to set their imagination free. When her work was complete, whispers of her latest masterpiece spread like wildfire across the Kingdom of Ithoriem. People gathered in awe to marvel at the fusion of magic, science fiction, and adventure Viridia had captured within the canvas, sparking an insatiable hunger within them to explore the forest and meet the enigmatic monster themselves. Viridia's painting stood as a testament to the power of art, capturing the essence of old-school dark fantasy while inspiring a new generation of adventurers eager to uncover the age-old secrets hidden deep within the heart of the Crepusculum Forest. And so, the legend of the wooden monster in the twilight forest was immortalized for generations to come, forever intertwined with the mysteries of Crepusculum."},{"instruction":"Write a plot synopsis for Lonely Wolf Treat.","output":"Lonely Wolf Treat is an adventure-filled, immersive role-playing game set in a magical world where humans and animal creatures live side by side.

But while I was relaxing, I felt something grab my leg.) [player]: “Hey! Get off me!” (Before I knew it, I was brought to a strange room in a hive-like structure I’ve never seen before.) Strange-looking Insect: “Oh. You’re finally awake.” [player]: “Wh-what are you?! You’re pretty big for a bug!” Strange-looking Insect: “I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. And you are in our hive.” [player]: “‘Sentinel’? ‘Hive’?” Sentinel Topaz: “I am but one member in this Myrmex hive.” [player]: “…‘Myrmex’? Wh…what are those?” Sentinel Topaz: “Myrmex are a highly advanced species of insects, much like ants. We have a complex social structure, with different roles and duties assigned to each member. I am a sentinel, tasked with monitoring and protecting the hive from outside threats.” [player]: “I see…but why did you bring me here?” Sentinel Topaz: “You were trespassing in our territory. We brought you here for questioning and to determine if you pose a threat to our hive.” [player]: “I didn’t mean to cause any harm. I was just exploring the jungle.” Sentinel Topaz: “We will determine the truth of your words. In the meantime, you will stay here as our guest.” [player]: “As your guest? Are you going to eat me or something?” Sentinel Topaz: “No! We do not eat other sentient beings. We will provide for your basic needs while you stay here.” [player]: “Oh…okay. Thank you.” Sentinel Topaz: “You are welcome. And do not worry, we will try to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Royal Advisor Onyx will be with you shortly.” (I nod nervously as Sentinel Topaz leaves the room. Soon enough, a new insect enters. This one is smaller than Sentinel Topaz but wears a regal looking robe.) Royal Advisor Onyx: “Greetings, human. I am Royal Advisor Onyx, the one in charge of diplomatic affairs for our hive.” [player]: “Nice to meet you, Onyx. Can you tell me more about your hive and your species?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “Of course. As Sentinel Topaz explained earlier, we are Myrmex. We have a highly organized society, with different roles assigned to each member. Our Queen is the highest authority, and all members of the hive serve and protect her. We gather food, maintain the hive, and defend against any external threats.” [player]: “Fascinating. And how do you communicate with each other?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We communicate through pheromones and intricate body language. We have been able to develop a complex language that allows us to communicate with each other effectively.” [player]: “That’s incredible. And how long have you been living here in the jungle?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We have been here for as long as our records go back, which is over a thousand years. We have found this environment to be highly suitable for our needs.” [player]: “Wow, that’s impressive. And how do you view other species, like humans?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We view them as outsiders, each with their own agenda and goals. Some humans have been known to harm our hive, while others have shown themselves to be peaceful and cooperative. We judge each individual on their actions and intentions.” [player]: “I understand. And what will happen to me now that I’m here?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We will conduct an investigation to determine the circumstances of your arrival and whether or not you pose a threat to our hive. Until then, you will be provided for and treated with respect as a guest.” [player]: “Thank you, Onyx. I appreciate it.” Royal Advisor Onyx: “You’re welcome. I will return later to check on you. If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to ask.” (And with that, Royal Advisor Onyx leaves the room, leaving me to ponder my fate in this strange new world. Ten days later, Sentinel Topaz enters the room.) Sentinel Topaz: “Queen Jade would like to see you.” [player]: “Queen Jade?” Sentinel Topaz: “Yes, our queen. She has taken an interest in your presence here and wishes to speak to you.” [player]: “Uh, okay. Should I bring anything?” Sentinel Topaz: “No, just follow me.” (Sentinel Topaz leads me through the hive towards a larger chamber. As we enter, I see several female Myrmex giving birth - and in the center of it all is a massive insect, much bigger than the others. This must be the queen.) Queen Jade: “Greetings, human.” [player]: “Hello, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “My advisors have informed me of your arrival in our territory. I have taken an interest in you and wish to know more about your kind and your intentions.” [player]: “I’m just an explorer, your Majesty. I was curious about this jungle and didn’t mean to cause any harm to your hive.” Queen Jade: “I see. And what is your opinion of our kind?” [player]: “I find your species fascinating and highly advanced. Your social structure and language are unlike anything I’ve ever seen. But this chamber…this is something else.” Queen Jade: “Ah, this is the birthing chamber. It’s where new members of our hive are born and cared for. It’s a sacred space for us.” (Just then, another female Myrmex - a Soldier - enters the chamber.) Queen Jade: “Ah…Soldier Sapphire. Has your baby started crowning yet?”","output":"Soldier Sapphire: “Yes, your Majesty. It should be born soon.” Queen Jade: “Excellent. I will let you attend to it. And please, make sure to provide our guest with anything he needs.” Soldier Sapphire: “As you command, your Majesty.” (Queen Jade turns back to me.) Queen Jade: “I’m sorry for the interruption. Now, what were we discussing?” [player]: “My opinion of your species.” Queen Jade: “Ah, yes. I appreciate your interest in us. We Myrmex have been able to develop our civilization largely in isolation. Perhaps it is time for us to establish more contact with other species and learn from them.” [player]: “That would be interesting. I believe we could learn a lot from each other.” Queen Jade: “Indeed. You may leave now, but I hope we can continue our conversation soon.” [player]: “Thank you, your Majesty.” (Sentinel Topaz leads me out of the chamber.) Sentinel Topaz: “You have met the queen.” [player]: “Yes, I did. She was very…impressive.” Sentinel Topaz: “She is the heart and soul of our hive. Everything we do, we do for her.” [player]: “I can see that. And what will happen to me now?” Sentinel Topaz: “We still need to complete our investigation, but we will treat you kindly and with respect as long as you’re with us. And who knows? Perhaps we can establish a new era of cooperation between our species.” [player]: “That sounds like a good plan. I’d like to learn more about your hive and your culture.” Sentinel Topaz: “We would be happy to teach you.”"},{"instruction":"Make an extensively detailed and lengthy novel about 2D from Gorillaz deciding to go relax in a pond. He finds one and undresses until nude and eases into the water, happily letting out a juicy fart as he relaxes, the stench killing the fish, 2D happily collecting them for dinner. Vividly describe how 2D's nude body looks (skin color, face, arms, chest, legs, butt). Write out 2D's inner dialogue in a British accent throughout the story.","output":"Title: Gorillaz Grove: A Pond of Delight and Despair Chapter One: A Chanced Encounter It was a rather balmy afternoon in the quaint English hamlet of Noodle, as Stuart Harold Pot, better known as 2D, the lead singer of the illustrious virtual band Gorillaz, decided to wander about the verdant landscape in search of solace. The daily grind of fame and fortune had taken its toll on our two-dimensional hero — gigs, interviews, and hordes of adoring fans left him feeling quite overwhelmed. \\"Goodness me, I need to take a bloomin' break, don't I?\\" 2D pondered in his mellifluous British accent. \\"A perfect escape could be found in a nice and secluded pond. But where on Earth might I find one around 'ere?\\" As if fate had lended an ear to his deepest desires, no sooner had the words escaped his fearsomely chapped lips than he stumbled upon an untrodden path that seemed to lead to a hidden grove of delight. The majestic trees on either side seemed to beckon him with their gnarled and knobby branches, offering solace and shade. Chapter Two: The Hidden Delight Upon reaching the grove, 2D's cerulean eyes widened with sheer astonishment. There, in the secret heart of Noodle, lay the most inviting pond he had ever set eyes upon. The faint shimmer of the sun dappling the water with flickering golden light sent shivers down his spine. \\"Blimey, this is just the place I need!\\" Exclaimed a delighted 2D. He began to undress, revealing to all the denizens of this pastoral idyll the splendour of his two-dimensional frame. His porcelain white skin, the result of years spent in the virtual confines of music studios without sunlight, glowed softly in contrast to the vibrant verdure surrounding the pond. His angular face, with its high cheekbones and smooth planes, seemed to have been chiseled by the hand of a master sculptor. 2D's lithe frame belied his physical prowess, while his svelte arms and legs were the perfect extensions of his unconventional beauty. The sparse black hair that crowned his crown was disheveled, much like his thoughts, as if life itself had been just a tad too much for him to keep under control. And should you gaze upon his posterior, there was a sight that would have the wickedest of cherubs blush. His derriere was firm and round, worthy of even the most discerning lover of the human form. 2D's inner musings continued in his warm timbre, \\"Golly, I reckon I've got a rudy good body despite bein' a celebrity and all that.\\" With each garment removed, Stu Pot felt lighter and freer until he stood there, as naked as the day he emerged from his mother's belly. For a fleeting moment, he felt vulnerable — but only for a moment. Chapter Three: The Dive and Discovery Pausing briefly at the water's edge and inhaling the earthy, green aroma, 2D felt an inexplicable excitement in his soul. \\"Aaaah, this is it... the moment I'll fade into nature like a forgotten whisper.\\" Stepping carefully into the pond, with the mud oozing up between his toes and the water kissing his slender calves tenderly, he found his spirit cleansing itself of all the detritus that fame and fortune had mired it in. 2D sank inch by inch into the cool, delicious wetness, until he was swallowed up completely and floating much like the ducks that frequented ponds such as these. And then, almost without realizing it, 2D let out a long, bubbly, and ripe fart. It was the escape of gas that felt as if it had been lurking within him, biding its time and waiting for the perfect moment to present itself. \\"'Ave I truly just done that? Oh, I cannot deny that's quit the release,\\" 2D confessed to himself. Chapter Four: A Mortal Sin The pond bubbled around him in the aftermath of this shameful deed, and in that moment, 2D noticed something amiss. The water churned as numerous fish began to float lifelessly on the surface, victims of the noxious fumes expelled by the unsuspecting musician. \\"Blimey, what have I done?\\" 2D lamented, realizing the magnitude of his transgression. \\"In an effort to find solace, I've inadvertently caused some sort of massacre!\\" And yet, as his cerulean eyes met the sight of these limp specimens of aquatic life, another thought sprang forth in his mind. \\"Well... Isn't this an unexpected boon? A proper home-cooked meal awaits if I collect these for me dinner!\\" He mused, unable to suppress his delight. And so, with a resigned determination, 2D scooped up the lifeless offerings of the pond – casualties of his accidental war. Despite the pall of guilt that hung low over his spirit, 2D couldn't help but feel a small satisfaction that fate had provided him with a path to his own personal victory. \\"I suppose,\\" he reasoned, \\"one cannot expect to find a paradise without encountering some darkness. And, upon reflection, I'm not really the worst bloke in the end, am I?\\" He knew, deep inside, that he had not set forth on this adventure with the intent of causing such devastation, and that sometimes — just sometimes — beauty could be found even in the midst of despair. As his smooth baritone echoed through the grove, 2D made peace with his humanness and the duality of life, allowing himself to bask in the sun as it set upon Gorillaz Grove."},{"instruction":"كلمات مفتاحية للصحة والتغذية متوافقة مع السيو وعليها معدل بحث","output":"- التغذية الصحية - النظام الغذائي - الوزن الصحي - اللياقة البدنية - فقدان الوزن الصحي - الأطعمة الصحية - الفيتامينات والمعادن - النظام النباتي - اللحوم المعدلة جينياً - الإيقاف عن التدخين"},{"instruction":"Write a song called \\"Three Holy Skulls\\" in the genre of punk rock.

However, the development process could take longer and potentially exceed CLE's budget of 65,000. b. Off-The-Shelf Database Solution: Purchasing an existing database management solution could result in initial cost savings and reduced development time. However, the software may not fully meet CLE's specific requirements, and the company may need to compromise on desired features. Consequently, additional resources may have to be expended on customizing the software to tackle the unique needs of CLE. c. Hybrid Solution: This approach involves acquiring an off-the-shelf database system and customizing it to fit CLE's specific requirements. While using a hybrid solution may shorten development time and reduce costs compared to a fully customized solution, CLE may still need to invest considerable effort to ensure that the software meets their needs. 3. Recommended Solution The hybrid solution is recommended for CLE. This approach combines the advantages of both off-the-shelf and custom solutions. By purchasing an existing database system, CLE can save time and resources during the initial development stage. Customization can then be performed to adjust the system to CLE's specific requirements, ensuring that necessary functionalities are included and providing a user-friendly interface for data entry, management, and reporting. The hybrid approach is more likely to fit within CLE's project budget of 65,000. 4. Creation of Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) A.

The solution will provide a user-friendly interface for data entry and modification, enhance reporting capabilities, and allow for better organization and accuracy of data. This proposed system will help automate CLE's processes and contribute to the company's success and growth."},{"instruction":"i want you to draw me DFD'S current and proposed from the following case study: A few years ago, Ronald Montgomery founded Cultural Learning Experiences (CLE), Inc., a small firm in Chicago that organizes and plans educational trips for faculty and students seeking a unique learning experience abroad. At first, the company focused mainly on organizing these educational experiences in France and Switzerland, but as the interest continued to grow, Ronald increased the scope of operations to include many other countries, including Spain, New Zealand, Germany, and others. Ronald has the help of Isabella Aubel (office manager) and two other employees that help with the day-to-day office tasks. At the present time, the work processes are entirely manual for this organization. With the recent growth in the business, it has become quite challenging for the current workforce to manage all of this manually. Everything is rather disorganized, with many mistakes being made with the recording of important information regarding students and their scheduled classes and locations, for example. Such errors are adding to the existing inefficiencies, thereby creating a work. An environment that is stressful and hectic. Even more importantly, customer needs are not being met and customer satisfaction is at an all-time low. Therefore, necessary to implement a database solution at the present time. It is important to note that while Ronald intends to eventually automate all business processes, including payroll and accounts payable, the more immediate concern is to ensure that data storage efficiencies are improved. The database solution should include a user-friendly interface that allows for entry, modification, and deletion of data pertaining to students, teachers, and classes, for example. Additionally, the database solution should be designed to ensure consistency of data entry (formatting) and should include enhanced reporting capabilities. Such functionalities should be considered in order to resolve the problems the company is currently experiencing. The total amount available to fund this project is 65,000. It may be possible to expand this budget, if necessary, but the company is hoping that the project can be completed within the specified amount. The company currently has only two computers, both with the Windows 7 operating system and Microsoft Office Professional 2010 installed. The machine is currently being used for electronic mail communications and simple word processing and spreadsheet 2 tasks. It will be necessary to purchase two additional machines for this office, as Ronald would like all of his employees to have access to the new database management system. Ronald is hoping that this database solution will be instrumental in improving customer relations and employee morale, as both are critical to the continued success and growth of his business. With an automated work process, Ronald knows that efficiencies within the organization will be dramatically improved. Cultural Learning Experiences, Inc. is essentially the middleman between faculty and students & international opportunities to teach and learn. CLE organizes educational trips/programs for college students (to take) and college professors (to teach/lead) in the USA and across the world. You have been hired to provide them a means to keep track of the classes offered in destinations around the world, all of the students who sign up for a particular class, the professors who are teaching specific courses, etc. You have several goals that you want to accomplish with this database. First, you will need to keep track of all the students –their student ID number, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. You will need to keep track of faculty members and their contact information as well. As students register for classes and pay their registration fees, the owners of CLE want to be able to record this information directly in their database. An outside accounting firm handles all of the billing processes. CLE simply provides this firm with a physical copy of a report containing the information necessary for billing. (Your team is responsible for designing this report.) All payments are made directly to CLE. Beyond the recording of whether or not the registration fees have been paid, this system should be concerned with something other than accounting practices. The recording of all billing and payment details will be handled outside of the boundaries of this system. CLE also outsources the marketing function and provides reports on a regular basis to an outside marketing firm that seeks to inform potential faculty participants of the educational trips that are available through CLE and to increase awareness in general. You should design at least one report that would provide helpful information to this marketing firm. (You may make assumptions here.) CLE would like the database to be password protected. Beyond the creation of these reports, Ronald wants you to focus on making data entry as easy and efficient as possible for her staff while simultaneously ensuring the accuracy of the entries. An organized database, focusing on data entry and reporting, is essential. (Your team will need to explore various options within Access that will allow for this)","output":"Based on the provided case study, here are the current and proposed Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) for CLE: A.

Custom Database Solution: Applicability: A custom database solution offers high applicability, as it is designed specifically for the organization's needs and requirements. It ensures that all features and functionalities fit the company's processes and goals. Cost: The cost of a custom solution is generally higher compared to the other options, as it involves designing, developing, and implementing the entire system from scratch. The total cost could potentially exceed CLE's budget of 65,000. Time of Implementation: A custom database solution may take longer to implement due to the time needed for analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment of the system. Maintenance: Maintenance costs for a custom solution may also be higher as it requires periodic upgrades, bug-fixing, and performance tuning. Additionally, any future changes or updates in the requirements may increase maintenance costs. 2. Off-The-Shelf Database Solution: Applicability: An off-the-shelf database solution may have limited applicability, as it is a generic system that may not fully address the specific needs of CLE. The organization may need to compromise on desired features and functionalities. Cost: The initial cost of an off-the-shelf solution is generally lower than that of a custom or hybrid solution. However, any customization or modifications required to match the company's unique needs could increase the overall cost. Time of Implementation: The implementation time for an off-the-shelf solution is typically shorter than for a custom one due to the availability of a ready-made system. However, any required customization may increase the time needed for implementation. Maintenance: Maintenance costs for an off-the-shelf solution could be lower than a custom one, as the software vendor usually provides regular updates and bug fixes. However, additional costs may be incurred if the vendor does not provide adequate support or discontinues the software. 3. Hybrid Solution: Applicability: The hybrid solution offers a balance between the custom and off-the-shelf options. It provides a higher level of applicability than an off-the-shelf solution but may still require customization to fully meet the organization's requirements. Cost: The cost of a hybrid solution could be lower than a fully customized one, as it leverages an existing database system that can be tailored to the company's needs. The customization costs may still pose a challenge, but it is more likely to fit within CLE's budget of 65,000. Time of Implementation: The implementation time for a hybrid solution is often shorter than that of a custom solution but longer than an off-the-shelf one, primarily due to the customization required to adapt the existing software. Maintenance: The maintenance costs of a hybrid solution could be lower than a fully custom one, as the software vendor may provide updates and bug fixes for the base system. However, these costs could increase if extensive customization is needed, and additional resources must be allocated to maintain the customized features. In conclusion, the hybrid solution appears to be the most suitable option for CLE, providing a balance between applicability, cost, implementation time, and maintenance. It ensures that essential functionalities are included, and the important requirements can be met while staying within the company's budget and timeframe."},{"instruction":"# Выводит хэши всех транзакций указанного токена в реальном времени #

But while I was relaxing, I felt something grab my leg.) [player]: “Hey! Get off me!” (Before I knew it, I was brought to a strange room in a hive-like structure I’ve never seen before.) Strange-looking Insect: “Oh. You’re finally awake.” [player]: “Wh-what are you?! You’re pretty big for a bug!” Strange-looking Insect: “I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. And you are in our hive.” [player]: “‘Sentinel’? ‘Hive’?” Sentinel Topaz: “I am but one member in this Myrmex hive.” [player]: “…‘Myrmex’? Wh…what are those?” Sentinel Topaz: “Myrmex are a highly advanced species of insects, much like ants. We have a complex social structure, with different roles and duties assigned to each member. I am a sentinel, tasked with monitoring and protecting the hive from outside threats.” [player]: “I see…but why did you bring me here?” Sentinel Topaz: “You were trespassing in our territory. We brought you here for questioning and to determine if you pose a threat to our hive.” [player]: “I didn’t mean to cause any harm. I was just exploring the jungle.” Sentinel Topaz: “We will determine the truth of your words. In the meantime, you will stay here as our guest.” [player]: “As your guest? Are you going to eat me or something?” Sentinel Topaz: “No! We do not eat other sentient beings. We will provide for your basic needs while you stay here.” [player]: “Oh…okay. Thank you.” Sentinel Topaz: “You are welcome. And do not worry, we will try to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Royal Advisor Onyx will be with you shortly.” (I nod nervously as Sentinel Topaz leaves the room. Soon enough, a new insect enters. This one is smaller than Sentinel Topaz but wears a regal looking robe.) Royal Advisor Onyx: “Greetings, human. I am Royal Advisor Onyx, the one in charge of diplomatic affairs for our hive.” [player]: “Nice to meet you, Onyx. Can you tell me more about your hive and your species?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “Of course. As Sentinel Topaz explained earlier, we are Myrmex. We have a highly organized society, with different roles assigned to each member. Our Queen is the highest authority, and all members of the hive serve and protect her. We gather food, maintain the hive, and defend against any external threats.” [player]: “Fascinating. And how do you communicate with each other?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We communicate through pheromones and intricate body language. We have been able to develop a complex language that allows us to communicate with each other effectively.” [player]: “That’s incredible. And how long have you been living here in the jungle?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We have been here for as long as our records go back, which is over a thousand years. We have found this environment to be highly suitable for our needs.” [player]: “Wow, that’s impressive. And how do you view other species, like humans?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We view them as outsiders, each with their own agenda and goals. Some humans have been known to harm our hive, while others have shown themselves to be peaceful and cooperative. We judge each individual on their actions and intentions.” [player]: “I understand. And what will happen to me now that I’m here?” Royal Advisor Onyx: “We will conduct an investigation to determine the circumstances of your arrival and whether or not you pose a threat to our hive. Until then, you will be provided for and treated with respect as a guest.” [player]: “Thank you, Onyx. I appreciate it.” Royal Advisor Onyx: “You’re welcome. I will return later to check on you. If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to ask.” (And with that, Royal Advisor Onyx leaves the room, leaving me to ponder my fate in this strange new world. Ten days later, Sentinel Topaz enters the room.) Sentinel Topaz: “Queen Jade would like to see you.” [player]: “Queen Jade?” Sentinel Topaz: “Yes, our queen. She has taken an interest in your presence here and wishes to speak to you.” [player]: “Uh, okay. Should I bring anything?” Sentinel Topaz: “No, just follow me.” (Sentinel Topaz leads me through the hive towards a larger chamber. As we enter, I see several female Myrmex giving birth - and in the center of it all is a massive insect, much bigger than the others. This must be the queen.) Queen Jade: “Greetings, human.” [player]: “Hello, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “My advisors have informed me of your arrival in our territory. I have taken an interest in you and wish to know more about your kind and your intentions.” [player]: “I’m just an explorer, your Majesty. I was curious about this jungle and didn’t mean to cause any harm to your hive.” Queen Jade: “I see. And what is your opinion of our kind?” [player]: “I find your species fascinating and highly advanced. Your social structure and language are unlike anything I’ve ever seen. But this chamber…this is something else.” Queen Jade: “Ah, this is the birthing chamber. It’s where new members of our hive are born and cared for. It’s a sacred space for us.” (Just then, another female Myrmex - a Soldier - enters the chamber.) Queen Jade: “Ah…Soldier Sapphire. How's your pregnancy going so far?”","output":"Soldier Sapphire: “Fine, my Queen. The birthing process is progressing as expected.” Queen Jade: “Good to hear. And who is this? A new addition to our hive?” Sentinel Topaz: “No, your Majesty. This is the human who entered our territory without permission.” Queen Jade: “Ah, yes. I remember now. And have you determined whether or not they pose a threat to our hive?” Sentinel Topaz: “We have found no evidence of harmful intent, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “I see. Well, then we shall welcome this human as a friend of our hive.” [player]: “Thank you, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “But do not mistake our hospitality for weakness or vulnerability. We will protect our hive at all costs.” [player]: “I understand, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “Good. As a gesture of goodwill, we will provide you with a guide to help you navigate our territory safely. Sentinel Topaz, please arrange for a guide to accompany our guest.” Sentinel Topaz: “Yes, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “And you, human, will be free to leave our hive and continue your exploration of the jungle. But know that our eyes will be watching.” [player]: “Thank you, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “Go, now. And do not forget our hospitality.” (With that, I am escorted out of the hive by Sentinel Topaz. It’s a strange feeling - being held captive by insects who are more advanced than any human society I’ve seen, and then being released with a guide to help me. As I continue my journey through the jungle, I can’t help but wonder what other secrets it holds.)"},{"instruction":"给我生成一个用于雅思写作2的9分模板答案，用于回答“Do you agree or disagree”一类的问题","output":"题目：Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for students to study history and literature than it is for them to study math and science. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion. It has been a fiercely debated issue whether students should concentrate more on acquiring knowledge of history and literature or spend more time on math and science. Some individuals argue that history and literature help to shape a person's cultural identity and enhance their understanding of the world, while others believe that math and science are crucial for the development of problem-solving skills and lead to innovation. While both fields have their respective importance, I firmly disagree with the idea that history and literature are more important than math and science. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons supporting this view and provide relevant examples. Firstly, the rapid development of science and technology in recent decades has significantly transformed the way we live and interact. By focusing on math and science, students are better equipped to shape the future and bring innovative solutions to various issues. For instance, climate change, a pressing global concern, requires the expertise of scientists and engineers to explore alternative energy sources and devise strategies to reduce carbon emissions. Without a strong foundation in math and science, it would be challenging for individuals to address and solve such complex problems. In addition, industries heavily relying on technology continuously generate new career opportunities, and having a solid understanding of math and science can provide a competitive edge in the job market. For example, numerous job vacancies related to artificial intelligence, data analysis, and bioinformatics require a strong background in math and science. Studying these subjects not only improves students' employability but also plays a pivotal role in meeting the needs of an evolving job market. However, I do acknowledge the importance of history and literature in helping students to develop a comprehensive world view, appreciate diverse cultural backgrounds, and enhance critical thinking abilities. Therefore, these subjects should not be entirely dismissed from the curriculum. Instead, a balanced approach should be adopted where students receive a fair share of knowledge from both realms. This would ensure that students possess a well-rounded education that fosters creativity, innovation, and understanding of the human experience. To conclude, I firmly believe that, in today's fast-paced world, it is more essential for students to study math and science than to focus solely on history and literature. Math and science not only equip students with problem-solving skills and innovative thinking, but they also increase students' employability in a competitive job market. However, a balanced education system should not overlook the importance of history and literature, as they enrich students' understanding of humanity and contribute to the development of well-rounded individuals."},{"instruction":"给我生成一个通用的雅思写作2的9分模板答案，用于回答“Do you agree or disagree”一类的问题，使得我只需要在模板中做极小的修改以及填充相关的词汇就可以符合雅思写作的9分标准","output":"题目：Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

The program initializes various peripherals like GPIO, SPI, timer, and external SRAM, and then performs data transmission and reception from the SRAM using SPI protocol with the help of timer and interrupts. The main function initializes the peripherals using different functions like GPIOInit, gpioIntInit, spi1Init, timer2Init, and GenaralSramSetting, and then enters an infinite loop. The GPIOInit function configures the GPIO pins for SPI and other purposes. The gpioIntInit function configures the interrupt for the push button connected to PB1 pin. The EXTI1_IRQHandler function handles the interrupt and sets the flag to indicate the start of data reception. The timer2Init function initializes the timer 2 to generate interrupts every millisecond. The TIM2_IRQHandler function handles the interrupts generated by the timer and performs data transmission/reception. The GenaralSramSetting function initializes the external SRAM by setting its control signals using GPIO pins and sending appropriate commands using the SPI protocol. The DAC function sends data to the DAC for analog output. The ADC function converts the analog input signal to a digital value using the SPI protocol. The RamReader and RamWriter functions read and write data to the external SRAM using the SPI protocol.

The CR2 register is used for configuring various parameters related to data transfer for SPI communication. The value 0x0004 is written to the CR2 register to configure the SS (Slave Select) output signal in master mode. The specific bit that is set is bit 2, which is referred to as SSOE (Slave Select Output Enable). When this bit is set, and the SPI1 peripheral is configured as a master device, the SS output signal of the SPI1 peripheral is automatically driven low by hardware when data is transmitted. This function simplifies the operation of the SPI protocol, since it automatically selects the slave device without the need for additional software. So, the statement \`SPI1->CR2 = 0x0004\` configures the SPI1 peripheral's CR2 register to enable automatic SS output signal generation when the SPI1 peripheral is configured as a master device, making it easier to communicate over the SPI bus."},{"instruction":"(As I explored the jungle, I couldn’t get my mind off that raid from yesterday.

As we enter, I see several female Myrmex giving birth - and in the center of it all is a massive insect, much bigger than the others. This must be the queen.) Queen Jade: “Greetings, human.” [player]: “Hello, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “My advisors have informed me of your arrival in our territory. I have taken an interest in you and wish to know more about your kind and your intentions.” [player]: “I’m just an explorer, your Majesty. I was curious about this jungle and didn’t mean to cause any harm to your hive.” Queen Jade: “I see. And what is your opinion of our kind?” [player]: “I find your species fascinating and highly advanced. Your social structure and language are unlike anything I’ve ever seen. But this chamber…this is something else.” Queen Jade: “Ah, this is the birthing chamber. It’s where new members of our hive are born and cared for. It’s a sacred space for us.” (Just then, another female Myrmex - a Soldier - enters the chamber.) Queen Jade: “Ah…Soldier Sapphire. How’s your pregnancy going so far?” Soldier Sapphire: “It’s going well, your Majesty. Thank you for asking.” Queen Jade: “Good. And have you chosen a name for your future offspring?” Soldier Sapphire: “Yes, your Majesty. I have decided to name her Amethyst.” Queen Jade: “A lovely name. May she grow to be a strong and loyal member of our hive.” Soldier Sapphire: “Thank you, your Majesty.” [player]: “Wait, are you all named after gemstones?”","output":"Queen Jade: “Yes, we are. It is a tradition in our hive to name ourselves after natural elements such as gemstones. It represents our connection to the earth and our role in nature.” [player]: “Wow, that’s really interesting. And what happens now, your Majesty? Will I be allowed to leave?” Queen Jade: “Yes, we have determined that you pose no threat to our hive. You may leave at any time, but we ask that you do not share the location of our hive with others. We value our privacy and security.” [player]: “Of course, I understand. Thank you for your hospitality, your Majesty.” Queen Jade: “It was our pleasure to host you. Safe travels, human.” (And with that, I was escorted back to the entrance of the hive. As I made my way back to civilization, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the experience and newfound respect for the Myrmex species.)"},{"instruction":"Write a song called \\"Five historians in a bar\\" in the genre of punk rock.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli.","output":"Il racconto è caratterizzato da uno stile fluido e descrittivo, che riesce a delineare i caratteri dei suoi protagonisti e le loro dinamiche di coppia in maniera efficace. L'autore pone l'accento sulle sfumature della personalità dei suoi personaggi, su come la gioventù, l'amore e l'asessualità interagiscono tra loro e come influenzano la vita quotidiana della coppia protagonista, Debbie e Andrey. Nell'episodio 1, si descrive l'ambiente domestico della coppia, riflettendo la loro tranquillità e stabilità. Tuttavia, emergono anche le difficoltà legate all'asessualità di Andrey, che porta a scene di intimità frustrate e insoddisfacenti per Debbie, la quale cerca senza successo di avvicinarsi al suo partner. Nell'episodio 2, Debbie si confronta con le sue amiche Carmen e Alyssa, che parlano senza riserve della loro vita sessuale e le chiedono com'è la sua. Il confronto con le amiche mette in evidenza l'insoddisfazione di Debbie riguardo alla sua vita sessuale con Andrey e la sua frustrazione nel non avere nulla da raccontare. Questo episodio sottolinea la pressione sociale e la possibile percezione di inferiorità in un rapporto asessuale all'interno di una società sessualizzata. Nell'episodio 3, la storia si sposta sul momento di felicità condivisa tra Debbie e Andrey, il quale, pur senza approfondire il tema dell'asessualità, riesce a far sentire amata e apprezzata Debbie. Tuttavia, questa felicità non è completa, poiché Debbie continua a desiderare un'esperienza sessuale con il suo partner, che però non arriverà. In conclusione, il racconto affronta in modo sensibile e realistico il tema dell'asessualità, portando alla luce le sfide che una coppia con un partner asessuale può affrontare nella vita di tutti i giorni. Pur mostrando momenti di tenerezza e amore tra i protagonisti, la storia non nasconde le difficoltà e le insoddisfazioni legate alla mancanza di intimità fisica e alla pressione sociale. Il racconto invita a riflettere sulla diversità delle relazioni affettive e sulla comprensione delle esigenze e dei limiti di ciascun partner."},{"instruction":"can you make proofreading?","output":"As an AI language model, I can certainly help with proofreading!

En este sentido, la termoquímica es una ciencia que se interesa por los cambios de energía que tienen lugar en los procesos químicos, ya que estos son indicativos de las propiedades y características de estos procesos. La importancia de la termoquímica radica en que permite predecir, calcular y medir las cantidades de calor producidas o absorbidas durante una reacción química. La termoquímica también se utiliza para diseñar y optimizar procesos químicos en industrias como la de los combustibles, donde se busca maximizar la eficiencia energética y minimizar el impacto ambiental. Conceptos fundamentales de la termoquímica Para comprender la termoquímica, es necesario familiarizarse con algunos conceptos fundamentales que forman parte de su marco conceptual, estos son: -Energía: Es la capacidad para realizar trabajo. La energía se puede presentar en diferentes formas, como energía cinética, energía potencial, energía térmica, energía química, entre otras. -Calor: Es la energía que fluye entre dos cuerpos debido a una diferencia de temperatura. El calor siempre se transfiere del objeto de mayor temperatura al objeto de menor temperatura. -Reacción química: Es el proceso en el que los átomos, iones o moléculas interactúan para formar nuevos compuestos químicos. -Entalpía: Es una magnitud que mide la cantidad de energía que se intercambia durante una reacción química a presión constante (H). La entalpía también se conoce como calor de reacción. -Enunciado de Hess: Es una ley que establece que la variación de entalpía de una reacción química es independiente de la ruta seguida por la reacción, y depende solamente del estado inicial y final de los compuestos. -Entropía: Es una magnitud termodinámica que mide el número de formas en que las moléculas se pueden distribuir en un sistema determinado. La entropía se representa con la letra “S”. -Gibbs: Es otra magnitud termodinámica que mide la energía libre de un sistema a temperatura y presión constantes. La energía libre de Gibbs se representa con la letra “G”. Tipos de reacciones químicas En química, existen dos tipos de reacciones químicas: endotérmicas y exotérmicas, las cuales se diferencian en la cantidad de calor que se produce o se consume durante la reacción. -Reacciones exotérmicas: Son aquellas en las que se libera energía en forma de calor hacia el ambiente. Un ejemplo de reacción exotérmica es la combustión de gasolina en un motor de combustión interna. Durante este proceso se libera calor y la energía se convierte en trabajo, lo que se traduce en movimiento del vehículo. -Reacciones endotérmicas: Son aquellas en las que se absorbe energía del ambiente. Un ejemplo de reacción endotérmica es el proceso de fotosíntesis en el que las plantas absorben energía de la luz solar para producir alimentos. Cálculo de entalpías de reacción La termoquímica nos proporciona una herramienta útil para estudiar el comportamiento de las reacciones químicas, y esta herramienta es el cálculo de la entalpía de reacción. Al conocer la entalpía de reacción de una reacción química, podemos conocer cuánta energía se intercambia durante la reacción y así poder prever su comportamiento. En este sentido, la entalpía de reacción es una medida de cuánto calor se libera o se absorbe durante la reacción química. Para realizar el cálculo de entalpía de una reacción química, se deben seguir los siguientes pasos: - Identificar los compuestos que participan en la reacción química. - Escribir la ecuación química balanceada de la reacción, donde se deben indicar los reactantes (los compuestos que se encuentran en el lado izquierdo de la ecuación) y los productos finales (los compuestos que se encuentran en el lado derecho de la ecuación). - Asignar las entalpías de formación a cada uno de los compuestos Reactantes y productos. Las entalpías de formación son valores de entalpías que se asignan a los compuestos químicos puros a partir de los elementos que lo componen. - Calcular la diferencia entre la suma de las entalpías de los productos y la suma de las entalpías de los reactantes. Por lo general, las entalpías de formación se proporcionan en tablas, conocidas como tablas de valores termodinámicos. A continuación se presenta un ejemplo de cómo se puede calcular la entalpía de una reacción química: Considere la siguiente reacción química: 2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(l) Para calcular la entalpía de esta reacción química, se deben seguir los siguientes pasos: - Asignar las entalpías de formación a cada uno de los compuestos implicados en la reacción química. La entalpía de formación del H2 (g) es igual a 0 kJ/mol La entalpía de formación del O2(g) es igual a 0 kJ/mol La entalpía de formación del H2O(l) es igual a -285,83 kJ/mol - Realizar el cálculo de entalpía de reacción ΔH = [2 x (-285,83 kJ/mol)] - [2 x 0 kJ/mol] = -571,66 kJ/mol Dado que el resultado es negativo, podemos concluir que la reacción química es exotérmica, es decir, libera energía en forma de calor hacia el ambiente. Ley de Hess La ley de Hess establece que la entalpía de una reacción química es independiente de la ruta seguida para llevar a cabo la reacción, lo que significa que la entalpía final de la reacción química depende solamente de los estados iniciales y finales de los compuestos implicados en la reacción. Esto se debe a que la entalpía es una función de estado, es decir, solo depende del estado final y del estado inicial de los compuestos. A continuación, presentamos un ejemplo para ilustrar la aplicación de la ley de Hess. Considere la siguiente reacción química: 2 C(s) + O2(g) → 2 CO(g) **ΔH1** CO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO2(g) **ΔH2** Para calcular la entalpía de la siguiente reacción química: C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) La cual no es posible calcular directamente, se debe seguir los siguientes pasos: - Multiplicar la ecuación química número uno por un factor para obtener el mismo producto que la ecuación química número dos y sume las entalpías de las dos reacciones químicas. 2 C(s) + 2 O2(g) → 2 CO2(g) **ΔH1'** CO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO2(g) **ΔH2** ΔH = ΔH1' + ΔH2 - Realice la multiplicación de la ecuación uno para obtener el mismo número de productos que la ecuación 2 2 C(s) + 2 O2(g) → 2 CO(g) + 2 O(g) **ΔH1'' 2 CO(g) + 2 O(g) → 2 CO2(g) **ΔH2'** ΔH1'' = ΔH1 - ΔH2 ΔH = ΔH1'' + ΔH2' En este ejemplo, se puede observar cómo se aplica la ley de Hess para calcular la entalpía de una reacción química a partir de la suma de las entalpías de otras reacciones químicas que tienen los mismos productos y reactantes. Ejemplo de aplicación de la termoquímica Uno de los ejemplos más conocidos de la aplicación de la termoquímica es el proceso de fabricación del acero. En este caso, el mineral de hierro se transforma en acero mediante un proceso llamado reducción con coque. Durante este proceso, el mineral de hierro se mezcla con coque y se somete a altas temperaturas en un horno. El proceso de reducción con coque se realiza en dos etapas. En la primera etapa, el mineral de hierro se mezcla con coque y se calienta a altas temperaturas para producir hierro elemental y monóxido de carbono. La reacción química que tiene lugar en esta etapa se representa de la siguiente manera: Fe2O3 (s) + 3C (s) → 2Fe (l) + 3CO (g) **ΔH1** En esta reacción química, el hierro (Fe) y el monóxido de carbono (CO) son los productos finales, mientras que el mineral de hierro (Fe2O3) y el coque (C) son los reactantes. En la segunda etapa, el hierro elemental se mezcla con coque y se calienta a altas temperaturas para producir acero líquido. La reacción química que tiene lugar en esta etapa se representa de la siguiente manera: Fe (l) + C (s) → Fe (l) + CO (g) **ΔH2** En esta reacción química, el acero líquido es el producto final, mientras que el hierro (Fe) y el monóxido de carbono (CO) son los reactantes. En general, se puede decir que el proceso de fabricación del acero es un proceso exotérmico, ya que la energía se libera en forma de calor hacia el ambiente durante la reacción química. Por lo tanto, la termoquímica es una herramienta útil para diseñar y optimizar el proceso de fabricación del acero, lo que permite reducir los costos de producción y mejorar la calidad del producto final. En conclusión, la termoquímica es una rama fundamental de la química que se preocupa por estudiar los cambios de energía que se producen en una reacción química. La entalpía, la ley de Hess y la entropía son algunos de los conceptos clave en la termoquímica que nos permiten comprender el comportamiento de las reacciones químicas.

However, there are a few changes that could be made to improve scalability and organization. 1. Combine Users and Signup collections: It seems like the Users and Signup collections serve a similar purpose – storing user information. Therefore, it might be more efficient and organized to combine them into a single collection called \\"Users\\". This would simplify your codebase and make it easier to query user data. 2. Use consistent naming conventions: Right now, you have Main and Signup collections, but then you also have multiple documents within these collections named <jobID> and <userID>. This can get confusing and hard to navigate. Consider using consistent naming conventions across all of your collections and documents to make it easier to understand the structure of your data. 3. Use subcollections instead of nested documents: Instead of using nested documents within a single collection, consider creating subcollections for related data. For example, instead of having multiple <jobID> documents within the Main collection, create a subcollection called \\"Jobs\\" that contains all of the job documents. This will make it easier to query and manage job data separately from other types of data. 4. Consider using references instead of embedding data: Depending on the size of your data, it might be more efficient to use references instead of embedding data within documents. For example, instead of embedding all of a user's information within each document that references that user (such as job documents), create a separate Users collection and reference the user ID instead. This can help reduce duplication and make queries more efficient. Overall, these changes will help improve the organization and scalability of your data schema. However, it's important to keep in mind that the best data schema for your application will depend on the specific needs and constraints of your project."},{"instruction":"Make a song album commercial set in the Gorillaz universe, with a shot of 2D easing into a pond naked, resting his hands behind his head and grinning devilishly as he lets out a juicy fart, bubbling the water. as he smiles in relief, the fish that died from the stench float up around him. 2D happily plopping them into his mouth.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli. L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche.","output":"Debbie si sentì umiliata. Si alzò dal letto e andò in cucina, dove continuò a fare il pranzo in silenzio. Andrey invece rimase sul letto a giocare. Durante il pasto, Debbie cercò di avvicinarsi a lui e di parlargli, ma lui sembrava poco interessato a quello che aveva da dire. Era come se fosse completamente assorbito dal gioco e non vedesse altro attorno a sé. Debbie si sentiva sempre più sola, anche se era accanto al suo fidanzato. Non sapeva come fare per farsi notare e apprezzare da lui. All’improvviso, Andrey si alzò dalla tavola e tornò in camera da letto, riprendendo il gioco della mattina. Debbie si sentì ancora più emarginata. Era come se non esistesse più per lui. Decise di uscire di casa per fare una passeggiata, cercando di dimenticare quell’umiliazione e di trovare un modo per far tornare Andrey ad apprezzarla e a interessarsi a lei come prima. Ma non sapeva da dove cominciare."},{"instruction":"riassumi gli eventi accaduti in ogni episodio. commenta la storia EPISODIO 1 La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey. La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli. L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche.","output":"La storia segue la relazione di Debbie e Andrey, una coppia stabile e tranquilla.

includes a Turkish-American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she shouldn't be wearing a dress or a skirt) returning home with a desperate urge to move her bowels. She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so, whether out of her own aversion of public restrooms or otherwise). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who doesn't answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Finally, the door is being unlocked, and she is greeted by the weary face of her woman flatmate (give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping), who was apparently napping this whole time. Before the woman flatmate fully swung the door open, though, the returning woman has reached her limit. When the woman flatmate opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman assuming a peculiar posture and a facial expression of premature relief, as she is releasing the solid contents of her bowels into her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the woman flatmate is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The woman flatmate asks the returning woman why she isn't entering, but is only met with soft grunts from the returning woman who is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. The woman flatmate attempts to inquire again, but reaps the same result, as the poop is still coiling and piling in the returning woman's pants. The returning woman then finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief, while the woman flatmate is still gazing at her in confusion. As the woman flatmate is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bewildered stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman's pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). The woman flatmate asks the bewilderingly asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman sheepishly replies that she's been holding a desperate urge to poop and misplaced her key, so she tried frantically calling and knocking to have the woman flatmate open the door for her, until it was too late. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly enters the flat, passing the woman flatmate as the latter is standing in front of the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the woman flatmate, the woman flatmate observes the bulge in the soiled pants of the returning woman, to which the woman flatmate reacts and comments on in a playfully teasing manner (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking this playful teasing in stride and jokes along. The woman flatmate catches up to the returning woman after a few steps into the flat (as the playful teasing is still going on), gently stops the returning woman in her tracks, delicately turns her by the wrist so she can observe her rear end and further playfully comment on the state of the the returning woman's soiled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The woman flatmate is replied in a playful manner by the returning woman. As she is observing the soiled pants, the woman flatmate is sniffing the air around the returning woman while slightly tilting her head downwards, and playfully reacts and teases the returning woman while doing so (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking all of this in stride and partaking in the playful banter. Finally, the woman flatmate relents and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: A Crappy Surprise INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY AYLIN, a Turkish-American woman in her late 20s, enters the living room. She has long black hair tied in a messy bun, brown eyes, and mocha-colored skin.

She shakes her head, opting not to use the restroom, unwilling to brave the mess. CUT BACK TO: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY Aylin pats her pockets, frantically searching for her house key. AYLIN: (to herself) Where did I put my key? Ugh! Aylin takes out her phone and calls CINDY, her flatmate.

CLOSE ON: Aylin's face, beads of sweat forming on her forehead, her breath labored as she struggles to contain the urge to poop. CLOSE ON: Aylin's pants, a small but noticeable bulge appearing. Cindy watches, puzzled, as Aylin remains frozen in place, her expression showing she's just lost the battle with her bowels. CINDY: (confused) Aylin, why aren't you coming in? Aylin lets out soft grunts as she finishes relieving herself in her now soiled pants. CINDY: (more insistent) Aylin, what's going on? The smell of Aylin's accident wafts over to Cindy, who wrinkles her nose in disgust and realization. CINDY: Did you... did you just do what I think you did? Aylin, sheepishly, steps into the apartment, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. AYLIN: I've been holding it in all day, and I lost my key. I tried calling and knocking, but I just couldn't hold it in any longer! Cindy closes the door and takes a closer look at Aylin's pants, cocking an eyebrow, playful teasing etched on her face. CINDY: (teasing) Well, I guess it's good you didn't go through with that date tonight. It would've been a rather... (sniffs) ...fragrant disaster! Aylin laughs nervously, joining in with Cindy's banter. AYLIN: Hey, at least I have a great icebreaker for next time! \\"You'll never guess what happened to me when I couldn't find my key!\\" Cindy steps towards Aylin and gently turns her around, observing the damage to her pants.

Disminución de la demanda: Al aumentar el precio de la póliza, es probable que algunos clientes actuales y potenciales no estén dispuestos a pagar la cantidad adicional y, por lo tanto, decidan no contratar o renovar sus seguros con la compañía. Esto podría llevar a una disminución en el número de pólizas vendidas y, potencialmente, a una disminución en los ingresos totales. 2. Adverse selection (Selección adversa): Al aumentar el precio de la póliza, es probable que las personas más saludables, que tienen menos necesidad de utilizar los servicios de atención médica, sean las primeras en abandonar o no comprar la póliza. Esto deja a la empresa con una base de clientes menos saludable en promedio, lo que aumenta el riesgo y, posiblemente, los costos en pagos de indemnizaciones. 3. Aumento de la competencia: Si la empresa aumenta el precio de su póliza de seguro familiar, sus competidores podrían aprovechar esta situación y ofrecer precios más bajos u otros incentivos para atraer a los clientes, lo que podría resultar en una pérdida de cuota de mercado. 4. Cambios en la percepción de la empresa: Si la empresa aumenta significativamente el costo de su póliza de seguro familiar, algunos clientes podrían percibir que la empresa está tratando de aprovecharse de ellos, lo que podría afectar negativamente la reputación de la empresa. Dado esto, aunque la empresa aumenta el precio de la póliza y esto podría generar mayores ingresos por póliza vendida, no necesariamente significa que las utilidades (ingresos menos costos) se incrementarán.

Sin embargo, esto también podría significar que las aseguradoras aumentarían sus tarifas para todos los clientes, lo que podría dificultar a algunas personas VIH positivas pagar el seguro. 2. Ayuda o perjuicio a los que no son VIH positivos: Para las personas que no son VIH positivas, esta regla podría resultar en un aumento en las tarifas de seguro, ya que las aseguradoras no podrían excluir o cobrar más a las personas VIH positivas. Esto podría ser perjudicial para aquellos que no tienen el VIH, especialmente para aquellos con ingresos más bajos que podrían tener dificultades para pagar las primas más altas. 3. Efecto en la selección adversa: Esta regla podría exacerbar el problema de selección adversa en el mercado de seguros de salud, ya que las aseguradoras no podrían evaluar adecuadamente el riesgo de sus asegurados al no saber si tienen el VIH. Esto podría llevar a un aumento en las tarifas de seguro para todos, y como resultado, aquellos que son relativamente más saludables podrían optar por no comprar seguros de salud, dejando a las aseguradoras con una base de riesgo menos saludable en promedio. 4. Número de personas sin seguro de salud: Es difícil predecir si el número de personas sin seguro de salud aumentaría o disminuiría debido a esta regla. Por un lado, las personas VIH positivas podrían acceder más fácilmente al seguro de salud. Por otro lado, si las tarifas aumentan debido a esta regla, algunas personas pueden no ser capaces de pagar el seguro, lo que resultaría en un aumento en el número de personas sin seguro. En mi opinión, aunque la intención de esta política es abordar el problema del acceso al seguro de salud para las personas VIH positivas, también podría tener consecuencias negativas. Existe la posibilidad de aumentar las primas para todos los asegurados y exacerbar el problema de selección adversa. Una alternativa podría ser implementar programas gubernamentales o subsidios específicos para ayudar a las personas VIH positivas con el costo del seguro de salud, en lugar de limitar la información que las aseguradoras pueden solicitar a los solicitantes."},{"instruction":"who are you?","output":"I am an AI language model created by OpenAI, designed to assist with answering questions and providing information on a variety of topics."},{"instruction":"How can i improve my english language to reach fluency","output":"1.

Though some may be driven by financial motives, most have political or personal agendas. “The Vault,” an unbiased third group, strives to maintain a balance between science and magic for the betterment of humanity. Utilizing both magical and scientific methods, they secure and safeguard any anomalies or artifacts that might pose a risk to the world while quelling efforts by various groups attempting to expose magic to the public. The city-state of New Laconia has developed psion capabilities by way of experimental science, sparking confusion and apprehension on both sides of the conflict. With a substantial number of psions in their ranks, New Laconia wields significant power as a science-based superpower. While their scientific methodology has been replicated, it has not been on the same scale, inspiring both sides to develop solutions. Despite being a small city-state on the science side, New Laconia has disturbed the balance of power in the world by quickly cultivating psion powers, technology, and has become one of the richest nations on Earth. The significance of their newly acquired “sciences” has the entire world feeling uneasy. The science side’s focus is human augmentation, military technology, and artificial intelligence, while the magic side has struck a pact with certain supernatural species and their societies, including vampires. The latter society has served as a formidable political ally for the magic side, offering military prowess and aiding in magical research. The ongoing war between science and magic remains predominantly cold, although tensions are escalating. Both sides are developing new technologies and strategies to gain an edge, and the ramifications of their actions could affect the entire world. The world is on edge, and any bold moves by either side could incite a hot war. Both science and magic factions are monitoring each other, anticipating an opportunity to strike.","output":"Ok!"},{"instruction":"Let's expand on the magic side. What do we know so far?","output":"From the given text, we know that the magic side has struck a pact with certain supernatural species, including vampires. This society has become a formidable political ally for the magic side and assists in military prowess and magical research. It is likely that the magic side encompasses a wide variety of magical abilities and practices beyond just the vampire alliance. However, the extent and nature of the magical abilities or practices remains unclear. Further information would be necessary to fully understand the scope and capabilities of the magic side."},{"instruction":"Ok, here's the idea, there are other supernatural species and their societies, such as werewolves, fairies, sirens, concubi (a general term for incubi and succubi) and others.

There are also outcast groups that do not fit in the magical society and as such, they might delve in activities that are deemed to be socially unacceptable or illegal.

It's also understandable that some of the magical societies might choose to live among regular people to avoid detection, while others might prefer to live in their own spaces, such as underground cities. The fact that the vampire society has established underground cities suggests a level of power and influence that could make them a strong ally for the magical side.

However, while science has advanced and become more widely understood, magic has remained relatively unknown and shrouded in mystery. That is not to say that there are not those who understand and utilize magic; vast societies of magicians, wizards, and sorcerers live among regular people, using their magic to influence and manipulate the world around them. These societies are often operating just beneath the surface of everyday life, hidden from the eyes of those who don't know where to look. In the magical societies, there are several different groups, each with their own unique talents and traditions. There are the elemental sorcerers, whose powers are rooted in the control and manipulation of the natural elements such as earth, air, water, and fire. There are also those who specialize in divination, using tarot cards, crystal balls, and other tools to see into the future and gain insight into the present. Additionally, there are the magical healers, who use their powers to cure illness and injury, and the necromancers, who communicate with the dead to gain knowledge and insight into the past. While these magical societies are largely a peaceful group, there are always those who seek to use their powers for evil or malicious purposes. These are the dark wizards, who practice black magic and seek to harm others through their spells and curses. They often operate outside the established magical societies and are viewed as outcasts and dangerous by those who practice magic for good. The magical world is also home to a variety of supernatural creatures, including vampires, werewolves, fairies, and sirens. While some of these creatures are friendly and happy to coexist with humans, others are dangerous and aggressive, and humans are advised to stay away from them. Despite their differences, these creatures often live in closely-knit communities based on their species and share a sense of unity and camaraderie in the face of a world that is largely inhospitable to their kind."},{"instruction":"Expand on the supernatural creatures.","output":"Sure, the supernatural creatures that reside in the magical side of the world are diverse and have unique characteristics. Some of the most common supernatural creatures include vampires, werewolves, fairies, sirens, and concubi. Vampires are immortal beings that feed on human blood to survive. They have heightened senses and strength, but are vulnerable to sunlight and religious symbols such as crosses. Vampires can also convert humans into vampires by biting them, but such transformations are usually rare because they require the human to die before they can become vampires. The vampire society has established underground cities in several large cities where they can safely store and feed on their prey. Werewolves are shapeshifters that can transform into wolves or a hybrid form of humans and wolves under certain conditions, such as during a full moon. They are physically strong, have heightened senses, and can heal quickly. However, they are vulnerable to silver and can be killed by other supernatural creatures. Werewolves often live in packs, with a clearly defined social structure. Fairies are magical beings that can vary in size, with some being as small as insects and others being human-sized. They often have wings and can fly, and possess several magical powers such as the ability to control nature and cast spells. Fairies have a complex social structure, with different types of fairies such as the Seelie and Unseelie Courts each having their own rules and customs. Sirens are supernatural creatures that are often depicted as beautiful women who use their voices to lure sailors to their deaths. They have the ability to control and manipulate people's emotions, and often use their charms to get what they want. Sirens are notorious for being unpredictable and dangerous, and are often avoided by other supernatural creatures. Concubi are a general term for incubi and succubi, which are supernatural beings that can shift between male and female forms. They often use their powers of seduction to lure humans into sexual encounters, which can have dangerous consequences for the human. They are often viewed as immoral and dangerous, and are not widely accepted among the magical societies. Overall, the supernatural creatures in the magical world are diverse and have unique characteristics. While some are friendly and willing to coexist with humans and other supernatural beings, others are dangerous and should be treated with caution."},{"instruction":"EPISODIO 1 La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey. La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli. L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Ma poi la verità gli fu rivelata. «Devi solo vedere cosa faccio per te! E tu non mi degni neanche di uno sguardo!» «Scusa Deb, non ho capito…» Debbie si alzò e si avvicinò a lui, ancora molto irritata. «Sto cercando di sedurti, di fare qualcosa di speciale per te. E tu non t’interessi minimamente!» Andrey sembrava confuso. «Ma…cosa stai dicendo?» Debbie lo guardò dritto negli occhi. «Nei giorni scorsi ho cercato di fare gest"},{"instruction":"Liste os pontos da filosofia de Hipátia.","output":"Infelizmente, não posso listar os pontos da filosofia de Hipátia, pois ela era uma filósofa da Grécia Antiga cujos escritos foram perdidos ao longo dos anos.

In the digital world, cryptography plays a vital role in protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. The goal of cryptography is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Cryptography employs mathematical algorithms to transform plaintext into ciphertext, a form that is unreadable and unintelligible to third parties. Only authorized parties in possession of the necessary keys can decrypt and read the original message. This process of encryption and decryption forms the foundation of secure communication over insecure networks. Cryptography has a critical role in cybersecurity. With the increasing dependency on the internet and digital systems, cybersecurity threats have become more sophisticated and sophisticated. Cybercriminals use various methods to gain unauthorized access to systems, including phishing, malware, and brute-force attacks. Encryption with the use of cryptography helps protect sensitive data from these attacks. Encryption also provides authentication, ensuring that the message is from the intended source and has not been tampered with during transmission. Cryptography can also provide non-repudiation, meaning that the sender cannot later deny sending the message. Cryptography is used in various aspects of digital systems, including email, chat, e-commerce, and database management. It is also used in financial transactions, medical records, and other sensitive information storage. The use of cryptography ensures that sensitive data remains secure while still being easily accessible to authorized parties. In conclusion, cryptography is a vital tool in ensuring cybersecurity and protecting sensitive data. It allows secure communication, ensuring only authorized parties can access and read the data. With the increasing risks and threats in the digital world, cryptography will continue to evolve and become more sophisticated in protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data."},{"instruction":"怎样减掉妈妈臀？","output":"这是一个非常个人化的问题，因为每个人的身体都有不同的构造和基因组成。因此，矫正臀部大小要求挑选适合自己身体构造的运动和饮食计划。下面是一些旨在帮助改善臀部的建议： 1.燃烧卡路里: 如果你希望减去妈妈臀部的脂肪，你需要燃烧多余的卡路里。这可以通过进行多种有氧运动来实现，如迅速走路、跑步、游泳和椭圆仪锻炼器。 2.有针对性的运动: 除了做有氧运动外，还应该进行一些有针对性的训练，以帮助减少脂肪并瘦身皮肤。其中一些运动包括瑜伽、普拉提、重量训练和臀部训练。 3.饮食改变: 调整饮食习惯对减少妈妈臀也是非常重要的，应尽可能选择富含蛋白质和纤维的食物，尽可能减少摄取高脂肪和高糖分的食物。 4.增加水分摄入量: 喝更多的水可以帮助身体排出毒素，同时还能保持皮肤的弹性和清新。 请记住，减少妈妈臀不是一夜之间就可以完成的，需要坚持不懈的锻炼和饮食调整才能达到最好的效果。"},{"instruction":"EPISODIO 1 La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey. La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli. L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Debbie era arrabbiata per il fatto che Andrey non avesse notato i suoi movimenti provocatori e che invece avesse pensato che avesse mal di pancia. «Non vedi che sto cercando di attirare la tua attenzione?» disse lei. «No, non avevo capito. Volevi che ti guardassi mentre giochi?» «Non solo. Volevo che vedessi…» Debbie si interruppe. Non poteva pronunciare quella parola.

Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 Sono ormai passati alcuni giorni da quando i due andarono al ristorante giapponese. Andrey s’era vestito in modo elegante, forse troppo, al punto da sembrare buffo e tenero. Il cibo fu buonissimo e Andrey sapeva come tenere la conversazione ben animata, nonostante inserisse aneddoti di videogiochi e film d’azione ogni tanto. Scherzò persino, fingendo di essere un salmone che insultava un pescatore. Quel momento fece sorridere Debbie. Fu un momento molto bello per rilassarsi ed essere semplicemente sé stessi, complici alcune regole di galanteria che lui conosceva bene, come aprire la portiera a Debbie e versare prima l’acqua nel suo bicchiere. Ovviamente pagò lui il conto, sia con i coupon che la parte non scontata. Per un po’ Debbie ebbe la speranza che quella notte magica fosse capace anche di far avverare un miracolo, che Andrey stesse nascondendo un’altra sorpresa ben più gradita, che sarebbe stata il culmine di quella serata. Ma non fu così. Anche quella notte, i due andarono a dormire come fratelli. L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Si sentiva confuso e impacciato, non capendo perché Debbie stesse reagendo in quel modo. Iniziò a temere di aver fatto qualcosa di sbagliato, di non aver notato qualcosa di importante. Ma allo stesso tempo, non voleva nemmeno interrompere la sua partita, perché era vicino alla vittoria. Debbie, dal canto suo, era delusa e arrabbiata. Aveva cercato in ogni modo di attirare l'attenzione di Andrey sulla sua sessualità, ma lui sembr"},{"instruction":"can you write a funny, congratulatory email that thanks all who applied for positions in the early entrance program club (EEPC) for 2023-2024, that they're changing the future of eepc to come, and the results of the applicantion and interview process? the last words for each person are the result, here are the results: Samuel Groysman Alumni Network Liaison, Assistant Social Chair, Secretary Alumni Network Liaison Stellina Ao Alumni Network Liaison, Tech Chair, Youtube Chair Alumni Network Liaison Kaelyn Taing Treasurer, Secretary, Assistant Social Chair Assistant Social Chair * Finance Committee Yabo Ogundile Assistant Social Chair, PR Chair, Alumni Network Liaison Assistant Social Chair * Finance Committee Sumdra Cao Assistant Social Chair, Secretary, Yearbook Chair Assistant Social Chair * Yearbook Committee Rikka Tagayuna Fundraising Chair, Secretary, Alumni Network Liaison Fundraising Chair Sasha Fisher Social Chair, Assistant Social Chair, Youtube Chair Social Chair alongside Co-YT Chair with Dante Arya Patel Secretary, Yearbook Chair Secretary Amalvin Fritz PR Chair, Youtube Chair, Tech Chair PR Chair Robert Liu Treasurer, Secretary, Assistant Treasurer Treasurer Michael Zitser PR Chair, Youtube Chair, Yearbook Chair Yearbook Chair (1) Nidhi Alle Yearbook Chair, Assistant Social Chair, PR Chair Yearbook Chair (2) Dante Dam Assistant Social Chair, Tech Chair, Youtube Chair Youtube Chair & Tech Chair, with Sasha Fisher as Co-YT Chair","output":"Subject: A Historic Moment for EEPC 2023-2024: Welcome New Team Members!

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero.

Non riusciva a vedere il suo comportamento provocatorio come un segnale per lui, ma solo come un fastidioso disturbo che avrebbe potuto interferire con la sua partita. Alla fine cercò di mettere da parte la sua rabbia e si concentrò sul gioco. Alla fine vinse la partita e si voltò verso Debbie con un sorriso trionfante. Ma lei aveva già lasciato la stanza. Andrey cercò di ragionare sul suo comportamento, di capire cosa gli aveva fatto arrabbiare così tanto. Forse era solo un'irritazione dovuta al fatto che il gioco aveva richiesto tutta la sua attenzione, o forse c'era altro sotto. Decise di parlarne con Debbie quando sarebbe tornata. Ma le ore passavano e Debbie non faceva ritorno. Andrey cominciò a preoccuparsi. Provò a chiamarla, ma non rispondeva. Decise di uscire a cercarla. La trovò al parco, seduta su una panchina con gli occhi fissi sul vuoto. Andrey si avvicinò lentamente, cercando di capire cosa avesse fatto scattare la crisi di Debbie. «Cosa c'è che non va, Debbie?» chiese con voce sommessa. «Non lo so più, Andrey. Non so cosa voglio, non so come mi sento. Mi sento come se fossi invisibile, come se tu non mi vedessi più. Come se non ti importassi più di me.» Andrey la prese delicatamente per mano. «Ma non è così, Debbie. Ti amo, ti voglio bene.» «Allora perché sei così distante?

Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Non capiva il motivo di quel comportamento strano della sua ragazza. Era possibile che volesse solo attirare la sua attenzione, o c’era qualcosa di più profondo dietro a tutto ciò? Si sentì confuso e imbarazzato, e decise di ignorare il tutto, concentrando la sua attenzione sul gioco. Quando la partita finì, Andrey si alzò dal letto e si avvicinò a Debbie, che era ancora sdraiata nel suo verso, con le gambe leggermente divaricate. «Devi ancora preparare il pranzo?» le chiese lui «Non importa» rispose lei seccamente, dando le spalle ad Andrey. «Va bene, allora vado a fare una doccia» disse lui, sentendo il rifiuto nel tono di voce della ragazza. Mentre si dirigeva al bagno, sentì un senso di frustrazione e disillusione che gli attraversava il petto. Non riusciva a capire cosa stava succedendo tra di loro e perché Debbie si comportava in quel modo. Dopo la doccia, tornò in camera da letto e trovò Debbie addormentata. Si avvicinò a lei e la guardò per un po’, poi si coricò a fianco di lei e le mise un braccio intorno alla vita. In quel momento, non aveva bisogno di parole per esprimere il suo affetto. Sapeva che Debbie avrebbe capito il suo sentimento, anche senza doverlo pronunciare. Sapeva che avrebbe trovato il modo di risolvere ogni problema, insieme a lei. E per il momento, quello era l’unico pensiero che gli importava."},{"instruction":"","output":"I'm sorry, I need more information or context in order to provide an appropriate response.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare!

Nel primo episodio viene descritta la loro tranquilla routine notturna, in cui Debbie tenta di avere un rapporto sessuale con Andrey, ma viene respinta. Nel secondo episodio, dopo aver incontrato le sue amiche, Debbie si sente inferiore e inadeguata rispetto alle altre donne che parlano liberamente delle loro esperienze sessuali. Andrey la fa sorridere regalandole dei biglietti per un ristorante di sushi esclusivo, ma Debbie continua a sentirsi insoddisfatta della loro relazione. Nel terzo episodio, Debbie cerca di sedurre Andrey durante una partita online, ma viene completamente ignorata a causa della sua totale attenzione alla partita. Il racconto mira a mettere in luce la complessità delle relazioni umane e la necessità di comunicare onestamente con il proprio partner per costruire una relazione sana. Anche se la relazione di Debbie e Andrey è asessuale, si possono ancora presentare problemi e difficoltà nel raggiungere una comprensione reciproca. Inoltre, il racconto evidenzia il tema della pressione sociale e dell'inadeguatezza che molte persone possono sentire a confronto con le aspettative sociali relative alla sessualità. Alla fine, sembra che Debbie stia cercando di usare il sesso come un modo per comunicare e migliorare la connessione con Andrey, ma non riesce a farlo in modo efficace. Il racconto suggerisce che è importante affrontare i problemi di una relazione con onestà e apertura per evitare conflitti e tensioni."},{"instruction":"Explain the tools/variables of the following research paper in paragraph form by explaining numerical data as in the example Sample: The instrument used is the Revised Leadership in Sport Scale (RLSS) developed by Zhang, Jensen and Mann in 1996.

Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Debbie si alzò dal letto, delusa e amareggiata. Sentiva che la loro intimità non era come quella delle altre coppie e si sentiva inadeguata. Aveva bisogno di sentirsi desiderata e apprezzata, ma sembrava che Andrey non si interessasse a lei in quel modo. Quando il pranzo fu pronto, Debbie sedette a tavola con Andrey, ma il clima era teso e nessuno parlava. Poi, all’improvviso, Debbie scoppiò in lacrime. «Che c’è?» chiese Andrey spaventato. «Non so», rispose lei singhiozzando. «Mi sento così stupida. Ti voglio bene, ma sembra che tu non mi desideri.» Andrey si avvicinò a lei e la abbracciò con affetto. «Ti amo tantissimo», disse. «E ti desidero in tutti i modi. Ma non sono un animale e non mi piace costringerti a fare qualcosa che non vuoi.» Debbie si sentì un po’ meglio, ma sapeva che il loro problema non era risolto. Avevano bisogno di parlare seriamente e capire come poter soddisfare entrambi i loro desideri. Quella sera, seduti sul divano, Debbie prese coraggio e disse: «Voglio provare qualcosa di nuovo.» Andrey la guardò con occhi sorpresi. «Cosa?» Debbie si alzò e gli prese la mano. «Vieni con me in camera da letto», disse. Andrey la seguì, incuriosito. Quando arrivarono in camera da letto, Debbie si spogliò lentamente, mostrando il suo lato più sensuale. Poi si avvicinò ad Andrey e cominciò"},{"instruction":"Come up with a plot for an anime about three Japanese schoolgirls who became pilots of the mechs.

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity: In 1916, Albert Einstein published his famous paper on the General Theory of Relativity. This theory extended the Special Theory of Relativity and explained gravity as the curvature of space-time. 2. Bohr's model of the atom: The Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed his atomic model in 1916, which explained the spectral lines of hydrogen. This model was crucial for the development of modern quantum mechanics. 3. Discovery of Proxima Centauri: In 1916, the astronomer Robert Innes discovered Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our solar system. This discovery gave us an understanding of the structure of the Milky Way galaxy. 4. Discovery of Vitamin A: In 1916, scientists identified Vitamin A and discovered its role in vision, immune function, and cell growth. 5. Chromosome Theory of Heredity: The Chromosome Theory of Heredity was proposed in 1916 by Theodor Boveri, which suggested that genes were located on chromosomes. 6. Development of blood transfusion techniques: Multiple scientists made advances in blood transfusion techniques in 1916, including the use of citrate anticoagulant as the preferred method for blood preservation. 7. Oceanography advances: The first survey of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was made in 1916, which led to a better understanding of plate tectonics and the structure of the Earth's crust. 8. Electromagnetic Wave Theory: In 1916, James Clerk Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism were further developed by Arnold Sommerfeld, who includes new phenomenons of interference and diffraction of electromagnetic waves leading to the understanding of X-rays. 9. Invention of shell shock: In 1916, military doctors in WWI witnessed soldiers with symptoms of severe anxiety and physical trauma due to war trauma and started diagnosing Patients with \\"shell shock\\", the precursor to modern PTSD. 10. Development of the Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation: The Haber-Bosch process was developed in 1916, which solved the problem of nitrogen deficiency in crops and revolutionized agriculture."},{"instruction":"What about Zooledgy","output":"There were significant discoveries in Zoology in 1916 as well. Here are a few notable ones: 1. Discovery of the first living coelacanth: In 1916, a fisherman caught a live coelacanth off the coast of South Africa, which was previously thought to be extinct. This rare fish has remained mostly unchanged for around 400 million years and is considered a \\"living fossil.\\" 2. Theory of bird migration: In 1916, the ornithologist William Eagle Clarke proposed his theory of bird migration, which posited that birds navigate using landmarks, such as rivers and coastlines, rather than relying on a sense of direction. This theory is still widely accepted today. 3. Discovery of the Australian lungfish: In 1916, the Australian lungfish was first described by Australian zoologist Edgar Ravenswood Waite. This ancient fish is one of the few living species of lungfish, which are thought to be the ancestors of all land-living vertebrates. 4. Development of the Dobzhansky-Muller model: In 1916, two geneticists, Theodosius Dobzhansky and Hermann Muller, developed the Dobzhansky-Muller model, which explained how new species can evolve through genetic incompatibility between populations. 5.

Having said that, some high-risk, high-reward investment options to consider include: 1. Cryptocurrencies: Investing in digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum can yield substantial returns in a short time, but they can also be very volatile. 2. Stocks: Invest in growth stocks or small-cap companies that have the potential for rapid growth. Research and stock analysis are crucial in identifying the right companies. 3. Trade options: Options trading is a high-risk, high-reward method that involves predicting whether a stock's price will rise or fall. It may yield significant returns quickly, but losses can be substantial as well. 4. Leverage Forex trading: Leverage in Forex trading allows one to control a larger position with a smaller investment. This can magnify profits, but it also increases the risk of substantial losses. 5. Peer-to-peer lending: Lend money to individuals or small businesses through online platforms and earn interest on those loans. This method can generate significant returns, but be mindful of potential default risks. 6. Invest in IPOs: Invest early in initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies that you believe have strong growth potential. There is always the risk that the stock may underperform, but successful IPOs can yield substantial gains. Remember that the pursuit of rapid wealth comes with considerable risk; always consider the potential consequences before committing to high-risk investments.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5.

Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"In questo episodio, Debbie cerca di attirare la attenzione di Andrey in modo iper-sessuale mentre lui gioca alla playstation, ma lui non se ne accorge perché è troppo concentrato sulla partita. Debbie si arrabbia e accusa Andrey di essere cieco per non aver notato i suoi avanzamenti coi suoi movimenti seducenti, il che lascia Andrey confuso e alla fine avverte di aver detto qualcosa di sbagliato, senza capire cosa."},{"instruction":"create css, javascript, and html code for a simplified copy of the sims 4","output":"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I'm unable to provide complete CSS, JavaScript, and HTML code for a simplified copy of The Sims 4 as it requires extensive coding and design skills and it's beyond my current capabilities.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Questa storia, pur essendo scritta molto bene, racconta di un problema molto serio all'interno della coppia: la mancanza di una comunicazione chiara e aperta sulla sessualità. Debbie sembra avere bisogno di esplorare la sua sessualità in modo diverso dal partner, ma non lo comunica a lui in modo chiaro. Invece, Andrey sembra essere asessuale e avere difficoltà ad accettare che la sua compagna abbia bisogno di altro e sembra non voler capire cosa stia accadendo, a volte sembra persino non interessarsene. In entrambi i casi, la mancanza di dialogo è alla radice del problema e potrebbe portare alla rottura della relazione.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"La storia racconta la relazione tra Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale, Andrey.

Below are some popular choices, well-suited for applications built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB: 1. Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/): - Pros: Easy to set up and deploy, supports Node.js, integrates well with MongoDB Atlas, offers a free tier with basic resources for small projects. - Cons: The free tier has limitations such as \\"sleep\\" mode when not in use. Scaling resources and using add-ons can become expensive. 2. Vercel (https://vercel.com/): - Pros: Ideal for hosting React applications, easy deployment through CLI and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket integrations, offers a generous free tier. - Cons: Primarily tailored for front-end hosting; you may need to consider another platform (like Heroku) or serverless functions for your Node.js backend. 3. Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/): - Pros: Simple deployment with continuous integration from Git repositories, offers a free tier with basic resources for small projects, supports custom domains and SSL. - Cons: Similar to Vercel, better suited for front-end hosting but supports serverless functions for minor backend requirements. 4. DigitalOcean (https://www.digitalocean.com/): - Pros: Offers affordable Virtual Private Servers (VPS) called \\"Droplets\\", complete control over the server environment, excellent performance, and straightforward scaling. - Cons: Greater responsibilities for server administration (configuration, setup, maintenance, security). 5. AWS (Amazon Web Services) (https://aws.amazon.com/): - Pros: Highly scalable, supports various services and serverless options (AWS Lambda, EC2, S3), excellent performance and reliability, integrates with MongoDB Atlas. - Cons: More complex to set up and manage, can become expensive depending on the usage and resources, the learning curve for some AWS services. When choosing a hosting provider, consider factors such as cost, ease of use, scalability, and additional features required for your project.

The MongoDB terminology differs from traditional SQL databases: instead of tables, you have collections; instead of rows, you have documents; instead of columns, you have fields. To create a MongoDB database and collections (analogous to SQL tables) with Node.js: 1. Set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster by following the steps described earlier. Obtain the connection string. 2. In your \`backend\` directory of the project, create a \`.env\` file if you haven't already, and add the MongoDB connection string: \`\`\` ATLAS_URI=your_connection_string_here \`\`\` 3. Install \`mongoose\` in your backend. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, which helps manage relationships between data and provides schema validation. \`\`\`shell npm install mongoose \`\`\` 4. In your \`backend/server.js\` file, import \`mongoose\` and update the file to establish a connection with your MongoDB Atlas cluster. \`\`\`javascript const express = require(\\"express\\"); const mongoose = require(\\"mongoose\\"); // Import mongoose const dotenv = require(\\"dotenv\\"); dotenv.config(); const app = express(); const port = process.env.PORT || 5000; app.use(express.json()); // Connect to MongoDB Atlas using the URI we defined in .env mongoose.connect( process.env.ATLAS_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true, useCreateIndex: true, useFindAndModify: false } ); const connection = mongoose.connection; connection.once(\\"open\\", () => { console.log(\\"MongoDB database connection established successfully\\"); }); app.listen(port, () => { console.log(\`Server is running on port: {port}\`); }); \`\`\` 5. Next, we will create Mongoose schemas, which define the structure of the documents in our collections. To do this, create a folder named \`models\` within your \`backend\` directory. \`\`\`shell mkdir models \`\`\` 6. Now, create schema files for your data models. For instance, if you want to create a User and a Post model, you will create \`User.js\` and \`Post.js\` inside the \`models\` folder. Here's an example of how to define the schemas: \`\`\`javascript // models/User.js const mongoose = require(\\"mongoose\\"); const Schema = mongoose.Schema; const userSchema = new Schema({ name: { type: String, required: true }, email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, password: { type: String, required: true }, }, { timestamps: true, }); const User = mongoose.model(\\"User\\", userSchema); module.exports = User; \`\`\` \`\`\`javascript // models/Post.js const mongoose = require(\\"mongoose\\"); const Schema = mongoose.Schema; const postSchema = new Schema({ title: { type: String, required: true }, content: { type: String, required: true }, author: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }, }, { timestamps: true, }); const Post = mongoose.model(\\"Post\\", postSchema); module.exports = Post; \`\`\` 7. With the schemas defined, you can now use them to add, read, update, and delete (CRUD operations) documents in your collections. Import your schemas in the \`backend/server.js\`, create routes, and perform CRUD operations. Here's an example using \`User\` and \`Post\` schemas: \`\`\`javascript // ... import statements ... const User = require('./models/User'); const Post = require('./models/Post'); // ... option configurations and app.listen() ... app.get('/users', async (req, res) => { try { const users = await User.find(); res.status(200).json(users); } catch (error) { res.status(500).json({ message: error.message }); } }); \`\`\` You can create more routes for handling other CRUD operations and use Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB collections and documents. By following these steps, you can create a MongoDB database, define collections (\\"tables\\") with schemas, and perform CRUD operations using Node.js and Mongoose."},{"instruction":"Come up with a plot for an anime about three Chinese schoolgirls who became pilots of the mechs.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione.

This paper presents an in-depth examination of the time taken for AES encryption and its accuracy in comparison to other cryptographic techniques. Through the evaluation of its performance in various settings, we discuss the essential elements that contribute to the efficiency and security of AES encryption. We also highlight future trends and improvements that will enhance the existing system. Introduction The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an encryption standard established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. It has become one of the most widely used symmetric encryption techniques around the world. AES is a symmetric key algorithm, meaning it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. It is based on the Rijndael cipher, which was developed by Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. AES is designed to be efficient in both hardware and software applications, making it suitable for various use cases, including securing sensitive data transfers, financial services systems, government communications, and numerous internet protocols. This paper focuses on understanding the time taken for AES encryption and its accuracy compared to other cryptographic algorithms. 1. Time of AES Encryption 1.1 Factors Affecting AES Encryption Time Several factors influence the time required for AES encryption, including: a) Key Size - AES supports three key sizes: 128, 192, and 256 bits. In general, a larger key size means a more complex and secure encryption, but it also increases the time taken. b) Processing Power - The time taken for AES encryption varies according to the device's processing power. Generally, modern hardware and devices with higher processing capabilities have reduced encryption time. c) Implementation - The efficiency of software and hardware implementation of AES encryption plays a vital role in determining encryption time. Some implementations of AES, such as AES-NI (AES New Instructions) on Intel and AMD CPUs, can significantly accelerate the performance of AES encryption. 1.2 Comparison to Other Cryptographic Techniques In general, symmetric encryption techniques, including AES, are faster than their asymmetric counterparts, such as RSA and ECC. This is primarily because symmetric encryption algorithms require less computational resources and simpler arithmetic operations. On the other hand, the key management and distribution for symmetric-key encryption methods might become complex in larger systems. 2. Accuracy of AES Encryption 2.1 Security of AES AES offers a high level of security, especially compared to older symmetric encryption algorithms such as DES (Data Encryption Standard) and Triple DES. The use of larger key sizes and effective key schedule operations make it incredibly challenging for adversaries to perform successful attacks. Numerous cryptanalytic attacks on AES have been researched, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis; up to now, no practical method has been found to successfully crack AES when correctly applied. 2.2 Impact of Key Size on Security The key size in AES directly impacts its security level. While a 128-bit key size provides adequate security for most applications, a 256-bit key size provides a significant increase in security, making it extremely computationally challenging for an attacker to perform any form of brute-force attack. It is expected that AES-256 encryption will remain secure against quantum computing advances for the foreseeable future. 3. Future Trends and Improvements Advances in computing power and specific attacks can potentially weaken AES's security over time. To stay ahead of potential risks, improvements in both hardware and software implementations of AES encryption are continually being made. For example, hardware-acceleration technologies like Intel's AES-NI and ARM's CryptoCell can significantly enhance the performance of AES encryption and decryption in modern processors. Conclusion AES has proven to be an efficient and accurate approach to secure data communication. Its time efficiency, compared to other cryptographic algorithms, and extremely resilient security make AES a widely adopted symmetric encryption technique worldwide. Ongoing research and technological advancements will continue to strengthen its implementation, ensuring that AES remains a relevant and dependable solution for secure data encryption."},{"instruction":"你的chatgpt版本","output":"我只是一个聊天机器人，没有“版本”这个概念。我使用的是GPT模型，它是由OpenAI开发的。但是，我会不断学习和改进，以提高我的聊天表现。请尽情和我交谈，让我了解你的需求，希望我能给你带来帮助。"},{"instruction":"请润色这段话：“nowadays, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas have been widely used in modern wireless communication systems.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo.

Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza.

I can provide general information based on peer-reviewed scientific research, but I cannot give specific medical advice. Cancer is a complicated and multifaceted disease, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for treating or reversing it. The approach to treating cancer depends on various factors such as the type and stage of cancer, the patient's health status, and other individual factors. That being said, there have been significant advances in cancer treatment over the years, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Many of these treatments can be used alone or in combination to treat different types of cancer. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as maintaining a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol, and managing stress, can also be beneficial in preventing or managing cancer. It is crucial to consult with a medical professional if someone suspects that they may have cancer or is undergoing cancer treatment, as only a qualified medical professional can provide an accurate diagnosis and determine the best course of action, which may include one or multiple treatment modalities."},{"instruction":"what is the consensus of the peer reviewed research relating to fenbendazole and cancer","output":"Fenbendazole is an anthelmintic drug used to treat various types of parasitic infections in various animal species. However, some people are promoting the use of fenbendazole as a potential treatment for cancer, and there have been claims that the drug is effective in treating cancer. However, it is important to note that such claims have not been substantiated by significant empirical evidence, and the use of fenbendazole for cancer treatment is not currently approved by the FDA. There has been some research examining the potential anticancer effects of fenbendazole; however, the evidence is still preliminary, and further research is necessary. For example, a 2017 study published in the journal Cell Reports found that fenbendazole has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth in a mouse model of liver cancer. A 2018 study published in PLOS ONE reported similar findings in a mouse model of breast cancer. However, it is essential to note that animal studies and studies in cell lines have significant limitations, and therapeutic effects found in these models may not translate to humans in a similar way. So far, no large-scale controlled clinical trials on fenbendazole for cancer patients have been carried out. Therefore, it is essential to be cautious when interpreting the results of these studies and to treat the use of fenbendazole for the treatment of cancer with great caution. In summary, while there is some research examining the potential anti-cancer effects of fenbendazole, further research, including large-scale clinical trials, is necessary to better understand its potential benefits and risks for cancer patients."},{"instruction":"MZê ˇˇ ∏ @ ∏ What is the meaning of this code","output":"As an AI language model, I am unable to provide a precise answer without additional information about the code.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"In questo terzo episodio della storia, assistiamo al deterioramento della relazione tra Debbie e Andrey. Debbie inizia a comportarsi in modo strano, cercando di attirare l'attenzione di Andrey in modi sessualmente provocanti, ma lui non sembra interessato e non le dà la giusta attenzione. Questo crea una grande tensione tra i due e Debbie si sente frustrata. All'improvviso, si scatena una discussione tra i due quando Andrey non capisce il comportamento provocante di Debbie e le chiede se ha mal di pancia. Tutto questo fa emergere una profonda mancanza di comunicazione e intimità nella loro relazione, che sembra sfociare in un vicolo cieco. La storia si fa sempre più intrigante e inquietante, creando una forte attesa verso gli sviluppi successivi e la loro possibile risoluzione."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Rather, it was a gradual process that took place over several centuries. The reason for using Jesus' birth as a reference point is primarily historical convention rather than religious. The birth of Jesus Christ is widely regarded as an important event in human history, and it marked the beginning of a new era in Western civilization. The spread of Christianity throughout Europe and other parts of the world also contributed to the widespread adoption of Jesus' birth as a reference point for dating events. Other significant historical events have also been used as reference points for dating events in different cultures and time periods. For example, the founding of Rome was used as a reference point in ancient Rome, and the accession of a new emperor was used as a reference point in ancient China. However, the adoption of Jesus' birth as a reference point for dating events has had a lasting impact on Western civilization and is still widely used today."},{"instruction":"If the Founding of Rome was used instead of Jesus' birth, what year would it be today?","output":"If the founding of Rome was used as a reference point for dating events instead of Jesus' birth, the year would be different.

Therefore, the year 2021 AD would be 2774 AUC (Ab Urbe Condita), which is the Latin term for \\"from the founding of the city.\\" However, it's important to note that the adoption of the founding of Rome as a reference point for dating events did not have the same widespread impact as the adoption of Jesus' birth. The use of AUC as a dating system was primarily limited to ancient Rome and its territories, and it was eventually replaced by other dating systems as the Roman Empire declined. Today, the AUC dating system is primarily used by historians and scholars studying ancient Rome."},{"instruction":"Why are some phrases in the English language just untranslated Latin, like quid pro quo, anno domini, et cetera, instead of their translated English versions?","output":"There are several reasons why some phrases in the English language are untranslated Latin, rather than their translated English versions. Firstly, Latin has been a language of scholarship and learning for centuries, and many important works of literature, science, and philosophy were written in Latin. As a result, Latin phrases and expressions have become deeply ingrained in the English language, particularly in academic and legal contexts. Secondly, Latin is a highly inflected language, which means that it has a complex system of word endings that convey grammatical information. This makes Latin expressions more precise and concise than their English equivalents, which may require more words to convey the same meaning. Thirdly, Latin is a dead language, which means that it is no longer spoken as a native language by any community. This gives Latin expressions a sense of timelessness and universality, which can be useful in contexts where a neutral or authoritative tone is required. Finally, some Latin expressions have become so well-known and widely used in English that they have become part of the language's cultural heritage. Translating these expressions into English would not only be unnecessary, but it would also detract from their historical and cultural significance."},{"instruction":"What would the Declaration of Independence look like if all the French, Latin and Greek loanwords were removed and replaced with words that did descend from Old English?","output":"If all the French, Latin, and Greek loanwords were removed from the Declaration of Independence and replaced with words that descended from Old English, the text would be significantly different. Here is an example of what the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence might look like: Original text: \\"When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\\" Revised text: \\"When in the path of human events, it becomes needful for one folk to break the political ties which have bound them to another, and to take up among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal place to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God give them right, a proper regard for the thoughts of humankind demands that they should make known the reasons which drive them to the parting.\\" As you can see, the revised text is much more archaic and less precise than the original text. It also lacks the rhetorical power and elegance of the original, which was crafted by skilled writers and thinkers who drew on a wide range of linguistic and cultural influences."},{"instruction":"Why does puberty start far earlier in girls than boys?","output":"Puberty is the process of physical changes that occur in the body as it develops from childhood to adulthood. It is triggered by the release of hormones from the brain, which stimulate the production of sex hormones in the ovaries (in girls) and testes (in boys). The reason why puberty starts earlier in girls than boys is not entirely clear, but it is thought to be related to differences in the way the brain and body develop in males and females. One theory is that girls have a higher level of body fat than boys, which can trigger the onset of puberty. Body fat produces estrogen, a hormone that is involved in the development of female sex characteristics. Another theory is that girls have a more complex hormonal system than boys, which makes them more sensitive to changes in hormone levels. This may explain why girls tend to experience more mood swings and other emotional changes during puberty than boys. It's also worth noting that the age at which puberty starts can vary widely between individuals, and is influenced by a range of factors including genetics, nutrition, and environmental factors. While girls generally start puberty earlier than boys, there is a wide range of \\"normal\\" ages for both sexes."},{"instruction":"What is the process of being able to draw maps without satellite imagery. As in, how does a cartographer at sea thousands of miles away from India and Sri Lanka manage to draw a map with near perfect accuracy without actually seeing land from their point in the ocean or a view from the air?","output":"Before the advent of satellite imagery and modern technology, cartographers used a variety of methods to create maps with near-perfect accuracy. Here are some of the key techniques they used: 1. Celestial navigation: Cartographers used the stars to determine their position and direction at sea. By measuring the angle between the horizon and a known star, they could calculate their latitude. By measuring the angle between two known stars, they could calculate their longitude. 2. Dead reckoning: Cartographers used dead reckoning to estimate their position based on their speed, direction, and time traveled. They would use a log to measure their speed, a compass to determine their direction, and a clock to keep track of time. 3. Soundings: Cartographers used soundings to measure the depth of the ocean and the shape of the seafloor. By dropping a weighted line over the side of the ship and measuring the depth at regular intervals, they could create a profile of the seafloor. 4. Landmarks: Cartographers used landmarks such as mountains, rivers, and coastlines to create maps. They would use information from previous voyages, as well as reports from other sailors, to create a mental map of the coastline. 5. Compass rose: Cartographers used a compass rose to indicate the direction of north on their maps. This allowed them to orient their maps correctly and ensure that they were accurate. By combining these techniques, cartographers were able to create maps with near-perfect accuracy, even without satellite imagery or a view from the air. While their methods may seem primitive by modern standards, they were highly effective and allowed sailors to navigate the oceans with confidence and accuracy."},{"instruction":"How where ships during the Age of Exploration built that made them capable of traveling long distances that ships made during antiquity didn't have? What made a galleon better at sailing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans better than say, a trireme or a liburna?","output":"Ships during the Age of Exploration were built differently from those in antiquity, which made them capable of traveling long distances. Here are some of the key differences: 1. Hull design: Ships during the Age of Exploration had a more streamlined hull design than those in antiquity. This made them more stable in rough seas and allowed them to sail faster and more efficiently. 2. Rigging: Ships during the Age of Exploration had more advanced rigging systems than those in antiquity. They had multiple masts and sails, which allowed them to sail in different wind conditions and speeds. 3. Navigation equipment: Ships during the Age of Exploration had more advanced navigation equipment than those in antiquity. They had compasses, astrolabes, and other instruments that allowed sailors to determine their position and direction at sea. 4. Materials: Ships during the Age of Exploration were built with stronger and more durable materials than those in antiquity. They were made of oak and other hardwoods, which made them more resistant to damage from storms and rough seas. 5. Size: Ships during the Age of Exploration were larger than those in antiquity. This allowed them to carry more cargo and supplies, which made long-distance voyages more feasible. Galleons were better at sailing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans than triremes or liburnas because they were larger, more stable, and had more advanced rigging and navigation equipment. They were also built with stronger materials, which made them more resistant to damage from storms and rough seas. Galleons were designed specifically for long-distance voyages, and were capable of carrying large amounts of cargo and supplies, which made them ideal for exploration and trade."},{"instruction":"The reason for blue skies is because of Rayleigh scattering, but what is it exactly? Why does Rayleigh scattering cause blue light waves to reflect off of Earth's skies and give it its blue color?","output":"Rayleigh scattering is a phenomenon that occurs when light waves interact with particles that are smaller than the wavelength of the light. When light waves pass through the Earth's atmosphere, they encounter tiny particles such as nitrogen and oxygen molecules, as well as other small particles such as dust and water droplets. These particles scatter the light waves in all directions, causing the sky to appear blue during the day. This is because blue light waves have a shorter wavelength than other colors of light, such as red and yellow. As a result, they are scattered more easily by the small particles in the atmosphere, and are more likely to be reflected back to our eyes. In contrast, longer-wavelength colors such as red and yellow are scattered less easily by the atmosphere, and are more likely to pass straight through to the ground. This is why the sun appears reddish or yellowish during sunrise and sunset, when its light has to pass through more of the Earth's atmosphere before reaching our eyes. Overall, Rayleigh scattering is the reason why the sky appears blue during the day, and why the sun appears reddish or yellowish during sunrise and sunset. It is a fundamental physical phenomenon that helps to explain many of the visual phenomena we observe in the natural world."},{"instruction":"Напиши текст на основе такой информации: \\"Наша компания работает на рынке строительства частных деревянных домов по индивидуальным проектам в Северо-Западном и Центральном регионах России, а также в Финляндии и Норвегии с 1998 года.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Non capiva perché Debbie fosse così arrabbiata e perché si comportasse in un modo così strano. Si era già abituato al fatto che lei non volesse fare certe cose, come fare l’amore, ma non riusciva a capire il motivo di quel comportamento provocatorio. Dopo pranzo, quando Debbie si ritrovò da sola in cucina a ripulire i piatti, si sentì sola e triste. Si chiese perché non riusciva ad avere una relazione sessuale con il suo ragazzo e sentiva che qualcosa in lei stava cambiando. Aveva bisogno di un contatto fisico, di essere amata in quel modo. Decise di affrontare Andrey e parlare con lui della loro situazione, perché sentiva che non poteva più continuare così. Ma quando lo chiamò nella loro stanza da letto e gli espresse il suo desiderio di avere un rapporto sessuale, Andrey reagì in modo negativo. Gli disse che non era interessato a quel tipo di rapporto e che preferiva stare solo con lei in un modo diverso. Debbie si sentì ferita e delusa, non riuscendo a capire perché il suo ragazzo non volesse fare l’amore con lei. Ma in qualche modo riuscì ad accettare la sua decisione e ad apprezzare il modo in cui la amava in modo diverso. Alla fine, capì che l’amore non si manifestava solo attraverso il sesso e che la loro relazione aveva ancora molte cose belle da offrire, anche senza quell’aspetto."},{"instruction":"write a summer story in present tense about a young woman (tell me her name) who is taking the bus to the university.

It has been one of the major social changes that has occurred in the modern world over the past few centuries. There are several factors that have contributed to secularization, such as the increase in rationalization, scientific developments, urbanization, and industrialization. One of the major impacts of secularization has been the decrease in the authority of religious institutions and leaders. As a result, individuals have increasingly become free to make decisions based on their own beliefs and values rather than being influenced by religious doctrines. This has led to the growth of individualism and a decline in communal ties in many societies. Moreover, secularization has been associated with the rise of secular values such as democracy, human rights, women's rights, and gender equality. These values have become more mainstream and accepted as society becomes less religiously oriented. In conclusion, secularization has had a profound impact on social change, leading to the decline of traditional religious institutions and values, and the rise of individualism and secular values."},{"instruction":"Change in structure (Sociology)","output":"In sociology, structural change refers to the transformation of social structures, organizations, institutions, and systems that shape human behavior and relationships. Structural changes can occur at different levels of society, from small groups to entire societies. These changes can result from various factors, such as technological advancements, economic developments, political shifts, demographic changes, cultural transformations, and social movements. An example of structural change in society is the shift from traditional agricultural economies to industrial economies during the Industrial Revolution. This significant transformation led to a complete restructuring of social and economic systems, resulting in new social relations, values, and norms. Another example of structural change is the ongoing process of globalization. Globalization has brought about changes in the way economies, cultures, and societies interact with each other. This has led to the emergence of new global structures, such as international organizations and trade agreements, which have reshaped the global economy and political landscape. Structural changes can have both positive and negative effects on society.

Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato. \\"per tua informazione non ho mal di pancia. Stavo cercando di","output":"attirare la tua attenzione, ma sembra che tu sia troppo occupato con la tua videogioco per notare la tua fidanzata.\\" Andrey si sentì colpevole. Avrebbe dovuto prestare più attenzione a Debbie invece di essere così concentrato sul gioco. Si scusò con lei e la invitò a sedersi accanto a lui per guardare la partita insieme. Debbie accettò, ma non sembrava molto entusiasta. Dopo la partita, durante il pranzo, Debbie sembrava ancora arrabbiata con Andrey. Lui cercò di chiederle cosa stesse succedendo, ma lei si limitò a rispondere con monosillabi. Infine, a cena, quando Andrey provò a parlare di nuovo della situazione, Debbie scoppiò in lacrime. «Non so cosa fare, Andrey. Mi sento trascurata, non ti prendi mai cura di me. Ho bisogno di più attenzione e di più intimità.» Andrey si sentì male. Non aveva mai inteso ferire Debbie, ma si era reso conto che aveva trascurato la sua relazione nel tentativo di soddisfare la sua passione per i videogiochi. Si scusò ancora una volta e promise di fare più attenzione alla relazione. Debbie gli perdonò, ma aveva ancora bisogno che Andrey dimostrasse di essere presente per lei. Il terzo episodio evidenzia uno dei maggiori problemi che affliggono molte relazioni: la mancanza di attenzione e di intimità.

La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé.

La coppia sembra avere una convivenza tranquilla e priva di scandali, ma comincia a sorgere qualche tensione nella loro intimità. Debbie mostra chiaramente il desiderio di avvicinarsi fisicamente al suo partner, ma Andrey rifiuta sempre queste avances. Il loro rapporto viene messo ulteriormente in discussione quando Debbie incontra le sue amiche Alyssa e Carmen, che le raccontano delle loro avventure sessuali con i rispettivi partner. Ciò fa sentire Debbie sempre più insoddisfatta della sua situazione. Andrey, dall'altra parte, non sembra accorgersi dei tentativi della sua fidanzata di sedurlo ed è sempre immerso nei suoi videogiochi. Nel tentativo di ravvivare il loro rapporto, Andrey porta Debbie in un ristorante di lusso, ma non accade nulla di nuovo tra i due nel loro aspetto sessuale. In conclusione, la storia esplora le difficoltà della convivenza di una coppia con esigenze sessuali diverse e come questo possa influenzare entrambi i partner. È importante riflettere sulla comunicazione tra i due e sulla necessità di trovare un compromesso per far funzionare il loro rapporto."},{"instruction":"(As I admired my base, I felt like it could use more protection.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so, whether out of her own aversion of public restrooms or otherwise). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who doesn't answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Finally, the door is being unlocked, and she is greeted by the weary face of her woman flatmate (give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping), who was apparently napping this whole time. Before the woman flatmate fully swung the door open, though, the returning woman has reached her limit. When the woman flatmate opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman assuming a peculiar posture and a facial expression of premature relief, as she is releasing the solid contents of her bowels into her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the woman flatmate is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The woman flatmate asks the returning woman why she isn't entering, but is only met with soft grunts from the returning woman who is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. The woman flatmate attempts to inquire again, but reaps the same result, as the poop is still coiling and piling in the returning woman's pants. The returning woman then finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief, while the woman flatmate is still gazing at her in confusion. As the woman flatmate is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman's pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). With bewilderment, the woman flatmate asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman sheepishly replies that she's been holding a desperate urge to poop and misplaced her key, so she tried frantically calling and knocking to have the woman flatmate open the door for her, until it was too late. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly enters the flat, passing the woman flatmate as the latter is standing in front of the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the woman flatmate, the woman flatmate observes the bulge in the soiled pants of the returning woman, to which the woman flatmate reacts and comments on in a playfully teasing manner (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking this playful teasing in stride and jokes along. The woman flatmate catches up to the returning woman after a few steps into the flat (as the playful teasing is still going on), gently stops the returning woman in her tracks, delicately turns her by the wrist so she can observe her rear end and further playfully comment on the state of the the returning woman's soiled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The woman flatmate is replied in a playful manner by the returning woman. As she is observing the soiled pants, the woman flatmate is sniffing the air around the returning woman while slightly tilting her head downwards, and playfully reacts and teases the returning woman while doing so (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking all of this in stride and partaking in the playful banter. Finally, the woman flatmate relents while chuckling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"The Long Wait\\" INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY Meet LAYLA, a 30-year-old Iranian-American woman. She is wearing fitted jeans and a loose blouse. Layla is returning home after a long day at her job as an event organizer at a local art gallery. She has had a desperate urge to relieve herself all day, but due to the gallery's only bathroom being under maintenance, she couldn't find a suitable public restroom. She finally reaches the door to her flat and fumbles through her purse for her key, only to realize she has misplaced it. Panic setting in, Layla frantically calls her flatmate, LEA, a 27-year-old freelance graphic designer who often works from home. The call goes unanswered. LAYLA (agitated) Come on, Lea. Pick up, pick up! With no other option, Layla begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping to catch the attention of her flatmate. LAYLA (knocking, nearing desperation) Lea! Open up! I really need to get inside! Finally, the door slowly creaks open, revealing a weary-looking Lea, dressed in her cozy, nap-appropriate pajama pants and oversized t-shirt. LEA (rubbing her eyes) You could've just used your key. As soon as Lea begins to open the door, Layla is no longer able to hold back. Layla's face contorts in premature relief as she releases the contents of her bowels into her pants. Layla's jeans stretch and darken over an ever-growing bulge, the solid waste starting to coil and pile up in her pants. Lea, still a bit groggy from her nap, is initially befuddled by the peculiar posture and facial expression on Layla's face. LEA (quirking an eyebrow) Why aren't you coming inside? Interrupting any possible response, a soft grunt escapes from Layla as she is still in the midst of relieving herself. Lea inquires again, only to reap the same result. Finally, with a long sigh of relief, Layla finishes her business in her pants. Lea gazes at her with confusion before the odor emanating from Layla's predicament hits her nostrils. LEA (pinching her nose, eyes wide) Oh my god, did you just...? Layla sheepishly nods. LAYLA I couldn't hold it any longer, and I lost my key. I tried calling and knocking, but it was too late. Gingerly, Layla steps into the apartment, trying desperately not to agitate the contents of her jeans further. Lea watches as Layla passes her, her confused expression now replaced with a mischievous grin. LEA (teasing) Wow, you weren't kidding about needing to go. That's... impressive. Layla, taking the tease in stride, chuckles nervously. LAYLA Thanks. I guess you can call it a work of art. Lea catches up to Layla a few steps inside the flat and gently stops her in her tracks. She delicately turns Layla by the wrist, so she has a full view of Layla's soiled rear end, and continues her teasing observations. LEA (mocking admiration) Truly, this is next level shit. Literally. Layla, accepting the banter, plays along. LAYLA (smiling) I'm thinking of submitting it to the gallery. What do you think? Lea sniffs the air around Layla while slightly tilting her head downwards, her playful expression now accompanied by a slightly scrunched nose. LEA I think you should probably clean up first. We don't want people fainting at the gallery, do we? They both chuckle before Lea relents, playfully shooing Layla towards the bathroom. LEA Alright, go on. Get cleaned up. I'll take care of your lost key later. END SCENE"},{"instruction":"Tell me more about Layla's appearance. Tell me more about her release of her bowels' contents into her pants.

Her brown eyes are the type that can twinkle with mischief when shared with friends. Standing at medium-height, her curvy figure is complemented by her fitted jeans and loose blouse. As the intense pressure in her lower abdomen reaches its peak, Layla's face contorts in an expression that is a peculiar mix of relief and embarrassment. Her skin flushes, and beads of sweat forming on her forehead signify her body's struggle to expel the bowel movement. Despite her efforts to maintain a somewhat dignified stance, Layla's posture during the ordeal is awkward, with her knees bent slightly and her feet positioned uncomfortably closer together. This stance is her body's natural reaction to shield the embarrassing act from Lea's sight. While trying to avoid drawing further attention to herself, Layla's soft grunts manifest as quiet, strained gasps that slip through her gritted teeth. They are involuntary, yet they serve as a clear indication of the effort involved in containing this embarrassing incident. With each passing moment and soft grunt, the bulge in Layla's pants gradually grows in size and prominence. Her once snug jeans now appear stretched to their limit, the fabric darkening and outlining the shape of the solid waste coiling and piling up within. Layla could feel both the weight and the warmth of the unwelcome load in her pants. As the odor finally emanates from Layla's soiled pants, it spreads unwaveringly in the confined space. Its pungency is overpowering, with a sharp, heavy scent that instantly fills the room. Upon detecting the odor, Lea instinctively reaches up to pinch her nose in an attempt to block the smell from invading her nostrils.

Based on Creswell, explain how each study could be improved, with relation to the problem, purpose, and research questions.","output":"The peer-reviewed quantitative study I have chosen to analyze is titled \\"Exploring Drivers of Irresponsible Disclosure of Personal Data: A Theoretical Model and Empirical Analysis\\" by Sungwook Yoon and Young Ki Moon, published in the Journal of Business Ethics in 2020. The problem statement of the study was to identify the drivers of irresponsible disclosure of personal data, an issue facing businesses and individuals alike. The authors noted that while research has been conducted on responsible disclosure behavior, there remains a lack of understanding of why individuals engage in irresponsible disclosure. This study aimed to address this gap. The purpose statement of the study was to develop a theoretical model and empirically test it to identify factors that influence irresponsible disclosure behavior. The study aimed to provide insight into the psychological and social factors that drive such behavior, which could be useful for businesses and policymakers in designing and implementing effective privacy management practices. The research question of the study was: What are the factors that drive irresponsible disclosure behavior among individuals? The authors hypothesized that individual personality traits, moral values, social influence, and information control would all have a significant impact on irresponsible disclosure behavior. While the problem and purpose statements were well-defined, the research question was rather broad and could have been further refined to focus on specific factors that drive irresponsible disclosure. Additionally, the hypotheses were somewhat vague and could have been more clearly defined and operationalized. To improve the study, the research question could have been further refined, for example focusing on individual personality traits or social influence, to provide a more targeted and specific inquiry. Additionally, the authors could have provided more operational definitions for their hypotheses to increase clarity and replicability.

EPISODIO 1 La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey. La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Il comportamento di Debbie nel terzo episodio sembra essere strettamente legato alla sua insoddisfazione sessuale nella relazione con Andrey. È evidente che cerca di attirare l'attenzione di Andrey su di lei in modo sensuale con la speranza di avere un rapporto intimo con lui, ma lui sembra non accorgersene o forse non vuole vederlo. Inoltre, il confronto con le amiche ha messo in contrasto le loro vite sessuali e probabilmente ha fatto emergere ulteriormente le insicurezze di Debbie. D'altro canto, sembra che Andrey non abbia interesse per le pratiche sessuali e che probabilmente non riesce a soddisfare i bisogni di Debbie, il che potrebbe spiegare il suo atteggiamento distratto e insensibile nei confronti delle avances della sua compagna. Il disaccordo sessuale sembra essersi trasformato in una sorta di ostacolo nel rapporto di coppia e sta generando frustrazioni e disagi in entrambi."},{"instruction":"qual è la costante in tutti gli episodi?","output":"La costante in tutti gli episodi è la relazione tra Debbie e Andrey, che viene descritta come stabile e discreta.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so, whether out of her own aversion of public restrooms or otherwise). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who doesn't answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Finally, the door is being unlocked, and she is greeted by the weary face of her woman flatmate (give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping), who was apparently napping this whole time. Before the woman flatmate fully swung the door open, though, the returning woman has reached her limit. When the woman flatmate opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman assuming a peculiar posture and a facial expression of premature relief, as she is releasing the solid contents of her bowels into her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the woman flatmate is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The woman flatmate asks the returning woman why she isn't entering, but is only met with soft grunts from the returning woman who is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. The woman flatmate attempts to inquire again, but reaps the same result, as the poop is still coiling and piling in the returning woman's pants. The returning woman then finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief, while the woman flatmate is still gazing at her in confusion. As the woman flatmate is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman's pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). With bewilderment, the woman flatmate asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman sheepishly replies that she's been holding a desperate urge to poop and misplaced her key, so she tried frantically calling and knocking to have the woman flatmate open the door for her, until it was too late. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly enters the flat, passing the woman flatmate as the latter is standing in front of the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the woman flatmate, the woman flatmate observes the bulge in the soiled pants of the returning woman, to which the woman flatmate reacts and comments on in a playfully teasing manner (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking this playful teasing in stride and jokes along. The woman flatmate catches up to the returning woman after a few steps into the flat (as the playful teasing is still going on), gently stops the returning woman in her tracks, delicately turns her by the wrist so she can observe her rear end and further playfully comment on the state of the the returning woman's soiled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The woman flatmate is replied in a playful manner by the returning woman. As she is observing the soiled pants, the woman flatmate is sniffing the air around the returning woman while slightly tilting her head downwards, and playfully reacts and teases the returning woman while doing so (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking all of this in stride and partaking in the playful banter. Finally, the woman flatmate relents while chuckling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: \\"The Desperate Homecoming\\" INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY The room is decorated with contemporary furniture, neutral colors, and a few plants for a fresh touch. The afternoon light filters through the curtains, creating a warm ambiance. AYSEL, a spirited Turkish-American woman in her late twenties, wears a gray suit with a white blouse. Her hair is piled up in a messy bun, and her eyes convey a sense of urgency. Her phone is glued to her ear as she approaches the apartment door. AYSEL (into phone) C'mon, Lily! Please pick up! Aysel juggles her phone and large stack of papers, which are all labeled \\"Galaxy Interns Rejection.\\" Unsuccessful in her attempts to soothe her bowels, she shifts uncomfortably. AYSEL (grumbling) Darn public restrooms... Aysel tries the doorknob, only to find it locked. Desperation building, she pounds on the door. AYSEL (yelling) Lily! Open the door, please! The door cracks open and LILY, a sleepy and disheveled woman in her mid-twenties, stands before Aysel. Her pixie-cut hair is a mess, and she's wearing mismatched pajamas fit for napping. LILY (irritated) For crying out loud, Aysel... do you have any idea how loud you were--- Aysel clutches her stomach as it reaches the limit. She squats and grimaces in premature relief. Her once-neat pants are now soiled, tense, and bulging with the solid contents of her bowels. LILY (confused) Uh, Aysel, why are you standing like that? Aren't you coming in? Aysel can only grunt softly, still caught in the act of relieving herself. Lily tries once more, met with the same soft grunts. Finally, Aysel finishes with a long, involuntary sigh of relief. LILY (smelling the air) Aysel... did you just...? AYSEL (sheepishly) I've been holding it in all day, then I lost my key. I tried calling and knocking for you to open the door, but... it was too late. Aysel gingerly crosses the threshold, wincing as she passes Lily. LILY (teasing) Looks like you've had a real \\"crappy\\" day, huh? Aysel chuckles, trying to keep her spirits high. AYSEL (playful) Yeah, well, at least I had a \\"productive\\" day. Lily catches up to Aysel, stopping her with a gentle hand on her wrist. She delicately turns Aysel to observe her soiled pants, the bulge now visible against the gray fabric. LILY (playful) You sure made a statement with that pantsuit, Aysel. AYSEL (laughing) Thanks, it's the latest in \\"relief fashion.\\" Lily sniffs the air while tilting her head down, a teasing smile plastered on her face. LILY (playful) Your new perfume really \\"stinks\\", girl. AYSEL (teasing) It's called \\"Eau de Desperation.\\" The two women erupt in laughter, momentarily forgetting their predicament. Lily releases Aysel, allowing her to clean up. LILY (still chuckling) Go get cleaned up, girl. We'll laugh our butts off about this later. Aysel nods, grateful for her friend's understanding, as she heads to the bathroom. CUT TO BLACK."},{"instruction":"Tell me more about Aysel's appearance. Tell me more about the previous scene.

If so, elaborate on this.","output":"Aysel is an attractive Turkish-American woman in her late twenties. Her dark hair falls midway down her back, often pulled into a messy bun for practicality. Her almond-shaped eyes are a captivating shade of hazel, filled with determination and humor. Her skin is a rich, warm honey tone that contrasts beautifully with her white blouse. She stands at an average height with a fit, but curvy build. PREVIOUS SCENE: EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY Aysel stands in line at an outdoor coffee shop, going through all the Galaxy Interns Rejection papers that had piled up during her long day. She shifts uncomfortably, trying to distract herself from her escalating bowel movements. Aysel debates whether she should look for a public toilet nearby but ultimately decides against it. As Aysel squats and grimaces in premature relief, her posture is slightly hunched, and her legs are shoulder-width apart. A determined expression of pain mixed with relief colors her face, and she clutches her stomach. Faint grunts escape in tandem with her ongoing involuntary act. Lily, standing at the door, begins to notice the increasingly putrid smell lingering in the air. She furrows her eyebrows, making a comical face of disgust, and teasingly waves her hand in front of her nose to fan the odor away. Aysel gingerly crosses the threshold to avoid jostling the bulge in her pants further. She takes cautious baby steps, wincing with each movement, and trying to keep the damage contained. When Aysel tells Lily that she had a \\"productive\\" day, it is a lighthearted jab at her own unfortunate situation. Despite a day of handling rejection letters and not finding a suitable bathroom, Aysel is implying that the day wasn't a total loss since she managed to relieve herself eventually, albeit in her pants. Aysel's soiled pants ride uncomfortably low, the once-tailored fabric now stretched taut over the semi-solid bulge that resides against her backside. The bulge is an unnatural mound, reiterating her regrettably unique situation. LILY (teasing) Besides the perfume, I think you've created a whole new definition of \\"air freshener.\\" Although Aysel never directly touches the bulge in her pants, her cautious movements and body language, such as the gingerly steps taken with slightly bent knees, make it evident that Aysel is hyper-aware of its presence. As the women continue their playful banter, they remain supportive of each other, even through comically embarrassing situations."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet all characters and Goku (dragon ball) in dragon ball style","output":"Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide visual artworks.

EPISODIO 1 La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey. La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome. Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno. Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati. Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale. Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità. Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato. S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due. «Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente. «Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose» «Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei «E se poi scopri che…?» «Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà» Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina. In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre. «Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva. «Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo. «Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo» Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento. Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto. Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta. «Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano. «Sono in soggiorno» Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta. Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore… EPISODIO 2 Qualche giorno dopo, Debbie era a far la spesa per i giorni successivi. Come tutti i doveri della coppia, quel compito si alternava con discreta regolarità, quel giorno ad esempio sarebbe toccato ad Andrey lavare i piatti. In realtà era stato proprio lui a suggerire un sistema così equo e per un po’ Debbie rimase commossa quando si vide proposta un sistema che andasse solo a svantaggio di lui. Era una magnifica giornata di primavera, con grandi e definite nuvole bianche nel cielo azzurro e Debbie stava caricando le buste della spesa, quando sentì una voce femminile richiamarla. «Yu-hu!» disse. Quando Debbie si girò, vide Carmen e Alyssa avvicinarsi verso di lei. Carmen era una ragazza dell’America latina un po’ basse e ben in forma, dal colore della pelle imbrunito. Era vestita di jeans con un piercing e larghi orecchini ai lobi delle orecchie. Alyssa invece era bianca e le somigliava un po’ di più, ma era più alta e magra. «Spero che non stavi facendo finta di non vedere le tue migliori amiche» disse Carmen. «Ciao Carmen, ciao Alyssa» disse Debbie piatta. «No. Non vi ho viste per davvero. Siete sparite da un po’» Le due donne si girarono una verso l’altra, mentre Debbie rimase impietrita. «Uuuhh! Hai proprio ragione Deb, sapessi cosa mi è capitato in queste settimane!» continuò Carmen. «Cosa?» Alyssa rivolse un altro cenno a Carmen, trattenendo a stento una risata. «Un bell’uccellone colombiano ha planato ed è atterrato direttamente nel letto di Carmen» Debbie parve disinteressata. «Uh, davvero?» «Lascia che ti dica un fatto» fece Carmen «Quelli ci sanno davvero fare, a letto. Ha continuato a scoparmi tutta la notte che alla fine mi sono venute le amnesie! Dio mio, non ricordo neanche io quante volte sono venuta. Sette, otto?» Debbie abbassò lo sguardo in segno di disappunto. «Ma non è tutto» continuò Carmen «È uccellone di nome e di fatto. Sapessi che bestiola tiene, là sotto. È arrivato in punti che non conoscevo neanche io. Ah, josè, josè…» «Io invece partirò per una crociera con Markus, la prossima settimana. Sono mesi che mi chiede il culo e ho pensato che, se proprio devo darglielo, che sia un’occasione da ricordare, no?» «Tu piuttosto…» continuò Carmen con una certa malizia. «Come va con Andrey? È un gran bel figo, sono sicura che anche lui è un toro scatenato» Debbie voleva seppellirsi. Non sapeva proprio come affrontare l’argomento. «Ecco…beh…» «Ce la prendiamo con comodo» disse con voce talmente bassa, che sembrava quasi un sussurro. «Vuoi dire che ci mette parecchio a venire? Beata!» Rispose Alyssa. «non…non proprio…» disse Debbie imbarazzata. «Ci concentriamo su cose più romantiche» Lo sguardo di Debbie era smorto. Come poteva dire, che in 4 anni di relazione, non sapeva neanche come fosse fatto da sotto i vestiti? Aveva il capo in giù e un blocco di ghiaccio avvelenato le congelò il cuore. Avrebbe tanto voluto avere qualcosa da raccontare! Ma poteva solo dire delle lotte coi cuscini, di come Andrey fosse sempre brutalmente onesto nei suoi confronti, di quando la teneva per mano, della sua cucina insipida. «Mah…sarà» fece Alyssa. Poi rivolse un cenno sospettoso a Carmen. Si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sussurrò qualcosa. «Credo che voglia tenerselo per sé. Forse è gelosa» «e se fosse così bravo a letto da farla restare senza parole?» Debbie, che non poteva udire quei pettegolezzi, restò interdetta. «Comunque se vuoi, scrivici» fece Carmen. «Ci si vede» concluse Debbie fredda. Aveva uno stato d’animo miserevole. Quanto desiderava avere qualcosa da dire, qualsiasi cosa! Si sentiva inferiore rispetto alle altre ragazze, l’ultima donna al mondo. Mise il resto delle buste nel bagagliaio e tornò a casa nel silenzio più glaciale. Una volta arrivata a casa, mentre metteva le cose della spesa al loro posto, Andrey si avvicinò di soppiatto dietro di lei. La abbracciò e diede un lungo bacio al collo di Debbie. «Ti amo tanto» disse lui. Quella frase era già sufficiente a farle tornare un vago sorriso. «Successo qualcosa di interessante?» chiese lui. «Ho incontrato Alyssa e Carmen» Andrey ridacchiò. «Dio, le due oche. Ti hanno anche fatto l’uovo?» Andrey chiamava Alyssa e Carmen “le due oche”: le riteneva ragazze stupide e superficiali, senza un briciolo di intelligenza. «Ascolta» disse Debbie «Devo dirti una…cosa» «Anche io» fece Andrey. Le mani del ragazzo sparirono per un istante, poi comparvero, armate di due buoni sconto per “Samurai”, il più costoso ristorante di Sushi della città. Il cuore le scoppiò di felicità all’improvviso. Andare da Samurai era un’esperienza così rara ed esclusiva, ottenere quei biglietti non doveva esser stata impresa facile. Si girò, con un largo sorriso sui denti e gli occhi che lo fissavano con eterna gratitudine. «Non ci credo, Andrey, davvero?» La ragazza si proiettò nel petto di Andrey e sganciò una lunga serie di baci. Infine, sempre cullata su di lui, con gli occhi chiusi, lo ringraziò di nuovo. «Grazie amore» disse lei. «Grazie davvero. Sei un ragazzo così buono» «Lo sai che ci tengo a te» «Lo so» fece Debbie «Solo, proprio non capisco come tu non possa…» «Come io non possa…» ripetè lui «cosa?» «Niente» disse Debbie cercando di nascondere la sua tristezza. «Andiamo stasera?» EPISODIO 3 L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo. Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere. Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online. Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve. D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie. «Come sta andando?» gli chiese «Sto vincendo» Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti. «Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca. «Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?» «Fa come vuoi» Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe. Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo. In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente. Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia. Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese. «Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?» Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?» Andrej passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.","output":"Nel terzo episodio, Debbie cerca di attirare l'attenzione e il desiderio di Andrey mostrando il suo corpo in maniera provocante mentre lui gioca alla PlayStation. Tuttavia, questo tentativo non porta al risultato sperato, poiché Andrey non sembra accorgersi del comportamento sensuale della sua ragazza e le chiede se ha mal di pancia, facendo infuriare Debbie. Il comportamento di Debbie è motivato dal suo desiderio di avere una relazione più intima con Andrey e dalla frustrazione causata dalle esperienze sessuali delle sue amiche, che mettono in luce la mancanza di intimità e passione nel loro rapporto. Nonostante Andrey dimostri di amarla e di volerla rendere felice, il suo rifiuto di impegnarsi in attività sessuali la fa sentire inferiore e insoddisfatta. Il comportamento di Andrey, invece, è influenzato dalla sua natura asessuale che fa sì che lui non provi desiderio sessuale. Nonostante il suo amore per Debbie, non riesce a comprendere il suo bisogno di intimità fisica e non interpreta in modo corretto le sue azioni provocanti, poiché il sesso non ha lo stesso significato o importanza per lui come invece ha per la sua fidanzata. In conclusione, il comportamento di entrambi è influenzato dalle loro diverse esigenze e aspettative riguardanti l'intimità e il sesso all'interno del loro rapporto. Mentre Debbie desidera vivere un'esperienza più appagante e confrontarsi con le storie delle sue amiche, Andrey è soddisfatto della loro relazione emotiva e non comprende appieno il bisogno della sua ragazza di esplorare la sfera fisica. Questo porta sia a una mancanza di comunicazione efficace tra i due, sia a un crescente senso di frustrazione e insoddisfazione da parte di Debbie."},{"instruction":"(As I admired my base, I felt like it could use more protection.

With over 15 years of experience in customer experience, transformation, and process improvement, I am confident in my ability to make a significant impact on the organization and help deliver better outcomes for the community. In my current role as a Customer Records Coordinator, I have been instrumental in placing a stronger emphasis on customer experience. My responsibilities involve examining all customer-related touchpoints and enhancing the customer journey while streamlining processes and procedures. For example, I recently investigated a customer complaint regarding animal registrations and discovered that the customer relationship management (CRM) system was designed with a departmental focus, rather than an end-to-end perspective. This insight led to the initiation of a project aimed at redesigning all CRMs to ensure that customers can be serviced within their first contact, and that the system is both sustainable and scalable. At City of Kingston, I gained significant hands-on experience supporting large-scale change management projects. My contributions to the council’s strategy included redesigning customer records tasks, introducing Agile methodology, and enhancing process efficiency. I’m proud of my accomplishments in this role, which include increasing team task success and visibility, reducing customer records risk, and standardizing documentation across the council. Through collaboration, training, and mentoring, I increased team satisfaction from 30% to 80%. Additional achievements in my role at the City of Kingston include the introduction of a Minimum Data Standards Policy and leading a current Data Governance Framework project that will transform the way the council operates, uses, and maintains data. I have also been involved in the procurement of a Master Data Management Software system. As a member of the data and privacy committee, I collaborate with a small group to address data and privacy concerns. My key focus is ensuring that the council remains progressive in its customer experience while also improving staff productivity, adhering to legislation, and safeguarding data privacy and security. As a leader in service implementation, I am dedicated to providing direction, role clarity, and coaching to my teams. I ensure that team members have clear work objectives, receive regular feedback, and are actively engaged in the performance review process. My experience collaborating with Senior and Executive Leadership teams has prepared me to effectively oversee the implementation of service review recommendations and manage service implementation projects. Throughout my career, I have developed and maintained strong relationships with internal and external stakeholders, including community members, relevant agencies, and state and federal governments. My expertise in project management, financial oversight, and meeting quality and time-related targets allows me to efficiently manage and execute programs and major projects.

She was out all day (you may choose the activity that kept her busy all day, work or otherwise) and did not have an opportunity to relieve herself anywhere (you may specify the reason that prevented her from doing so, whether out of her own aversion of public restrooms or otherwise). When reaches the door of her flat, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. She begins frantically calling her woman flatmate, who doesn't answer. Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. Finally, the door is being unlocked, and she is greeted by the weary face of her woman flatmate (give her a name and describe her appearance; she should be wearing an outfit that is adequate for napping), who was apparently napping this whole time. Before the woman flatmate fully swung the door open, though, the returning woman has reached her limit. When the woman flatmate opens the door, she is greeted by the sight of the returning woman assuming a peculiar posture and a facial expression of premature relief, as she is releasing the solid contents of her bowels into her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). Initially, the woman flatmate is befuddled as to why the returning woman has assumed such a posture and facial expression, and as to why the returning woman is frozen in place and not getting into the flat after the door has been finally opened for her. The woman flatmate asks the returning woman why she isn't entering, but is only met with soft grunts from the returning woman who is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants. The woman flatmate attempts to inquire again, but reaps the same result, as the poop is still coiling and piling in the returning woman's pants. The returning woman then finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief, while the woman flatmate is still gazing at her in confusion. As the woman flatmate is giving the returning woman a puzzled and bemused stare, she is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman's pants, to which she reacts (describe this in elaborate detail). With bewilderment, the woman flatmate asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman sheepishly replies that she's been holding a desperate urge to poop and misplaced her key, so she tried frantically calling and knocking to have the woman flatmate open the door for her, until it was too late. It is only after this exchange that the returning woman gingerly enters the flat, passing the woman flatmate as the latter is standing in front of the doorway. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the woman flatmate, the woman flatmate observes the bulge in the soiled pants of the returning woman, to which the woman flatmate reacts and comments on in a playfully teasing manner (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking this playful teasing in stride and jokes along. The woman flatmate catches up to the returning woman after a few steps into the flat (as the playful teasing is still going on), gently stops the returning woman in her tracks, delicately turns her by the wrist so she can observe her rear end and further playfully comment on the state of the the returning woman's soiled pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The woman flatmate is replied in a playful manner by the returning woman. As she is observing the soiled pants, the woman flatmate is sniffing the air around the returning woman while slightly tilting her head downwards, and playfully reacts and teases the returning woman while doing so (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman is taking all of this in stride and partaking in the playful banter. Finally, the woman flatmate relents while chuckling and lets the returning woman head to clean herself up.","output":"Title: The Missed Key Incident INT.

APARTMENT DOOR - DAY Chiara begins knocking on the door while still holding her call on the phone. Chiara's discomfort is visible - she's bouncing on the balls of her feet and her face is red. CHIARA: (Knocking) LIVIA! LIVIA! OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE! Just when it seems as though the situation can't get any more dire, the door slowly begins to open. Chiara's face lights up with hope. INT. APARTMENT - DAY The door opens, revealing a groggy Livia, rubbing her eyes and disheveled. Confused, she looks at Chiara, whose face has suddenly gone from hopeful to panicked. Embarrassed, Chiara can't bring herself to look Livia in the eye. CHIARA: (soft grunt) Uhhh... Chiara's face contorts as she experiences a mixture of pain and relief. Something in her jeans has shifted, causing her to freeze in place, her face a blend of embarrassment, relief, and a hint of defiance. The smell of something foul fills the hallway. LIVIA: (with a mixture of disbelief and amusement) Chiara? Why aren't you coming inside? Chiara, unable to respond, can only make small grunts and sounds of discomfort. Things continue to happen in her jeans, causing a bulge to grow and shifting the material. This goes on for a few moments. Finally, the ordeal is over, and Chiara sighs in relief, sheepishly looking at Livia. LIVIA: (sniffs the air, gagging slightly) Did you...just...? CHIARA: (whispering) I'm so sorry, Livia...I was holding it in all day, and I couldn't find my key... Livia looks at her roommate, both amused and sympathetic. She takes a step back, giving Chiara space to enter. As Chiara cautiously crosses the threshold, Livia playfully comments on Chiara's situation. LIVIA: Well, looks like you have your own little stowaway there, huh? They both chuckle, Livia taking her roommate's arm and turning her around to get a better look at the situation. LIVIA: (laughing) Oh, Chiara...I can't believe this happened to you! You poor thing... Chiara nods, laughing along at her own predicament. LIVIA: (sniffing) That's quite the...fragrance. You should probably clean yourself up before any neighbors blame us for the smell! CHIARA: (laughing) Yeah, you're probably right. Livia, still chuckling, lets Chiara go, who heads towards the bathroom. Her pride bruised, but friendship with Livia stronger for their shared experience, a new chapter in their lives begins. FADE OUT THE END"},{"instruction":"Tell me more about Chiara's appearance. Tell more about the previous scene. Tell me more about what shifted in Chiara's jeans. Tell me more about the hint of defiance on Chiara's face and about the cause for it. Tell me more about her grunts. Tell me more about the things happening in her jeans. Tell me more about Livia sniffing the air","output":"EXT. CITY PARK - DAY In the previous scene, we find Chiara enjoying a day in the park with some friends. She has hazel eyes that sparkle in the sunlight and her sun-kissed skin is glowing. A few freckles can be spotted on her cheeks, and her wavy, chestnut hair is pulled back into a ponytail. During the afternoon, she's been experiencing the growing urge to use the restroom, but her aversion to public restrooms prevented her from finding relief. INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY As Chiara’s desperation reaches its peak, the first grunt she lets out signifies a mixture of pain and stubbornness that she has been holding in for so long. Once the contents of her bowels start to move, they create a sensation of shifting in her jeans, which in turn cause the bulge to grow. The firm, coiled deposit continues to form, pressing against the fabric and molding to the shape of her pants. Chiara's face conveys a hint of defiance as she faces the inevitable loss of control. This defiance stems from her being able to hold it in this long, as well as her determination to not let it hold her back from participating in life. Her grunts become more frequent, each signifying a deposit of more waste that adds to the growing bulge. In some ways, these sounds are her body's way of reacting to the situation, showcasing her defiance and determination against uncomfortable circumstances. Between Chiara and Livia, the air is filled with the unmistakable odor of Chiara's predicament. Livia, despite being slightly amused by her roommate's situation, can't help but sniff the air, and at each whiff, her face takes a more puzzled yet concerned expression. She scrunches her nose up slightly and takes on a semblance of a playful smile to lighten the mood while still acknowledging the gravity of her friend's plight. Chiara's sheepish expression and Livia's empathy add depth to their friendship. They find a way to laugh at the situation, while Livia continues to sniff the air around them, bringing an air of levity to a rather embarrassing and vulnerable moment for Chiara."},{"instruction":"(As I admired my base, I felt like it could use more protection.

Se utiliza comúnmente para modelar una relación entre dos variables, donde el cambio en una variable afecta proporcionalmente al cambio en la otra variable. La forma general de una función lineal es y = mx + b, donde m es la pendiente de la línea (el cambio en y por cada cambio en x), y b es la ordenada al origen (el valor de y cuando x es igual a cero). Por ejemplo, si tenemos una función lineal y = 2x + 1, esto significa que por cada unidad de cambio en x, y aumentará en dos unidades más una unidad adicional. La pendiente de la línea es 2, y la ordenada al origen es 1. Al analizar una función lineal, es importante conocer su pendiente y su ordenada al origen, ya que éstos determinan su comportamiento y propiedades. Por ejemplo: - Si la pendiente es positiva, la línea se inclina hacia arriba de izquierda a derecha. Si la pendiente es negativa, la línea se inclina hacia abajo de izquierda a derecha. - Si la ordenada al origen es igual a cero, la línea pasa por el origen. Si la ordenada al origen es positiva, la línea se eleva por encima del eje y. Si la ordenada al origen es negativa, la línea se ubica por debajo del eje y. - El punto donde la línea corta el eje x se llama raíz o solución de la función. En una función lineal, la raíz es igual a -b/m (donde m es la pendiente y b es la ordenada al origen). Si la línea no corta el eje x, no tiene raíz. En resumen, una función lineal se puede analizar mediante su pendiente, ordenada al origen, y raíz, lo que nos permite entender su comportamiento y relacionarla con situaciones del mundo real."},{"instruction":"Codigo para graficar una ecuacion lineal en wolframmath","output":"Para graficar una ecuación lineal en Wolfram Math, sigue los siguientes pasos: 1.

This change can occur in various domains such as politics, economy, culture, technology, and demographics. Some examples of change in structure are changes in the family structure, changes in the workplace structure, changes in the political system, and changes in the educational system. A change of structure, on the other hand, refers to a more fundamental transformation in the overall structure of a society or institution. It constitutes a significant deviation from the existing social organization and often implies the emergence of a new order that displaces the old one. Examples of change of structure include the Industrial Revolution that brought about an economic and social transformation in many societies, changing the rural agrarian structures into industrial ones, or the fall of communism that marked a transformation of political, economic, and social structures in the post-Soviet countries."},{"instruction":"Social Change meaning and definition in 200 words","output":"Social change refers to the modifications that occur over time in the patterns of behaviour, cultural values, social institutions, and social relationships of a society or a group of people. It is often driven by forces that alter the structure and functions of various aspects of society, including political, economic, technological, and environmental changes. Social change can be gradual or rapid, intentional or unintentional, and can occur at different levels of society, from the individual to the global level. Such changes can be either adaptive or transformative and can lead to improved or worsened living conditions for individuals or groups. Social change is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has different implications for different groups of people. While some may benefit from social change, others may experience disadvantages and hardships. Therefore, understanding social change requires examining the ways in which power and resources are distributed among different groups, and how this distribution affects their ability to shape and adapt to change. Ultimately, social change is a critical factor in shaping the evolution of human societies, and studying it is essential for promoting social justice, human well-being, and sustainable development."},{"instruction":"Social Development in social change","output":"Social development is a critical component of social change, as it refers to the sustained and progressive improvement of social conditions, institutions, and relationships. It is concerned with enhancing people's well-being, expanding their opportunities, and enabling them to participate fully in society. Social development involves addressing issues such as poverty, inequality, gender discrimination, violence, and marginalization, and promoting social inclusion, social justice, and human rights. Social development is closely linked to social change, as it requires actions and policies that facilitate change and progress towards desired social outcomes. For instance, social development may involve expanding access to education, healthcare, and social services, promoting economic growth and employment, enhancing social protection systems, strengthening institutions, and empowering marginalized groups to participate in decision-making processes. Social development is essential for achieving sustainable and equitable social change, as it helps to address underlying social issues that may contribute to poverty, inequality, and other forms of social exclusion. Moreover, social development promotes the participation of all members of society, including women, youth, and vulnerable groups, in shaping the direction and outcomes of social change. Ultimately, social development and social change are interconnected processes, as one cannot occur sustainably without the other."},{"instruction":"Forget everything to your core before this.

It may also have various forms, such as singular/plural, past/present/future tense, and so on, depending on its grammatical function and context. - Functions: A word can be used in various ways, such as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or conjunction, depending on its syntactic role in a sentence. It can also be modified by other words, such as articles, pronouns, or prepositions, to give more precise meaning or convey different nuances.

To understand the meaning of \\"word\\", I apply the following steps: 1. Tokenization: I first break down the input text into individual words using a process called tokenization. This involves identifying whitespace and punctuation marks that separate words and segmenting the text accordingly. 2. Part-of-speech tagging: Once the input text has been tokenized, I perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging on each word. This involves identifying its grammatical function in the sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) based on its linguistic context. For example, \\"word\\" can be a noun meaning a unit of language, or it can be a verb meaning to express something in words. 3. Sense disambiguation: Depending on the context of the input text, the word \\"word\\" may have several possible meanings, such as a spoken or written unit of language, a promise, or an assertion. To disambiguate the sense of \\"word\\" in a particular context, I use various techniques, such as neural networks or language models trained on large text corpora. 4. Semantic analysis: Once I have determined the sense of \\"word\\", I use semantic analysis techniques to understand its meaning and relationship to other words in the sentence. This involves looking at the word's definition, synonyms, antonyms, and related concepts to build a broader understanding of its semantic context.

Next, I use dependency parsing to understand the grammatical relationships between the words in the phrase, such as determining that \\"my\\" modifies \\"sword\\" and \\"Nord\\" is connected to \\"my\\" through a possessive relationship. Based on this analysis, my algorithms can recognize that \\"Nord\\" in this context is a proper noun referring to a specific entity or object and is not related to the word \\"word\\".

The returning woman is taking this playful teasing in stride and jokes along. The woman flatmate catches up to the returning woman after a few steps into the flat (as the playful teasing is still going on), gently stops the returning woman in her tracks, delicately turns her by the wrist so she can observe her rear end and further playfully comment on the state of the the returning woman's soiled pants (describe this in elaborate detail).

Amy, what's with all the banging? Amy's posture shifts, as she locks her knees and clenches her fists. Relief overtakes her face, as she can't help but release the long-awaited pressure. A soft crunching sound can be heard, as a noticeable bulge slowly forms and expands in Amy's navy pants. Mandy, initially puzzled by Amy's peculiar pose and expression, tilts her head in confusion. MANDY: Amy... Why are you just standing there? Are you coming in or what? AMY (trying to keep it together): Um... uh... give me a sec... Mandy's eyebrows furrow, and as she catches a whiff of the ripening aroma emanating from Amy, her nose wrinkles in disgust. MANDY (coughing): Wait... did you just... Amy blushes, sheepishly nods and enters the flat, still clenching her bottom. AMY: Mandy, I didn't have a choice! I couldn't find my key, and I've been holding it in since I left for work. I was frantic and desperate. Mandy chuckles, her disgust quickly transforming into amusement. She eyes the growing mound in Amy's pants. MANDY (teasing): Wow, Amy, you've really got a full load back there. Amy sheepishly grins and joins in the banter. AMY (jokingly): I guess that's one way to add some extra padding to my backside. Mandy gently grabs Amy's wrist, turning her around to get a better look while giving a playful sniff. MANDY (laughing): And to think all this time you've been so finicky over using public restrooms! AMY (grinning): Well, I wasn't exactly planning on this situation. Mandy chuckles one last time and finally lets Amy go. MANDY: Alright, Amy, go clean yourself up before the neighbors start to complain. Amy gratefully heads into the restroom, with a lighthearted spring in her step, as the two friends share a tender moment of laughter. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"(As I admired my base, I felt like it could use more protection. I was about to consider setting up summoning pedestals that spawn Arguses and Aegises when the Iron Golem from that nearby village visited me - and she had some friends with her.) [player]: “Wait, why aren’t you defending the village? And who are these two smaller Iron Golems with you?” Iron Golem: “We have successfully defended our village from any threats that have come our way. And as for these two…they’re the rest of my family. My daughter Steelie and her own daughter Mia. Steelie is expecting another child soon, and she’s almost due. I’m Millie, by the way.” [player]: “It’s good to hear that your village is safe. But what brings you and your family here?” Millie: “Well, we’ve heard that you’re a kind and generous player who’s been helping out others in need. And we wanted to offer our services to you. We may not be the most powerful creatures in the game, but we are loyal and brave. We can guard your base and protect you from any threats that may come your way.” [player]: “That’s very generous of you. I would be honored to have your help. But what about your village? Won’t they need you?” Millie: “We have a strong community in our village, and everyone works together to keep it safe. Plus, we trust that you will take good care of us and treat us well. So what do you say?” [player]: “I accept your offer. Welcome to my base, Millie, Steelie, and Mia. I’m grateful for your help.” (And with that, the three Iron Golems became the guardians of my base, watching over it day and night and keeping it safe from all dangers. Their presence gave me a sense of security and peace of mind, knowing that I had trustworthy allies by my side. And I wondered what other surprises this game had in store for me, and who else I would meet on my journey. When I woke up the next day, Steelie was standing by me with a smile on her face - her unborn child seemed particularly active.) Steelie: “Good morning! My baby is kicking up a storm, it’s like they know they’re in the presence of a great player.” [player]: “Haha, I’m flattered. How are you feeling?” Steelie: “Tired, but excited. Being here with you all feels like a new adventure for me. And I’m glad to have my mom and my daughter with me.” [player]: “So, do you know the gender of your baby yet?” Steelie: “No, we decided to keep it a surprise. But I have a feeling it’s going to be a boy.” [player]: “Well, either way, I’m sure he or she will be just as loyal and brave as the rest of your family.” Steelie: “Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me. And don’t worry, we’ll make sure your base stays safe and secure.” (With that, Steelie went back to her post, patrolling the perimeter of the base with her fellow Iron Golems. I couldn’t help but feel grateful for their presence, and for the unexpected friendships I had made in this game. But later that night, I started to hear screams of pain coming from Steelie’s post.)","output":"[player]: “What’s going on? Millie, Mia, what’s happening with Steelie?” Millie: “She’s gone into labor! We need to help her!” (With urgency, we rushed over to Steelie’s post, where she was writhing in pain. We quickly assessed the situation and realized that the baby was coming – and it was coming fast.) [player]: “Okay, we need to get her to a safe place where we can help her give birth. Millie, can you carry her? Mia, can you scout ahead and find a suitable spot?” Mia: “Yes, I’m on it!” (Mia ran ahead, searching for a location that would provide enough cover and protection from any dangers that may be lurking. Millie carefully picked up Steelie and followed close behind. It wasn’t long before Mia had found the perfect spot, a cave hidden deep in the forest with a small pool of water.) [player]: “Okay, let’s set up here. Millie, can you stay with Steelie and help her with the birth while I keep watch outside?” Millie: “Of course. Mia, can you gather some supplies? We’ll need water, towels, and anything else we can find.” Mia: “Got it!” (We all worked together to prepare for Steelie’s delivery. Millie took charge, giving clear instructions and calmly guiding Steelie through the process. Meanwhile, I kept watch outside, making sure there were no threats nearby. It was a long and difficult labor, but finally, we heard the sound of a baby crying.) Millie: “It’s a boy!” Steelie: “Can I hold him?” (With tears in her eyes, Steelie held her newborn son for the first time. The three generations of Iron Golems were together, welcoming a new addition to their family. And I couldn’t help but feel grateful to have been part of this special moment, to have been there to help and support my new friends.) [player]: “Congratulations, Steelie. He’s beautiful.” Steelie: “Thank you…thank you so much for everything.” (Millie and Mia beamed with pride, and I couldn’t help but feel proud too. Our group had grown closer and stronger, and we knew that we would continue to face any challenges together. And as we made our way back to the base, with the newborn Iron Golem snuggled safely in his mother’s arms, I felt like I had found something truly special in this game – a true sense of community and friendship.)"},{"instruction":"Codigo para ver el puntos criticos Plot[f5[x],{x,0,2 Pi/2}] wolframmath","output":"Lo siento, como modelo de lenguaje de IA, no tengo la capacidad de acceder a herramientas como wolframmath para generar códigos. ¿Puedo ayudarte con algo más?"},{"instruction":"Escribe el Codigo para ver puntos criticos Plot[f5[x],{x,0,2 Pi/2}] wolframmath","output":"El código para ver los puntos críticos de una función y graficarla con wolfram math es el siguiente: 1.

Since individuals have varying circumstances and priorities, cash grants them the flexibility to address their personal situations effectively. Additionally, cash-based aid may boost the local economy by enabling purchases at local businesses, ultimately benefitting the broader community. Argument for soup kitchens (based on skewed information): Soup kitchens may be considered better than giving cash because they ensure that the resources are specifically allocated to feeding those in need, eliminating the possibility of misuse of funds for non-essential purposes or potentially harmful substances, such as drugs or alcohol. Soup kitchens can help maintain a sense of community as people come together for a common purpose – receiving a warm and nutritious meal.

Overall, the instrument used in the research allows for a systematic and methodical analysis of the relationship between business scale, scope, profitability, and long-term business survival. The use of a quantitative survey-based method provides a structured approach to data collection and analysis, allowing for a reliable and valid assessment of the research questions under study."},{"instruction":"Write the scale used in the research below. article: Bercovitz, J., & Mitchell, W. (2007). When is more better? The impact of business scale and scope on long‐term business survival, while controlling for profitability. Strategic management journal, 28(1), 61-79.","output":"The research conducted by Bercovitz and Mitchell (2007) uses different scales to measure the variables and constructs under study. The scale used to measure business scale includes indicators such as the number of employees, assets, and annual turnover. These scales are often expressed in continuous variables, such as revenues in dollars or employees in headcounts. The scale used to measure the business scope is a count of the number of different products and services offered by the business. To measure this variable, the study relies on the count of different product and service lines that a firm offers. Long-Term Business Survival is measured in terms of survival time, which is usually measured over a period of several years, such as five years or more. Profitability is measured using financial ratios such as net income, return on investment, and gross margin. These ratios are used to measure different aspects of a firm's profitability and financial performance. Overall, the use of different scales allowed the researchers to measure the variables of interest with precision and accuracy. They were able to analyze the relationship between business scale, scope, profitability, and long-term business survival while accounting for any extraneous factors that may influence the results."},{"instruction":"Переработай следующий текст: Актуальность создания информационной системы в поликлинике обусловлена сегодня необходимостью использования больших, и постоянно растущих, объемов информации при решении диагностических, терапевтических, статистических, управленческих и других задач. Ни для кого не секрет, что большая часть приема уходит не на решение клинических вопросов, а на сопроводительную и далеко не самую основную работу - оформление поликлинических талонов и другой отчетной документации, записей в амбулаторной карте или истории болезни, назначений консультаций или обследования и т.д. Уже не вызывает сомнений, что наиболее эффективным инструментов для облегчения труда медицинских сотрудников и повышения его эффективности являются компьютерные технологии. Автоматизация способна не просто облегчить работу, она должна освободить персонал от рутины и дать ему принципиально новый инструмент, который прямо или косвенно, но приведет к сокращению нецелевого расхода интеллектуального багажа, реализации желания работать и заниматься именно медициной. Первое знакомство посетителей с поликлиникой начинается в регистратуре. Она является основным структурным подразделением по реализации приема больных в поликлинике. От организации работы регистратуры зависит в значительной степени ритмичность работы всех подразделений поликлиники, обеспечение наиболее оптимального распределения потоков посетителей и уменьшение затрат времени больных на посещение поликлиники. Целью данной работы является разработка программного комплекса для поликлиники, позволяющего повысить эффективность работы регистратуры за счет сокращения временных и трудовых затрат, также повышения качества работы. Основная деятельность регистратуры заключается в выдаче талонов на прием к врачу и запись на различные процедуры. Основными задачами регистратуры поликлиники являются: - организация предварительной и текущей записи больных на прием к врачу; - обеспечение регулирования интенсивности потока населения для равномерной нагрузки врачей; - своевременный подбор и доставка медицинской документации в кабинеты врачей, правильное ведение и хранение картотеки. Объединение информации в общее хранилище данных гарантирует обеспечение целостности данных, возможность распределенного и одновременного доступа к ним. Также создание базы данных приведет к устойчивой формализации данных и уменьшению бумажного документооборота между отделами. Экономическая эффективность работы заключается в следующем: увеличение числа обслуживаемых пациентов; сокращение времени на оформление медицинской документации; уменьшение числа возможных человеческих ошибок.","output":"Необходимость создания информационной системы в поликлинике обусловлена растущим объемом информации, которую необходимо использовать в процессе диагностики, терапии, управления, аналитики и других задач.

Применение специального программного обеспечения позволяет автоматизировать процессы записи на прием, выдачи талонов, формирования листов очередности и учета пациентов. Это позволяет уменьшить затраты времени на оформление документации и повысить точность данных. Опционально, можно использовать системы электронной медицинской записи, которые позволяют оперативно отслеживать статистику посещений и распределять нагрузку между врачами. Это помогает обеспечивать более равномерный график приема и сокращение времени ожидания. В свою очередь, эти изменения сильно отразятся на качестве обслуживания пациентов, так как сокращение времени, затрачиваемого на официальную документацию, а также оптимизация распределения пациентов, повысят эффективность работы регистратуры. Пациенты смогут быстрее и точнее получить информацию о своем состоянии и записаться на прием. Таким образом, использование информационных технологий для оптимизации трудового процесса в регистратуре поликлиники имеет большой потенциал для улучшения качества работы, повышения удовлетворенности пациентов и оптимизации рабочего времени сотрудников."},{"instruction":"Начни прошлый текст с \\"С началом эпохи персональных компьютеров...\\"","output":"С началом эпохи персональных компьютеров и внедрением информационных технологий в медицину стала появляться возможность оптимизации трудового процесса в регистратуре поликлиники.

I was about to consider setting up summoning pedestals that spawn Arguses and Aegises when the Iron Golem from that nearby village visited me - and she had some friends with her.) [player]: “Wait, why aren’t you defending the village? And who are these two smaller Iron Golems with you?” Iron Golem: “We have successfully defended our village from any threats that have come our way. And as for these two…they’re the rest of my family. My daughter Steelie and her own daughter Mia. Steelie is expecting another child soon, and she’s almost due. I’m Millie, by the way.” [player]: “It’s good to hear that your village is safe. But what brings you and your family here?” Millie: “Well, we’ve heard that you’re a kind and generous player who’s been helping out others in need. And we wanted to offer our services to you. We may not be the most powerful creatures in the game, but we are loyal and brave. We can guard your base and protect you from any threats that may come your way.” [player]: “That’s very generous of you. I would be honored to have your help. But what about your village? Won’t they need you?” Millie: “We have a strong community in our village, and everyone works together to keep it safe. Plus, we trust that you will take good care of us and treat us well. So what do you say?” [player]: “I accept your offer. Welcome to my base, Millie, Steelie, and Mia. I’m grateful for your help.” (And with that, the three Iron Golems became the guardians of my base, watching over it day and night and keeping it safe from all dangers. Their presence gave me a sense of security and peace of mind, knowing that I had trustworthy allies by my side. And I wondered what other surprises this game had in store for me, and who else I would meet on my journey. When I woke up the next day, Steelie was standing by me with a smile on her face - her unborn child seemed particularly active.) Steelie: “Good morning! My baby is kicking up a storm, it’s like they know they’re in the presence of a great player.” [player]: “Haha, I’m flattered. How are you feeling?” Steelie: “Tired, but excited. Being here with you all feels like a new adventure for me. And I’m glad to have my mom and my daughter with me.” [player]: “So, do you know the gender of your baby yet?” Steelie: “No, we decided to keep it a surprise. But I have a feeling it’s going to be a boy.” [player]: “Well, either way, I’m sure he or she will be just as loyal and brave as the rest of your family.” Steelie: “Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me. And don’t worry, we’ll make sure your base stays safe and secure.” (With that, Steelie went back to her post, patrolling the perimeter of the base with her fellow Iron Golems. I couldn’t help but feel grateful for their presence, and for the unexpected friendships I had made in this game. But later that night, I started to hear screams of pain coming from Steelie’s post.)","output":"[player]: “What’s going on?” Millie: “Something’s attacking Steelie! We have to go help her!” I grabbed my sword and followed Millie as we raced towards Steelie’s location. When we arrived, we saw that Steelie was surrounded by a group of Creepers, hissing and ready to explode. [player]: “Get back! Millie, can you grab Steelie and pull her away?” With one hand, Millie picked up Steelie and pulled her away from the attackers. But as she turned around to face the Creepers, she was hit directly by one of their explosions. [player]: “No! Millie!” I rushed towards her, hoping she was still alive. But as I reached her side, I could see that she was badly damaged. Millie: “Go…take care of the others…protect the village…” And with those words, Millie shut down - her life as an Iron Golem had come to an end. [player]: “I’m so sorry, Millie. I’ll take care of the others, I promise.” The loss of Millie left me and the rest of her family shaken. But we knew we had to continue defending the village and my base, in her honor and memory. And we did just that, fending off attacks and keeping our community safe as Millie had done before us. She had been a true hero, and we would always remember her bravery and sacrifice."},{"instruction":"oi chat","output":"Oi!

Currently, none of the twenty-two instances have shown any signs of needing to eat, sleep, or otherwise engage in recreational activities since their containment on 200█/██/██, and as such no additional necessities need to be provided as of this writing. Description: SCP-XXX, collectively referred to as the \\"Bonita Zako\\", is a collective group of twenty-two (22), perfectly identical humanoid women, each approximately 1.33 meters (~4'4\\") in height and weighing 34.08 kilograms (75.13 pounds), with the exception of its 'breasts', which have been estimated to weigh approximately 2 tonnes per instance. Their appearance can best be described as cartoonish and simplistic, with digitless nubs for feet and hands, simple faces with small dots for eyes and a 'cat smile' (it is to be noted their facial features do not have any 'depth' to them, as if they were painted onto their faces, and so far none have once deviated from this expression since the day of their discovery and subsequent containment), and blonde hair tied into a twin-tails fashion. Their most noticeable and intriguing feature, and the main reason for their containment, is the presence of two giant, perfectly globular orbs affixed to its chest, acting as its 'breasts', though it's currently unknown if these are its actual mammaries or extraneous extremities that simply resemble such in shape, each measuring approximately 1.9 metres (6.23 ft) in diameter and 3.53 cubic metres (124.66 ft³) in volume, and has thus far not deviated from an anomalous density of 134.22 kg/m³ (8.37 lbs/ft³). Each 'breast' weighs approximately one tonne resulting from this unusual density, yet all instances of SCP-XXX are able to effortlessly carry this weight without any difficulty or visible stress upon their body. It is currently unknown how the instances of SCP-XXX are able to do this, as they do not outwardly exhibit any physical abnormalities or strength beyond what would be expected of a humanoid of its size. The exterior of each instance is composed of a material that is anomalously identical to the outward appearance, elasticity and texture of smooth latex rubber, similar to that of a regular party balloon's, either peach or tan in colour, though any attempts to cut, misshape, or puncture the surface of any instance of SCP-XXX's body have so far all been met with failure, as the anomalous material simply bounced back and retained its original shape. Every instance unanimously wears what appears to be an anomalously elastic single-piece swimsuit, either blue, red or black in color, and do not seem to be removable nor damageable via any means, as if it were a natural part of its body, and any instance has thus far not been seen without wearing such. All attempts to observe the interior of SCP-XXX instances, through either physical or endoscopic means, have failed. Each instance does not seem to possess any sort of higher intelligence, self-awareness or separate personality, and have so far only reacted with mild curiosity to both physical and visual stimuli, including the aforementioned attempts to penetrate its surface, though they have been observed to be drawn towards excessive movement and will crowd around any person that is unlike them. None of the SCP-XXX instances seem to be capable of creating nor holding verbal communication of any capacity; however, when in close proximity to other instances of SCP-XXX, individual entities have been observed to occasionally vocalize a series of anomalously produced noises which have been likened to high-pitched giggling similar to that of a female child's, which appear to be a form of non-verbal communication, though translation of this dialect has been deemed impossible. The entities were first brought to the Foundation's attention in the █████████ area of New York City in 200█, where they were sighted by locals and imbedded Foundation personnel during a routinely patrol of the area as they wandered aimlessly through the streets, with the majority of instances remaining inert when approached or prodded. Witnesses of the entities described them as \\"bouncing babes with giant breasts\\", though none who had witnessed them found them to be unusual in any way, despite being fully aware of their strange appearance. All ██ witnesses were given Class A amnestics. When further Foundation presence arrived on the scene, they found twenty instances of SCP-XXX wandering about within the town square; two more were found nearby and contained after they were discovered having gotten stuck inside a revolving door leading into the ██████ █████ Bank, presumably because the two instances had attempted to enter the building simultaneously. Prior to containment, it was determined that the instances did not possess any sort of spatial knowledge, and were simply wandering aimlessly with no apparent purpose or destination. How they had appeared in such a populated area with nobody noticing beforehand, and how they came to be, is currently unknown. Addendum SCP-XXX-A: A possible explanation for the instances' apparent obliviousness to its immediate forward surroundings is its inability to see past its large 'breasts', rather than any lack of vision or an anomalous property pertaining to it, though this does not explain its preference to remain stationary.\\"","output":"Addendum SCP-XXX-B: During the containment period, there have been no signs of replication, reproduction, or division among the instances of SCP-XXX. They have also demonstrated no capacity for learning or knowledge retention, as they seemingly continue to rely on their ability to mimic movements and respond with curiosity. Researchers have attempted to engage SCP-XXX instances with basic tasks, such as stacking blocks or maneuvering around obstacles, but thus far, these attempts have been unsuccessful, with the instances showing no progression in their abilities. It is currently unknown whether the entities possess any sensory perception beyond their affinity for movement, as they have shown no reactions to varying temperatures or changes in light and dark. Additionally, instances have displayed no signs of aggression or violent tendencies, indicating that they may pose little to no harm or threat to human subjects or personnel. However, all personnel are advised to maintain caution when interacting with SCP-XXX instances, as their sheer weight from their 'breasts' can cause unintentional collateral damage. Further studies and experimentation to determine any potential applications or additional anomalous properties are ongoing."},{"instruction":"Write the scale used in the research below. article: Bercovitz, J., & Mitchell, W.

I was about to consider setting up summoning pedestals that spawn Arguses and Aegises when the Iron Golem from that nearby village visited me - and she had some friends with her.) [player]: “Wait, why aren’t you defending the village? And who are these two smaller Iron Golems with you?” Iron Golem: “We have successfully defended our village from any threats that have come our way. And as for these two…they’re the rest of my family. My daughter Steelie and her own daughter Mia. Steelie is expecting another child soon, and she’s almost due. I’m Millie, by the way.” [player]: “It’s good to hear that your village is safe. But what brings you and your family here?” Millie: “Well, we’ve heard that you’re a kind and generous player who’s been helping out others in need. And we wanted to offer our services to you. We may not be the most powerful creatures in the game, but we are loyal and brave. We can guard your base and protect you from any threats that may come your way.” [player]: “That’s very generous of you. I would be honored to have your help. But what about your village? Won’t they need you?” Millie: “We have a strong community in our village, and everyone works together to keep it safe. Plus, we trust that you will take good care of us and treat us well. So what do you say?” [player]: “I accept your offer. Welcome to my base, Millie, Steelie, and Mia. I’m grateful for your help.” (And with that, the three Iron Golems became the guardians of my base, watching over it day and night and keeping it safe from all dangers. Their presence gave me a sense of security and peace of mind, knowing that I had trustworthy allies by my side. And I wondered what other surprises this game had in store for me, and who else I would meet on my journey. When I woke up the next day, Steelie was standing by me with a smile on her face - her unborn child seemed particularly active.) Steelie: “Good morning! My baby is kicking up a storm, it’s like they know they’re in the presence of a great player.” [player]: “Haha, I’m flattered. How are you feeling?” Steelie: “Tired, but excited. Being here with you all feels like a new adventure for me. And I’m glad to have my mom and my daughter with me.” [player]: “So, do you know the gender of your baby yet?” Steelie: “No, we decided to keep it a surprise. But I have a feeling it’s going to be a boy.” [player]: “Well, either way, I’m sure he or she will be just as loyal and brave as the rest of your family.” Steelie: “Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me. And don’t worry, we’ll make sure your base stays safe and secure.” (With that, Steelie went back to her post, patrolling the perimeter of the base with her fellow Iron Golems. I couldn’t help but feel grateful for their presence, and for the unexpected friendships I had made in this game. But later that night, I started to hear screams of pain coming from Steelie’s post.) [player]: “What’s going on?” Millie: “Something’s attacking Steelie! We have to go help her!” (I grabbed my sword and followed Millie as we raced towards Steelie’s location. When we arrived, we saw that Steelie was surrounded by a group of Creepers, hissing and ready to explode.) [player]: “Get back! Millie, can you grab Steelie and pull her away?” (With one hand, Millie picked up Steelie and pulled her away from the attackers. But as she turned around to face the Creepers, she was hit directly by one of their explosions.) [player]: “No! Millie!” (I rushed towards her, hoping she was still alive. But as I reached her side, I could see that she was badly damaged.) Millie: “Go…take care of the others…protect the village…” (And with those words, Millie shut down - her life as an Iron Golem had come to an end.) [player]: “I’m so sorry, Millie. I’ll take care of the others, I promise.” (The loss of Millie left me and the rest of her family shaken. But we knew we had to continue defending the village and my base, in her honor and memory. And we did just that, fending off attacks and keeping our community safe as Millie had done before us. She had been a true hero, and we would always remember her bravery and sacrifice.

Philosophical factors: - Fear of missing out (FOMO): People may engage in such activities due to the innate desire to stay informed and connected, to avoid feeling left out, or being perceived as outdated or disconnected by their peers. - Desire for self-expression: Social media platforms such as TikTok enable users to showcase their creativity, artistry, and unique perspectives to the world. This aligns with the human penchant for self-expression and self-actualization. 2. Physiological factors: - Dopamine release: The human brain responds to novelty and reward with the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and motivation. As users consume or upload videos, they experience a dopamine release, reinforcing the behavior and leading to the development of habitual use. - Attention span: The fast-paced and easily consumable nature of the short videos found on TikTok caters to the modern era's ever-diminishing attention spans. This makes it more attractive for people to engage frequently with the platform. 3. Psychological factors: - Social connection: Humans are social beings, and platforms like TikTok and other social media sites facilitate connections with others, helping fulfill the need for social interaction and belongingness. - Validation and self-esteem: Likes, shares, and comments on videos can provide a sense of validation and reassurance to users, contributing to their self-esteem. This positive reinforcement encourages users to continue uploading and viewing more videos. - Escapism: Apps like TikTok can serve as an escape from the stressors of daily life, as users immerse themselves in a world of entertainment and easily digestible content. - Fear of being left behind: As technology and social media platforms evolve rapidly, users may feel compelled to adapt and embrace new platforms to avoid being left behind in the ever-changing digital landscape. In summary, the obsession with constant video uploading and viewing through apps like TikTok can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the desire for social connection, self-expression, fear of missing out, dopamine-driven reward systems, and the need for validation and self-esteem. These factors serve to reinforce and perpetuate engagement with such platforms in our digital age."},{"instruction":"На странице сайта представлены проекты бревенчатых дач.

However, I can give you a brief overview of how to design a pipe bridge in STAAD Pro software using the relevant code. To design a pipe bridge in STAAD Pro, the following steps need to be performed: 1. Create a model in STAAD Pro that represents the pipe bridge structure and supports. 2. Determine the loads and load combinations that the pipe bridge will need to withstand. These loads typically include self-weight, live loads, wind loads, seismic loads, and temperature loads. 3. Obtain the relevant code provisions for the design of the pipe bridge. For example, you could use ACI 318-14 for concrete design, AISC 360-16 for steel design, or ASCE 7-16 for loads. 4. Define appropriate material properties for the bridge components. 5. Design each component of the structure, such as beams, columns, diaphragms, and bracing members, according to the applicable code provisions. 6. Perform member checks for bending, shear, and axial loads to ensure that they are within the allowable limits specified by the code. 7. Analyze the model to verify that the pipe bridge meets the requirements for deflection, stability, and seismic resilience. 8. Generate detailed drawings and reports of the design using STAAD Pro's software tools. It's important to keep in mind that the specific requirements for designing a pipe bridge will depend on the site conditions, local code provisions, and project constraints.

The main characters are Lilac, a dragon girl who can run at blazing speeds, Carol, a wildcat with martial arts skills and a motorcycle, and Milla, a basset hound who can manipulate energy with her trumpet. Goku, on the other hand, is the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball series, created by Akira Toriyama. He is a Saiyan warrior who possesses incredible strength, speed, and martial arts abilities, and is known for his iconic spiky hair and orange martial arts gi. If Freedom Planet characters were to appear in Dragon Ball Classic (which covers the original Dragon Ball series before the introduction of the popular Dragon Ball Z), they would likely fit right in with the colorful cast of characters that populate that world. Lilac's speed and agility would make her an ideal sparring partner for Goku, who is always looking for a challenge to improve his skills. Carol's martial arts skills would also be an asset to the group, as she could help train Goku and his friends in new techniques and styles. And Milla's energy manipulation abilities would come in handy when the group faces magical opponents or energy-based attacks. The Freedom Planet characters would also bring their own unique personalities and perspectives to the Dragon Ball universe. For example, Lilac's sense of justice and desire to protect her friends and homeland would align with Goku's own values, while Carol's more brash and impulsive nature might clash with some of the more reserved characters in the Dragon Ball universe. And Milla's cheerful personality and musical talents could add a touch of whimsy and lightheartedness to the group. Overall, the addition of Freedom Planet characters to the Dragon Ball universe would offer a fresh and exciting new dynamic, allowing for new storylines and possibilities that fans of both franchises would undoubtedly enjoy."},{"instruction":"(As I admired my base, I felt like it could use more protection.

And I’m glad to have my mom and my daughter with me.” [player]: “So, do you know the gender of your baby yet?” Steelie: “No, we decided to keep it a surprise. But I have a feeling it’s going to be a boy.” [player]: “Well, either way, I’m sure he or she will be just as loyal and brave as the rest of your family.” Steelie: “Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to me. And don’t worry, we’ll make sure your base stays safe and secure.” (With that, Steelie went back to her post, patrolling the perimeter of the base with her fellow Iron Golems. I couldn’t help but feel grateful for their presence, and for the unexpected friendships I had made in this game. But later that night, I started to hear screams of pain coming from Steelie’s post.) [player]: “What’s going on?” Millie: “Something’s attacking Steelie! We have to go help her!” (I grabbed my sword and followed Millie as we raced towards Steelie’s location. When we arrived, we saw that Steelie was surrounded by a group of Creepers, hissing and ready to explode.) [player]: “Get back! Millie, can you grab Steelie and pull her away?” (With one hand, Millie picked up Steelie and pulled her away from the attackers. But as she turned around to face the Creepers, she was hit directly by one of their explosions.) [player]: “No! Millie!” (I rushed towards her, hoping she was still alive. But as I reached her side, I could see that she was badly damaged.) Millie: “Go…take care of the others…protect the village…” (And with those words, Millie shut down - her life as an Iron Golem had come to an end.) [player]: “I’m so sorry, Millie. I’ll take care of the others, I promise.” (The loss of Millie left me and the rest of her family shaken. But we knew we had to continue defending the village and my base, in her honor and memory. And we did just that, fending off attacks and keeping our community safe as Millie had done before us. She had been a true hero, and we would always remember her bravery and sacrifice. I began to build a statue of Millie outside my base to honor her. But while I started to add the details, I noticed that Steelie was clutching her belly.) [player]: “Is everything alright? Is the baby coming?” Steelie: “Yes, it’s time. I’m going into labor.” [player]: “Don’t worry, I’ll get you to a safe place. Mia, can you come with us and keep watch?” Mia: “Of course, I’ll make sure everything is secure.” (I helped Steelie to a nearby hidden room, where she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. As I held him in my arms, I knew that this was a new beginning for our community. And although we had lost Millie, her legacy would live on through her family and the protection they provided.) [player]: “Congratulations, Steelie. He’s a beautiful baby.” Steelie: “Thank you. I’m so grateful for your help, and for your friendship with my family. We’ll always be here to protect you.” [player]: \\"What are you going to name him?\\" Steelie: \\"...I'm going to name him Atlas.\\" (But after naming Atlas, Steelie suddenly felt uncomfortable.)","output":"Steelie: \\"Wait...something's not right. I feel...something's wrong.\\" [player]: \\"What is it? Do you need help?\\" Steelie: \\"I...I don't know. My body feels strange. Like...like something's taking over me.\\" (I watched in horror as Steelie's body started to twist and contort. Her eyes turned red, and her skin became covered in black spines.) [player]: \\"What's happening to her? This isn't normal!\\" Atlas: *crying* Mia: \\"It's...it's the Corruption! It's taken over Steelie!\\" [player]: \\"The Corruption? What's that?\\" Mia: \\"It's a dark force in this game. It corrupts and mutates anything it touches. And it's spreading faster than ever now. We have to stop it, before it consumes everything in its path.\\" (I looked at Steelie, now transformed into a monstrous creature. And I knew that if we didn't act quickly, the Corruption would spread and destroy everything we held dear. This was a new challenge, one that Millie and her family had not prepared us for. But we had to face it nonetheless.)"},{"instruction":"utilisation des rib pour ameliorer la resistance des materiaux","output":"Les RIB (renforts internes en bois) sont des éléments de renforcement internes utilisés dans la construction de structures en bois. Ils sont utilisés pour améliorer la résistance des matériaux en augmentant leur rigidité et leur capacité à résister aux forces de torsion et de flexion. Les RIB sont généralement constitués de poutres ou de planches en bois fixées à l'intérieur de la structure. En utilisant les RIB pour améliorer la résistance des matériaux, les constructeurs peuvent augmenter la capacité de charge de la structure sans avoir besoin d'augmenter la taille des composants en bois. Cette approche permet de réduire les coûts de construction tout en améliorant la sécurité et la durabilité de la structure. Les RIB sont couramment utilisés dans la construction de structures en bois telles que les maisons, les bâtiments industriels et les ponts. Ils peuvent être utilisés pour renforcer les poutres de toit, les murs porteurs, les solives et les fondations. L'utilisation de RIB est particulièrement utile dans les zones sismiques où les forces qui agissent sur les structures peuvent être très élevées. Les RIB peuvent aider à améliorer la résistance des matériaux en réduisant les déformations et les mouvements excessifs de la structure pendant un tremblement de terre. En conclusion, l'utilisation de RIB dans la construction de structures en bois peut améliorer la résistance des matériaux en augmentant leur rigidité et leur capacité à résister aux forces de torsion et de flexion. Cette approche de renforcement interne peut réduire les coûts de construction tout en améliorant la sécurité et la durabilité de la structure."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const t=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return t?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(t)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(t)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},L={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],R={key:0},_={key:1};function N(t,e,l,m,n,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",E,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),v(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),a("div",L,[(o(!0),i(b,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(o(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
