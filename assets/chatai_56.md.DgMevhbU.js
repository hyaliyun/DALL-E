Jeśli tylko Twój stan zdrowia Ci na to pozwala, to przekaż pracodawcy takie informacje jak: data i miejsce wypadku – jest to konieczne do określenia gdzie i kiedy doszło do zdarzenia; rodzaj obrażeń – określ, do jakich obrażeń doszło na skutek wypadku, dzięki czemu pracodawca i służby medyczne będą w stanie ocenić powagę sytuacji; opisz zdarzenie – powiedz, jak dokładnie doszło do wypadku; opisz podjęte działania – poinformuj pracodawcę, jakie kroki zostały podjęte po wypadku w pracy, np. czy skorzystałeś z pomocy medycznej. 👉 Udaj się do lekarza Jeśli na skutek wypadku w pracy doszło do obrażeń, to koniecznie zgłoś się do lekarza lub specjalisty z zakresu BHP, który pracuje w firmie. Taka osoba powinna być odpowiednio przeszkolona, a dzięki temu będzie mogła udzielić Ci pierwszej pomocy. Skorzystałeś z pomocy medycznej? W takim razie powiadom o tym pracodawcę. Zadbaj także o to, żeby lekarz sporządził raport medyczny, który będzie stanowił jeden z podstawowych dokumentów podczas ubiegania się o odszkodowanie. 👉 Zgłoś wypadek do Inspekcji Pracy /Arbeidstilsynet/ Uważasz, że do wypadku w pracy w Norwegii doszło na skutek zaniedbań pracodawcy lub osób zarządzających? Zatem koniecznie zgłoś ten fakt do tamtejszego Urzędu Inspekcji Pracy (norw. Arbeidstilsynet). Możesz zgłosić się do tej instytucji i poinformować o incydencie, do jakiego doszło, a także o ewentualnych zaniechaniach czy nieprawidłowościach ze strony pracodawcy. Wtedy Arbeidstilsynet rozpocznie dochodzenie w tej sprawie i sprawdzi, czy Twój pracodawca prowadzi firmę zgodnie z norweskim prawem i zapewnia bezpieczne warunki pracy. 👉 Zgłoś wypadek do NAV Choć to pracodawca ma obowiązek zgłoszenia wypadku do NAV, to jednak i tak warto, żebyś upewnił się, że zostały dopełnione wszelkie formalności. Jeśli do tego nie doszło, to samodzielnie wypełnij i złóż odpowiedni formularz.Dlaczego to takie ważne? Podczas procesu odszkodowania niezbędne jest poświadczenie w NAV o wypadku w pracy. 👉 Odszukaj świadków wypadku Skontaktuj się ze świadkami wypadku. Dzięki temu łatwiejsze będzie ustalenie okoliczności wypadku czy też ewentualnie wyeliminowanie Twojej winy. Szczególnie jest to ważne, gdybyś chciał starać się o odszkodowanie. 👉 Skorzystaj z pomocy NAV Wypadek w pracy w Norwegii, uprawnia Cię do starania się o wypłatę odszkodowania. Każdy pracodawca ma obowiązek opłacania ubezpieczenia, z którego możesz otrzymać środki na pokrycie leczenia, rehabilitacji, a nawet zrekompensowanie dochodów, jakie zostały utracone z powodu wypadku. Norweskie ubezpieczenie pokrywa też wydatki, jakie musiałeś ponieść, a do tego może wypłacić Ci odszkodowanie za utratę możliwości wykonywania obowiązków domowych. W niektórych przypadkach możesz również starać się o środki finansowe z NAV – wiele zależy od tego, jak poważny jest uszczerbek na zdrowiu. Zazwyczaj takie świadczenia są wypłacane, jeśli spędzisz więcej niż 6 tygodni na zwolnieniu lekarskim. Poza tym każda sytuacja jest traktowana indywidualnie, ale najważniejsze jest to, żebyś postępował zgodnie z ustalonymi procedurami. 👉 Wnioskuj o odszkodowanie na skutek wypadku przy pracy Chcesz starać się o odszkodowanie? Najważniejsze jest to, żebyś skompletował wszystkie niezbędne dokumenty, które umożliwią ocenę Twojego stanu zdrowia oraz przyczyn zdarzenia. Przede wszystkim musisz dostarczyć następujące dokumenty: poświadczenie o wypadku w pracy wypisane przez NAV, zaświadczenie oraz zwolnienie od lekarza lub ze szpitala, protokół powypadkowy, wszystkie dokumenty, które potwierdzają niezdolność do pracy, rachunki za leki, rehabilitacje oraz pozostałe koszty związane z leczeniem bądź niezdolnością do wykonywania codziennych czynności, dokumenty wypełnione przez policję lub Arbeidstilsynet – nie zawsze jest to konieczne, zależy to m.in. od rodzaju wypadku i odniesionych obrażeń. 👉 Odszkodowanie z firmy ubezpieczeniowej Osobie poszkodowanej w wypadku należy się odszkodowanie, jeśli do zdarzenia doszło: nie z winy pracownika (np. z winy lub zaniechania innego pracownika), z powodu zaniedbań pracodawcy (np. jeśli pracodawca nie przeszkolił pracownika z zasad BHP). O odszkodowanie należy ubiegać się w firmie ubezpieczeniowej, w której pracodawca wykupił obowiązkowe ubezpieczenie pracownicze. O zdarzeniu należy poinformować w formie pisemnej. Często firmy posiadają własne formularze, które wystarczy wypełnić. W ramach odszkodowania z firmy ubezpieczeniowej poszkodowany może otrzymać: Zwrot kosztów związanych z leczeniem (wizyty u lekarza, zakup sprzętu rehabilitacyjnego, leki). Odszkodowanie za utratę dochodów (wlicza się tu także przewidywane dochody z nadgodzin). Odszkodowanie od NAV za trwałe uszkodzenie ciała (minimum 15% uszczerbku na zdrowiu). Zwrot kosztów za pomoc adwokata. Zadośćuczynienie od pracodawcy, jeśli ten dopuścił się rażących zaniedbań, które mogły przyczynić się do wypadku przy pracy. Jest to jedyna sytuacja, w której pracownik może żądać odszkodowania do pracodawcy. W pozostałych przypadkach to ubezpieczyciel jest drugą stroną.","output":"Wypadek w pracy – jak postępować? W przypadku wypadku w pracy warto znać kilka istotnych kroków, które należy podjąć zaraz po incydencie. Przede wszystkim należy zgłosić wypadek pracodawcy, który jest odpowiedzialny za zarządzanie całą sytuacją. Informacja o zdarzeniu powinna zawierać datę i miejsce wypadku, rodzaj obrażeń oraz dokładny opis zdarzenia. Warto również poinformować pracodawcę o podjętych działaniach po wypadku, na przykład o skorzystaniu z pomocy medycznej. Następnie, jeżeli doszło do obrażeń, należy jak najszybciej udać się do lekarza lub specjalisty BHP, który pracuje w firmie. Tam będzie udzielona pierwsza pomoc, a lekarz sporządzi raport medyczny, który będzie potrzebny przy ubieganiu się o odszkodowanie. Jeśli uważamy, że przyczyną wypadku było zaniedbanie pracodawcy lub osób zarządzających, warto zgłosić to do odpowiednich instytucji, takich jak Urząd Inspekcji Pracy (Arbeidstilsynet) w Norwegii. Tam przeprowadzone zostanie dochodzenie w celu ustalenia, czy pracodawca działa zgodnie z norweskim prawem i zapewnia bezpieczne warunki pracy. Dodatkowo, należy zgłosić wypadek do NAV (norweski urząd ds. ubezpieczeń i emerytur), nawet jeśli pracodawca jest zobowiązany do takiego zgłoszenia. Poświadczenie wypadku wydane przez NAV jest bowiem niezbędne w procesie ubiegania się o odszkodowanie. Ważne jest również skontaktowanie się ze świadkami wypadku, co ułatwi ustalenie okoliczności i wyeliminowanie własnej winy. Osoba poszkodowana w wypadku ma prawo starać się o odszkodowanie, pokrycie kosztów leczenia, rehabilitacji, a nawet zrekompensowanie utraconych dochodów. W tym celu trzeba jednak dostarczyć odpowiednie dokumenty, takie jak poświadczenie o wypadku w pracy od NAV, zaświadczenie i zwolnienie lekarskie, protokół powypadkowy, dokumenty potwierdzające niezdolność do pracy oraz rachunki za leki i rehabilitację. W przypadku odszkodowania, jeżeli wypadek nie był winą pracownika, można ubiegać się o nie w firmie ubezpieczeniowej, w której pracodawca ma obowiązkowe ubezpieczenie pracownicze. Odszkodowanie może obejmować zwrot kosztów leczenia, odszkodowanie za utratę dochodów, zwrot kosztów za pomoc adwokata oraz zadośćuczynienie od pracodawcy za zaniedbania, które przyczyniły się do wypadku. Wnioskowanie o odszkodowanie może być procesem skomplikowanym, dlatego ważne jest zapoznanie się z wymaganiami i dostarczenie niezbędnych dokumentów.

Sara looks down at her chest, sighing softly. SARA I can't believe how big they've gotten. It's becoming quite a challenge to find clothes that fit properly. Amy giggles, giving Sara a playful nudge. AMY Oh come on, Sara. You have to admit, they look amazing. You're like a goddess. Mine are practically non-existent in comparison. Sara's face crinkles into a wry smile.

Крючковые вопросы: - Знаете ли вы, кто на самом деле движет миром? - Что общего между вашим успешным днём и игрой супербоула? - Готовы ли вы узнать, как один человек может изменить историю цивилизации? Доброе утро, дорогие читатели! Солнце уже влезло в небесный офис и приступило к световой смене, а значит пришло время для утренней порции мотивации. Хорошее настроение — это как кофе, только не надо стоять в очереди за ним! И пока вы свариваете свой утренний крепкий эспрессо духа, позвольте мне поделиться мыслью одного из величайших тренеров в истории американского спорта - Винса Ломбарди. А как вы уже знаете, наша утренняя мотивационная статья - это свежий аромат ваших новых возможностей, подаваемый ежедневно в 7 часов утра по московскому времени! Итак, в исполнении групповой оркестровки усилий по созданию гармонии в мире мужчин и женщин, давайте распакуем одно вдохновляющее высказывание: «Индивидуальная приверженность к групповым усилиям — вот что заставляет работать команду, компанию, общество, цивилизацию». Сказал этот гигант духа примерно так же, как вы говорите своему кофе: \\"Давай, просыпайся!\\". И да, это был Винс Ломбарди — человек, который знал толк в командных победах. Простыми словами, мастер-тренер говорил нам о том, что за любым великим делом стоит не просто группа людей, а группа людей, каждый из которых готов выложиться на все сто! Подумайте об этом, как о рок-группе: если барабанщик спит во время соло гитариста, единственное, что у них получится - это некая музыкальная каша, которую милосердно окрестят \\"экспериментальным джазом\\". Индивидуальная приверженность — это когда вы встаёте рано утром, взбираетесь на свой персональный горный велосипед однажды называемый \\"хорошими намерениями\\", и педалируете через гору препятствий к вершине вашей собственной эффективности. И вот здесь Винс Ломбарди похлопывает нас по плечу и напоминает: \\"Ты можешь быть чемпионом соло-педалирования, но если ты не в групповой велогонке под названием 'Добиваемся цели вместе', возможно, пришло время подумать о командной форме\\". Да, каждый из нас иногда похож на супергероя в пижаме — мы чувствуем в себе силу, но чтобы мир увидел это, нужно действовать совместно. Командная работа, это не просто фраза, которую любят упоминать на корпоративных тренингах, чтобы ты почувствовал себя частью чего-то большего, пока активно нажимаешь кнопку на кофемашине. Это реальная динамика, которая делает компании успешными, государства - процветающими, а спортивные команды - легендарными. Так что же делает индивидуальную приверженность такой мощной? Во-первых, это ответственность. Когда каждый знает, что от его личного вклада зависит общий результат, создается особая атмосфера - атмосфера, в которой никто не хочет быть слабым звеном. Во-вторых, это увлечённость. Человек, который действительно \\"горит\\" своим делом, заразителен, как чих в метро (но в хорошем смысле, конечно!). И вот, мой дорогой читатель, в этой атмосфере каждый становится архитектором цивилизации, каждый — скульптором общества, каждый — дирижёром в оркестре усилий. Неважно, вы командир в полосатых носках или бас-гитарист с кофейными пятнами на рубашке, ваш вклад неоценим. Автор высказывания, Винс Ломбарди, был главным тренером 'Green Bay Packers' в 1960-х, и его команду заслуженно считают одной из самых успешных в истории профессионального американского футбола. Ломбарди — символ побед и уверенности в себе, человек, который превращал обычных парней в ураганных героев травяного поля. Нравится вам это или нет, но наш мир танцует в ритме командной работы. Да, иногда этот танец выглядит как первый урок вальса для новичков, но когда все двигаются в унисон... это магия, это симфония успешности. Так что, мои утренние зарядники, если вы хотите изменить мир или хотя бы улучшить свою среду обитания, вспомните слова Винса и пусть ваша индивидуальная приверженность станет звездой в небе групповых усилий. И не забудьте поделиться этой мотивацией с друзьями, найдите момент для лайка, а в комментариях опишите свои истории личного вклада в командный успех. Ваш путь к великим свершениям начинается с каждого маленького шага, который вы сделаете сегодня. На связи ваш канал \\"Мир мужчин и женщин\\" — источник вашего ежедневного вдохновения и энергетического 'латте' для души.

Being this close to you... it's overwhelming.\\" The soldier's stern expression softened, and he reached out to gently lift the medic's chin, meeting his gaze. \\"Your delicate touch and endearing beauty have not gone unnoticed, beloved medic,\\" he whispered, his voice now filled with tenderness. \\"You possess a strength of your own, tucked away behind those shy eyes.\\" Their eyes locked, the world around them fading into insignificance. In that small medical bay, two souls found solace amidst the chaos of war, a bond forming in the most unexpected of circumstances. There, in each other's embrace, they discovered a love that transcended the boundaries of their roles. Together, they learned that strength can be found in vulnerability, and that true power lies in the courage to embrace one's own desires.

شناختی است که از طریق یادگیری ارزیابی ها و بازخورد اجتماعی اکتساب می شود. اینکه آیا فرد روی خود به عنوان عامل انجام دهنده تمرکز کند یا روی خود به عنوان موضوع (یعنی، «خود پنداره) تا اندازه ای به علاقه و دیدگاه نظری او بستگی دارد، اما عمدتاً به آنچه فرد سعی دارد درباره خود درک کند بستگی دارد. در چنین تحلیل انگیزشی درباره خود چهار مسئله با تلاش خود صحنه اصلی را اشغال میکنند با میستر (۱۹۸۷) ۱ تعریف خود ربط دادن خود به جامعه پرورش دادن توانایی شخصی تنظیم خود خود به عنوان موضوع تعریف خود ما برای تعریف خود از خود میپرسیم چه کسی هستیم، چگونه دیگران ما را می بینند و چه شباهت و تفاوتی با دیگران داریم ما سؤالهای اساسی چه کسی هستم؟» و «آیا ویژگی های مثبت دارم را میپرسیم تعریف خود نشان میدهد که چگونه خود پنداره رفتار را نیرومند و هدایت میکند. برخی از جنبه های تعریف خود صرفاً به ما نسبت داده شده اند (مثل جنسیت)، اما جنبه های دیگر باید از طریق پیشرفت و انتخاب به دست آیند مثل شغل دوستان ارزش ها شکل ۱-۱۱ تعریف ویژگیهای دو دیدگاه درباره خود خود به عنوان عامل و خود به عنوان موضوع دو دیدگاه درباره خود موضوع مراء بازنمایی اجتماعی - شناختی خود به عنوان موضوع خود به عنوان دانا بازنمایی اکتسابی ساختار اجتماعی بر پایه بازخورد اجتماعی سؤال های اساسی : . من کیستم؟ . آیا ویژگی های مثبت دارم؟ چه تفاوتی دارم؟ عامل من نیروی انگیزشی خود به عنوان فرایند. خود به عنوان دانا موهبت طبیعی نیروی درونی که رفتار را آغاز می کند. سؤال های اساسی : . چه کسی می توانم بشوم؟ . اهداف من چیستند؟ . آیا اصیل هستم؟ ربط دادن خود به جامعه ما در جستجوی ربط دادن خود به جامعه به جایگاه خود در دنیای اجتماعی و اینکه چه نقشهای اجتماعی برای ما وجود دارند یا ندارند می اندیشیم. ما می پرسیم انقش من چیست؟ ربط دادن خود به جامعه نشان میدهد چگونه هویت رفتار را نیرومند و هدایت میکند و نگه میدارد جامعه از چند نظر در ترغیب افراد به دنبال کردن نقش ها یا حتی فراهم کردن آنها انعطاف ناپذیر است. اما جامعه از نظرات دیگر، انعطاف پذیر است. و در تعیین اینکه چه کسی همسر فرد خواهد بود و چه نقشهای اجتماعی اشغال خواهند شد (مثل دانش آموز مادر سیاستمدار معلم مقداری انتخاب و مسئولیت شخصی به فرد می دهد. خود به عنوان عامل پرورش دادن توانایی شخصی ما برای پرورش خود این موضوع را بررسی می کنیم که به چه چیزی علاقه داریم و نداریم تفاوت بین عمل ناشی از خود در برابر عمل ناشی از نیروهای خارج از خود را درک میکنیم میکوشیم هدف و معنی بیافرینیم میخواهیم استعدادهای خود را کشف کنیم و پرورش دهیم و وقت خود را صرف پرورش دادن برخی مهارت ها و روابط می کنیم. ما می پرسیم چه کسی میتوانم بشوم؟» و اهداف من كدام ند؟ کشف کردن و پرورش دادن توانایی خود عاملیت را منعکس میکند و به آن نیاز دارد. عاملیت یعنی عامل (خود قدرت و قصد عمل کردن را دارد و انگیزش ذاتی در خود را نشان می دهد. تنظیم خود ما در جستجوی تنظیم و مدیریت خود به توانایی هایمان می اندیشیم هدفهای بلند مدت را برای دنبال کردن تعیین میکنیم برنامه ها و راهبردها را اجرا میکنیم دستیابی به اهدافمان را زیر نظر میگیریم و برای رسیدن به اهداف بلند مدت مان تنظیم هایی را انجام می دهیم. ما میپرسیم آیا میتوانم کنترل شخصی اعمال کنم؟». مدیریت یا تنظیم خود نشان میدهد که چگونه خود تنظیمی احتمال عملکرد شایسته را بیشتر میکند. خود به جای اینکه به صورت تکانشی عمل کند میتواند ارضا را به تأخیر اندازد و جلوی پاداش های کوتاه مدت و وسوسه را بگیرد تا هدفهای بلند مدتی را دنبال کند که بزرگتر و خشنود کننده تر هستند. مسئله عزت نفس قبل از بحث درباره خود پنداره هویت عاملیت و خود تنظیمی مفید خواهد بود که قدری مکث کنیم و عقیده ای اساسی را به چالش بکشیم که خیلی از افراد آن را تأیید میکنند یعنی بهترین راه برای افزایش دادن انگیزش فرد بالا بردن عزت نفس اوست معلمان، کارفرمایان و مربیان همواره و با اشتیاق میگویند که روش با انگیزه کردن دانش آموزان کارمندان و ورزشکاران، بالا بردن عزت نفس آنهاست آنها را تحسین کنید به آنها پاداش بدهید به آنها تبریک بگویید کاری کنید که احساس خوبی در مورد خودشان داشته باشند و بعد ببینید که چه چیزهای شگفت آوری آشکار خواهند شد. عزت نفس بالا بسیار خوب است و برای مثال با شاد بودن همبستگی مثبت دارد دینر و دینر (۱۹۹۶) با این حال مسئله تقویت کردن عزت نفس به عنوان یک مداخله انگیزشی این است که تقریباً هیچ یافته ای وجود ندارد که نشان دهد عزت نفس اصلاً موجب چیزی شود. بلکه عزت نفس تحت تأثیر موفقیتها و شکستها قرار دارد… آنچه باید بهبود یابد، عزت نفس نیست بلکه بهبود بخشیدن به مهارتهای ما برای رسیدگی به دنیاست» (سلیگمن نقل شده 2. self-regulation در آذر (۱۹۹۴) به عبارت دیگر در رابطه بین عزت نفس و عملکرد خود، عملکرد خود علت است در حالی که عزت نفس فقط معلول است. عزت نفس اصولاً کارت امتیاز یا تابلوی امتیازی است برای گزارش دادن چگونه اوضاع در زندگی ما خوب یا بد پیش می روند (هلنمک و ون آکن، (۱۹۹۵) عزت نفس و پیشرفت با یکدیگر همبستگی مثبت دارند اما بالا رفتن عزت نفس موجب افزایش پیشرفت با بازدهی نمی شود؛ بلکه افزایش پیشرفت و بازدهی باعث می شوند. عزت نفس بالا برود هلمکون آکن ۱۹۹۵ مارش ۱۹۹۰ مارش و گراون، ۲۰۰۶؛ مارش و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) عزت نفس نشان میدهد که زندگی چگونه پیش می رود، اما منبع انگیزشی نیست که به افراد امکان دهد تا زندگی را خوب پیش ببرند. دلیلی وجود ندارد که نشان دهند. تقویت کردن عزت نفس افراد عملکرد آنها را بهتر خواهد کرد با میستر و همکاران (۲۰۰۳) فایده اصلی عزت نفس بالا این است که از خود (self) در برابر حالت عاطفی منفی مانند افسردگی و اضطراب محافظت میکند عزت نفس به افراد امکان میدهد تا احساس خوبی در مورد خودشان داشته باشند ولی آنها را برای انجام هیچ کاری با انگیزه نمی کند. اگر منطق فوق درست باشد در این صورت ارزش آن را دارد که بپرسیم چگونه جنبش عزت نفس در ابتدا آغاز شد. این جنبش در سال ۱۹۸۶ آغاز شد، زمانی که ایالت کالیفرنیا به عنوان راهبردی برای کاهش دادن رد شدن در مدرسه وابستگی به خدمات اجتماعی، جرم حاملگی ناخواسته و اعتیاد به مواد مخدر تصمیم گرفت عزت نفس تمام شهروندان را تقویت کند. منطق نهفته این بود که تقریباً تمام مشکلات روان شناختی تا عزت نفس پایین فرد قابل پیگیری هستند (براندن (۱۹۸۴) برنامه های تقویت عزت نفس با پیروی از این رهنمود (بدون فرگونه شواهد تجربی برای تأیید آن به شکل برنامه هایی نظیر Head ، Upward Bound و نمونه های دیگر وارد صحنه شدند. زمانی که پژوهش Early Training Project. Star تجربی به این برنامه ها رسیدگی کرد تا اثر بخشی آنها را ثابت کند نتایج نشان دادند که این رنامه ها نتوانستند مشکلات اجتماعی را که قانون گذاران ایالت کالیفرنیا مشخص کرده بودند. رطرف کنند با میستر و همکاران ۲۰۰۳؛ داوس ۱۹۹۶؛ سوان ۱۹۹۶)، عزت نفس بالا که زار بود در این برنامه های افزایش عزت نفس ترویج داده شوند، خیالی و ناپایدار بودند. در پایان بهترین نتیجه ای که میتوانیم بگیریم این است که عزت نفس چیزی شبیه شادکامی است. سعی در شادکام بودن باعث نمی شود که خیلی موفق شوید، بلکه شادکامی پیامد Scanned with CamScanner خشنودی ها پیروزی ها و روابط مثبت زندگی است دیتر و بیزواز دیتر (۲۰۰۸) همین طور عزت نفس صرفاً پیامد عملکرد انطباقی و تمریخش خود (self) است. خود پنداره خود پنداره بازنمایی های ذهنی افراد از خودشان است. همانگونه که افراد از دیگران مکانها و وقایع، بازنمایی های ذهنی دارند از خودشان نیز بازنمایی ذهنی دارند. خود پنداره از تجربه ها و از فکر کردن به این تجربه ها ساخته می شود. افراد برای ساختن خودپنداره به بازخوردی توجه میکنند که در امور روزمره خود می گیرند. که صفات ویژگیها و ترجیحات آنها را آشکار می سازند عناصر اصلی که افراد از آنها برای ساختن و توصیف خود استفاده میکنند از تجربه های خاص زندگی به دست می آیند. مانند موارد زیر . هنگام بحث گروهی احساس ناراحتی و نگرانی کردم . در سفر علمی مدرسه به باغ وحش زیاد حرف نزدم هنگام صرف ناهار از نشستن کنار دیگران خودداری کردم. افراد در مواقع فکر کردن صدها تجربه زندگی را به یاد نمی آورند، بلکه با گذشت زمان تجربه های خاص خود را به یک بازنمایی کلی از خود تبدیل میکنند (مثلاً، با توجه به تجربه های فروخورده ام در گروه ها در باغ وحش و هنگام صرف ناهار خودم را به صورت خجالتی برداشت میکنم همین نتیجه گیری کلی من خجالتیام و نه تجربه های خاص در گروه ها در باغ وحش و هنگام صرف ناهار است که افراد به یاد می آورند و از آنها برای ساختن و توصیف خود پنداره استفاده میکنند (مارکوس (۱۹۷۷) خود طرحواره ها خود طرحواره ها نتیجه گیریهای شناختی درباره خود هستند که زمینه خاصی دارند و از تجربه های گذشته آموخته میشوند مارکوس ۱۹۷۷ (۱۹۸۳) نتیجه گیری قبلی من 1. self-concept خجالتی ام بیانگر خود طرحواره است. خجالتی بودن هم زمینه خاص است روابط با دیگران) و هم از تجربه های گذشته آموخته شده است هنگام بحثهای گروهی سفرهای علمی گفتگوها به هنگام صرف ناهار خجالتی بودن بیانگر خود پنداره نیست، بلکه خود (self) را در یک زمینه خاص نشان میدهد - روابط فرد با دیگران در ورزشها یک دانش آموز دبیرستانی با در نظر گرفتن تجربه های هفته گذشته و یادآوری ترک کردن دو ۱۶۰۰ متر به علت خستگی و بارها برخورد با مانع هنگام پرش از آن، یک خود طرحواره با زمینه خاص تشکیل میدهد. با این حال همین دانش آموز در زمینه متفاوتی ممکن است به یاد بیاورد که در امتحان نمره بالایی گرفته است به تمام سؤال های معلم جواب داده است و شعری سروده که برای چاپ در نشریه مدرسه پذیرفته شده است. سرانجام، اگر تجربه ها در ورزش و در کلاس به قدر کافی مستمر و مکرر باشند این دانش آموز درباره خود نتیجه خواهد گرفت که در ورزشها عمدتاً بی کفایت اما در مدرسه ماهر است. این نتیجه گیری ها از لحاظ ورزشی نالایق از لحاظ عقلانی باهوش خود طرحواره های زمینه خاص دیگری را تشکیل می دهند. خود پنداره مجموعه ای از طرحواره های زمینه خاص است خود طرحواره هایی که در توصیف خودپنداره درگیرند آن دسته از زمینه های زندگی هستند که بیشترین اهمیت را برای فرد دارند مارکوس (۱۹۷۷) برای مثال زمینه های مهم در دوران کودکی، معمولاً شایستگی شناختی شایستگی جسمانی پذیرش همسالان و سلوک رفتاری هستند. در نوجوانی زمینه های عمده زندگی عموماً شایستگی تحصیلی شایستگی ورزشی، ظاهر جسمانی پذیرش همسالان روابط دوستی صمیمی جاذبه رمانتیک سلوک رفتاری یا اخلاقیات هستند هارتر (۱۹۹۰) در دانشگاه زمینه های عمده زندگی عبارت اند از شایستگی تحصیلی توانایی عقلانی شایستگی شغلی شایستگی ورزشی ظاهر جسمانی پذیرش همسالان روابط دوستی نزدیک روابط رمانتیک روابط با والدین اخلاقیات و حس شوخ طبعی هارتر ۱۹۹۰؛ نیمان و هارتر (۱۹۸۶) زمینه های خاص زندگی از فردی به فرد دیگر تفاوت دارند، اما این زمینه ها ساختار مرتبط با سن خود پنداره را نشان می دهند. ویژگیهای انگیزشی خود طرحواره ها خود طرحواره ها به دو صورت انگیزش به وجود می آورند. اول اینکه خود طرحواره ها بعد از اینکه تشکیل شدند رفتار فرد را طوری هدایت میکنند که بازخورد هماهنگ با خود طرحواره های تشکیل شده را فراخوانی میکنند یعنی چون فرد خود را خجالتی می داند. رفتار آینده اش را در زمینه های بین فردی به گونه ای هدایت میکند تا بازخوردی را به وجود آورد که خودانگاره من خجالتی ام را تأیید کند. افراد خجالتی بازخورد اجتماعی را می خواهند و از آن احساس راحتی میکنند که تأیید کند آنها خجالتی هستند درست مانند افراد شوخ طبعی که بازخورد اجتماعی را میخواهند و از آن احساس راحتی میکنند که تأیید کند آنها شوخ طبع هستند. در مقابل بازخوردی که با خود طرحواره تشکیل شده ناسازگار است، تنش انگیزشی ناشی از ناسازگاری و عدم تأیید خود به وجود می آورد که به مقاومت و استدلال مخالف می انجامد. مفهوم اساسی در پس هماهنگی خود طرحواره ها این است که اگر به فردی گفته شود درونگر است در حالی که خودش معتقد است برونگر است این بازخورد متضاد تنش انگیزشی ایجاد میکند این تنش فرد را برای بازگرداندن هماهنگی با انگیزه میکند. بنابراین افراد برای پیشگیری از احساس تنش انگیزشی ناخوشایند به صورت هماهنگ با خود طرحواره رفتار میکنند اگر این پیشگیری مؤثر واقع نشود در این صورت افراد طوری رفتار میکنند که بازخورد تازه ای را به وجود آورد تا هماهنگی خود طرحواره را به حال اول برگرداند. خود طرحواره ها همچنین برای پیش بردن خود موجود به سمت خود مطلوب آینده انگیزش به وجود می آورند خود آرمانی ممکن خیلی شبیه فرایند ایجاد ناهمخوانی در تعیین هدف رفتار هدف گرا را آغاز میکند بنابراین دانش آموزی که میخواهد هنرپیشه شود، هر اقدامی را که برای پیش بردن خود از دانش آموز بودن به هنرپیشه» شدن لازم است آغاز می کند. دانش آموز خود موجود در حالی که هنر پیشه خود آرمانی را تشکیل می دهد. جستجوی خودهای ممکن نوعی فرایند تعیین هدف است که تغییر و تحول خودپنداره را می طلبد در حالی که جستجوی نظر خودانگاره باثبات نوعی فرایند تأیید است که پایداری خود پنداره را حفظ می کند. خود باثبات بعد از اینکه فرد خود طرحواره روشنی را در زمینه خاصی تشکیل داد، به طور کلی برای حفظ کردن خود انگاره عمل میکند خود طرحواره ها بعد از تشکیل به طور فزاینده ای در برابر اطلاعات مغایر مقاوم میشوند مارکوس ۱۹۸۳،۱۹۷۷) افراد با جستجوی فعال اطلاعات هماهنگ با خودپنداره شان و با نادیده گرفتن اطلاعات مغایر با خود انگاره شان خود باثبات را حفظ میکنند. اعتقاد داشتن به اینکه یک چیز درباره خود درست است ولی به فرد گفته شود که در واقع برعکس آن صحت دارد، از لحاظ روان شناختی ناراحت کننده است. آشفتگی سیاستمداری که انتخاب محلی را می بازد یا آشفتگی قهرمان ورزشی را که برای رتبه بندی حرفه ای انتخاب نمی شود، تجسم کنید. نا هماهنگی و مغایرت نوعی ناراحتی هیجانی تولید میکنند که خبر می دهد ثبات باید به حال اول برگردانده شود. همین حالت عاطفی منفی است که انگیزش جستجوی اطلاعات و بازخورد تأیید خود و اجتناب از عدم تأیید خود را به وجود می آورد. برای اینکه مطمئن شویم دیگران ما را به همان صورت خودمان در نظر میگیرند از علائم و نمادهایی استفاده میکنیم که اعلام میدارند ما کیستیم یا فکر میکنیم هستیم. نمونه هایی از این گونه علائم و نمادها ظواهری هستند که از طریق پوشاک عادات غذایی، وزنه برداری جراحی پلاستیک و حتی اموال و نوع اتومبیلی که سوار میشویم در خود جسمانی خویش انتقال می دهیم. به علاوه برای حفاظت از خود طرحواره عمداً تعامل با افرادی را انتخاب میکنیم که با ما به صورت هماهنگ با خودانگاره مان رفتار کنند و از افرادی که طوری با ما برخورد می کنند که با خود انگاره مان هماهنگ نیست اجتناب میکنیم فرایندی که با عنوان تعامل گزینشی به آن شاره شده است رابینسون و اسمیت - لاوین، ۱۹۹۲ ،سوان پلهام و کرول، ۱۹۸۹) با انتخاب دوستانی که خود انگاره ما را تأیید میکنند و فاصله گیری از کسانی که خود انگاره ما را نفی می کنند، احتمال بازخورد تأیید کننده خود را افزایش داده و احتمال بازخورد نفی کننده خود را کاهش میدهیم تعامل گزینشی توضیح میدهد که چرا دوستان هم اتاقی ها، مربیان، معلمان نمبازی ها و همسران خاصی را انتخاب میکنیم - یعنی به دلیل اینکه از تعامل های اجتماعی رای حفظ و تأیید خودانگاره مان استفاده میکنیم (سوان (۱۹۸۷) تعامل گزینشی همچنین رضیح می دهد که چرا افراد رابطه ای را که در آن طرف مقابل آنها را به صورت متفاوت با بودشان در نظر میگیرد قطع میکنند مثلاً در طلاق فرد به وسیله ازدواج با شخصی به جای شخص دیگر تعامل با همسری را انتخاب میکند که منبع بازخورد برای ثبات خود باشد و با طلاق گرفتن از همسر خود ممکن است منبع بازخورد ناسازگار با خود را حذف کند. با وجود اقدامات پیشگیرانه گاهی بازخورد ناسازگار با خود روی می دهد همان گونه که برای سیاستمدار و ورزشکار روی داد اولین دفاع برای حفظ کردن خود باثبات تحریف اطلاعات است تا اینکه از حالت ناسازگار خارج شود. وقتی فردی با بازخورد ناسازگار با خود طرحواره روبرو میشود ممکن است بپرسد آیا بازخورد معتبر است، آیا منبع بازخورد قابل اعتماد است و این بازخورد تا چه اندازه ای مهم یا مناسب است. برای مثال دانشجویی که خود انگاره باهوش بودن دارد ولی در یک درس رد میشود ممکن است این بازخورد را نپذیرد و علیه (۱) اعتبار آن (۲) قضاوت استاد و (۳) اهمیت یا تناسب آن دلیل بیاورد. افراد همچنین با نخوت جبرانی تأیید خود و رفتارهای جدید برای تأیید خودانگاره خویش با بازخورد نفی کننده مقابله می کنند. تأیید خود در برابر تغییر خود پنداره اطمینان فرد از اینکه خود طرحواره او معتبر و درست است اطمینان از خودپنداره را تشکیل می دهد. در صورتی که اطمینان از خود پنداره زیاد باشد خود طرحواره ها را محکم میکند. بازخورد ناسازگار به ندرت خود طرحواره باثبات را تغییر میدهد با این حال چنانچه اطمینان از خود پنداره کم باشد بازخورد ناسازگار میتواند سرانجام موجب تغییر خود طرحواره شود. تعارض بین خود طرحواره نامطمئن و بازخورد ناسازگار بحران تأیید خود را برانگیخته می کند (سوان، ۱۹۸۳، ۱۹۹۹). فرایند نسبتاً پیچیده تأیید خود در شکل ۲-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. به طوری که در بالای این شکل نشان داده شده است افراد با بازنمایی خود خود طرحواره و ترجیح بازخورد تأیید کننده خود شروع میکنند. وقتی افراد به صورت علنی علائم و نمادهای چه کسی هستند (خودانگاره شان را آشکار می سازند تعامل اجتماعی روزمره آنها جریان یکنواخت تأیید خود را به وجود می آورد. فقط بعد از پدیدار شدن بازخورد اجتماعی ناسازگار با خود اوضاع شروع به پیچیده شدن می کند. افراد اطلاعات ناسازگار با خود ملایم را تقریباً خوب تحمل می کنند. ولی، تأثیر بازخورد نیرومند نفی کننده خود به راحتی پذیرفته نمی شود تأثیر چنین بازخوردی به اطمینان از خود پنداره بستگی دارد. وقتی اطمینان از خود پنداره کم باشد شکل ۲-۱۱ را ببینید)، بازخورد فصل ۱۱ ٫ خود و تلاشهای آن نیرومند می تواند بر خود طرحواره از پیش موجود غلبه کرده و تغییر خود پنداره را برانگیخته کند. با این حال چنانچه اطمینان از خودپنداره زیاد باشد در برابر بازخورد نیرومند مقاومت صورت میگیرد و فقط به عنوان یک قطعه اطلاعات جزئی ارزیابی می شود. جالب ترین مورد از لحاظ رشدی زمانی اتفاق می افتد که اطمینان از خودپنداره متوسط باشد. وقتی اطمینان از خود پنداره متوسط باشد و فرد با بازخورد نیرومند ناسازگار با خود روبرو می شود، بحران تأیید خود را تجربه خواهد کرد. فرد هنگام بحران تأیید خود قضاوت را به تأخیر می اندازد و بازخورد بیشتری را جستجو میکند اگر بازخورد بیشتر خیلی متقاعد کننده باشد بحران تأیید خود خودانگاره را تغییر نمی دهد بلکه در عوض، اطمینان از خود پنداره را پایین می آورد. همین اطمینان کم از خودپنداره است که باعث میشود فرد در برابر تغییر خود پنداره در آینده مستعد شود. توجه داشته باشید که تنها مسیر به سمت تغییر خود پنداره از طریق اطمینان کم به خود پنداره است که در سمت راست شکل ۲-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. قبل از اینکه خود پنداره تغییر کند (۱) اطمینان از خود پنداره باید پایین باشد و (۲) بازخورد ناسازگار با خود باید قوی و واضح باشد - یعنی رد کردن آن دشوار باشد (شوان، ۱۹۸۷) ناسازگار با خود باید قوی و واضح باشد - یعنی رد کردن آن دشوار باشد (شوان، ۱۹۸۷) گرچه خود پنداره میتواند تغییر کند ولی تغییر استثناست نه قاعده تغییر خود پنداره به ندرت صورت میگیرد در حالی که تأیید خود و ثبات خود پنداره رایج هستند. چرا افراد خود را تأیید میکنند؟ افراد به دلایل شناختی دانشی و عملی بازخورد تأیید خود را ترجیح می دهند. از نظر شناختی افراد به این دلیل خود را تأیید میکنند که میخواهند خودشان را بشناسند (با) خودشان صادق باشند در رابطه با مسائل دانشی افراد به این دلیل جویای تأیید خود هستند که تأیید خود برداشت از دنیا را به صورت پیش بینی پذیر و منسجم تقویت میکند (سوان و پلهام (۲۰۰۲) از لحاظ عملی افراد به این علت خود را تأیید می کنند که دوست دارند از تعامل هایی اجتناب ورزند که ممکن است آکنده از سوء تفاهم ها و انتظارات نامعقول باشند؛ آنها جویای تعامل با افرادی هستند که میدانند چه انتظاری از آنها داشته باشند (سوان، ۱۹۹۲ ۱۹۹۹؛ سوان و پلهام (۲۰۰۲) 1. epistemic شکل ۲-۱۱ فرایندهای زیربنای تأیید خود و تغییر خود پنداره خودهای ممکن گاهی خود طرحواره ها در پاسخ به بازخورد اجتماعی تغییر میکنند (شکل ۲-۱۱) اما خود طرحواره ها به احتمال بیشتری به شیوه عمدی تغییر میکنند تغییر خود طرحواره می تواند از طریق تلاش عمدی برای پیش بردن خود موجود به سمت خود ممکن مطلوب در آینده روی دهد. خودهای ممکن نظر افراد را درباره آنچه دوست دارند بشوند و همچنین آنچه می ترسند ممکن است بشوند منعکس می سازند مارکوس و نوریوس، ۱۹۸۶؛ مارکوس و رولو، (۱۹۸۹) برای مثال برخی از خودهای مورد نظر ممکن است خود موفق خود خلاق خود ثروتمند خود لاغر یا خود محبوب باشند؛ برخی از خودهایی که فرد از آنها واهمه دارد ممکن است خود بیکار خود معلول خود چاق یا خود طرد شده باشند. اینکه چگونه ممکن است فردی از خود فعلی به خود ممکن مطلوب در آینده پیشرفت کند. در شکل ۳-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. خودهای ممکن عمدتاً منشأ اجتماعی دارند، به طوری که فرد خودهایی را مشاهده میکند که توسط دیگران الگو قرار داده می شوند (مارکوس و نوریوس (۱۹۸۶) فرد خود فعلی خویش را به صورت خود موجود می بیند و الگوی نقش را به صورت خود آرمانی مطلوب آینده در نظر میگیرد وقتی فرد این اختلاف را می بیند. استنباط می کند که او نیز میتواند مانند الگوی نقش موفق در آینده موفق باشد. برای اینکه این اتفاق روی دهد فرد ویژگیها مهارتها و تواناییهای خود را با ویژگی ها مهارت ها و توانایی های الگوی نقش مقایسه میکند. این مقایسه ها حالت انگیزشی ناهماهنگی ایجاد می کنند. فرد برای رفع این ناهماهنگی تلاش میکند برنامه ریزی راهبردی می کند و ابتکار عمل لازم را به خرج میدهد تا خود فعلی را ارتقا دهد و بیشتر شبیه خود ممکن مطلوب شود. برای مثال، امکان دارد کودکی نوازندگانی را در یک کنسرت مشاهده و آرزو کند خواننده شود. خودهای ممکن بیانگر خود آینده هستند بنابراین خود ممکن از لحاظ انگیزشی مانند هدف عمل میکند خود ممکن به عنوان هدف - مانند حالت مطلوب در آینده - همانند تمام هدفها به صورت نیرویی قدرتمند عمل میکند؛ یعنی با افزایش دادن تلاش استقامت متمرکز کردن توجه و برنامه ریزی راهبردی به فصل ۸ مراجعه کنید. خودهای ممکن قطعه مهمی را به معمای چگونه خود رشد می کند، می افزایند. خودهای ممكن اصولاً بازنمایی های ذهنی ویژگیها صفات و تواناییهایی هستند که خود هنوز از آنها برخوردار نیست مثلاً، من دوست دارم پزشک شوم هر چند درباره آناتومی انسان با فنون جراحی آگاهی زیادی ندارم فردی که خود ممکنی را دنبال می کند کمتر بر 1. present self فصل ۱۱ ٫ خود و تلاشهای آن خود طرحواره های موجود و بیشتر بر خود مورد نظر اتکا میکند و سؤالهایی از این قبیل را می پرسد: اگر قرار باشد به خود ممکنم تبدیل شوم چگونه باید رفتار کنم؟ چه فعالیت هایی را باید دنبال کنم؟ به چه آموزشی نیاز دارم؟ به طوری که این سؤالها اشاره دارند، پیش بردن خود به سمت خود آرمانی نه تنها ایجاب میکند که برای خود ممکن تلاش شود، بلکه همچنین راهبردهای مؤثری برای رسیدن به آن ضرورت دارند. مفهوم خودهای ممکن خود را به صورت هستی پویا که گذشته، حال و آینده دارد، ترسیم می کند. فردی که در زمینه خاصی خود ممکن ندارد از مبنای شناختی مهم برای پرورش دادن توانایی ها در آن زمینه بی بهره است (کراس) و مارکوس (۱۹۹۴) شاید بتوانید به تلاش های گذشته خودتان که صرف چند درس مختلف دانشگاهی کردید نگاهی بیندازید و این سؤال ها را از خود بپرسید بود در برابر نبود خود ممکن در تعیین اینکه برای خواندن این کتاب حضور یافتن در کلاس و ثبت نام آن تلاش کردم چه نقشی را ایفا کرد؟ بخشی از دلیل تلاش زیاد استقامت، توجه متمرکز و برنامه ریزی راهبردی شما در یک درس خاص را می توان به وجود خود ممکن مهمی ربط داد؛ همان گونه که بخشی از دلیل اینکه چرا برای درس دیگری در دانشگاه تلاش استقامت توجه و برنامه ریزی راهبردی نداشتید می تواند به نبود خود ممکن ربط داشته باشد. فعالیتها و پیامدهای درسی روزمره از لحاظ انگیزشی مهم هستند (مثل موضوع درس بازخورد موفقیت ٫ شکست ولی بود در برابر نبود خود ممکن، چشم انداز آینده ای را اضافه میکند که به مشارکت انگیزش مبتنی بر آینده در فعالیت امروز، اشاره دارد. هویتی هویت پدیده جامعه شناختی و روان شناختی است اکسلز (۲۰۰۹)، از لحاظ جامعه شناختی هویت جایگاه با نقش فرد در جامعه است. از لحاظ روان شناختی هویت این است که آیا نقش با جایگاه اجتماعی با توصیف اجتماعی درست احساس میشود و با خود پنداره فرد ارتباط مناسبی دارد یا اینکه از نظر ناهمخوانی بین خودپنداره و نقش اجتماعی، غلط احساس می شوده (اویسر من و دستین (۲۰۱۱) انگار که فرد ۱۰۰ عکس مختلف را می بیند که افراد را در 1. identity نقش های اجتماعی مختلف نشان میدهند مثل معلم ،پلیس راننده تاکسی، کشیش و قضاوت می کند که این یکی درست احساس میشود و آن یکی غلط احساس می شوده و الی آخر هویت وسیله ای است که خود توسط آن با جامعه ارتباط برقرار می کند، به طوری که ماهیت فرد را در زمینه فرهنگی نشان میدهد فرهنگها و گروه های اجتماعی انواع هویت ها را ارائه می دهند که اعضای آنها ممکن است اختیار کنند یعنی نقشهای اجتماعی) و ممکن است از لحاظ روان شناختی با آن ارتباط برقرار کنند یعنی ارزشهای روان شناختی، وقتی فرد نقشی را بر عهده می گیرد مثل دانش آموز مادر فروشنده موسیقیدان با ارتباط اجتماعی برقرار می کند مثل لیبرال محیط گرا از آن پس آن هویت از فرد میخواهد رفتارهایی را آشکار سازد رفتارهای تأیید کننده هویت و در عین حال از رفتارهای دیگر اجتناب کند رفتارهای نفی کننده هویت، بنابراین هویتها به این دلیل مهم هستند که وقتی احساس شود رفتار با هویت هماهنگ است طبیعی و درست احساس میشود زیرا هویت را تأیید و آن را ابراز می کند و وقتی رفتار با هویت ناهماهنگ است غیر عادی و غلط احساس می شود (اوپسرمن، ۲۰۰۷) نقش ها نقش، انتظارات فرهنگی برای رفتار از فردی است که جایگاه اجتماعی خاصی دارد. هر یک از ما چند جایگاه نقش) اجتماعی داریم و اینکه در هر لحظه معینی چه نقشی را بر عهده بگیریم به موقعیتی که در آن قرار داریم و افرادی که با آنها تعامل میکنیم بستگی دارد. برای مثال، در دانشگاه که با دانشجویان دیگر و استاد تعامل میکنید نقش دانشجو» را بر عهده می گیرید. وقتی دانشگاه را ترک میکنید و به محل کار خود در کلینیک روان شناسی می روید. نقشی که بر عهده میگیرید تغییر میکند و وقتی با مراجعان تعامل میکنید، نقش مشاور» را می پذیرید. در خانه وقتی نقش مادر یا پدر را بر عهده میگیرید که با یک دختر» تعامل می کند نقش شما و نقشهای افرادی که با آنها تعامل می کنید، تغییر می کنند. وقتی افراد نقشی را به جای نقش دیگر بر عهده میگیرند شیوه عمل خود را تغییر می دهند. آنها موضوع گفتگو واژگانی که به کار میبرند لحن صدا و غیره را تغییر می دهند. با اینکه ماری هنوز همان فرد است ولی وقتی خود را به جای «مادر» در نقش «استاد» می باید به شیوه متفاوتی گفتگو می کند. ارتباطها با گروه های اجتماعی افراد علاوه بر نقش های اجتماعی با گروه های اجتماعی مانند وابستگی های مشترک من کاتولیک هستم، تمایلات مشترک من طرفدار فوتبال هستم و عقاید و ارزشهای مشترک من طرفدار محیط زیست هستم ارتباطهایی دارند. این ارتباطها به جای اختیار کردن نقش های اجتماعی تأیید ارزشهای روان شناختی هستند وقتی افراد ارتباط های خود را با گروه های اجتماعی در نظر میگیرند برخی از این ارتباطها را می پذیرند در حالی که برخی دیگر را رد میکنند - فرایند تشکیل هویت را تجربه میکنند سوئنز و همکاران ۲۰۱۱) این فرایند انتخاب کردن کدام هویتها جذب خود شوند و کدام هویتهای دیگر رد شوند، چالش رشدی دشواری است اما پاسخی را به سؤال اساسی خود برای فرد تأمین می کند: «چگونه خود را به جامعه ربط می دهم؟». افراد برای پاسخ دادن به این سؤال هویت به سطوح مختلف کاوش و تعهد نسبت به این هویتهای ممکن میپردازند که به آنها علاقه دارند و برای آنها مهیا هستند. برخی افراد سبک اطلاعاتی را اختیار میکنند که به موجب آن گزینه ها و امکانات مرتبط با هویت خود را جستجو و آنها را به صورت انتقادی ارزشیابی میکنند در حالی که افراد دیگر سبک هنجاری را اختیار می کنند که در آن به انتظارات و تجویزهای کسانی را که به آنها احترام میگذارند، متکی می شوند. این سبک های مختلف به این دلیل مهم هستند که توضیح میدهند چرا برخی افراد هویت اصیل، پیچیده و کاملاً منسجمی دارند یعنی آنهایی که سبک اطلاعاتی دارند، در حالی که دیگران هویت های نه چندان اصیل و تکه پاره دارند یعنی آنهایی که سبک هنجاری دارند و این تمایز اشاراتی برای بهزیستی فرد دارد لین ویل ۱۹۸۷؛ رایان لا گاردیا و راستورن (۲۰۰۵) موقعیت ها هویتهای خاص را برجسته میکنند هویتی که ما اختیار میکنیم تا اندازه ای به موقعیتی که خود را در آن می یابیم، بستگی دارد. بنابراین فرد در خانه مادر» است اما در اداره رئیس است. افراد چند هویت دارند، بنابراین اینکه کدام هویت رفتار جاری را هدایت کند تا اندازه ای بستگی دارد به اینکه زمینه موقعیتی کدام هویت را برجسته کرده باشد. مداخله هایی مانند مداخله از مدرسه تا شغل به دانش آموزان کمک میکنند از هویتی که در موقعیت بسیار آشنا و کاملاً تعریف شده (مدرسه) داشتند به هویت وقعیت نه چندان آشنا و نه چندان تعریف شده (کار) انتقال یابند اویر من و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) عاملیت خود از ساختارهای شناختی خودپنداره عمیق تر است خود از انگیزش درونی نیز برخوردار است که کیفیت عاملیت به آن میدهد (رایان (۱۹۹۳) عاملیت مستلزم علیت و عمل شخصی است دچارمز (۱۹۸۷) عاملیت بیانگر نظری درباره خود به صورت عمل و رشد از درون به عنوان فرایندها و انگیزشهای فطری است (دمی و رایان (۱۹۹۱) خود به عنوان عمل و رشد از درون در فصل ۶ درباره نیازهای روان شناختی ارگانیز می خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط بحث کردیم - نیازهایی که نیروی انگیزشی طبیعی برای پرورش عاملیت یعنی ابتکار عمل، عمل) فراهم می کنند. این نیازهای روان شناختی به طور جدایی ناپذیری با ماهیت فعال خود رشد کننده هماهنگ هستند دسی و رایان (۱۹۹۱) و منبع انگیزش زیربنای عاملیت را تشکیل می دهند. (یعنی دنبال کردن تمایلات جستجوی چالشهای محیطی به کار بردن مهارت ها و پرورش دادن استعدادها برای پی بردن به توانایی پرورش دادن آن و تحقق بخشیدن به آن). تمایز و یکپارچگی تمایز و یکپارچگی دو فرایند رشد فطری در خود (self) هستند. تمایز خود (self) را به صورت هستی به طور فزاینده ای پیچیده گسترش میدهد یکپارچگی این هستی پیچیده را در یک کل منسجم ترکیب میکند و به این ترتیب از خود پنداره منفرد و منسجم محافظت می نماید. تمایز زمانی صورت میگیرد که فرد از تمایلات ترجیحات و توانایی های خود به شیوه ای استفاده کند که خود نسبتاً کلی و نامتمایز در چند زمینه زندگی تخصص یابد. به عنوان مثال سابقه خود را در نظر بگیرید که یاد گرفتید تمام کامپیوترها تمام ورزشها، تمام سیاستمداران و تمام مذاهب همانند نیستند. تمایز جزئی خودش را در سادگی آشکار می سازد که در آن فرد فقط درک تک بعدی از زمینه دانش خاصی دارد تمایز غنی خودش را در درک تمایزهای دقیق و جنبه های منحصر به فرد زمینه خاصی از زندگی آشکار می سازد. انگیزش درونی تمایلات و نیازهای روان شناختی به صورت پیشتازانه خود را برای تعامل با دنیا به شیوه ای نیرومند می سازند که زمینه برای متمایز شدن آن به موجودیتی بسیار پیچیده 1. agency آماده شود. برای مثال کودکی که به هواپیماهای مدل علاقه دارد کاتالوگ ها را بررسی می کند. به باشگاه های مدل سازی میرود درباره ساختن مدل با همسالان خود صحبت می کند. مشترک مجله ای درباره آن میشود مواد جدید و روشهای ساختن گوناگون را امتحان میکند و در حال یادگیری مهارتهای تخصصی را پرورش میدهد. این انگیزش درونی خود است که به آن عاملیتی را میدهد که برای بررسی کاتالوگها رفتن به باشگاه مدل سازی، صحبت با همسالان و غیره به آن نیاز دارد و همین جریان تجربه جاری و عاملیت است که امکان تمایز و پیچیده شدن را به خود می دهد. تمایز به صورت کاهش ناپذیر پیچیدگی خود را گسترش نمیدهد، بلکه برای یکپارچگی پیچیدگی خود در خودپنداره واحد و وحدتی منسجم نوعی گرایش ترکیبی وجود دارد. یکپارچگی فرایندی سازمان دهنده است که اجزای متمایز خود را به صورت یک کل منسجم کنار هم قرار میدهد به جای اینکه خود با دهها خود طرحواره نامرتبط با حتی تا اندازه ای ناسازگار باقی بماند آن را به صورت خود پنداره واحدی در می آورد. مفاهیم عاملیت از طریق انگیزش درونی نمایز و یکپارچگی اعلام می دارند که خود از جنبه های فطری برخوردار است نیازهای روان شناختی و فرایندهای رشد نقطه شروعی را برای پرورش خود تأمین میکنند. وقتی افراد بالغ میشوند تماس بیشتری با موقعیت اجتماعی برقرار میکنند و برخی از این جنبه های دنیای اجتماعی در سیستم خود جذب و ادغام می شوند. بنابراین تصویر انگیزشی رشد خود با این دیدگاه که خود صرفاً دریافت کننده منفعل بازخورد دنیای اجتماعی خود طرحواره ها و هویت ها جایگاه ها در ترتیب اجتماعی است، مغایرت دارد. خود همچنین به صورت فعال خودش را از طریق عاملیت فطری اش پرورش می دهد. درونی سازی و یکپارچه کردن خود خود با نیازهای فطری تمایلات ،ترجیحات و توانایی هایش آماده رشد کردن و متمایز شدن است. با این حال نیاز به ارتباط فرد را در ارتباط نزدیک با مسائل و تنظیم های اجتماعی قرار می دهد و بنابراین خود هم در جهت استقلال و هم ارتباط پرورش می یابد. نیاز روان شناختی به ارتباط روابط گرم و صمیمانه با دیگران کیفیت انگیزشی است که به انگیزش پیشتازانه فرد برای درونی سازی مقررات ارزشها و مسائل اجتماعی کمک می کند. بنابراین رفتارها هیجانها و شیوه های تفکر نه تنها از درون خود، بلکه همچنین از درون موقعیت اجتماعی و جامعه سرچشمه میگیرند وقتی فرد بازی مطالعه، عمل و با دیگران تعامل میکند این افراد از او توقع دارند که از شیوه های خاص رفتار، احساس و فکر کردن تبعیت کند. بنابراین اعمال عمدی یعنی عاملیت گاهی از خود و گاهی از رهنمود و توصیه های دیگران ناشی میشوند فرایندی که افراد از طریق آن شیوه های تفکر احساس با رفتار کردن تجویز شده به صورت بیرونی را جذب میکنند و میپذیرند. درونی سازی نامیده می شود. درونی سازی به دو دلیل روی میدهد اول اینکه درونی سازی در اثر تمایل فرد به برقراری ارتباط معنی دار با دوستان ،والدین معلمان ،مربیان کارفرمایان کشیشان، خانواده و دیگران روی می دهد. بنابراین درونی سازی به وسیله نیاز به ارتباط برانگیخته می شود. دوم اینکه درونی سازی در اثر تمایل فرد به تعامل مؤثر با دنیای اجتماعی روی می دهد. بنابراین درونی سازی توسط نیاز به شایستگی برانگیخته میشود. بیشتر چیزهایی که فرد درونی میکند به عملکرد مؤثر او کمک میکنند مثل رفتن به مدرسه مسواک زدن دندان پوزش خواستن از دیگران این گونه درونی سازی برای خود ارزش بین فردی انطباقی دارد، زیرا نه تنها به کارآمدی بیشتر در تبادلهای محیطی بلکه همچنین به وحدت بیشتر بین خود و جامعه کمک می کند. مفهوم خود به عنوان عامل تأیید میکند که (۱) انسانها از یک خود اساسی برخوردارند که توسط انگیزش فطری نیرومند میشود و به وسیله فرایندهای رشد فطری تمایز و یکپارچگی هدایت می شود و (۲) تمام ساختارهای خود به طور برابر اصیل نیستند، به طوری که برخی از ساختارهای خود واقعاً خود اساسی در حالی که ساختارهای دیگر، فقط نیازها و اولویت های جامعه را منعکس میکنند رایان، ۱۹۹۳ دسی (۲۰۱۷) چون برخی از ساختارهای خود از جامعه سرچشمه میگیرند ممکن است درون خود تعارض ایجاد کنند. تعارض برعکس یکپارچگی است شرایط محیطی کنترل کننده باعث میشوند که خود نیازها و ترجیحات فطری را نادیده بگیرد و در عوض ساختار خودی را بر مبنای هدف تأیید بیرونی پرورش دهد (هاگینز و نی (۲۰۰۲) بنابراین افرادی که تأیید بیرونی خودی را که از لحاظ اجتماعی مطلوب است دنبال میکنند امکان دارد به جای شغلی که با تمایلات ترجیحات و نیازهای روان شناختی درونی آنها هماهنگ باشد شغلی را انتخاب کنند که ثروت مقام یا قدرت اجتماعی تأمین کند. خود واقعی خود واقعی درجه ای را که فرد با تجربه درونی ارتباط دارد منعکس می کند (یعنی فرد از نیازها، تمایلات و اهداف شخصی ذهن آگاه است با چنین آگاهی و ذهن آگاهی بین تجربه درونی و رفتار واقعی ارتباط نزدیکی وجود دارد در مقابل خود کاذب خودی است که در آن تجربه درونی نادیده گرفته شده سرکوب شده یا تحریف شده است. به طوری که بین تجربه درونی و رفتار فرد ارتباط اندکی وجود دارد. به طور کلی در صورتی که روابط از تلاش ها خود بیانگریها و مقاصد افراد حمایت کنند آنها از خود واقعی ذهن آگاهی و دانش شخصی کسب میکنند اما وقتی روابط و نیروهای اجتماعی عیب جویی ارزشیابی و کنترل کنند یا صرفاً بی تفاوت باشند در این صورت عملکرد خود مستقل لطمه میبیند و دفاعی می شود، درک خود تحریف شده پدیدار میشود تا با چنین نبود حمایتی انطباق یابد هورنی ۱۹۵۰ راجرز ۱۹۶۱؛ دسی و رایان ۲۰۱۷) خود هماهنگی سؤالهایی که توسط مدل خود هماهنگی پرسیده میشوند عبارت اند از: (۱) افراد چگونه تصمیم میگیرند در زندگی خود برای چه چیزی تلاش کنند؟ و (۲) چگونه این فرایند تلاش شخصی گاهی خود را پرورش میدهد و به بهزیستی کمک میکند و در مواقع دیگر به خطا می رود و بهزیستی را کاهش می دهد؟ وقتی افراد تصمیم میگیرند هدفهایی را دنبال کنند که با خود اساسی آنها هماهنگ هستند، هدف های هماهنگ با خود را دنبال میکنند شکل ۴-۱۱ به صورت نموداری این مفهوم را توضیح میدهد که هدفهای فرد ممکن است بیانگر نیازها، تمایلات و ارزشهای درونی شده او باشند یا نباشند. بر طبق نظریه خود مختاری (فصل ۵) هدف های درونی هدفهایی که از تمایلات شخصی ناشی میشوند و هدفهای خودپذیر هدف هایی که از اعتقاد یا ارزشهای فرد ناشی میشوند بیانگر هدفهای هماهنگ با خود هستند. هدف های هماهنگ با خود خود یکپارچه و عامل را منعکس و ابراز میکنند. هدف های درون فکنی شده هدف هایی که از الزامات اجتماعی ناشی میشوند و هدفهای بیرونی آنهایی که از میل به تحسین یا تقویت شدن ناشی میشوند بیانگر هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود هستند. هدف های شکل ۱۱۰۴ توضیح نموداری عمل منسجم و نامنسجم خود تا هماهنگ با خود اعمال نامنسجم را منعکس و ابراز میکنند که از فشارهای کنترل کننده درونی و بیرونی ناشی می شوند. مدل خود هماهنگی در شکل ۱۱۵ نشان داده شده است این مدل زمانی آغاز می شود که فرد هدفی را تعیین میکند برای مثال امکان دارد یک نفر هدف ازدواج دیگری هدف برقراری روابط دوستی جدید و نفر بعدی هدف ترک سیگار را تعیین کرده باشد. اولین سوالی که مدل خود هماهنگی در مورد چنین هدفی میپرسد صرفاً این است: چرا؟ چرا می خواهید ازدواج کنید؟ چرا میخواهید روابط دوستی جدید برقرار کنید؟ چرا میخواهید سیگار را ترک کنید؟ برخی هدفها از نیازها تمایلات و ترجیحات خود اساسی باشی میشوند و آنها را منعکس میکنند هدف های هماهنگ با خود در حالی که هدفهای دیگر چنین نیستند. هدف های هماهنگ با خود به این دلیل از لحاظ انگیزشی مهم هستند که تلاش بیشتر علاقه بیشتر و عاملیت بیشتر از هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود ایجاد میکنند و نگه می دارند شلدون و البوت (۱۹۹۹) تلاش علاقه و عاملیت بیشتر به ویژه وقتی با گذشت زمان ادامه یافته باشند. شکل ۱۱۵ مدل خود هماهنگی احتمال دستیابی به هدف را افزایش میدهند دستیابی به هدف هماهنگ با خود تجربیات ارضای نیاز را نیز پرورش میدهد. سرانجام اینکه همین تجربه ارضای نیاز اصیل خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط است که بهزیستی را افزایش میدهد (یعنی بالا رفتن خلق مثبت نشاط سلامت جسمانی یعنی دستیابی به هدفهای هماهنگ با خود خوراک روان شناختی برای خود تأمین میکند که بهزیستی و انگیزش عاملیت را حفظ می نماید (رایان (۱۹۹۵ هدفهای هماهنگ با خود هدفهای درونی هدفهای خودپذیر از احساس اصالت و Scanned with CamScanner انگیزش و هیجان مالکیت شخصی سرچشمه میگیرند (مثلاً می خواهم سیگار را ترک کنم، بنابراین تمایل به دنبال کردن هدف های هماهنگ با خود در زمینه عاطفه مثبت رشد شخصی و سلامت روان شناختی روی میدهد. از سوی دیگر هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود هدف های بیرونی هدف های درون فکنی شده از احساس تعارض فشار و الزامات دیگران با ضروریات اجتماعی سرچشمه میگیرند (مثلاً من مجبورم سیگار را ترک کنم، بنابراین، میل به دنبال کردن هدف های ناهماهنگ با خود از اضطراب تعارض روان شناختی و فشار اجتماعی ناشی می شود (شلدون و کاسر (۱۹۹۸) هدفهای درونی و هدف های بیرونی فرض اساسی پژوهش درباره هدفهای درونی در برابر بیرونی این است که همه هدف ها یا آرزوهای زندگی برابر نیستند به طوری که برخی هدفها (درونی) برای سلامت روانی و عملکرد اجتماعی مفیدتر از هدفهای دیگر (بیرونی) هستند (کاسر ۲۰۱۶؛ رایان و دسی ۲۰۰۹؛ رایان و همکاران، ۱۹۹۶) برای اینکه نمونه ای از معنی این موضوع داشته باشید، یکی از هدفهای مهم زندگی خودتان را در جای خالی زیر وارد کنید هدف من در زندگی این است. هدفهای درونی آرزوها و فعالیتهای زندگی هستند که به صورت فطری خشنود کننده اند، زیرا دنبال کردن آنها فرصتهای مکرری را برای تلاشگر هدف ایجاد می کنند. تا ارضای نیاز خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط را در این راستا تجربه کند. برخی از هدف های درونی در نیمه بالای جدول ۲-۱۱ فهرست شده اند. وقتی افراد هدفهای درونی را دنبال می کنند، معمولاً جریان یکنواخت ارضای نیاز خود مختاری و شایستگی را تجربه می کنند و وقتی افراد هدفهایی را دنبال میکنند که به رشد رابطه و مشارکت در جامعه کمک می نمایند. معمولاً جریان یکنواخت ارضای رابطه را تجربه می کنند. هدفهای بیرونی آن دسته از آرزوها و فعالیتهای زندگی هستند که به توجه با تأیید دیگران نیاز دارند و بنابراین خنثی یا ناخوشایند هستند - دنبال کردن آنها افکار و رفتارهای تلاشگر را از هدف منحرف می سازد و ارضای نیاز او نادیده گرفته می شود با لطمه می بیند. برخی از هدفهای زندگی بیرونی در قسمت پایین جدول ۲-۱۱ فهرست شده اند و آرزو داشتن برای پول شهرت و ظاهر جذاب را شامل میشوند. وقتی افراد شهرت و ثروت را دنبال جدول ۲-۱۱ نمونه هایی از هدفهای درونی و هدف های بیرونی هدفهای درونی دنبال کردن خود مختاری رشد روان شناختی و رشد خود مثبت روابط صمیمی دنبال کردن پیوندهای عاطفی نزدیک صمیمیت عاطفی و رابطه بسیار رضایت بخش با دیگران مشارکت در جامعه دنبال کردن جامعه ای بهتر و دنیایی بهتر از طریق فعالیت نوع دوستانه موفقیت مالی (پول) دنبال کردن ثروت و نمادهای آن ثروت مانند اموال مادی شهرت اجتماعی دنبال کردن تحسین اجتماعی تأیید اجتماعی سرشناس بودن و تشخیص داده شدن توسط دیگران به عنوان آدم مشهور ظاهر جذاب دنبال کردن تحسین های اجتماعی و مقام اجتماعی بالا با جستجوی جذابیت از نظر بدن می کنند تجربیات ارضای نیاز خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط معمولاً ناچیز هستند. در زمینه های زندگی مثل کار ورزش دنبال کردن و رسیدن به هدفهای درونی در مقایسه با بیرونی نه تنها ارضای نیاز بیشتر بلکه همچنین مشغولیت (تلاش استقامت) یادگیری عملکرد و بهزیستی را پیش بینی میکند. علت این منافع این است که دنبال کردن هدفهای درونی ارضا کننده نیاز تلاش استقامت تفکر راهبردی و عاملیت فرد را به شیوه ای نیرومند میکند که هدفهای بیرونی این کار را انجام نمی دهند. خود تنظیمی خود تنظیمی با تعیین هدف بلند مدت آغاز میشود. هدفهای بلند مدت، مانند فارغ التحصیل 1. self-regulation Scanned with CamScanner شدن از دانشگاه یادگیری زبان خارجی و ابرقراری رابطه ای خوب، صرفاً خودشان تحقق نمی یابند. بلکه خود برای پیش بردن هدف مورد نظر به حالت نهایی مطلوب آن دستیابی به هدف باید تلاش شناختی انگیزشی و هیجانی به خرج دهد. این فرایند مدیریت خود برای تحقق بخشیدن به هدف بلند مدت خود تنظیمی نامیده میشود. به صورت رسمی تی خود تنظیمی عبارت است از برنامه ریزی اجرا نظارت و ارزیابی فراشناختی از تلاش های فرد برای هدف پینتریج، ۱۲۰۰۰ زیمر من (۲۰۰۲) آینده نگری از طریق تأمل خود تنظیمی فرایندی است که با تعیین هدف بلند مدت شروع میشود و هر یک از موارد زیر را دربر دارد که با گذشت زمان روی میدهد . برنامه ریزی و تفکر راهبردی . عمل کردن و خویشتنداری . نظارت و وارسی کردن . تأمل و تنظیم کردن بعد از اینکه فرد هدف بلند مدتی را تعیین میکند تا برای آن تلاش کند، رسیدن به آن هدف باید برنامه ریزی شود؛ فرد یک برنامه عمل به وجود می آورد؛ برای به ثمر رساندن این هدف راهبردهایی را به کار میبرد؛ و اجرای قصدها را ایجاد میکند بعد از اینکه فرایند تعیین هدف تشکیل شد فرد به سمت تلاش برای هدف و خویشتنداری پیش میرود. تلاش برای هدف به کار شناختی انگیزشی و هیجانی نیاز دارد زیرا برنامه ها راهبردها و اجرای قصدها باید عملی شوند در حالی که خویشتنداری به جلوگیری از تکانه های متعارض هدف کوتاه مدت حواسپرتی ها و وسوسه ها نیاز دارد وقتی تلاش برای هدف با گذشت زمان پدیدار می شود. فرد باید اختلاف هدف - عملکرد را زیر نظر بگیرد و ببیند آیا این اختلاف کاهش یافته و پیشرفت صورت گرفته است یا نه سرانجام فرد باید به این موضوع فکر کند که چرا خود تنظیمی موفق شده با شکست خورده است. بعد از اینکه فرد موفقیت یا شکست خود را تشخیص داد به آن فکر کرد و آن را درک کرد تلاشهای خود تنظیمی آینده باید اصلاح و به روز شوند تا فرد بتواند برای موفقیت در خود تنظیمی آینده در وضعیت بهتری قرار گیرد. به طوری که در شکل ۱۱۶ توضیح داده شده است خود تنظیمی یک فرایند جاری و چرخشی است زیمرمن (۲۰۰۰) و این موارد را شامل میشود آینده نگری (تعیین هدف برنامه ریزی راهبردی عمل تلاش برای هدف خویشتنداری و تأمل نظارت بر خود و ارزیابی خود که به آینده نگری بیشتر قبل از فرصت بعدی عملکرد منجر می شود. ماهیت جاری و چرخشی خود تنظیمی زمانی آشکار میشود که تأمل درباره موفقیت ها و شکست های خود تنظیمی فرد به آینده نگری جدید و بنابراین به خود تنظیمی مؤثرتر در آینده بینجامد. شکل ۱۱۶ مراحل چرخشی خود تنظیمی پرورش دادن خود تنظیمی شایسته تر هر کسی به خود تنظیمی می پردازد اما برخی افراد بهتر از دیگران از عهده آن بر می آیند. اکثر پژوهشگران خود تنظیمی را به صورت مهارت خود (self) مهارتی که باید فراگیری شود، بهبود یابد و اصلاح شود در نظر میگیرند شانک و زیمرمن (۱۹۹۷) خود تنظیمی به عنوان مهارت اکتسابی زمانی آشکارتر است که افراد هدف بلند مدتی را در زمینه ای نا آشنا دنبال کنند (مثل دانشجویی که برای اولین بار در کلاس ممتازی ثبت نام میکند کارمندی که شغل تازه ای را به طوری که در شکل ۷-۱۱ نشان داده شده است خود تنظیمی مستلزم توانایی

فرایند یادگیری اجتماعی نبود مهارت خوتنظیمی فرایند کامل تعیین هدف توسط خود فرد است. افزایش در شایستگی خود تنظیمی، عموماً در قالب فرایند یادگیری اجتماعی و در سطح مشاهده ای روی میدهد که طی آن، مشاهده گر نسبتاً مبتدی رفتار و بیانگریهای فرد نسبتاً ماهری را مشاهده می کند. این فرد مبتدی ابتدا از الگوی ماهر تقلید میکند به طوری که در شکل ۸-۱۱ نشان داده شده است و مشاهده در نهایت به تقلید می انجامد فرد مبتدی در مدت تقلید راهنمایی می شود و برای مؤثر بودن رفتارهای تقلیدی خود بازخورد اصلاحی دریافت میکند. تنظیم هایی در جهت خود تنظیمی مؤثرتر صورت میگیرند فرد مبتدی بعد از یک دوره راهنمایی و بازخورد اصلاحی معیارهای ممتاز بودن را که توسط الگو تأیید شده اند درونی سازی میکند فرد مبتدی سرانجام در آن زمینه خود تنظیم میشود و دیگر به الگوی ماهر نیازی ندارد و میتواند از نظر تعیین هدف تلاش برای هدف نظارت بر خود و ارزیابی خود خود تنظیم شود. برای مثال فرد مبتدی وقتی میخواهد یاد بگیرد چگونه نویسنده شایسته و خود تنظیمی شود سبک و معیارهای یک نویسنده ماهر را مشاهده و از آن تقلید میکند یاد میگیرد هدفهایی را تعیین کند راهبردهایی را تدوین نماید و قصدهایی را اجرا کند محیط فیزیکی را برای کمک به نگارش بازسازی کند و روشهایی را برای نظارت بر کار خود و ارزیابی آن فراگیری نماید زیمرمن و ریز مبرگ (۱۹۹۷) پرورش دادن خود تنظیمی شایسته به زمان و تمرین طولانی نیاز دارد. تمرین مستقل بسیار اهمیت دارد، اما نکته ای که در تمام نوشته ها درباره خود تنظیمی به آن اشاره می شود این است: اگر افراد یک مربی داشته باشند که نحوه تعیین

زیمرمن و ریز مبرگ، (۱۹۹۷) پرورش دادن خود تنظیمی شایسته به زمان و تمرین طولانی نیاز دارد. تمرین مستقل بسیار اهمیت دارد، اما نکته ای که در تمام نوشته ها درباره خود تنظیمی به آن اشاره می شود این است اگر

آنها این است که افراد بیشتر از ارضای به تأخیر افتاده که از هدفهای بلند مدت حاصل میشود، مجذوب ارضای فوری پاداش های کوتاه مدت میشوند رفتار تکانشی سریع و راحت است - صرفاً به جای اینکه به Scanned with CamScanner سر کار بروید تسلیم شوید و شیرینی بخورید الکل بنوشید و بازی ویدیویی کنید. مشکل این جذابیت های کوتاه مدت این است که اغلب با دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت، ناسازگار و حتی متضاد هستند. یعنی اگر بازی ویدیویی کنید به سختی میتوانید کار خود را به اتمام برسانید. جذابیت های کوتاه مدت این است که اغلب با دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت، ناسازگار و حتی متضاد هستند. یعنی اگر بازی ویدیویی کنید به سختی میتوانید کار

برای خوردن غذای سالم نه تنها باید میوه و سبزیجات بیشتری مصرف کنیم، بلکه به طور همزمان باید در برابر میل به خوردن کیک شکلاتی بستنی و هر چیز راحت دیگر بگیر و برو در فروشگاه مقاومت کنیم خویشتنداری توانایی جلوگیری مهار کردن و حتی نادیده گرفتن میل تکانشی به دنبال کردن هدف کوتاه مدت است بائر) و با میستر (۲۰۱۱) خویشتنداری توانایی قطع کردن گرایش ما به راهنمای خودکار و جذابیتهای کوتاه مدت و به جای آن هدایت کردن عمدی رفتار در مسیر هدف بلند مدت است. در سطح محاوره ای خویشتنداری نیروی اراده است. برای اینکه خویشتنداری را در عمل احساس کنید آزمایش تربچه را در نظر بگیرید با میستر بر اتسلاوسکی موراون و تایس (۱۹۹۸) شرکت کنندگان در گروه آزمایشی ابتدا تکلیفی را انجام میدهند که به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد در حالی که شرکت کنندگان در گروه گواه تکلیف مشابهی را انجام میدهند که به خویشتنداری نیاز ندارد بعداً، تمام شرکت کنندگان به تکلیف نامربوطی که به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد جابجا میشوند. فرضیه این است؛ چون خویشتنداری تحلیل برنده است خسته کننده پرزحمت شرکت کنندگانی که تکلیف اولیه خویشتنداری را انجام میدهند خسته میشوند و بنابراین در تکلیف خویشتنداری بعدی به طور نامناسب تر از شرکت کنندگان گروه گواه عمل می کنند. در تحقیق تربچه آزمایشگران از تمام شرکت کنندگان خواستند قبل از تحقیق، حداقل به مدت سه ساعت هیچ چیزی نخورند. وقتی شرکت کنندگان وارد آزمایشگاه شدند، آزمایشگران ترتیبی دادند تا بوی کیک شکلاتی که تازه پخته شده بود در هوا پخش شود. وقتی شرکت کنندگان نشستند تا تحقیق شروع شود جلوی آنها روی میز مقداری از آن کیک شکلاتی تازه و یک کاسه تربچه تازه قرار داشت برای شرکت کنندگان در گروه آزمایشی تکلیف خویشتنداری زیاد تعیین شده بود که در آن باید تربچه میخوردند و در برابر خوردن کیک شکلاتی مقاومت میکردند در حالی که برای شرکت کنندگان در گروه گواه چنین تکلیف خویشتنداری تعیین نشده بود و آنها میتوانستند هرچه میخواستند بخورند. بعد از پنج دقیقه شرکت کنندگان به اتاق دیگری برده شدند و چند مسئله هندسه به آنها داده شد که حل کردن آنها غیر ممکن بود (مثلاً، شکل هندسی را بدون ردیابی هر خط یا بلند کردن مداد از روی کاغذ دنبال کنید. آزمایش این بود که آزمودنیها قبل از دست کشیدن چه مدت مقاومت خواهند کرد. به طور میانگین شرکت کنندگانی که کیک شکلاتی خورده بودند به مدت ۱۹ دقیقه مقاومت کردند اما شرکت کنندگانی که تربچه خورده و جلوی میل به خوردن کیک شکلاتی را گرفته بودند، فقط ۸ دقیقه مقاومت کردند شرکت کنندگانی که تربچه خورده بودند، از سطح یکسان انرژی برای مقاومت در برابر مسائل دشوار برخوردار نبودند. متأسفانه زندگی تکلیف مداوم سعی در مقاومت کردن در برابر مسائلی است که با کیک شکلاتی تازه برابرند. اکنون پژوهشگران در حدود ۱۰۰ آزمایش با استفاده از الگوی پژوهشی که در فوق شرح داده شد انجام داده اند و هفت حوزه کلی خویشتنداری را مشخص کرده اند با میستر و وس ۲۰۰۷ ها گر وود استف و چانزیسار انتیس (۲۰۱۰) . جلوگیری از تکانه ها و امیال . مدیریت و جلوگیری از هیجانها . کنترل کردن و جلوگیری از افکار . کنترل کردن توجه . تصمیم گیری و انتخاب های زیاد . مدیریت اظهاری که فرد به دیگران بیان میکند . مهربان بودن با افراد پر توقع و دشوار و کنار آمدن با آنها در آزمایش های جداگانه ای درباره خویشتنداری پژوهشگران از شرکت کنندگان درخواست کردند با جلوگیری از تکانه ها و امیال مانند مقاومت در برابر شیرینی جات و غذاهای حاضر و آماده (وس، با میستر و سیاروچو (۲۰۰۵) و میل به مشروبخواری و کشیدن سیگار (موراون و شمولی (۲۰۰۶) خویشتنداری نشان دهند؛ با جلوگیری از واکنشهای هیجانی طبیعی مانند گریه نکردن در حال تماشای فیلم بسیار غم انگیز هیجانها را مدیریت کنند (موراون نایس و با میستر (۱۹۹۸) یا از واکنشهای انزجار در حال نگاه کردن به شینی آلوده جلوگیری کنند. دماری را بنسیون و پو (۲۰۰۶؛ با جلوگیری از افکار ناخواسته افکار را کنترل کنند (موراون تایس و با میستر (۱۹۹۸) با طولانی کردن استقامت در کلماتی که حفظ کردن آنها دشوار بود و انجام دادن تکالیف گوش به زنگی توجه را کنترل کنند وس و با میستر (۲۰۰۳)؛ در گزینه های جزئی و بی اهمیت مقدار زیادی تصمیم گیری و انتخاب کنند وس و همکاران، ۲۰۰۸)؛ با معرفی خود به صورت فردی شایسته و دوست داشتنی تأثیری که بر دیگران می گذارند مدیریت کنند (وس، با میستر و سیاروچی (۲۰۰۵) و با مؤدب بودن هنگام تعامل با افراد بسیار دشوار و پر توقع مهربان باشند فینکل و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) کاهش انرژی یافته های به دست آمده از آزمایش تربچه اشاره دارند که خویشتنداری بیش از یک مهارت است. خویشتنداری ذخیره انرژی است که به نظر می رسد فقط به مقدار محدود وجود دارد. افراد بعد از اعمال خویشتنداری به طور موقتی مقداری از توانایی خود را برای خویشتنداری آینده از دست میدهند. همچنین وقتی افراد توانایی خود را برای خویشتنداری از دست می دهند، به احتمال زیاد گرفتار امیال و وسوسه های تکانشی میشوند. این شیوه تفکر به ارائه مدل توان محدود خویشتنداری انجامیده است با میستر و همکاران ۲۰۰۷ موراون (۲۰۱۲) که میتوان آن را به صورت سه قضیه زیر بیان کرد: ۱ مقدار یا توان نیروی اراده برای خویشتنداری موفقیت آمیز حیاتی است. اعمال خویشتنداری مقداری از این منبع را کاهش می دهد و بنابراین تلاشهای بعدی برای خویشتنداری به احتمال زیاد شکست می خورند. چنین مدلی این سؤال را می طلبد که چه چیزی هنگام تلاشهای خویشتنداری کاهش می یابد. به نظر می رسد که پاسخ سوخت گلوکز مغز باشد گایلیوت و با میستر، ۲۰۰۷؛ گایلیوت و همکاران (۲۰۰۷) گلوکز در بدن از غذا ساخته میشود. هنگام گوارش این قند تولید و در جریان خون آزاد می شود و از آنجا به سمت عضلات قلب کند دستگاه ایمنی و مغز می رود. مغز مصرف کننده بزرگ انرژی است و حدود ۲۰ درصد از سوخت گلوکز بدن یعنی کالری ها را مصرف میکند. گلوکز عملاً وارد مغز نمی شود بلکه در عوض به چیزی که مغز مصرف میکند تبدیل می شود یعنی انتقال دهنده های عصبی اگر مغز بدون انتقال دهنده های عصبی بماند، در این صورت تفکر را متوقف میکند و اگر مغز تفکر را متوقف کند تکانشی تر می شود و کنترل اجرایی کمتری اعمال میکند تمام این زیست شناسی پیچیده به این درک ساده خلاصه می شود: «نبود گلوکز، نبود نیروی اراده با میستر و تیرنی ۲۰۱۱، ص ۴۹) اگر استدلال فوق درست باشد در این صورت افرادی که خویشتنداری اعمال میکنند باید کاهش چشمگیری در سطح گلوکز خود نشان دهند. پژوهش نشان می دهد که این دقیقاً همان چیزی است که اتفاق می افتد و علاوه بر آن کاهش گلوکز نسبتاً سریع و زیاد است گایلیوت و با میستر، ۲۰۰۷ گایلیوت و همکاران (۲۰۰۷) یعنی اگر شما از گلوکز در سطح «X» برخوردار باشید و بعد به تکلیف خویشتنداری مانند جلوگیری از یک هوس بپردازید. در این صورت به سرعت سطح گلوکز کمتر از X خواهید داشت. این کاهش گلوکز را به راحتی می توان به وسیله گلوکز سنج تأیید کرد. در آزمایش کاهش شرکت کنندگان به یک رشته تکالیف خویشتنداری پرداختند - یکی پس از دیگری گلوکز به طرز محسوسی کاهش یافت که به عملکرد ضعیف در تکلیف انجامید. وقتی به آزمودنی ها از قبل هشدار داده شد که آنها یک رشته تکالیف خویشتنداری انجام خواهند داد یعنی از شما درخواست خواهد شد تا سخت فکر کنید و تکانه را نادیده بگیرید، صرفاً انتظار خویشتنداری کافی بود تا گلوکز و عملکرد در تکلیف کاهش یابد موراون شمولی و بارکلی (۲۰۰۶) تکمیل انرژی خویشتنداری گلوکز را کاهش میدهد اما وقتی افراد از آن آگاه باشند، می توانند قبل از تکلیف خویشتنداری چالش انگیز یک لیوان آب پرتقال لیموناد یا شیر بستنی مملو از گلوکز بخورند. خویشتنداری چالش انگیز یک لیوان آب پرتقال لیموناد یا شیر بستنی مملو از گلوکز بخورند. انجام این کار به طور چشمگیری به افراد کمک میکند تا خویشتنداری مؤثری اعمال کنند (هاگر و همکاران (۲۰۱۰) لزومی ندارد که گلوکز از طریق نوشیدنی قند دار مصرف شود، بلکه این سریع ترین راه دریافت گلوکز برای مغز است به طوری که افراد دیابتی به شما خواهند گفت. غذاهایی که قند کم و پروتئین زیاد نیز دارند بادام ها میوه ها گوشت، پنیر به خوبی عمل میکنند ولی زمان بیشتری طول میکشد تا سوخت مغز را تولید کنند. این اثر غذایی باعث شد که پژوهشگران خویشتنداری به توصیه ای عملی برسند قبل از اینکه روز خود را که به مقدار زیادی خویشتنداری نیاز دارد آغاز کنید، صبحانه خوبی بخورید. خویشتنداری گلوکز را کاهش میدهد اما فقط زمانی این کار را انجام می دهد که خویشتنداری به معنی جلوگیری از میل کوتاه مدت جذابی باشد خوردن شیرینی جات، کشیدن سیگار بازی ویدیویی تا اینکه هدف بلند مدتی که جذابیت کمتری دارد، دنبال شود (مطالعه به مدت چند ساعت نوشتن فهرست طولانی از کارهای روزمره کنترل خشم هنگام یک مذاکره) جالب اینکه اگر ابتدا فرد در حالت خلق مثبت قرار داده شود مثلاً با تماشای فیلم خنده دار کاهش گلوکز و عملکرد ضعیف روی نمیدهند تایس با میستر شمولی و موراون (۲۰۰۷) همچنین وقتی افراد هدفهای بلندمدنی را دنبال میکنند که نیازهای روان شناختی خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط را ارضا میکنند کاهش گلوکز و عملکرد ضعیف روی نمی دهند (موراون (۲۰۰۸) در واقع دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدتی که نیاز روان شناختی را ارضا می کند به جای اینکه انرژی و عملکرد را کاهش دهد عملاً آنها را افزایش می دهد (مولان دسی و رایان ۲۰۰۶ موراون گاگن و روزمن (۲۰۰۸) نیرومندی خویشتنداری را میتوان از طریق تمرین نیز افزایش داد (با میستر، کایلیوت، دوال و اوتن (۲۰۰۶) برای مثال شرکت کنندگان به مدت دو هفته هر روز روی نظارت بر وضع اندامی و بهبود بخشیدن به آن یا زیر نظر گرفتن غذایی که هر روز

Ajouter un gestionnaire d'événements à votre scène pour détecter les clics de souris. 2. Utiliser le raycasting pour déterminer si un objet 3D a été cliqué. 3. Ouvrir une nouvelle fenêtre avec \`window.open()\` lorsque l'objet est cliqué. Voici un exemple de base de comment vous pourriez implémenter cela: \`\`\`javascript // Créer un raycaster pour détecter les clics sur des objets const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster(); const mouse = new THREE.Vector2(); // Fonction pour gérer les événements de clic de souris function onMouseClick(event) { // Convertir les coordonnées de la souris en espace normalisé mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1; mouse.y = - (event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1; // Mettre à jour le raycaster avec la position de la souris raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera); // Calculer les objets qui intersectent le rayon lancé const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true); if (intersects.length > 0) { // Pour cet exemple, nous prendrons simplement le premier objet intersecté const intersectedObject = intersects[0].object; // Vous pouvez vérifier l'identité de l'objet si nécessaire, par exemple en utilisant son nom if (intersectedObject.name === 'nomDeLobjet') { // Ouvrir une nouvelle fenêtre avec une URL spécifique window.open('http://votre-url-exemple.com', '_blank'); } } } // Ajouter l'écouteur d'événement pour détecter les clics de souris window.addEventListener('click', onMouseClick, false); \`\`\` N'oubliez pas d'ajouter cet écouteur après que vos objets soient ajoutés à la scène, et que la caméra est configurée. Remarque importante: l'utilisation de \`window.open()\` pour ouvrir de nouvelles fenêtres peut être bloquée par des bloqueurs de pop-up dans les navigateurs modernes si elle n'est pas déclenchée par une interaction de l'utilisateur. Dans cet exemple, c'est le clic de l'utilisateur qui déclenche l'ouverture de la fenêtre, donc cela devrait normalement fonctionner.

Chaque fois que l'utilisateur déplace la souris, l'événement \`mousemove\` est déclenché et la fonction \`onMouseMove\` que vous spécifiez est appelée. La fonction \`onMouseMove\` sera typiquement utilisée pour suivre la position de la souris et mettre à jour tout état ou animation en réponse à ce mouvement.

Cela peut affecter les performances si la logique dans la fonction \`onMouseMove\` est lourde. Il est souvent judicieux de limiter les calculs dans cette fonction pour garder une application fluide, surtout en 3D. Si votre intention est de l’utiliser avec Three.js pour réaliser des actions, telles que changer la couleur ou la taille d’un objet lorsque la souris passe au-dessus (hover), vous souhaiterez probablement gérer un système de \\"hover\\" d’objets en plus ou à la place de la détection des clics."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

شناختی خود به عنوان موضوع خود به عنوان دانا بازنمایی اکتسابی ساختار اجتماعی بر پایه بازخورد اجتماعی سؤال های اساسی : . من کیستم؟ . آیا ویژگی های مثبت دارم؟ چه تفاوتی دارم؟ عامل من نیروی انگیزشی خود به عنوان فرایند. خود به عنوان دانا موهبت طبیعی نیروی درونی که رفتار را آغاز می کند. سؤال های اساسی : . چه کسی می توانم بشوم؟ . اهداف من چیستند؟ . آیا اصیل هستم؟ ربط دادن خود به جامعه ما در جستجوی ربط دادن خود به جامعه به جایگاه خود در دنیای اجتماعی و اینکه چه نقشهای اجتماعی برای ما وجود دارند یا ندارند می اندیشیم. ما می پرسیم انقش من چیست؟ ربط دادن خود به جامعه نشان میدهد چگونه هویت رفتار را نیرومند و هدایت میکند و نگه میدارد جامعه از چند نظر در ترغیب افراد به دنبال کردن نقش ها یا حتی فراهم کردن آنها انعطاف ناپذیر است. اما جامعه از نظرات دیگر، انعطاف پذیر است. و در تعیین اینکه چه کسی همسر فرد خواهد بود و چه نقشهای اجتماعی اشغال خواهند شد (مثل دانش آموز مادر سیاستمدار معلم مقداری انتخاب و مسئولیت شخصی به فرد می دهد. خود به عنوان عامل پرورش دادن توانایی شخصی ما برای پرورش خود این موضوع را بررسی می کنیم که به چه چیزی علاقه داریم و نداریم تفاوت بین عمل ناشی از خود در برابر عمل ناشی از نیروهای خارج از خود را درک میکنیم میکوشیم هدف و معنی بیافرینیم میخواهیم استعدادهای خود را کشف کنیم و پرورش دهیم و وقت خود را صرف پرورش دادن برخی مهارت ها و روابط می کنیم. ما می پرسیم چه کسی میتوانم بشوم؟» و اهداف من كدام ند؟ کشف کردن و پرورش دادن توانایی خود عاملیت را منعکس میکند و به آن نیاز دارد. عاملیت یعنی عامل (خود قدرت و قصد عمل کردن را دارد و انگیزش ذاتی در خود را نشان می دهد. تنظیم خود ما در جستجوی تنظیم و مدیریت خود به توانایی هایمان می اندیشیم هدفهای بلند مدت را برای دنبال کردن تعیین میکنیم برنامه ها و راهبردها را اجرا میکنیم دستیابی به اهدافمان را زیر نظر میگیریم و برای رسیدن به اهداف بلند مدت مان تنظیم هایی را انجام می دهیم. ما میپرسیم آیا میتوانم کنترل شخصی اعمال کنم؟». مدیریت یا تنظیم خود نشان میدهد که چگونه خود تنظیمی احتمال عملکرد شایسته را بیشتر میکند. خود به جای اینکه به صورت تکانشی عمل کند میتواند ارضا را به تأخیر اندازد و جلوی پاداش های کوتاه مدت و وسوسه را بگیرد تا هدفهای بلند مدتی را دنبال کند که بزرگتر و خشنود کننده تر هستند. مسئله عزت نفس قبل از بحث درباره خود پنداره هویت عاملیت و خود تنظیمی مفید خواهد بود که قدری مکث کنیم و عقیده ای اساسی را به چالش بکشیم که خیلی از افراد آن را تأیید میکنند یعنی بهترین راه برای افزایش دادن انگیزش فرد بالا بردن عزت نفس اوست معلمان، کارفرمایان و مربیان همواره و با اشتیاق میگویند که روش با انگیزه کردن دانش آموزان کارمندان و ورزشکاران، بالا بردن عزت نفس آنهاست آنها را تحسین کنید به آنها پاداش بدهید به آنها تبریک بگویید کاری کنید که احساس خوبی در مورد خودشان داشته باشند و بعد ببینید که چه چیزهای شگفت آوری آشکار خواهند شد. عزت نفس بالا بسیار خوب است و برای مثال با شاد بودن همبستگی مثبت دارد دینر و دینر (۱۹۹۶) با این حال مسئله تقویت کردن عزت نفس به عنوان یک مداخله انگیزشی این است که تقریباً هیچ یافته ای وجود ندارد که نشان دهد عزت نفس اصلاً موجب چیزی شود. بلکه عزت نفس تحت تأثیر موفقیتها و شکستها قرار دارد… آنچه باید بهبود یابد، عزت نفس نیست بلکه بهبود بخشیدن به مهارتهای ما برای رسیدگی به دنیاست» (سلیگمن نقل شده 2. self-regulation در آذر (۱۹۹۴) به عبارت دیگر در رابطه بین عزت نفس و عملکرد خود، عملکرد خود علت است در حالی که عزت نفس فقط معلول است. عزت نفس اصولاً کارت امتیاز یا تابلوی امتیازی است برای گزارش دادن چگونه اوضاع در زندگی ما خوب یا بد پیش می روند (هلنمک و ون آکن، (۱۹۹۵) عزت نفس و پیشرفت با یکدیگر همبستگی مثبت دارند اما بالا رفتن عزت نفس موجب افزایش پیشرفت با بازدهی نمی شود؛ بلکه افزایش پیشرفت و بازدهی باعث می شوند. عزت نفس بالا برود هلمکون آکن ۱۹۹۵ مارش ۱۹۹۰ مارش و گراون، ۲۰۰۶؛ مارش و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) عزت نفس نشان میدهد که زندگی چگونه پیش می رود، اما منبع انگیزشی نیست که به افراد امکان دهد تا زندگی را خوب پیش ببرند. دلیلی وجود ندارد که نشان دهند. تقویت کردن عزت نفس افراد عملکرد آنها را بهتر خواهد کرد با میستر و همکاران (۲۰۰۳) فایده اصلی عزت نفس بالا این است که از خود (self) در برابر حالت عاطفی منفی مانند افسردگی و اضطراب محافظت میکند عزت نفس به افراد امکان میدهد تا احساس خوبی در مورد خودشان داشته باشند ولی آنها را برای انجام هیچ کاری با انگیزه نمی کند. اگر منطق فوق درست باشد در این صورت ارزش آن را دارد که بپرسیم چگونه جنبش عزت نفس در ابتدا آغاز شد. این جنبش در سال ۱۹۸۶ آغاز شد، زمانی که ایالت کالیفرنیا به عنوان راهبردی برای کاهش دادن رد شدن در مدرسه وابستگی به خدمات اجتماعی، جرم حاملگی ناخواسته و اعتیاد به مواد مخدر تصمیم گرفت عزت نفس تمام شهروندان را تقویت کند. منطق نهفته این بود که تقریباً تمام مشکلات روان شناختی تا عزت نفس پایین فرد قابل پیگیری هستند (براندن (۱۹۸۴) برنامه های تقویت عزت نفس با پیروی از این رهنمود (بدون فرگونه شواهد تجربی برای تأیید آن به شکل برنامه هایی نظیر Head ، Upward Bound و نمونه های دیگر وارد صحنه شدند. زمانی که پژوهش Early Training Project. Star تجربی به این برنامه ها رسیدگی کرد تا اثر بخشی آنها را ثابت کند نتایج نشان دادند که این رنامه ها نتوانستند مشکلات اجتماعی را که قانون گذاران ایالت کالیفرنیا مشخص کرده بودند. رطرف کنند با میستر و همکاران ۲۰۰۳؛ داوس ۱۹۹۶؛ سوان ۱۹۹۶)، عزت نفس بالا که زار بود در این برنامه های افزایش عزت نفس ترویج داده شوند، خیالی و ناپایدار بودند. در پایان بهترین نتیجه ای که میتوانیم بگیریم این است که عزت نفس چیزی شبیه شادکامی است. سعی در شادکام بودن باعث نمی شود که خیلی موفق شوید، بلکه شادکامی پیامد Scanned with CamScanner خشنودی ها پیروزی ها و روابط مثبت زندگی است دیتر و بیزواز دیتر (۲۰۰۸) همین طور عزت نفس صرفاً پیامد عملکرد انطباقی و تمریخش خود (self) است. خود پنداره خود پنداره بازنمایی های ذهنی افراد از خودشان است. همانگونه که افراد از دیگران مکانها و وقایع، بازنمایی های ذهنی دارند از خودشان نیز بازنمایی ذهنی دارند. خود پنداره از تجربه ها و از فکر کردن به این تجربه ها ساخته می شود. افراد برای ساختن خودپنداره به بازخوردی توجه میکنند که در امور روزمره خود می گیرند. که صفات ویژگیها و ترجیحات آنها را آشکار می سازند عناصر اصلی که افراد از آنها برای ساختن و توصیف خود استفاده میکنند از تجربه های خاص زندگی به دست می آیند. مانند موارد زیر . هنگام بحث گروهی احساس ناراحتی و نگرانی کردم . در سفر علمی مدرسه به باغ وحش زیاد حرف نزدم هنگام صرف ناهار از نشستن کنار دیگران خودداری کردم. افراد در مواقع فکر کردن صدها تجربه زندگی را به یاد نمی آورند، بلکه با گذشت زمان تجربه های خاص خود را به یک بازنمایی کلی از خود تبدیل میکنند (مثلاً، با توجه به تجربه های فروخورده ام در گروه ها در باغ وحش و هنگام صرف ناهار خودم را به صورت خجالتی برداشت میکنم همین نتیجه گیری کلی من خجالتیام و نه تجربه های خاص در گروه ها در باغ وحش و هنگام صرف ناهار است که افراد به یاد می آورند و از آنها برای ساختن و توصیف خود پنداره استفاده میکنند (مارکوس (۱۹۷۷) خود طرحواره ها خود طرحواره ها نتیجه گیریهای شناختی درباره خود هستند که زمینه خاصی دارند و از تجربه های گذشته آموخته میشوند مارکوس ۱۹۷۷ (۱۹۸۳) نتیجه گیری قبلی من 1. self-concept خجالتی ام بیانگر خود طرحواره است. خجالتی بودن هم زمینه خاص است روابط با دیگران) و هم از تجربه های گذشته آموخته شده است هنگام بحثهای گروهی سفرهای علمی گفتگوها به هنگام صرف ناهار خجالتی بودن بیانگر خود پنداره نیست، بلکه خود (self) را در یک زمینه خاص نشان میدهد - روابط فرد با دیگران در ورزشها یک دانش آموز دبیرستانی با در نظر گرفتن تجربه های هفته گذشته و یادآوری ترک کردن دو ۱۶۰۰ متر به علت خستگی و بارها برخورد با مانع هنگام پرش از آن، یک خود طرحواره با زمینه خاص تشکیل میدهد. با این حال همین دانش آموز در زمینه متفاوتی ممکن است به یاد بیاورد که در امتحان نمره بالایی گرفته است به تمام سؤال های معلم جواب داده است و شعری سروده که برای چاپ در نشریه مدرسه پذیرفته شده است. سرانجام، اگر تجربه ها در ورزش و در کلاس به قدر کافی مستمر و مکرر باشند این دانش آموز درباره خود نتیجه خواهد گرفت که در ورزشها عمدتاً بی کفایت اما در مدرسه ماهر است. این نتیجه گیری ها از لحاظ ورزشی نالایق از لحاظ عقلانی باهوش خود طرحواره های زمینه خاص دیگری را تشکیل می دهند. خود پنداره مجموعه ای از طرحواره های زمینه خاص است خود طرحواره هایی که در توصیف خودپنداره درگیرند آن دسته از زمینه های زندگی هستند که بیشترین اهمیت را برای فرد دارند مارکوس (۱۹۷۷) برای مثال زمینه های مهم در دوران کودکی، معمولاً شایستگی شناختی شایستگی جسمانی پذیرش همسالان و سلوک رفتاری هستند. در نوجوانی زمینه های عمده زندگی عموماً شایستگی تحصیلی شایستگی ورزشی، ظاهر جسمانی پذیرش همسالان روابط دوستی صمیمی جاذبه رمانتیک سلوک رفتاری یا اخلاقیات هستند هارتر (۱۹۹۰) در دانشگاه زمینه های عمده زندگی عبارت اند از شایستگی تحصیلی توانایی عقلانی شایستگی شغلی شایستگی ورزشی ظاهر جسمانی پذیرش همسالان روابط دوستی نزدیک روابط رمانتیک روابط با والدین اخلاقیات و حس شوخ طبعی هارتر ۱۹۹۰؛ نیمان و هارتر (۱۹۸۶) زمینه های خاص زندگی از فردی به فرد دیگر تفاوت دارند، اما این زمینه ها ساختار مرتبط با سن خود پنداره را نشان می دهند. ویژگیهای انگیزشی خود طرحواره ها خود طرحواره ها به دو صورت انگیزش به وجود می آورند. اول اینکه خود طرحواره ها بعد از اینکه تشکیل شدند رفتار فرد را طوری هدایت میکنند که بازخورد هماهنگ با خود طرحواره های تشکیل شده را فراخوانی میکنند یعنی چون فرد خود را خجالتی می داند. رفتار آینده اش را در زمینه های بین فردی به گونه ای هدایت میکند تا بازخوردی را به وجود آورد که خودانگاره من خجالتی ام را تأیید کند. افراد خجالتی بازخورد اجتماعی را می خواهند و از آن احساس راحتی میکنند که تأیید کند آنها خجالتی هستند درست مانند افراد شوخ طبعی که بازخورد اجتماعی را میخواهند و از آن احساس راحتی میکنند که تأیید کند آنها شوخ طبع هستند. در مقابل بازخوردی که با خود طرحواره تشکیل شده ناسازگار است، تنش انگیزشی ناشی از ناسازگاری و عدم تأیید خود به وجود می آورد که به مقاومت و استدلال مخالف می انجامد. مفهوم اساسی در پس هماهنگی خود طرحواره ها این است که اگر به فردی گفته شود درونگر است در حالی که خودش معتقد است برونگر است این بازخورد متضاد تنش انگیزشی ایجاد میکند این تنش فرد را برای بازگرداندن هماهنگی با انگیزه میکند. بنابراین افراد برای پیشگیری از احساس تنش انگیزشی ناخوشایند به صورت هماهنگ با خود طرحواره رفتار میکنند اگر این پیشگیری مؤثر واقع نشود در این صورت افراد طوری رفتار میکنند که بازخورد تازه ای را به وجود آورد تا هماهنگی خود طرحواره را به حال اول برگرداند. خود طرحواره ها همچنین برای پیش بردن خود موجود به سمت خود مطلوب آینده انگیزش به وجود می آورند خود آرمانی ممکن خیلی شبیه فرایند ایجاد ناهمخوانی در تعیین هدف رفتار هدف گرا را آغاز میکند بنابراین دانش آموزی که میخواهد هنرپیشه شود، هر اقدامی را که برای پیش بردن خود از دانش آموز بودن به هنرپیشه» شدن لازم است آغاز می کند. دانش آموز خود موجود در حالی که هنر پیشه خود آرمانی را تشکیل می دهد. جستجوی خودهای ممکن نوعی فرایند تعیین هدف است که تغییر و تحول خودپنداره را می طلبد در حالی که جستجوی نظر خودانگاره باثبات نوعی فرایند تأیید است که پایداری خود پنداره را حفظ می کند. خود باثبات بعد از اینکه فرد خود طرحواره روشنی را در زمینه خاصی تشکیل داد، به طور کلی برای حفظ کردن خود انگاره عمل میکند خود طرحواره ها بعد از تشکیل به طور فزاینده ای در برابر اطلاعات مغایر مقاوم میشوند مارکوس ۱۹۸۳،۱۹۷۷) افراد با جستجوی فعال اطلاعات هماهنگ با خودپنداره شان و با نادیده گرفتن اطلاعات مغایر با خود انگاره شان خود باثبات را حفظ میکنند. اعتقاد داشتن به اینکه یک چیز درباره خود درست است ولی به فرد گفته شود که در واقع برعکس آن صحت دارد، از لحاظ روان شناختی ناراحت کننده است. آشفتگی سیاستمداری که انتخاب محلی را می بازد یا آشفتگی قهرمان ورزشی را که برای رتبه بندی حرفه ای انتخاب نمی شود، تجسم کنید. نا هماهنگی و مغایرت نوعی ناراحتی هیجانی تولید میکنند که خبر می دهد ثبات باید به حال اول برگردانده شود. همین حالت عاطفی منفی است که انگیزش جستجوی اطلاعات و بازخورد تأیید خود و اجتناب از عدم تأیید خود را به وجود می آورد. برای اینکه مطمئن شویم دیگران ما را به همان صورت خودمان در نظر میگیرند از علائم و نمادهایی استفاده میکنیم که اعلام میدارند ما کیستیم یا فکر میکنیم هستیم. نمونه هایی از این گونه علائم و نمادها ظواهری هستند که از طریق پوشاک عادات غذایی، وزنه برداری جراحی پلاستیک و حتی اموال و نوع اتومبیلی که سوار میشویم در خود جسمانی خویش انتقال می دهیم. به علاوه برای حفاظت از خود طرحواره عمداً تعامل با افرادی را انتخاب میکنیم که با ما به صورت هماهنگ با خودانگاره مان رفتار کنند و از افرادی که طوری با ما برخورد می کنند که با خود انگاره مان هماهنگ نیست اجتناب میکنیم فرایندی که با عنوان تعامل گزینشی به آن شاره شده است رابینسون و اسمیت - لاوین، ۱۹۹۲ ،سوان پلهام و کرول، ۱۹۸۹) با انتخاب دوستانی که خود انگاره ما را تأیید میکنند و فاصله گیری از کسانی که خود انگاره ما را نفی می کنند، احتمال بازخورد تأیید کننده خود را افزایش داده و احتمال بازخورد نفی کننده خود را کاهش میدهیم تعامل گزینشی توضیح میدهد که چرا دوستان هم اتاقی ها، مربیان، معلمان نمبازی ها و همسران خاصی را انتخاب میکنیم - یعنی به دلیل اینکه از تعامل های اجتماعی رای حفظ و تأیید خودانگاره مان استفاده میکنیم (سوان (۱۹۸۷) تعامل گزینشی همچنین رضیح می دهد که چرا افراد رابطه ای را که در آن طرف مقابل آنها را به صورت متفاوت با بودشان در نظر میگیرد قطع میکنند مثلاً در طلاق فرد به وسیله ازدواج با شخصی به جای شخص دیگر تعامل با همسری را انتخاب میکند که منبع بازخورد برای ثبات خود باشد و با طلاق گرفتن از همسر خود ممکن است منبع بازخورد ناسازگار با خود را حذف کند. با وجود اقدامات پیشگیرانه گاهی بازخورد ناسازگار با خود روی می دهد همان گونه که برای سیاستمدار و ورزشکار روی داد اولین دفاع برای حفظ کردن خود باثبات تحریف اطلاعات است تا اینکه از حالت ناسازگار خارج شود. وقتی فردی با بازخورد ناسازگار با خود طرحواره روبرو میشود ممکن است بپرسد آیا بازخورد معتبر است، آیا منبع بازخورد قابل اعتماد است و این بازخورد تا چه اندازه ای مهم یا مناسب است. برای مثال دانشجویی که خود انگاره باهوش بودن دارد ولی در یک درس رد میشود ممکن است این بازخورد را نپذیرد و علیه (۱) اعتبار آن (۲) قضاوت استاد و (۳) اهمیت یا تناسب آن دلیل بیاورد. افراد همچنین با نخوت جبرانی تأیید خود و رفتارهای جدید برای تأیید خودانگاره خویش با بازخورد نفی کننده مقابله می کنند. تأیید خود در برابر تغییر خود پنداره اطمینان فرد از اینکه خود طرحواره او معتبر و درست است اطمینان از خودپنداره را تشکیل می دهد. در صورتی که اطمینان از خود پنداره زیاد باشد خود طرحواره ها را محکم میکند. بازخورد ناسازگار به ندرت خود طرحواره باثبات را تغییر میدهد با این حال چنانچه اطمینان از خود پنداره کم باشد بازخورد ناسازگار میتواند سرانجام موجب تغییر خود طرحواره شود. تعارض بین خود طرحواره نامطمئن و بازخورد ناسازگار بحران تأیید خود را برانگیخته می کند (سوان، ۱۹۸۳، ۱۹۹۹). فرایند نسبتاً پیچیده تأیید خود در شکل ۲-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. به طوری که در بالای این شکل نشان داده شده است افراد با بازنمایی خود خود طرحواره و ترجیح بازخورد تأیید کننده خود شروع میکنند. وقتی افراد به صورت علنی علائم و نمادهای چه کسی هستند (خودانگاره شان را آشکار می سازند تعامل اجتماعی روزمره آنها جریان یکنواخت تأیید خود را به وجود می آورد. فقط بعد از پدیدار شدن بازخورد اجتماعی ناسازگار با خود اوضاع شروع به پیچیده شدن می کند. افراد اطلاعات ناسازگار با خود ملایم را تقریباً خوب تحمل می کنند. ولی، تأثیر بازخورد نیرومند نفی کننده خود به راحتی پذیرفته نمی شود تأثیر چنین بازخوردی به اطمینان از خود پنداره بستگی دارد. وقتی اطمینان از خود پنداره کم باشد شکل ۲-۱۱ را ببینید)، بازخورد فصل ۱۱ ٫ خود و تلاشهای آن نیرومند می تواند بر خود طرحواره از پیش موجود غلبه کرده و تغییر خود پنداره را برانگیخته کند. با این حال چنانچه اطمینان از خودپنداره زیاد باشد در برابر بازخورد نیرومند مقاومت صورت میگیرد و فقط به عنوان یک قطعه اطلاعات جزئی ارزیابی می شود. جالب ترین مورد از لحاظ رشدی زمانی اتفاق می افتد که اطمینان از خودپنداره متوسط باشد. وقتی اطمینان از خود پنداره متوسط باشد و فرد با بازخورد نیرومند ناسازگار با خود روبرو می شود، بحران تأیید خود را تجربه خواهد کرد. فرد هنگام بحران تأیید خود قضاوت را به تأخیر می اندازد و بازخورد بیشتری را جستجو میکند اگر بازخورد بیشتر خیلی متقاعد کننده باشد بحران تأیید خود خودانگاره را تغییر نمی دهد بلکه در عوض، اطمینان از خود پنداره را پایین می آورد. همین اطمینان کم از خودپنداره است که باعث میشود فرد در برابر تغییر خود پنداره در آینده مستعد شود. توجه داشته باشید که تنها مسیر به سمت تغییر خود پنداره از طریق اطمینان کم به خود پنداره است که در سمت راست شکل ۲-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. قبل از اینکه خود پنداره تغییر کند (۱) اطمینان از خود پنداره باید پایین باشد و (۲) بازخورد ناسازگار با خود باید قوی و واضح باشد - یعنی رد کردن آن دشوار باشد (شوان، ۱۹۸۷) ناسازگار با خود باید قوی و واضح باشد - یعنی رد کردن آن دشوار باشد (شوان، ۱۹۸۷) گرچه خود پنداره میتواند تغییر کند ولی تغییر استثناست نه قاعده تغییر خود پنداره به ندرت صورت میگیرد در حالی که تأیید خود و ثبات خود پنداره رایج هستند. چرا افراد خود را تأیید میکنند؟ افراد به دلایل شناختی دانشی و عملی بازخورد تأیید خود را ترجیح می دهند. از نظر شناختی افراد به این دلیل خود را تأیید میکنند که میخواهند خودشان را بشناسند (با) خودشان صادق باشند در رابطه با مسائل دانشی افراد به این دلیل جویای تأیید خود هستند که تأیید خود برداشت از دنیا را به صورت پیش بینی پذیر و منسجم تقویت میکند (سوان و پلهام (۲۰۰۲) از لحاظ عملی افراد به این علت خود را تأیید می کنند که دوست دارند از تعامل هایی اجتناب ورزند که ممکن است آکنده از سوء تفاهم ها و انتظارات نامعقول باشند؛ آنها جویای تعامل با افرادی هستند که میدانند چه انتظاری از آنها داشته باشند (سوان، ۱۹۹۲ ۱۹۹۹؛ سوان و پلهام (۲۰۰۲) 1. epistemic شکل ۲-۱۱ فرایندهای زیربنای تأیید خود و تغییر خود پنداره خودهای ممکن گاهی خود طرحواره ها در پاسخ به بازخورد اجتماعی تغییر میکنند (شکل ۲-۱۱) اما خود طرحواره ها به احتمال بیشتری به شیوه عمدی تغییر میکنند تغییر خود طرحواره می تواند از طریق تلاش عمدی برای پیش بردن خود موجود به سمت خود ممکن مطلوب در آینده روی دهد. خودهای ممکن نظر افراد را درباره آنچه دوست دارند بشوند و همچنین آنچه می ترسند ممکن است بشوند منعکس می سازند مارکوس و نوریوس، ۱۹۸۶؛ مارکوس و رولو، (۱۹۸۹) برای مثال برخی از خودهای مورد نظر ممکن است خود موفق خود خلاق خود ثروتمند خود لاغر یا خود محبوب باشند؛ برخی از خودهایی که فرد از آنها واهمه دارد ممکن است خود بیکار خود معلول خود چاق یا خود طرد شده باشند. اینکه چگونه ممکن است فردی از خود فعلی به خود ممکن مطلوب در آینده پیشرفت کند. در شکل ۳-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. خودهای ممکن عمدتاً منشأ اجتماعی دارند، به طوری که فرد خودهایی را مشاهده میکند که توسط دیگران الگو قرار داده می شوند (مارکوس و نوریوس (۱۹۸۶) فرد خود فعلی خویش را به صورت خود موجود می بیند و الگوی نقش را به صورت خود آرمانی مطلوب آینده در نظر میگیرد وقتی فرد این اختلاف را می بیند. استنباط می کند که او نیز میتواند مانند الگوی نقش موفق در آینده موفق باشد. برای اینکه این اتفاق روی دهد فرد ویژگیها مهارتها و تواناییهای خود را با ویژگی ها مهارت ها و توانایی های الگوی نقش مقایسه میکند. این مقایسه ها حالت انگیزشی ناهماهنگی ایجاد می کنند. فرد برای رفع این ناهماهنگی تلاش میکند برنامه ریزی راهبردی می کند و ابتکار عمل لازم را به خرج میدهد تا خود فعلی را ارتقا دهد و بیشتر شبیه خود ممکن مطلوب شود. برای مثال، امکان دارد کودکی نوازندگانی را در یک کنسرت مشاهده و آرزو کند خواننده شود. خودهای ممکن بیانگر خود آینده هستند بنابراین خود ممکن از لحاظ انگیزشی مانند هدف عمل میکند خود ممکن به عنوان هدف - مانند حالت مطلوب در آینده - همانند تمام هدفها به صورت نیرویی قدرتمند عمل میکند؛ یعنی با افزایش دادن تلاش استقامت متمرکز کردن توجه و برنامه ریزی راهبردی به فصل ۸ مراجعه کنید. خودهای ممکن قطعه مهمی را به معمای چگونه خود رشد می کند، می افزایند. خودهای ممكن اصولاً بازنمایی های ذهنی ویژگیها صفات و تواناییهایی هستند که خود هنوز از آنها برخوردار نیست مثلاً، من دوست دارم پزشک شوم هر چند درباره آناتومی انسان با فنون جراحی آگاهی زیادی ندارم فردی که خود ممکنی را دنبال می کند کمتر بر 1. present self فصل ۱۱ ٫ خود و تلاشهای آن خود طرحواره های موجود و بیشتر بر خود مورد نظر اتکا میکند و سؤالهایی از این قبیل را می پرسد: اگر قرار باشد به خود ممکنم تبدیل شوم چگونه باید رفتار کنم؟ چه فعالیت هایی را باید دنبال کنم؟ به چه آموزشی نیاز دارم؟ به طوری که این سؤالها اشاره دارند، پیش بردن خود به سمت خود آرمانی نه تنها ایجاب میکند که برای خود ممکن تلاش شود، بلکه همچنین راهبردهای مؤثری برای رسیدن به آن ضرورت دارند. مفهوم خودهای ممکن خود را به صورت هستی پویا که گذشته، حال و آینده دارد، ترسیم می کند. فردی که در زمینه خاصی خود ممکن ندارد از مبنای شناختی مهم برای پرورش دادن توانایی ها در آن زمینه بی بهره است (کراس) و مارکوس (۱۹۹۴) شاید بتوانید به تلاش های گذشته خودتان که صرف چند درس مختلف دانشگاهی کردید نگاهی بیندازید و این سؤال ها را از خود بپرسید بود در برابر نبود خود ممکن در تعیین اینکه برای خواندن این کتاب حضور یافتن در کلاس و ثبت نام آن تلاش کردم چه نقشی را ایفا کرد؟ بخشی از دلیل تلاش زیاد استقامت، توجه متمرکز و برنامه ریزی راهبردی شما در یک درس خاص را می توان به وجود خود ممکن مهمی ربط داد؛ همان گونه که بخشی از دلیل اینکه چرا برای درس دیگری در دانشگاه تلاش استقامت توجه و برنامه ریزی راهبردی نداشتید می تواند به نبود خود ممکن ربط داشته باشد. فعالیتها و پیامدهای درسی روزمره از لحاظ انگیزشی مهم هستند (مثل موضوع درس بازخورد موفقیت ٫ شکست ولی بود در برابر نبود خود ممکن، چشم انداز آینده ای را اضافه میکند که به مشارکت انگیزش مبتنی بر آینده در فعالیت امروز، اشاره دارد. هویتی هویت پدیده جامعه شناختی و روان شناختی است اکسلز (۲۰۰۹)، از لحاظ جامعه شناختی هویت جایگاه با نقش فرد در جامعه است. از لحاظ روان شناختی هویت این است که آیا نقش با جایگاه اجتماعی با توصیف اجتماعی درست احساس میشود و با خود پنداره فرد ارتباط مناسبی دارد یا اینکه از نظر ناهمخوانی بین خودپنداره و نقش اجتماعی، غلط احساس می شوده (اویسر من و دستین (۲۰۱۱) انگار که فرد ۱۰۰ عکس مختلف را می بیند که افراد را در 1. identity نقش های اجتماعی مختلف نشان میدهند مثل معلم ،پلیس راننده تاکسی، کشیش و قضاوت می کند که این یکی درست احساس میشود و آن یکی غلط احساس می شوده و الی آخر هویت وسیله ای است که خود توسط آن با جامعه ارتباط برقرار می کند، به طوری که ماهیت فرد را در زمینه فرهنگی نشان میدهد فرهنگها و گروه های اجتماعی انواع هویت ها را ارائه می دهند که اعضای آنها ممکن است اختیار کنند یعنی نقشهای اجتماعی) و ممکن است از لحاظ روان شناختی با آن ارتباط برقرار کنند یعنی ارزشهای روان شناختی، وقتی فرد نقشی را بر عهده می گیرد مثل دانش آموز مادر فروشنده موسیقیدان با ارتباط اجتماعی برقرار می کند مثل لیبرال محیط گرا از آن پس آن هویت از فرد میخواهد رفتارهایی را آشکار سازد رفتارهای تأیید کننده هویت و در عین حال از رفتارهای دیگر اجتناب کند رفتارهای نفی کننده هویت، بنابراین هویتها به این دلیل مهم هستند که وقتی احساس شود رفتار با هویت هماهنگ است طبیعی و درست احساس میشود زیرا هویت را تأیید و آن را ابراز می کند و وقتی رفتار با هویت ناهماهنگ است غیر عادی و غلط احساس می شود (اوپسرمن، ۲۰۰۷) نقش ها نقش، انتظارات فرهنگی برای رفتار از فردی است که جایگاه اجتماعی خاصی دارد. هر یک از ما چند جایگاه نقش) اجتماعی داریم و اینکه در هر لحظه معینی چه نقشی را بر عهده بگیریم به موقعیتی که در آن قرار داریم و افرادی که با آنها تعامل میکنیم بستگی دارد. برای مثال، در دانشگاه که با دانشجویان دیگر و استاد تعامل میکنید نقش دانشجو» را بر عهده می گیرید. وقتی دانشگاه را ترک میکنید و به محل کار خود در کلینیک روان شناسی می روید. نقشی که بر عهده میگیرید تغییر میکند و وقتی با مراجعان تعامل میکنید، نقش مشاور» را می پذیرید. در خانه وقتی نقش مادر یا پدر را بر عهده میگیرید که با یک دختر» تعامل می کند نقش شما و نقشهای افرادی که با آنها تعامل می کنید، تغییر می کنند. وقتی افراد نقشی را به جای نقش دیگر بر عهده میگیرند شیوه عمل خود را تغییر می دهند. آنها موضوع گفتگو واژگانی که به کار میبرند لحن صدا و غیره را تغییر می دهند. با اینکه ماری هنوز همان فرد است ولی وقتی خود را به جای «مادر» در نقش «استاد» می باید به شیوه متفاوتی گفتگو می کند. ارتباطها با گروه های اجتماعی افراد علاوه بر نقش های اجتماعی با گروه های اجتماعی مانند وابستگی های مشترک من کاتولیک هستم، تمایلات مشترک من طرفدار فوتبال هستم و عقاید و ارزشهای مشترک من طرفدار محیط زیست هستم ارتباطهایی دارند. این ارتباطها به جای اختیار کردن نقش های اجتماعی تأیید ارزشهای روان شناختی هستند وقتی افراد ارتباط های خود را با گروه های اجتماعی در نظر میگیرند برخی از این ارتباطها را می پذیرند در حالی که برخی دیگر را رد میکنند - فرایند تشکیل هویت را تجربه میکنند سوئنز و همکاران ۲۰۱۱) این فرایند انتخاب کردن کدام هویتها جذب خود شوند و کدام هویتهای دیگر رد شوند، چالش رشدی دشواری است اما پاسخی را به سؤال اساسی خود برای فرد تأمین می کند: «چگونه خود را به جامعه ربط می دهم؟». افراد برای پاسخ دادن به این سؤال هویت به سطوح مختلف کاوش و تعهد نسبت به این هویتهای ممکن میپردازند که به آنها علاقه دارند و برای آنها مهیا هستند. برخی افراد سبک اطلاعاتی را اختیار میکنند که به موجب آن گزینه ها و امکانات مرتبط با هویت خود را جستجو و آنها را به صورت انتقادی ارزشیابی میکنند در حالی که افراد دیگر سبک هنجاری را اختیار می کنند که در آن به انتظارات و تجویزهای کسانی را که به آنها احترام میگذارند، متکی می شوند. این سبک های مختلف به این دلیل مهم هستند که توضیح میدهند چرا برخی افراد هویت اصیل، پیچیده و کاملاً منسجمی دارند یعنی آنهایی که سبک اطلاعاتی دارند، در حالی که دیگران هویت های نه چندان اصیل و تکه پاره دارند یعنی آنهایی که سبک هنجاری دارند و این تمایز اشاراتی برای بهزیستی فرد دارد لین ویل ۱۹۸۷؛ رایان لا گاردیا و راستورن (۲۰۰۵) موقعیت ها هویتهای خاص را برجسته میکنند هویتی که ما اختیار میکنیم تا اندازه ای به موقعیتی که خود را در آن می یابیم، بستگی دارد. بنابراین فرد در خانه مادر» است اما در اداره رئیس است. افراد چند هویت دارند، بنابراین اینکه کدام هویت رفتار جاری را هدایت کند تا اندازه ای بستگی دارد به اینکه زمینه موقعیتی کدام هویت را برجسته کرده باشد. مداخله هایی مانند مداخله از مدرسه تا شغل به دانش آموزان کمک میکنند از هویتی که در موقعیت بسیار آشنا و کاملاً تعریف شده (مدرسه) داشتند به هویت وقعیت نه چندان آشنا و نه چندان تعریف شده (کار) انتقال یابند اویر من و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) عاملیت خود از ساختارهای شناختی خودپنداره عمیق تر است خود از انگیزش درونی نیز برخوردار است که کیفیت عاملیت به آن میدهد (رایان (۱۹۹۳) عاملیت مستلزم علیت و عمل شخصی است دچارمز (۱۹۸۷) عاملیت بیانگر نظری درباره خود به صورت عمل و رشد از درون به عنوان فرایندها و انگیزشهای فطری است (دمی و رایان (۱۹۹۱) خود به عنوان عمل و رشد از درون در فصل ۶ درباره نیازهای روان شناختی ارگانیز می خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط بحث کردیم - نیازهایی که نیروی انگیزشی طبیعی برای پرورش عاملیت یعنی ابتکار عمل، عمل) فراهم می کنند. این نیازهای روان شناختی به طور جدایی ناپذیری با ماهیت فعال خود رشد کننده هماهنگ هستند دسی و رایان (۱۹۹۱) و منبع انگیزش زیربنای عاملیت را تشکیل می دهند. (یعنی دنبال کردن تمایلات جستجوی چالشهای محیطی به کار بردن مهارت ها و پرورش دادن استعدادها برای پی بردن به توانایی پرورش دادن آن و تحقق بخشیدن به آن). تمایز و یکپارچگی تمایز و یکپارچگی دو فرایند رشد فطری در خود (self) هستند. تمایز خود (self) را به صورت هستی به طور فزاینده ای پیچیده گسترش میدهد یکپارچگی این هستی پیچیده را در یک کل منسجم ترکیب میکند و به این ترتیب از خود پنداره منفرد و منسجم محافظت می نماید. تمایز زمانی صورت میگیرد که فرد از تمایلات ترجیحات و توانایی های خود به شیوه ای استفاده کند که خود نسبتاً کلی و نامتمایز در چند زمینه زندگی تخصص یابد. به عنوان مثال سابقه خود را در نظر بگیرید که یاد گرفتید تمام کامپیوترها تمام ورزشها، تمام سیاستمداران و تمام مذاهب همانند نیستند. تمایز جزئی خودش را در سادگی آشکار می سازد که در آن فرد فقط درک تک بعدی از زمینه دانش خاصی دارد تمایز غنی خودش را در درک تمایزهای دقیق و جنبه های منحصر به فرد زمینه خاصی از زندگی آشکار می سازد. انگیزش درونی تمایلات و نیازهای روان شناختی به صورت پیشتازانه خود را برای تعامل با دنیا به شیوه ای نیرومند می سازند که زمینه برای متمایز شدن آن به موجودیتی بسیار پیچیده 1. agency آماده شود. برای مثال کودکی که به هواپیماهای مدل علاقه دارد کاتالوگ ها را بررسی می کند. به باشگاه های مدل سازی میرود درباره ساختن مدل با همسالان خود صحبت می کند. مشترک مجله ای درباره آن میشود مواد جدید و روشهای ساختن گوناگون را امتحان میکند و در حال یادگیری مهارتهای تخصصی را پرورش میدهد. این انگیزش درونی خود است که به آن عاملیتی را میدهد که برای بررسی کاتالوگها رفتن به باشگاه مدل سازی، صحبت با همسالان و غیره به آن نیاز دارد و همین جریان تجربه جاری و عاملیت است که امکان تمایز و پیچیده شدن را به خود می دهد. تمایز به صورت کاهش ناپذیر پیچیدگی خود را گسترش نمیدهد، بلکه برای یکپارچگی پیچیدگی خود در خودپنداره واحد و وحدتی منسجم نوعی گرایش ترکیبی وجود دارد. یکپارچگی فرایندی سازمان دهنده است که اجزای متمایز خود را به صورت یک کل منسجم کنار هم قرار میدهد به جای اینکه خود با دهها خود طرحواره نامرتبط با حتی تا اندازه ای ناسازگار باقی بماند آن را به صورت خود پنداره واحدی در می آورد. مفاهیم عاملیت از طریق انگیزش درونی نمایز و یکپارچگی اعلام می دارند که خود از جنبه های فطری برخوردار است نیازهای روان شناختی و فرایندهای رشد نقطه شروعی را برای پرورش خود تأمین میکنند. وقتی افراد بالغ میشوند تماس بیشتری با موقعیت اجتماعی برقرار میکنند و برخی از این جنبه های دنیای اجتماعی در سیستم خود جذب و ادغام می شوند. بنابراین تصویر انگیزشی رشد خود با این دیدگاه که خود صرفاً دریافت کننده منفعل بازخورد دنیای اجتماعی خود طرحواره ها و هویت ها جایگاه ها در ترتیب اجتماعی است، مغایرت دارد. خود همچنین به صورت فعال خودش را از طریق عاملیت فطری اش پرورش می دهد. درونی سازی و یکپارچه کردن خود خود با نیازهای فطری تمایلات ،ترجیحات و توانایی هایش آماده رشد کردن و متمایز شدن است. با این حال نیاز به ارتباط فرد را در ارتباط نزدیک با مسائل و تنظیم های اجتماعی قرار می دهد و بنابراین خود هم در جهت استقلال و هم ارتباط پرورش می یابد. نیاز روان شناختی به ارتباط روابط گرم و صمیمانه با دیگران کیفیت انگیزشی است که به انگیزش پیشتازانه فرد برای درونی سازی مقررات ارزشها و مسائل اجتماعی کمک می کند. بنابراین رفتارها هیجانها و شیوه های تفکر نه تنها از درون خود، بلکه همچنین از درون موقعیت اجتماعی و جامعه سرچشمه میگیرند وقتی فرد بازی مطالعه، عمل و با دیگران تعامل میکند این افراد از او توقع دارند که از شیوه های خاص رفتار، احساس و فکر کردن تبعیت کند. بنابراین اعمال عمدی یعنی عاملیت گاهی از خود و گاهی از رهنمود و توصیه های دیگران ناشی میشوند فرایندی که افراد از طریق آن شیوه های تفکر احساس با رفتار کردن تجویز شده به صورت بیرونی را جذب میکنند و میپذیرند. درونی سازی نامیده می شود. درونی سازی به دو دلیل روی میدهد اول اینکه درونی سازی در اثر تمایل فرد به برقراری ارتباط معنی دار با دوستان ،والدین معلمان ،مربیان کارفرمایان کشیشان، خانواده و دیگران روی می دهد. بنابراین درونی سازی به وسیله نیاز به ارتباط برانگیخته می شود. دوم اینکه درونی سازی در اثر تمایل فرد به تعامل مؤثر با دنیای اجتماعی روی می دهد. بنابراین درونی سازی توسط نیاز به شایستگی برانگیخته میشود. بیشتر چیزهایی که فرد درونی میکند به عملکرد مؤثر او کمک میکنند مثل رفتن به مدرسه مسواک زدن دندان پوزش خواستن از دیگران این گونه درونی سازی برای خود ارزش بین فردی انطباقی دارد، زیرا نه تنها به کارآمدی بیشتر در تبادلهای محیطی بلکه همچنین به وحدت بیشتر بین خود و جامعه کمک می کند. مفهوم خود به عنوان عامل تأیید میکند که (۱) انسانها از یک خود اساسی برخوردارند که توسط انگیزش فطری نیرومند میشود و به وسیله فرایندهای رشد فطری تمایز و یکپارچگی هدایت می شود و (۲) تمام ساختارهای خود به طور برابر اصیل نیستند، به طوری که برخی از ساختارهای خود واقعاً خود اساسی در حالی که ساختارهای دیگر، فقط نیازها و اولویت های جامعه را منعکس میکنند رایان، ۱۹۹۳ دسی (۲۰۱۷) چون برخی از ساختارهای خود از جامعه سرچشمه میگیرند ممکن است درون خود تعارض ایجاد کنند. تعارض برعکس یکپارچگی است شرایط محیطی کنترل کننده باعث میشوند که خود نیازها و ترجیحات فطری را نادیده بگیرد و در عوض ساختار خودی را بر مبنای هدف تأیید بیرونی پرورش دهد (هاگینز و نی (۲۰۰۲) بنابراین افرادی که تأیید بیرونی خودی را که از لحاظ اجتماعی مطلوب است دنبال میکنند امکان دارد به جای شغلی که با تمایلات ترجیحات و نیازهای روان شناختی درونی آنها هماهنگ باشد شغلی را انتخاب کنند که ثروت مقام یا قدرت اجتماعی تأمین کند. خود واقعی خود واقعی درجه ای را که فرد با تجربه درونی ارتباط دارد منعکس می کند (یعنی فرد از نیازها، تمایلات و اهداف شخصی ذهن آگاه است با چنین آگاهی و ذهن آگاهی بین تجربه درونی و رفتار واقعی ارتباط نزدیکی وجود دارد در مقابل خود کاذب خودی است که در آن تجربه درونی نادیده گرفته شده سرکوب شده یا تحریف شده است. به طوری که بین تجربه درونی و رفتار فرد ارتباط اندکی وجود دارد. به طور کلی در صورتی که روابط از تلاش ها خود بیانگریها و مقاصد افراد حمایت کنند آنها از خود واقعی ذهن آگاهی و دانش شخصی کسب میکنند اما وقتی روابط و نیروهای اجتماعی عیب جویی ارزشیابی و کنترل کنند یا صرفاً بی تفاوت باشند در این صورت عملکرد خود مستقل لطمه میبیند و دفاعی می شود، درک خود تحریف شده پدیدار میشود تا با چنین نبود حمایتی انطباق یابد هورنی ۱۹۵۰ راجرز ۱۹۶۱؛ دسی و رایان ۲۰۱۷) خود هماهنگی سؤالهایی که توسط مدل خود هماهنگی پرسیده میشوند عبارت اند از: (۱) افراد چگونه تصمیم میگیرند در زندگی خود برای چه چیزی تلاش کنند؟ و (۲) چگونه این فرایند تلاش شخصی گاهی خود را پرورش میدهد و به بهزیستی کمک میکند و در مواقع دیگر به خطا می رود و بهزیستی را کاهش می دهد؟ وقتی افراد تصمیم میگیرند هدفهایی را دنبال کنند که با خود اساسی آنها هماهنگ هستند، هدف های هماهنگ با خود را دنبال میکنند شکل ۴-۱۱ به صورت نموداری این مفهوم را توضیح میدهد که هدفهای فرد ممکن است بیانگر نیازها، تمایلات و ارزشهای درونی شده او باشند یا نباشند. بر طبق نظریه خود مختاری (فصل ۵) هدف های درونی هدفهایی که از تمایلات شخصی ناشی میشوند و هدفهای خودپذیر هدف هایی که از اعتقاد یا ارزشهای فرد ناشی میشوند بیانگر هدفهای هماهنگ با خود هستند. هدف های هماهنگ با خود خود یکپارچه و عامل را منعکس و ابراز میکنند. هدف های درون فکنی شده هدف هایی که از الزامات اجتماعی ناشی میشوند و هدفهای بیرونی آنهایی که از میل به تحسین یا تقویت شدن ناشی میشوند بیانگر هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود هستند. هدف های شکل ۱۱۰۴ توضیح نموداری عمل منسجم و نامنسجم خود تا هماهنگ با خود اعمال نامنسجم را منعکس و ابراز میکنند که از فشارهای کنترل کننده درونی و بیرونی ناشی می شوند. مدل خود هماهنگی در شکل ۱۱۵ نشان داده شده است این مدل زمانی آغاز می شود که فرد هدفی را تعیین میکند برای مثال امکان دارد یک نفر هدف ازدواج دیگری هدف برقراری روابط دوستی جدید و نفر بعدی هدف ترک سیگار را تعیین کرده باشد. اولین سوالی که مدل خود هماهنگی در مورد چنین هدفی میپرسد صرفاً این است: چرا؟ چرا می خواهید ازدواج کنید؟ چرا میخواهید روابط دوستی جدید برقرار کنید؟ چرا میخواهید سیگار را ترک کنید؟ برخی هدفها از نیازها تمایلات و ترجیحات خود اساسی باشی میشوند و آنها را منعکس میکنند هدف های هماهنگ با خود در حالی که هدفهای دیگر چنین نیستند. هدف های هماهنگ با خود به این دلیل از لحاظ انگیزشی مهم هستند که تلاش بیشتر علاقه بیشتر و عاملیت بیشتر از هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود ایجاد میکنند و نگه می دارند شلدون و البوت (۱۹۹۹) تلاش علاقه و عاملیت بیشتر به ویژه وقتی با گذشت زمان ادامه یافته باشند. شکل ۱۱۵ مدل خود هماهنگی احتمال دستیابی به هدف را افزایش میدهند دستیابی به هدف هماهنگ با خود تجربیات ارضای نیاز را نیز پرورش میدهد. سرانجام اینکه همین تجربه ارضای نیاز اصیل خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط است که بهزیستی را افزایش میدهد (یعنی بالا رفتن خلق مثبت نشاط سلامت جسمانی یعنی دستیابی به هدفهای هماهنگ با خود خوراک روان شناختی برای خود تأمین میکند که بهزیستی و انگیزش عاملیت را حفظ می نماید (رایان (۱۹۹۵ هدفهای هماهنگ با خود هدفهای درونی هدفهای خودپذیر از احساس اصالت و Scanned with CamScanner انگیزش و هیجان مالکیت شخصی سرچشمه میگیرند (مثلاً می خواهم سیگار را ترک کنم، بنابراین تمایل به دنبال کردن هدف های هماهنگ با خود در زمینه عاطفه مثبت رشد شخصی و سلامت روان شناختی روی میدهد. از سوی دیگر هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود هدف های بیرونی هدف های درون فکنی شده از احساس تعارض فشار و الزامات دیگران با ضروریات اجتماعی سرچشمه میگیرند (مثلاً من مجبورم سیگار را ترک کنم، بنابراین، میل به دنبال کردن هدف های ناهماهنگ با خود از اضطراب تعارض روان شناختی و فشار اجتماعی ناشی می شود (شلدون و کاسر (۱۹۹۸) هدفهای درونی و هدف های بیرونی فرض اساسی پژوهش درباره هدفهای درونی در برابر بیرونی این است که همه هدف ها یا آرزوهای زندگی برابر نیستند به طوری که برخی هدفها (درونی) برای سلامت روانی و عملکرد اجتماعی مفیدتر از هدفهای دیگر (بیرونی) هستند (کاسر ۲۰۱۶؛ رایان و دسی ۲۰۰۹؛ رایان و همکاران، ۱۹۹۶) برای اینکه نمونه ای از معنی این موضوع داشته باشید، یکی از هدفهای مهم زندگی خودتان را در جای خالی زیر وارد کنید هدف من در زندگی این است. هدفهای درونی آرزوها و فعالیتهای زندگی هستند که به صورت فطری خشنود کننده اند، زیرا دنبال کردن آنها فرصتهای مکرری را برای تلاشگر هدف ایجاد می کنند. تا ارضای نیاز خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط را در این راستا تجربه کند. برخی از هدف های درونی در نیمه بالای جدول ۲-۱۱ فهرست شده اند. وقتی افراد هدفهای درونی را دنبال می کنند، معمولاً جریان یکنواخت ارضای نیاز خود مختاری و شایستگی را تجربه می کنند و وقتی افراد هدفهایی را دنبال میکنند که به رشد رابطه و مشارکت در جامعه کمک می نمایند. معمولاً جریان یکنواخت ارضای رابطه را تجربه می کنند. هدفهای بیرونی آن دسته از آرزوها و فعالیتهای زندگی هستند که به توجه با تأیید دیگران نیاز دارند و بنابراین خنثی یا ناخوشایند هستند - دنبال کردن آنها افکار و رفتارهای تلاشگر را از هدف منحرف می سازد و ارضای نیاز او نادیده گرفته می شود با لطمه می بیند. برخی از هدفهای زندگی بیرونی در قسمت پایین جدول ۲-۱۱ فهرست شده اند و آرزو داشتن برای پول شهرت و ظاهر جذاب را شامل میشوند. وقتی افراد شهرت و ثروت را دنبال جدول ۲-۱۱ نمونه هایی از هدفهای درونی و هدف های بیرونی هدفهای درونی دنبال کردن خود مختاری رشد روان شناختی و رشد خود مثبت روابط صمیمی دنبال کردن پیوندهای عاطفی نزدیک صمیمیت عاطفی و رابطه بسیار رضایت بخش با دیگران مشارکت در جامعه دنبال کردن جامعه ای بهتر و دنیایی بهتر از طریق فعالیت نوع دوستانه موفقیت مالی (پول) دنبال کردن ثروت و نمادهای آن ثروت مانند اموال مادی شهرت اجتماعی دنبال کردن تحسین اجتماعی تأیید اجتماعی سرشناس بودن و تشخیص داده شدن توسط دیگران به عنوان آدم مشهور ظاهر جذاب دنبال کردن تحسین های اجتماعی و مقام اجتماعی بالا با جستجوی جذابیت از نظر بدن می کنند تجربیات ارضای نیاز خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط معمولاً ناچیز هستند. در زمینه های زندگی مثل کار ورزش دنبال کردن و رسیدن به هدفهای درونی در مقایسه با بیرونی نه تنها ارضای نیاز بیشتر بلکه همچنین مشغولیت (تلاش استقامت) یادگیری عملکرد و بهزیستی را پیش بینی میکند. علت این منافع این است که دنبال کردن هدفهای درونی ارضا کننده نیاز تلاش استقامت تفکر راهبردی و عاملیت فرد را به شیوه ای نیرومند میکند که هدفهای بیرونی این کار را انجام نمی دهند. خود تنظیمی خود تنظیمی با تعیین هدف بلند مدت آغاز میشود. هدفهای بلند مدت، مانند فارغ التحصیل 1. self-regulation Scanned with CamScanner شدن از دانشگاه یادگیری زبان خارجی و ابرقراری رابطه ای خوب، صرفاً خودشان تحقق نمی یابند. بلکه خود برای پیش بردن هدف مورد نظر به حالت نهایی مطلوب آن دستیابی به هدف باید تلاش شناختی انگیزشی و هیجانی به خرج دهد. این فرایند مدیریت خود برای تحقق بخشیدن به هدف بلند مدت خود تنظیمی نامیده میشود. به صورت رسمی تی خود تنظیمی عبارت است از برنامه ریزی اجرا نظارت و ارزیابی فراشناختی از تلاش های فرد برای هدف پینتریج، ۱۲۰۰۰ زیمر من (۲۰۰۲) آینده نگری از طریق تأمل خود تنظیمی فرایندی است که با تعیین هدف بلند مدت شروع میشود و هر یک از موارد زیر را دربر دارد که با گذشت زمان روی میدهد . برنامه ریزی و تفکر راهبردی . عمل کردن و خویشتنداری . نظارت و وارسی کردن . تأمل و تنظیم کردن بعد از اینکه فرد هدف بلند مدتی را تعیین میکند تا برای آن تلاش کند، رسیدن به آن هدف باید برنامه ریزی شود؛ فرد یک برنامه عمل به وجود می آورد؛ برای به ثمر رساندن این هدف راهبردهایی را به کار میبرد؛ و اجرای قصدها را ایجاد میکند بعد از اینکه فرایند تعیین هدف تشکیل شد فرد به سمت تلاش برای هدف و خویشتنداری پیش میرود. تلاش برای هدف به کار شناختی انگیزشی و هیجانی نیاز دارد زیرا برنامه ها راهبردها و اجرای قصدها باید عملی شوند در حالی که خویشتنداری به جلوگیری از تکانه های متعارض هدف کوتاه مدت حواسپرتی ها و وسوسه ها نیاز دارد وقتی تلاش برای هدف با گذشت زمان پدیدار می شود. فرد باید اختلاف هدف - عملکرد را زیر نظر بگیرد و ببیند آیا این اختلاف کاهش یافته و پیشرفت صورت گرفته است یا نه سرانجام فرد باید به این موضوع فکر کند که چرا خود تنظیمی موفق شده با شکست خورده است. بعد از اینکه فرد موفقیت یا شکست خود را تشخیص داد به آن فکر کرد و آن را درک کرد تلاشهای خود تنظیمی آینده باید اصلاح و به روز شوند تا فرد بتواند برای موفقیت در خود تنظیمی آینده در وضعیت بهتری قرار گیرد. به طوری که در شکل ۱۱۶ توضیح داده شده است خود تنظیمی یک فرایند جاری و چرخشی است زیمرمن (۲۰۰۰) و این موارد را شامل میشود آینده نگری (تعیین هدف برنامه ریزی راهبردی عمل تلاش برای هدف خویشتنداری و تأمل نظارت بر خود و ارزیابی خود که به آینده نگری بیشتر قبل از فرصت بعدی عملکرد منجر می شود. ماهیت جاری و چرخشی خود تنظیمی زمانی آشکار میشود که تأمل درباره موفقیت ها و شکست های خود تنظیمی فرد به آینده نگری جدید و بنابراین به خود تنظیمی مؤثرتر در آینده بینجامد. شکل ۱۱۶ مراحل چرخشی خود تنظیمی پرورش دادن خود تنظیمی شایسته تر هر کسی به خود تنظیمی می پردازد اما برخی افراد بهتر از دیگران از عهده آن بر می آیند. اکثر پژوهشگران خود تنظیمی را به صورت مهارت خود (self) مهارتی که باید فراگیری شود، بهبود یابد و اصلاح شود در نظر میگیرند شانک و زیمرمن (۱۹۹۷) خود تنظیمی به عنوان مهارت اکتسابی زمانی آشکارتر است که افراد هدف بلند مدتی را در زمینه ای نا آشنا دنبال کنند (مثل دانشجویی که برای اولین بار در کلاس ممتازی ثبت نام میکند کارمندی که شغل تازه ای را به طوری که در شکل ۷-۱۱ نشان داده شده است خود تنظیمی مستلزم توانایی

فرایند یادگیری اجتماعی نبود مهارت خوتنظیمی فرایند کامل تعیین هدف توسط خود فرد است. افزایش در شایستگی خود تنظیمی، عموماً در قالب فرایند یادگیری اجتماعی و در سطح مشاهده ای روی میدهد که طی آن، مشاهده گر نسبتاً مبتدی رفتار و بیانگریهای فرد نسبتاً ماهری را مشاهده می کند. این فرد مبتدی ابتدا از الگوی ماهر تقلید میکند به طوری که در شکل ۸-۱۱ نشان داده شده است و مشاهده در نهایت به تقلید می انجامد فرد مبتدی در مدت تقلید راهنمایی می شود و برای مؤثر بودن رفتارهای تقلیدی خود بازخورد اصلاحی دریافت میکند. تنظیم هایی در جهت خود تنظیمی مؤثرتر صورت میگیرند فرد مبتدی بعد از یک دوره راهنمایی و بازخورد اصلاحی معیارهای ممتاز بودن را که توسط الگو تأیید شده اند درونی سازی میکند فرد مبتدی سرانجام در آن زمینه خود تنظیم میشود و دیگر به الگوی ماهر نیازی ندارد و میتواند از نظر تعیین هدف تلاش برای هدف نظارت بر خود و ارزیابی خود خود تنظیم شود. برای مثال فرد مبتدی وقتی میخواهد یاد بگیرد چگونه نویسنده شایسته و خود تنظیمی شود سبک و معیارهای یک نویسنده ماهر را مشاهده و از آن تقلید میکند یاد میگیرد هدفهایی را تعیین کند راهبردهایی را تدوین نماید و قصدهایی را اجرا کند محیط فیزیکی را برای کمک به نگارش بازسازی کند و روشهایی را برای نظارت بر کار خود و ارزیابی آن فراگیری نماید زیمرمن و ریز مبرگ (۱۹۹۷) پرورش دادن خود تنظیمی شایسته به زمان و تمرین طولانی نیاز دارد. تمرین مستقل بسیار اهمیت دارد، اما نکته ای که در تمام نوشته ها درباره خود تنظیمی به آن اشاره می شود این است: اگر افراد یک مربی داشته باشند که نحوه تعیین

زیمرمن و ریز مبرگ، (۱۹۹۷) پرورش دادن خود تنظیمی شایسته به زمان و تمرین طولانی نیاز دارد. تمرین مستقل بسیار اهمیت دارد، اما نکته ای که در تمام نوشته ها درباره خود تنظیمی به آن اشاره می شود این است اگر

آنها این است که افراد بیشتر از ارضای به تأخیر افتاده که از هدفهای بلند مدت حاصل میشود، مجذوب ارضای فوری پاداش های کوتاه مدت میشوند رفتار تکانشی سریع و راحت است - صرفاً به جای اینکه به Scanned with CamScanner سر کار بروید تسلیم شوید و شیرینی بخورید الکل بنوشید و بازی ویدیویی کنید. مشکل این جذابیت های کوتاه مدت این است که اغلب با دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت، ناسازگار و حتی متضاد هستند. یعنی اگر بازی

برای خوردن غذای سالم نه تنها باید میوه و سبزیجات بیشتری مصرف کنیم، بلکه به طور همزمان باید در برابر میل به خوردن کیک شکلاتی بستنی و هر چیز راحت دیگر بگیر و برو در فروشگاه مقاومت کنیم خویشتنداری توانایی جلوگیری مهار کردن و حتی نادیده گرفتن میل تکانشی به دنبال کردن هدف کوتاه مدت است بائر) و با میستر (۲۰۱۱) خویشتنداری توانایی قطع کردن گرایش ما به راهنمای خودکار و جذابیتهای کوتاه مدت و به جای آن هدایت کردن عمدی رفتار در مسیر هدف بلند مدت است. در سطح محاوره ای خویشتنداری نیروی اراده است. برای اینکه خویشتنداری را در عمل احساس کنید آزمایش تربچه را در نظر بگیرید با میستر بر اتسلاوسکی موراون و تایس (۱۹۹۸) شرکت کنندگان در گروه آزمایشی ابتدا تکلیفی را انجام میدهند که به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد در حالی که شرکت کنندگان در گروه گواه تکلیف مشابهی را انجام میدهند که به خویشتنداری نیاز ندارد بعداً، تمام شرکت کنندگان به تکلیف نامربوطی که به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد جابجا میشوند. فرضیه این است؛ چون خویشتنداری تحلیل برنده است خسته کننده پرزحمت شرکت کنندگانی که تکلیف اولیه خویشتنداری را انجام میدهند خسته میشوند و بنابراین در تکلیف خویشتنداری بعدی به طور نامناسب تر از شرکت کنندگان گروه گواه عمل می کنند. در تحقیق تربچه آزمایشگران از تمام شرکت کنندگان خواستند قبل از تحقیق، حداقل به مدت سه ساعت هیچ چیزی نخورند. وقتی شرکت کنندگان وارد آزمایشگاه شدند، آزمایشگران ترتیبی دادند تا بوی کیک شکلاتی که تازه پخته شده بود در هوا پخش شود. وقتی شرکت کنندگان نشستند تا تحقیق شروع شود جلوی آنها روی میز مقداری از آن کیک شکلاتی تازه و یک کاسه تربچه تازه قرار داشت برای شرکت کنندگان در گروه آزمایشی تکلیف خویشتنداری زیاد تعیین شده بود که در آن باید تربچه میخوردند و در برابر خوردن کیک شکلاتی مقاومت میکردند در حالی که برای شرکت کنندگان در گروه گواه چنین تکلیف خویشتنداری تعیین نشده بود و آنها میتوانستند هرچه میخواستند بخورند. بعد از پنج دقیقه شرکت کنندگان به اتاق دیگری برده شدند و چند مسئله هندسه به آنها داده شد که حل کردن آنها غیر ممکن بود (مثلاً، شکل هندسی را بدون ردیابی هر خط یا بلند کردن مداد از روی کاغذ دنبال کنید. آزمایش این بود که آزمودنیها قبل از دست کشیدن چه مدت مقاومت خواهند کرد. به طور میانگین شرکت کنندگانی که کیک شکلاتی خورده بودند به مدت ۱۹ دقیقه مقاومت کردند اما شرکت کنندگانی که تربچه خورده و جلوی میل به خوردن کیک شکلاتی را گرفته بودند، فقط ۸ دقیقه مقاومت کردند شرکت کنندگانی که تربچه خورده بودند، از سطح یکسان انرژی برای مقاومت در برابر مسائل دشوار برخوردار نبودند. متأسفانه زندگی تکلیف مداوم سعی در مقاومت کردن در برابر مسائلی است که با کیک شکلاتی تازه برابرند. اکنون پژوهشگران در حدود ۱۰۰ آزمایش با استفاده از الگوی پژوهشی که در فوق شرح داده شد انجام داده اند و هفت حوزه کلی خویشتنداری را مشخص کرده اند با میستر و وس ۲۰۰۷ ها گر وود استف و چانزیسار انتیس (۲۰۱۰) . جلوگیری از تکانه ها و امیال . مدیریت و جلوگیری از هیجانها . کنترل کردن و جلوگیری از افکار . کنترل کردن توجه . تصمیم گیری و انتخاب های زیاد . مدیریت اظهاری که فرد به دیگران بیان میکند . مهربان بودن با افراد پر توقع و دشوار و کنار آمدن با آنها در آزمایش های جداگانه ای درباره خویشتنداری پژوهشگران از شرکت کنندگان درخواست کردند با جلوگیری از تکانه ها و امیال مانند مقاومت در برابر شیرینی جات و غذاهای حاضر و آماده (وس، با میستر و سیاروچو (۲۰۰۵) و میل به مشروبخواری و کشیدن سیگار (موراون و شمولی (۲۰۰۶) خویشتنداری نشان دهند؛ با جلوگیری از واکنشهای هیجانی طبیعی مانند گریه نکردن در حال تماشای فیلم بسیار غم انگیز هیجانها را مدیریت کنند (موراون نایس و با میستر (۱۹۹۸) یا از واکنشهای انزجار در حال نگاه کردن به شینی آلوده جلوگیری کنند. دماری را بنسیون و پو (۲۰۰۶؛ با جلوگیری از افکار ناخواسته افکار را کنترل کنند (موراون تایس و با میستر (۱۹۹۸) با طولانی کردن استقامت در کلماتی که حفظ کردن آنها دشوار بود و انجام دادن تکالیف گوش به زنگی توجه را کنترل کنند وس و با میستر (۲۰۰۳)؛ در گزینه های جزئی و بی اهمیت مقدار زیادی تصمیم گیری و انتخاب کنند وس و همکاران، ۲۰۰۸)؛ با معرفی خود به صورت فردی شایسته و دوست داشتنی تأثیری که بر دیگران می گذارند مدیریت کنند (وس، با میستر و سیاروچی (۲۰۰۵) و با مؤدب بودن هنگام تعامل با افراد بسیار دشوار و پر توقع مهربان باشند فینکل و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) کاهش انرژی یافته های به دست آمده از آزمایش تربچه اشاره دارند که خویشتنداری بیش از یک مهارت است. خویشتنداری ذخیره انرژی است که به نظر می رسد فقط به مقدار محدود وجود دارد. افراد بعد از اعمال خویشتنداری به طور موقتی مقداری از توانایی خود را برای خویشتنداری آینده از دست میدهند. همچنین وقتی افراد توانایی خود را برای خویشتنداری از دست می دهند، به احتمال زیاد گرفتار امیال و وسوسه های تکانشی میشوند. این شیوه تفکر به ارائه مدل توان محدود خویشتنداری انجامیده است با میستر و همکاران ۲۰۰۷ موراون (۲۰۱۲) که میتوان آن را به صورت سه قضیه زیر بیان کرد: ۱ مقدار یا توان نیروی اراده برای خویشتنداری موفقیت آمیز حیاتی است. اعمال خویشتنداری مقداری از این منبع را کاهش می دهد و بنابراین تلاشهای بعدی برای خویشتنداری به احتمال زیاد شکست می خورند. چنین مدلی این سؤال را می طلبد که چه چیزی هنگام تلاشهای خویشتنداری کاهش می یابد. به نظر می رسد که پاسخ سوخت گلوکز مغز باشد گایلیوت و با میستر، ۲۰۰۷؛ گایلیوت و همکاران (۲۰۰۷) گلوکز در بدن از غذا ساخته میشود. هنگام گوارش این قند تولید و در جریان خون آزاد می شود و از آنجا به سمت عضلات قلب کند دستگاه ایمنی و مغز می رود. مغز مصرف کننده بزرگ انرژی است و حدود ۲۰ درصد از سوخت گلوکز بدن یعنی کالری ها را مصرف میکند. گلوکز عملاً وارد مغز نمی شود بلکه در عوض به چیزی که مغز مصرف میکند تبدیل می شود یعنی انتقال دهنده های عصبی اگر مغز بدون انتقال دهنده های عصبی بماند، در این صورت تفکر را متوقف میکند و اگر مغز تفکر را متوقف کند تکانشی تر می شود و کنترل اجرایی کمتری اعمال میکند تمام این زیست شناسی پیچیده به این درک ساده خلاصه می شود: «نبود گلوکز، نبود نیروی اراده با میستر و تیرنی ۲۰۱۱، ص ۴۹) اگر استدلال فوق درست باشد در این صورت افرادی که خویشتنداری اعمال میکنند باید کاهش چشمگیری در سطح گلوکز خود نشان دهند. پژوهش نشان می دهد که این دقیقاً همان چیزی است که اتفاق می افتد و علاوه بر آن کاهش گلوکز نسبتاً سریع و زیاد است گایلیوت و با میستر، ۲۰۰۷ گایلیوت و همکاران (۲۰۰۷) یعنی اگر شما از گلوکز در سطح «X» برخوردار باشید و بعد به تکلیف خویشتنداری مانند جلوگیری از یک هوس بپردازید. در این صورت به سرعت سطح گلوکز کمتر از X خواهید داشت. این کاهش گلوکز را به راحتی می توان به وسیله گلوکز سنج تأیید کرد. در آزمایش کاهش شرکت کنندگان به یک رشته تکالیف خویشتنداری پرداختند - یکی پس از دیگری گلوکز به طرز محسوسی کاهش یافت که به عملکرد ضعیف در تکلیف انجامید. وقتی به آزمودنی ها از قبل هشدار داده شد که آنها یک رشته تکالیف خویشتنداری انجام خواهند داد یعنی از شما درخواست خواهد شد تا سخت فکر کنید و تکانه را نادیده بگیرید، صرفاً انتظار خویشتنداری کافی بود تا گلوکز و عملکرد در تکلیف کاهش یابد موراون شمولی و بارکلی (۲۰۰۶) تکمیل انرژی خویشتنداری گلوکز را کاهش میدهد اما وقتی افراد از آن آگاه باشند، می توانند قبل از تکلیف خویشتنداری چالش انگیز یک لیوان آب پرتقال لیموناد یا شیر بستنی مملو از گلوکز بخورند. خویشتنداری چالش انگیز یک لیوان آب پرتقال لیموناد یا شیر بستنی مملو از گلوکز بخورند. انجام این کار به طور چشمگیری به افراد کمک میکند تا خویشتنداری مؤثری اعمال کنند (هاگر و همکاران (۲۰۱۰) لزومی ندارد که گلوکز از طریق نوشیدنی قند دار مصرف شود، بلکه این سریع ترین راه دریافت گلوکز برای مغز است به طوری که افراد دیابتی به شما خواهند گفت. غذاهایی که قند کم و پروتئین زیاد نیز دارند بادام ها میوه ها گوشت، پنیر به خوبی عمل میکنند ولی زمان بیشتری طول میکشد تا سوخت مغز را تولید کنند. این اثر غذایی باعث شد که پژوهشگران خویشتنداری به توصیه ای عملی برسند قبل از اینکه روز خود را که به مقدار زیادی خویشتنداری نیاز دارد آغاز کنید، صبحانه خوبی بخورید. خویشتنداری گلوکز را کاهش میدهد اما فقط زمانی این کار را انجام می دهد که خویشتنداری به معنی جلوگیری از میل کوتاه مدت جذابی باشد خوردن شیرینی جات، کشیدن سیگار بازی ویدیویی تا اینکه هدف بلند مدتی که جذابیت کمتری دارد، دنبال شود (مطالعه به مدت چند ساعت نوشتن فهرست طولانی از کارهای روزمره کنترل خشم هنگام یک مذاکره) جالب اینکه اگر ابتدا فرد در حالت خلق مثبت قرار داده شود مثلاً با تماشای فیلم خنده دار کاهش گلوکز و عملکرد ضعیف روی نمیدهند تایس با میستر شمولی و موراون (۲۰۰۷) همچنین وقتی افراد هدفهای بلندمدنی را دنبال میکنند که نیازهای روان شناختی خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط را ارضا میکنند کاهش گلوکز و عملکرد ضعیف روی نمی دهند (موراون (۲۰۰۸) در واقع دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدتی که نیاز روان شناختی را ارضا می کند به جای اینکه انرژی و عملکرد را کاهش دهد عملاً آنها را افزایش می دهد (مولان دسی و رایان ۲۰۰۶ موراون گاگن و روزمن (۲۰۰۸) نیرومندی خویشتنداری را میتوان از طریق تمرین نیز افزایش داد (با میستر، کایلیوت، دوال و اوتن (۲۰۰۶) برای مثال شرکت کنندگان به مدت دو هفته هر روز روی نظارت بر وضع اندامی و بهبود بخشیدن به آن یا زیر نظر گرفتن غذایی که هر روز میخوردند، خویشتنداری را تمرین کردند موراون و همکاران (۱۹۹۹) نظارت بر وضع اندامی به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد. زیرا فرد باید همواره عادت قوز کردن را نادیده بگیرد مثل موقع نشستن، ایستادن زیر نظر گرفتن مصرف روزانه غذا به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد زیرا فرد باید سبک خوردن بگیر و برو را مهار کند. بعد از دو هفته تمرین خویشتنداری شرکت کنندگان آموزش دیده خویشتنداری بیشتری از شرکت کنندگان گواه آموزش ندیده نشان دادند

خویشتنداری مؤثر استفاده از نیروی اراده برای تبدیل دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت به دستیابی آن است. این هدف اساسی خود تنظیمی در سه بخش خاکستری شکل ۹-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. اما به طوری که با خط ضخیم رو به

و توجیه میکند همان گونه که خویشتنداری دستیابی به هدف بلند مدت و موفقیت خود تنظیمی را پیش بینی و توجیه میکند. مدل نیروی محدود همچنین توضیح می دهد که چگونه ممکن است خویشتنداری افزایش یابد - مثلاً از طریق تکمیل مواد غذایی و ارضای نیاز روان شناختی و همچنین چگونه ممکن است از طریق آموزش و تمرین محافظت شود. یک قلم که در شکل ۱۱۹ ترسیم نشده است باز هم نیاز به در نظر گرفتن و بحث کردن دارد. سمت چپ بالای

مطالعه به مدت روزی چهار ساعت مستلزم جلوگیری از تعداد زیادی امیال و چیزهای جذاب کوتاه مدت است همانگونه که رژیم گرفتن و سعی در کاهش دادن وزن جلوگیری از تعداد زیادی امیال و چیزهای جذاب کوتاه مدت را ایجاب میکند. دنبال کردن چندین هدف بلند مدت به طور همزمان خیلی تحلیل برنده است. پژوهش نشان میدهد که بهتر است هر بار یک هدف بلند مدت دنبال شود و گنجایش محدود خویشتنداری صرف آن هدف بلند مدت شود شمولی و

اصلی در نظر گرفته می‌شود: به عنوان عامل و به عنوان موضوع. دیدگاه اول خود را به عنوان عامل انگیزشی فطری و درونی توصیف می‌کند که از طریق اهداف، ابتکارات و اعمال فرد استنباط می‌شود. دیدگاه دوم خود را به عنوان موضوع در نظر می‌گیرد که در زمینه‌های اجتماعی و شناختی شکل می‌گیرد و از طریق ارزیابی‌ها و بازخوردهای اجتماعی تأثیر می‌پذیرد. فرد برای فهم خود می‌تواند بر روی خود به عنوان فاعل یا موضوع تمرکز کرده و این انتخاب تا حدی به نظریه‌پردازی شخصی و علاقه او بستگی دارد. چهار مسئله اصلی که در خود تحلیل انگیزشی با توجه به میستر (1987) برجسته هستند شامل تعریف خود، ربط دادن خود به جامعه، پرورش دادن توانایی شخصی و تنظیم خود می‌باشند. 1. تعریف خود: در این مورد، فرد به دنبال پاسخ به سوالات اساسی مثل «من کیستم؟» و «آیا ویژگی‌های مثبت دارم؟» است. این تعریف نحوه رفتار فرد را هدایت می‌کند. 2. ربط دادن خود به جامعه: اینجا، فرد جایگاه خود را در جامعه و نقش‌های متعدد اجتماعی‌اش را در نظر می‌گیرد. 3. پرورش دادن توانایی شخصی: این بخش به تلاش فرد برای کشف و پرورش استعدادهایش و خلق معنا و هدف در زندگی‌اش اشاره دارد. 4. تنظیم خود: در این بخش، فرد برنامه‌ریزی و راهبردهایی برای دنبال کردن اهداف بلند مدت طراحی می‌کند و قدرت کنترل شخصی خود را ارزیابی می‌نماید. بعلاوه، مدل نیروی محدود خویشتنداری به توانایی فرد برای مدیریت رفتارها و هیجاناتش در راستای دستیابی به اهداف بلند مدت اشاره دارد. این مدل بیان می‌دارد که خویشتنداری مؤثر مستلزم استفاده از نیروی اراده و منابع محدودی مانند گلوکز است که می‌توانند با تمرین و خودآگاهی افزایش یابند. در نهایت، مدل خود هماهنگی مفهومی از تعیین هدف‌های شخصی است که با نیازها و ارزش‌های درونی فرد هماهنگ هستند و به افزایش موفقیت و بهزیستی کمک می‌کنند. این مدل بر اهمیت انتخاب هدف‌های مطابق با خود واقعی و پرهیز از هدف‌های مبتنی بر تأیید خارجی تأکید دارد."},{"instruction":"hello, i am going to apply for my postgraduate programme in Manchester and i wanna write a

Доброе утро, дорогие читатели! Солнце уже влезло в небесный офис и приступило к световой смене, а значит пришло время для утренней порции мотивации. Хорошее настроение — это как кофе, только не надо стоять в очереди за ним! И пока вы свариваете свой утренний крепкий эспрессо духа, позвольте мне поделиться мыслью одного из величайших тренеров в истории американского спорта - Винса Ломбарди. А как вы уже знаете, наша утренняя мотивационная статья - это свежий аромат ваших новых возможностей, подаваемый ежедневно в 7 часов утра по московскому времени! Итак, в исполнении групповой оркестровки усилий по созданию гармонии в мире мужчин и женщин, давайте распакуем одно вдохновляющее высказывание: «Индивидуальная приверженность к групповым усилиям — вот что заставляет работать команду, компанию, общество, цивилизацию». Сказал этот гигант духа примерно так же, как вы говорите своему кофе: “Давай, просыпайся!”. И да, это был Винс Ломбарди — человек, который знал толк в командных победах. Простыми словами, мастер-тренер говорил нам о том, что за любым великим делом стоит не просто группа людей, а группа людей, каждый из которых готов выложиться на все сто! Подумайте об этом, как о рок-группе: если барабанщик спит во время соло гитариста, единственное, что у них получится - это некая музыкальная каша, которую милосердно окрестят “экспериментальным джазом”. Индивидуальная приверженность — это когда вы встаёте рано утром, взбираетесь на свой персональный горный велосипед однажды называемый “хорошими намерениями”, и педалируете через гору препятствий к вершине вашей собственной эффективности. И вот здесь Винс Ломбарди похлопывает нас по плечу и напоминает: “Ты можешь быть чемпионом соло-педалирования, но если ты не в групповой велогонке под названием ‘Добиваемся цели вместе’, возможно, пришло время подумать о командной форме”. Да, каждый из нас иногда похож на супергероя в пижаме — мы чувствуем в себе силу, но чтобы мир увидел это, нужно действовать совместно. Командная работа, это не просто фраза, которую любят упоминать на корпоративных тренингах, чтобы ты почувствовал себя частью чего-то большего, пока активно нажимаешь кнопку на кофемашине. Это реальная динамика, которая делает компании успешными, государства - процветающими, а спортивные команды - легендарными. Так что же делает индивидуальную приверженность такой мощной? Во-первых, это ответственность. Когда каждый знает, что от его личного вклада зависит общий результат, создается особая атмосфера - атмосфера, в которой никто не хочет быть слабым звеном. Во-вторых, это увлечённость. Человек, который действительно “горит” своим делом, заразителен, как чих в метро (но в хорошем смысле, конечно!). И вот, мой дорогой читатель, в этой атмосфере каждый становится архитектором цивилизации, каждый — скульптором общества, каждый — дирижёром в оркестре усилий. Неважно, вы командир в полосатых носках или бас-гитарист с кофейными пятнами на рубашке, ваш вклад неоценим. Автор высказывания, Винс Ломбарди, был главным тренером ‘Green Bay Packers’ в 1960-х, и его команду заслуженно считают одной из самых успешных в истории профессионального американского футбола. Ломбарди — символ побед и уверенности в себе, человек, который превращал обычных парней в ураганных героев травяного поля. Нравится вам это или нет, но наш мир танцует в ритме командной работы. Да, иногда этот танец выглядит как первый урок вальса для новичков, но когда все двигаются в унисон… это магия, это симфония успешности. Так что, мои утренние зарядники, если вы хотите изменить мир или хотя бы улучшить свою среду обитания, вспомните слова Винса и пусть ваша индивидуальная приверженность станет звездой в небе групповых усилий. И не забудьте поделиться этой мотивацией с друзьями, найдите момент для лайка, а в комментариях опишите свои истории личного вклада в командный успех. Ваш путь к великим свершениям начинается с каждого маленького шага, который вы сделаете сегодня.

شناختی است که از طریق یادگیری ارزیابی ها و بازخورد اجتماعی اکتساب می شود. اینکه آیا فرد روی خود به عنوان عامل انجام دهنده تمرکز کند یا روی خود به عنوان موضوع (یعنی، «خود پنداره) تا اندازه ای به علاقه و دیدگاه نظری او بستگی دارد، اما عمدتاً به آنچه فرد سعی دارد درباره خود درک کند بستگی دارد. در چنین تحلیل انگیزشی درباره خود چهار مسئله با تلاش خود صحنه اصلی را اشغال میکنند با میستر (۱۹۸۷) ۱ تعریف خود ربط دادن خود به جامعه پرورش دادن توانایی شخصی تنظیم خود خود به عنوان موضوع تعریف خود ما برای تعریف خود از خود میپرسیم چه کسی هستیم، چگونه دیگران ما را می بینند و چه شباهت و تفاوتی با دیگران داریم ما سؤالهای اساسی چه کسی هستم؟» و «آیا ویژگی های مثبت دارم را میپرسیم تعریف خود نشان میدهد که چگونه خود پنداره رفتار را نیرومند و هدایت میکند. برخی از جنبه های تعریف خود صرفاً به ما نسبت داده شده اند (مثل جنسیت)، اما جنبه های دیگر باید از طریق پیشرفت و انتخاب به دست آیند مثل شغل دوستان ارزش ها شکل ۱-۱۱ تعریف ویژگیهای دو دیدگاه درباره خود خود به عنوان عامل و خود به عنوان موضوع دو دیدگاه درباره خود موضوع مراء بازنمایی اجتماعی - شناختی خود به عنوان موضوع خود به عنوان دانا بازنمایی اکتسابی ساختار اجتماعی بر پایه بازخورد اجتماعی سؤال های اساسی : . من کیستم؟ . آیا ویژگی های مثبت دارم؟ چه تفاوتی دارم؟ عامل من نیروی انگیزشی خود به عنوان فرایند. خود به عنوان دانا موهبت طبیعی نیروی درونی که رفتار را آغاز می کند. سؤال های اساسی : . چه کسی می توانم بشوم؟ . اهداف من چیستند؟ . آیا اصیل هستم؟ ربط دادن خود به جامعه ما در جستجوی ربط دادن خود به جامعه به جایگاه خود در دنیای اجتماعی و اینکه چه نقشهای اجتماعی برای ما وجود دارند یا ندارند می اندیشیم. ما می پرسیم انقش من چیست؟ ربط دادن خود به جامعه نشان میدهد چگونه هویت رفتار را نیرومند و هدایت میکند و نگه میدارد جامعه از چند نظر در ترغیب افراد به دنبال کردن نقش ها یا حتی فراهم کردن آنها انعطاف ناپذیر است. اما جامعه از نظرات دیگر، انعطاف پذیر است. و در تعیین اینکه چه کسی همسر فرد خواهد بود و چه نقشهای اجتماعی اشغال خواهند شد (مثل دانش آموز مادر سیاستمدار معلم مقداری انتخاب و مسئولیت شخصی به فرد می دهد. خود به عنوان عامل پرورش دادن توانایی شخصی ما برای پرورش خود این موضوع را بررسی می کنیم که به چه چیزی علاقه داریم و نداریم تفاوت بین عمل ناشی از خود در برابر عمل ناشی از نیروهای خارج از خود را درک میکنیم میکوشیم هدف و معنی بیافرینیم میخواهیم استعدادهای خود را کشف کنیم و پرورش دهیم و وقت خود را صرف پرورش دادن برخی مهارت ها و روابط می کنیم. ما می پرسیم چه کسی میتوانم بشوم؟» و اهداف من كدام ند؟ کشف کردن و پرورش دادن توانایی خود عاملیت را منعکس میکند و به آن نیاز دارد. عاملیت یعنی عامل (خود قدرت و قصد عمل کردن را دارد و انگیزش ذاتی در خود را نشان می دهد. تنظیم خود ما در جستجوی تنظیم و مدیریت خود به توانایی هایمان می اندیشیم هدفهای بلند مدت را برای دنبال کردن تعیین میکنیم برنامه ها و راهبردها را اجرا میکنیم دستیابی به اهدافمان را زیر نظر میگیریم و برای رسیدن به اهداف بلند مدت مان تنظیم هایی را انجام می دهیم. ما میپرسیم آیا میتوانم کنترل شخصی اعمال کنم؟». مدیریت یا تنظیم خود نشان میدهد که چگونه خود تنظیمی احتمال عملکرد شایسته را بیشتر میکند. خود به جای اینکه به صورت تکانشی عمل کند میتواند ارضا را به تأخیر اندازد و جلوی پاداش های کوتاه مدت و وسوسه را بگیرد تا هدفهای بلند مدتی را دنبال کند که بزرگتر و خشنود کننده تر هستند. مسئله عزت نفس قبل از بحث درباره خود پنداره هویت عاملیت و خود تنظیمی مفید خواهد بود که قدری مکث کنیم و عقیده ای اساسی را به چالش بکشیم که خیلی از افراد آن را تأیید میکنند یعنی بهترین راه برای افزایش دادن انگیزش فرد بالا بردن عزت نفس اوست معلمان، کارفرمایان و مربیان همواره و با اشتیاق میگویند که روش با انگیزه کردن دانش آموزان کارمندان و ورزشکاران، بالا بردن عزت نفس آنهاست آنها را تحسین کنید به آنها پاداش بدهید به آنها تبریک بگویید کاری کنید که احساس خوبی در مورد خودشان داشته باشند و بعد ببینید که چه چیزهای شگفت آوری آشکار خواهند شد. عزت نفس بالا بسیار خوب است و برای مثال با شاد بودن همبستگی مثبت دارد دینر و دینر (۱۹۹۶) با این حال مسئله تقویت کردن عزت نفس به عنوان یک مداخله انگیزشی این است که تقریباً هیچ یافته ای وجود ندارد که نشان دهد عزت نفس اصلاً موجب چیزی شود. بلکه عزت نفس تحت تأثیر موفقیتها و شکستها قرار دارد… آنچه باید بهبود یابد، عزت نفس نیست بلکه بهبود بخشیدن به مهارتهای ما برای رسیدگی به دنیاست» (سلیگمن نقل شده 2. self-regulation در آذر (۱۹۹۴) به عبارت دیگر در رابطه بین عزت نفس و عملکرد خود، عملکرد خود علت است در حالی که عزت نفس فقط معلول است. عزت نفس اصولاً کارت امتیاز یا تابلوی امتیازی است برای گزارش دادن چگونه اوضاع در زندگی ما خوب یا بد پیش می روند (هلنمک و ون آکن، (۱۹۹۵) عزت نفس و پیشرفت با یکدیگر همبستگی مثبت دارند اما بالا رفتن عزت نفس موجب افزایش پیشرفت با بازدهی نمی شود؛ بلکه افزایش پیشرفت و بازدهی باعث می شوند. عزت نفس بالا برود هلمکون آکن ۱۹۹۵ مارش ۱۹۹۰ مارش و گراون، ۲۰۰۶؛ مارش و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) عزت نفس نشان میدهد که زندگی چگونه پیش می رود، اما منبع انگیزشی نیست که به افراد امکان دهد تا زندگی را خوب پیش ببرند. دلیلی وجود ندارد که نشان دهند. تقویت کردن عزت نفس افراد عملکرد آنها را بهتر خواهد کرد با میستر و همکاران (۲۰۰۳) فایده اصلی عزت نفس بالا این است که از خود (self) در برابر حالت عاطفی منفی مانند افسردگی و اضطراب محافظت میکند عزت نفس به افراد امکان میدهد تا احساس خوبی در مورد خودشان داشته باشند ولی آنها را برای انجام هیچ کاری با انگیزه نمی کند. اگر منطق فوق درست باشد در این صورت ارزش آن را دارد که بپرسیم چگونه جنبش عزت نفس در ابتدا آغاز شد. این جنبش در سال ۱۹۸۶ آغاز شد، زمانی که ایالت کالیفرنیا به عنوان راهبردی برای کاهش دادن رد شدن در مدرسه وابستگی به خدمات اجتماعی، جرم حاملگی ناخواسته و اعتیاد به مواد مخدر تصمیم گرفت عزت نفس تمام شهروندان را تقویت کند. منطق نهفته این بود که تقریباً تمام مشکلات روان شناختی تا عزت نفس پایین فرد قابل پیگیری هستند (براندن (۱۹۸۴) برنامه های تقویت عزت نفس با پیروی از این رهنمود (بدون فرگونه شواهد تجربی برای تأیید آن به شکل برنامه هایی نظیر Head ، Upward Bound و نمونه های دیگر وارد صحنه شدند. زمانی که پژوهش Early Training Project. Star تجربی به این برنامه ها رسیدگی کرد تا اثر بخشی آنها را ثابت کند نتایج نشان دادند که این رنامه ها نتوانستند مشکلات اجتماعی را که قانون گذاران ایالت کالیفرنیا مشخص کرده بودند. رطرف کنند با میستر و همکاران ۲۰۰۳؛ داوس ۱۹۹۶؛ سوان ۱۹۹۶)، عزت نفس بالا که زار بود در این برنامه های افزایش عزت نفس ترویج داده شوند، خیالی و ناپایدار بودند. در پایان بهترین نتیجه ای که میتوانیم بگیریم این است که عزت نفس چیزی شبیه شادکامی است. سعی در شادکام بودن باعث نمی شود که خیلی موفق شوید، بلکه شادکامی پیامد Scanned with CamScanner خشنودی ها پیروزی ها و روابط مثبت زندگی است دیتر و بیزواز دیتر (۲۰۰۸) همین طور عزت نفس صرفاً پیامد عملکرد انطباقی و تمریخش خود (self) است. خود پنداره خود پنداره بازنمایی های ذهنی افراد از خودشان است. همانگونه که افراد از دیگران مکانها و وقایع، بازنمایی های ذهنی دارند از خودشان نیز بازنمایی ذهنی دارند. خود پنداره از تجربه ها و از فکر کردن به این تجربه ها ساخته می شود. افراد برای ساختن خودپنداره به بازخوردی توجه میکنند که در امور روزمره خود می گیرند. که صفات ویژگیها و ترجیحات آنها را آشکار می سازند عناصر اصلی که افراد از آنها برای ساختن و توصیف خود استفاده میکنند از تجربه های خاص زندگی به دست می آیند. مانند موارد زیر . هنگام بحث گروهی احساس ناراحتی و نگرانی کردم . در سفر علمی مدرسه به باغ وحش زیاد حرف نزدم هنگام صرف ناهار از نشستن کنار دیگران خودداری کردم. افراد در مواقع فکر کردن صدها تجربه زندگی را به یاد نمی آورند، بلکه با گذشت زمان تجربه های خاص خود را به یک بازنمایی کلی از خود تبدیل میکنند (مثلاً، با توجه به تجربه های فروخورده ام در گروه ها در باغ وحش و هنگام صرف ناهار خودم را به صورت خجالتی برداشت میکنم همین نتیجه گیری کلی من خجالتیام و نه تجربه های خاص در گروه ها در باغ وحش و هنگام صرف ناهار است که افراد به یاد می آورند و از آنها برای ساختن و توصیف خود پنداره استفاده میکنند (مارکوس (۱۹۷۷) خود طرحواره ها خود طرحواره ها نتیجه گیریهای شناختی درباره خود هستند که زمینه خاصی دارند و از تجربه های گذشته آموخته میشوند مارکوس ۱۹۷۷ (۱۹۸۳) نتیجه گیری قبلی من 1. self-concept خجالتی ام بیانگر خود طرحواره است. خجالتی بودن هم زمینه خاص است روابط با دیگران) و هم از تجربه های گذشته آموخته شده است هنگام بحثهای گروهی سفرهای علمی گفتگوها به هنگام صرف ناهار خجالتی بودن بیانگر خود پنداره نیست، بلکه خود (self) را در یک زمینه خاص نشان میدهد - روابط فرد با دیگران در ورزشها یک دانش آموز دبیرستانی با در نظر گرفتن تجربه های هفته گذشته و یادآوری ترک کردن دو ۱۶۰۰ متر به علت خستگی و بارها برخورد با مانع هنگام پرش از آن، یک خود طرحواره با زمینه خاص تشکیل میدهد. با این حال همین دانش آموز در زمینه متفاوتی ممکن است به یاد بیاورد که در امتحان نمره بالایی گرفته است به تمام سؤال های معلم جواب داده است و شعری سروده که برای چاپ در نشریه مدرسه پذیرفته شده است. سرانجام، اگر تجربه ها در ورزش و در کلاس به قدر کافی مستمر و مکرر باشند این دانش آموز درباره خود نتیجه خواهد گرفت که در ورزشها عمدتاً بی کفایت اما در مدرسه ماهر است. این نتیجه گیری ها از لحاظ ورزشی نالایق از لحاظ عقلانی باهوش خود طرحواره های زمینه خاص دیگری را تشکیل می دهند. خود پنداره مجموعه ای از طرحواره های زمینه خاص است خود طرحواره هایی که در توصیف خودپنداره درگیرند آن دسته از زمینه های زندگی هستند که بیشترین اهمیت را برای فرد دارند مارکوس (۱۹۷۷) برای مثال زمینه های مهم در دوران کودکی، معمولاً شایستگی شناختی شایستگی جسمانی پذیرش همسالان و سلوک رفتاری هستند. در نوجوانی زمینه های عمده زندگی عموماً شایستگی تحصیلی شایستگی ورزشی، ظاهر جسمانی پذیرش همسالان روابط دوستی صمیمی جاذبه رمانتیک سلوک رفتاری یا اخلاقیات هستند هارتر (۱۹۹۰) در دانشگاه زمینه های عمده زندگی عبارت اند از شایستگی تحصیلی توانایی عقلانی شایستگی شغلی شایستگی ورزشی ظاهر جسمانی پذیرش همسالان روابط دوستی نزدیک روابط رمانتیک روابط با والدین اخلاقیات و حس شوخ طبعی هارتر ۱۹۹۰؛ نیمان و هارتر (۱۹۸۶) زمینه های خاص زندگی از فردی به فرد دیگر تفاوت دارند، اما این زمینه ها ساختار مرتبط با سن خود پنداره را نشان می دهند. ویژگیهای انگیزشی خود طرحواره ها خود طرحواره ها به دو صورت انگیزش به وجود می آورند. اول اینکه خود طرحواره ها بعد از اینکه تشکیل شدند رفتار فرد را طوری هدایت میکنند که بازخورد هماهنگ با خود طرحواره های تشکیل شده را فراخوانی میکنند یعنی چون فرد خود را خجالتی می داند. رفتار آینده اش را در زمینه های بین فردی به گونه ای هدایت میکند تا بازخوردی را به وجود آورد که خودانگاره من خجالتی ام را تأیید کند. افراد خجالتی بازخورد اجتماعی را می خواهند و از آن احساس راحتی میکنند که تأیید کند آنها خجالتی هستند درست مانند افراد شوخ طبعی که بازخورد اجتماعی را میخواهند و از آن احساس راحتی میکنند که تأیید کند آنها شوخ طبع هستند. در مقابل بازخوردی که با خود طرحواره تشکیل شده ناسازگار است، تنش انگیزشی ناشی از ناسازگاری و عدم تأیید خود به وجود می آورد که به مقاومت و استدلال مخالف می انجامد. مفهوم اساسی در پس هماهنگی خود طرحواره ها این است که اگر به فردی گفته شود درونگر است در حالی که خودش معتقد است برونگر است این بازخورد متضاد تنش انگیزشی ایجاد میکند این تنش فرد را برای بازگرداندن هماهنگی با انگیزه میکند. بنابراین افراد برای پیشگیری از احساس تنش انگیزشی ناخوشایند به صورت هماهنگ با خود طرحواره رفتار میکنند اگر این پیشگیری مؤثر واقع نشود در این صورت افراد طوری رفتار میکنند که بازخورد تازه ای را به وجود آورد تا هماهنگی خود طرحواره را به حال اول برگرداند. خود طرحواره ها همچنین برای پیش بردن خود موجود به سمت خود مطلوب آینده انگیزش به وجود می آورند خود آرمانی ممکن خیلی شبیه فرایند ایجاد ناهمخوانی در تعیین هدف رفتار هدف گرا را آغاز میکند بنابراین دانش آموزی که میخواهد هنرپیشه شود، هر اقدامی را که برای پیش بردن خود از دانش آموز بودن به هنرپیشه» شدن لازم است آغاز می کند. دانش آموز خود موجود در حالی که هنر پیشه خود آرمانی را تشکیل می دهد. جستجوی خودهای ممکن نوعی فرایند تعیین هدف است که تغییر و تحول خودپنداره را می طلبد در حالی که جستجوی نظر خودانگاره باثبات نوعی فرایند تأیید است که پایداری خود پنداره را حفظ می کند. خود باثبات بعد از اینکه فرد خود طرحواره روشنی را در زمینه خاصی تشکیل داد، به طور کلی برای حفظ کردن خود انگاره عمل میکند خود طرحواره ها بعد از تشکیل به طور فزاینده ای در برابر اطلاعات مغایر مقاوم میشوند مارکوس ۱۹۸۳،۱۹۷۷) افراد با جستجوی فعال اطلاعات هماهنگ با خودپنداره شان و با نادیده گرفتن اطلاعات مغایر با خود انگاره شان خود باثبات را حفظ میکنند. اعتقاد داشتن به اینکه یک چیز درباره خود درست است ولی به فرد گفته شود که در واقع برعکس آن صحت دارد، از لحاظ روان شناختی ناراحت کننده است. آشفتگی سیاستمداری که انتخاب محلی را می بازد یا آشفتگی قهرمان ورزشی را که برای رتبه بندی حرفه ای انتخاب نمی شود، تجسم کنید. نا هماهنگی و مغایرت نوعی ناراحتی هیجانی تولید میکنند که خبر می دهد ثبات باید به حال اول برگردانده شود. همین حالت عاطفی منفی است که انگیزش جستجوی اطلاعات و بازخورد تأیید خود و اجتناب از عدم تأیید خود را به وجود می آورد. برای اینکه مطمئن شویم دیگران ما را به همان صورت خودمان در نظر میگیرند از علائم و نمادهایی استفاده میکنیم که اعلام میدارند ما کیستیم یا فکر میکنیم هستیم. نمونه هایی از این گونه علائم و نمادها ظواهری هستند که از طریق پوشاک عادات غذایی، وزنه برداری جراحی پلاستیک و حتی اموال و نوع اتومبیلی که سوار میشویم در خود جسمانی خویش انتقال می دهیم. به علاوه برای حفاظت از خود طرحواره عمداً تعامل با افرادی را انتخاب میکنیم که با ما به صورت هماهنگ با خودانگاره مان رفتار کنند و از افرادی که طوری با ما برخورد می کنند که با خود انگاره مان هماهنگ نیست اجتناب میکنیم فرایندی که با عنوان تعامل گزینشی به آن شاره شده است رابینسون و اسمیت - لاوین، ۱۹۹۲ ،سوان پلهام و کرول، ۱۹۸۹) با انتخاب دوستانی که خود انگاره ما را تأیید میکنند و فاصله گیری از کسانی که خود انگاره ما را نفی می کنند، احتمال بازخورد تأیید کننده خود را افزایش داده و احتمال بازخورد نفی کننده خود را کاهش میدهیم تعامل گزینشی توضیح میدهد که چرا دوستان هم اتاقی ها، مربیان، معلمان نمبازی ها و همسران خاصی را انتخاب میکنیم - یعنی به دلیل اینکه از تعامل های اجتماعی رای حفظ و تأیید خودانگاره مان استفاده میکنیم (سوان (۱۹۸۷) تعامل گزینشی همچنین رضیح می دهد که چرا افراد رابطه ای را که در آن طرف مقابل آنها را به صورت متفاوت با بودشان در نظر میگیرد قطع میکنند مثلاً در طلاق فرد به وسیله ازدواج با شخصی به جای شخص دیگر تعامل با همسری را انتخاب میکند که منبع بازخورد برای ثبات خود باشد و با طلاق گرفتن از همسر خود ممکن است منبع بازخورد ناسازگار با خود را حذف کند. با وجود اقدامات پیشگیرانه گاهی بازخورد ناسازگار با خود روی می دهد همان گونه که برای سیاستمدار و ورزشکار روی داد اولین دفاع برای حفظ کردن خود باثبات تحریف اطلاعات است تا اینکه از حالت ناسازگار خارج شود. وقتی فردی با بازخورد ناسازگار با خود طرحواره روبرو میشود ممکن است بپرسد آیا بازخورد معتبر است، آیا منبع بازخورد قابل اعتماد است و این بازخورد تا چه اندازه ای مهم یا مناسب است. برای مثال دانشجویی که خود انگاره باهوش بودن دارد ولی در یک درس رد میشود ممکن است این بازخورد را نپذیرد و علیه (۱) اعتبار آن (۲) قضاوت استاد و (۳) اهمیت یا تناسب آن دلیل بیاورد. افراد همچنین با نخوت جبرانی تأیید خود و رفتارهای جدید برای تأیید خودانگاره خویش با بازخورد نفی کننده مقابله می کنند. تأیید خود در برابر تغییر خود پنداره اطمینان فرد از اینکه خود طرحواره او معتبر و درست است اطمینان از خودپنداره را تشکیل می دهد. در صورتی که اطمینان از خود پنداره زیاد باشد خود طرحواره ها را محکم میکند. بازخورد ناسازگار به ندرت خود طرحواره باثبات را تغییر میدهد با این حال چنانچه اطمینان از خود پنداره کم باشد بازخورد ناسازگار میتواند سرانجام موجب تغییر خود طرحواره شود. تعارض بین خود طرحواره نامطمئن و بازخورد ناسازگار بحران تأیید خود را برانگیخته می کند (سوان، ۱۹۸۳، ۱۹۹۹). فرایند نسبتاً پیچیده تأیید خود در شکل ۲-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. به طوری که در بالای این شکل نشان داده شده است افراد با بازنمایی خود خود طرحواره و ترجیح بازخورد تأیید کننده خود شروع میکنند. وقتی افراد به صورت علنی علائم و نمادهای چه کسی هستند (خودانگاره شان را آشکار می سازند تعامل اجتماعی روزمره آنها جریان یکنواخت تأیید خود را به وجود می آورد. فقط بعد از پدیدار شدن بازخورد اجتماعی ناسازگار با خود اوضاع شروع به پیچیده شدن می کند. افراد اطلاعات ناسازگار با خود ملایم را تقریباً خوب تحمل می کنند. ولی، تأثیر بازخورد نیرومند نفی کننده خود به راحتی پذیرفته نمی شود تأثیر چنین بازخوردی به اطمینان از خود پنداره بستگی دارد. وقتی اطمینان از خود پنداره کم باشد شکل ۲-۱۱ را ببینید)، بازخورد فصل ۱۱ ٫ خود و تلاشهای آن نیرومند می تواند بر خود طرحواره از پیش موجود غلبه کرده و تغییر خود پنداره را برانگیخته کند. با این حال چنانچه اطمینان از خودپنداره زیاد باشد در برابر بازخورد نیرومند مقاومت صورت میگیرد و فقط به عنوان یک قطعه اطلاعات جزئی ارزیابی می شود. جالب ترین مورد از لحاظ رشدی زمانی اتفاق می افتد که اطمینان از خودپنداره متوسط باشد. وقتی اطمینان از خود پنداره متوسط باشد و فرد با بازخورد نیرومند ناسازگار با خود روبرو می شود، بحران تأیید خود را تجربه خواهد کرد. فرد هنگام بحران تأیید خود قضاوت را به تأخیر می اندازد و بازخورد بیشتری را جستجو میکند اگر بازخورد بیشتر خیلی متقاعد کننده باشد بحران تأیید خود خودانگاره را تغییر نمی دهد بلکه در عوض، اطمینان از خود پنداره را پایین می آورد. همین اطمینان کم از خودپنداره است که باعث میشود فرد در برابر تغییر خود پنداره در آینده مستعد شود. توجه داشته باشید که تنها مسیر به سمت تغییر خود پنداره از طریق اطمینان کم به خود پنداره است که در سمت راست شکل ۲-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. قبل از اینکه خود پنداره تغییر کند (۱) اطمینان از خود پنداره باید پایین باشد و (۲) بازخورد ناسازگار با خود باید قوی و واضح باشد - یعنی رد کردن آن دشوار باشد (شوان، ۱۹۸۷) ناسازگار با خود باید قوی و واضح باشد - یعنی رد کردن آن دشوار باشد (شوان، ۱۹۸۷) گرچه خود پنداره میتواند تغییر کند ولی تغییر استثناست نه قاعده تغییر خود پنداره به ندرت صورت میگیرد در حالی که تأیید خود و ثبات خود پنداره رایج هستند. چرا افراد خود را تأیید میکنند؟ افراد به دلایل شناختی دانشی و عملی بازخورد تأیید خود را ترجیح می دهند. از نظر شناختی افراد به این دلیل خود را تأیید میکنند که میخواهند خودشان را بشناسند (با) خودشان صادق باشند در رابطه با مسائل دانشی افراد به این دلیل جویای تأیید خود هستند که تأیید خود برداشت از دنیا را به صورت پیش بینی پذیر و منسجم تقویت میکند (سوان و پلهام (۲۰۰۲) از لحاظ عملی افراد به این علت خود را تأیید می کنند که دوست دارند از تعامل هایی اجتناب ورزند که ممکن است آکنده از سوء تفاهم ها و انتظارات نامعقول باشند؛ آنها جویای تعامل با افرادی هستند که میدانند چه انتظاری از آنها داشته باشند (سوان، ۱۹۹۲ ۱۹۹۹؛ سوان و پلهام (۲۰۰۲) 1. epistemic شکل ۲-۱۱ فرایندهای زیربنای تأیید خود و تغییر خود پنداره خودهای ممکن گاهی خود طرحواره ها در پاسخ به بازخورد اجتماعی تغییر میکنند (شکل ۲-۱۱) اما خود طرحواره ها به احتمال بیشتری به شیوه عمدی تغییر میکنند تغییر خود طرحواره می تواند از طریق تلاش عمدی برای پیش بردن خود موجود به سمت خود ممکن مطلوب در آینده روی دهد. خودهای ممکن نظر افراد را درباره آنچه دوست دارند بشوند و همچنین آنچه می ترسند ممکن است بشوند منعکس می سازند مارکوس و نوریوس، ۱۹۸۶؛ مارکوس و رولو، (۱۹۸۹) برای مثال برخی از خودهای مورد نظر ممکن است خود موفق خود خلاق خود ثروتمند خود لاغر یا خود محبوب باشند؛ برخی از خودهایی که فرد از آنها واهمه دارد ممکن است خود بیکار خود معلول خود چاق یا خود طرد شده باشند. اینکه چگونه ممکن است فردی از خود فعلی به خود ممکن مطلوب در آینده پیشرفت کند. در شکل ۳-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. خودهای ممکن عمدتاً منشأ اجتماعی دارند، به طوری که فرد خودهایی را مشاهده میکند که توسط دیگران الگو قرار داده می شوند (مارکوس و نوریوس (۱۹۸۶) فرد خود فعلی خویش را به صورت خود موجود می بیند و الگوی نقش را به صورت خود آرمانی مطلوب آینده در نظر میگیرد وقتی فرد این اختلاف را می بیند. استنباط می کند که او نیز میتواند مانند الگوی نقش موفق در آینده موفق باشد. برای اینکه این اتفاق روی دهد فرد ویژگیها مهارتها و تواناییهای خود را با ویژگی ها مهارت ها و توانایی های الگوی نقش مقایسه میکند. این مقایسه ها حالت انگیزشی ناهماهنگی ایجاد می کنند. فرد برای رفع این ناهماهنگی تلاش میکند برنامه ریزی راهبردی می کند و ابتکار عمل لازم را به خرج میدهد تا خود فعلی را ارتقا دهد و بیشتر شبیه خود ممکن مطلوب شود. برای مثال، امکان دارد کودکی نوازندگانی را در یک کنسرت مشاهده و آرزو کند خواننده شود. خودهای ممکن بیانگر خود آینده هستند بنابراین خود ممکن از لحاظ انگیزشی مانند هدف عمل میکند خود ممکن به عنوان هدف - مانند حالت مطلوب در آینده - همانند تمام هدفها به صورت نیرویی قدرتمند عمل میکند؛ یعنی با افزایش دادن تلاش استقامت متمرکز کردن توجه و برنامه ریزی راهبردی به فصل ۸ مراجعه کنید. خودهای ممکن قطعه مهمی را به معمای چگونه خود رشد می کند، می افزایند. خودهای ممكن اصولاً بازنمایی های ذهنی ویژگیها صفات و تواناییهایی هستند که خود هنوز از آنها برخوردار نیست مثلاً، من دوست دارم پزشک شوم هر چند درباره آناتومی انسان با فنون جراحی آگاهی زیادی ندارم فردی که خود ممکنی را دنبال می کند کمتر بر 1. present self فصل ۱۱ ٫ خود و تلاشهای آن خود طرحواره های موجود و بیشتر بر خود مورد نظر اتکا میکند و سؤالهایی از این قبیل را می پرسد: اگر قرار باشد به خود ممکنم تبدیل شوم چگونه باید رفتار کنم؟ چه فعالیت هایی را باید دنبال کنم؟ به چه آموزشی نیاز دارم؟ به طوری که این سؤالها اشاره دارند، پیش بردن خود به سمت خود آرمانی نه تنها ایجاب میکند که برای خود ممکن تلاش شود، بلکه همچنین راهبردهای مؤثری برای رسیدن به آن ضرورت دارند. مفهوم خودهای ممکن خود را به صورت هستی پویا که گذشته، حال و آینده دارد، ترسیم می کند. فردی که در زمینه خاصی خود ممکن ندارد از مبنای شناختی مهم برای پرورش دادن توانایی ها در آن زمینه بی بهره است (کراس) و مارکوس (۱۹۹۴) شاید بتوانید به تلاش های گذشته خودتان که صرف چند درس مختلف دانشگاهی کردید نگاهی بیندازید و این سؤال ها را از خود بپرسید بود در برابر نبود خود ممکن در تعیین اینکه برای خواندن این کتاب حضور یافتن در کلاس و ثبت نام آن تلاش کردم چه نقشی را ایفا کرد؟ بخشی از دلیل تلاش زیاد استقامت، توجه متمرکز و برنامه ریزی راهبردی شما در یک درس خاص را می توان به وجود خود ممکن مهمی ربط داد؛ همان گونه که بخشی از دلیل اینکه چرا برای درس دیگری در دانشگاه تلاش استقامت توجه و برنامه ریزی راهبردی نداشتید می تواند به نبود خود ممکن ربط داشته باشد. فعالیتها و پیامدهای درسی روزمره از لحاظ انگیزشی مهم هستند (مثل موضوع درس بازخورد موفقیت ٫ شکست ولی بود در برابر نبود خود ممکن، چشم انداز آینده ای را اضافه میکند که به مشارکت انگیزش مبتنی بر آینده در فعالیت امروز، اشاره دارد. هویتی هویت پدیده جامعه شناختی و روان شناختی است اکسلز (۲۰۰۹)، از لحاظ جامعه شناختی هویت جایگاه با نقش فرد در جامعه است. از لحاظ روان شناختی هویت این است که آیا نقش با جایگاه اجتماعی با توصیف اجتماعی درست احساس میشود و با خود پنداره فرد ارتباط مناسبی دارد یا اینکه از نظر ناهمخوانی بین خودپنداره و نقش اجتماعی، غلط احساس می شوده (اویسر من و دستین (۲۰۱۱) انگار که فرد ۱۰۰ عکس مختلف را می بیند که افراد را در 1. identity نقش های اجتماعی مختلف نشان میدهند مثل معلم ،پلیس راننده تاکسی، کشیش و قضاوت می کند که این یکی درست احساس میشود و آن یکی غلط احساس می شوده و الی آخر هویت وسیله ای است که خود توسط آن با جامعه ارتباط برقرار می کند، به طوری که ماهیت فرد را در زمینه فرهنگی نشان میدهد فرهنگها و گروه های اجتماعی انواع هویت ها را ارائه می دهند که اعضای آنها ممکن است اختیار کنند یعنی نقشهای اجتماعی) و ممکن است از لحاظ روان شناختی با آن ارتباط برقرار کنند یعنی ارزشهای روان شناختی، وقتی فرد نقشی را بر عهده می گیرد مثل دانش آموز مادر فروشنده موسیقیدان با ارتباط اجتماعی برقرار می کند مثل لیبرال محیط گرا از آن پس آن هویت از فرد میخواهد رفتارهایی را آشکار سازد رفتارهای تأیید کننده هویت و در عین حال از رفتارهای دیگر اجتناب کند رفتارهای نفی کننده هویت، بنابراین هویتها به این دلیل مهم هستند که وقتی احساس شود رفتار با هویت هماهنگ است طبیعی و درست احساس میشود زیرا هویت را تأیید و آن را ابراز می کند و وقتی رفتار با هویت ناهماهنگ است غیر عادی و غلط احساس می شود (اوپسرمن، ۲۰۰۷) نقش ها نقش، انتظارات فرهنگی برای رفتار از فردی است که جایگاه اجتماعی خاصی دارد. هر یک از ما چند جایگاه نقش) اجتماعی داریم و اینکه در هر لحظه معینی چه نقشی را بر عهده بگیریم به موقعیتی که در آن قرار داریم و افرادی که با آنها تعامل میکنیم بستگی دارد. برای مثال، در دانشگاه که با دانشجویان دیگر و استاد تعامل میکنید نقش دانشجو» را بر عهده می گیرید. وقتی دانشگاه را ترک میکنید و به محل کار خود در کلینیک روان شناسی می روید. نقشی که بر عهده میگیرید تغییر میکند و وقتی با مراجعان تعامل میکنید، نقش مشاور» را می پذیرید. در خانه وقتی نقش مادر یا پدر را بر عهده میگیرید که با یک دختر» تعامل می کند نقش شما و نقشهای افرادی که با آنها تعامل می کنید، تغییر می کنند. وقتی افراد نقشی را به جای نقش دیگر بر عهده میگیرند شیوه عمل خود را تغییر می دهند. آنها موضوع گفتگو واژگانی که به کار میبرند لحن صدا و غیره را تغییر می دهند. با اینکه ماری هنوز همان فرد است ولی وقتی خود را به جای «مادر» در نقش «استاد» می باید به شیوه متفاوتی گفتگو می کند. ارتباطها با گروه های اجتماعی افراد علاوه بر نقش های اجتماعی با گروه های اجتماعی مانند وابستگی های مشترک من کاتولیک هستم، تمایلات مشترک من طرفدار فوتبال هستم و عقاید و ارزشهای مشترک من طرفدار محیط زیست هستم ارتباطهایی دارند. این ارتباطها به جای اختیار کردن نقش های اجتماعی تأیید ارزشهای روان شناختی هستند وقتی افراد ارتباط های خود را با گروه های اجتماعی در نظر میگیرند برخی از این ارتباطها را می پذیرند در حالی که برخی دیگر را رد میکنند - فرایند تشکیل هویت را تجربه میکنند سوئنز و همکاران ۲۰۱۱) این فرایند انتخاب کردن کدام هویتها جذب خود شوند و کدام هویتهای دیگر رد شوند، چالش رشدی دشواری است اما پاسخی را به سؤال اساسی خود برای فرد تأمین می کند: «چگونه خود را به جامعه ربط می دهم؟». افراد برای پاسخ دادن به این سؤال هویت به سطوح مختلف کاوش و تعهد نسبت به این هویتهای ممکن میپردازند که به آنها علاقه دارند و برای آنها مهیا هستند. برخی افراد سبک اطلاعاتی را اختیار میکنند که به موجب آن گزینه ها و امکانات مرتبط با هویت خود را جستجو و آنها را به صورت انتقادی ارزشیابی میکنند در حالی که افراد دیگر سبک هنجاری را اختیار می کنند که در آن به انتظارات و تجویزهای کسانی را که به آنها احترام میگذارند، متکی می شوند. این سبک های مختلف به این دلیل مهم هستند که توضیح میدهند چرا برخی افراد هویت اصیل، پیچیده و کاملاً منسجمی دارند یعنی آنهایی که سبک اطلاعاتی دارند، در حالی که دیگران هویت های نه چندان اصیل و تکه پاره دارند یعنی آنهایی که سبک هنجاری دارند و این تمایز اشاراتی برای بهزیستی فرد دارد لین ویل ۱۹۸۷؛ رایان لا گاردیا و راستورن (۲۰۰۵) موقعیت ها هویتهای خاص را برجسته میکنند هویتی که ما اختیار میکنیم تا اندازه ای به موقعیتی که خود را در آن می یابیم، بستگی دارد. بنابراین فرد در خانه مادر» است اما در اداره رئیس است. افراد چند هویت دارند، بنابراین اینکه کدام هویت رفتار جاری را هدایت کند تا اندازه ای بستگی دارد به اینکه زمینه موقعیتی کدام هویت را برجسته کرده باشد. مداخله هایی مانند مداخله از مدرسه تا شغل به دانش آموزان کمک میکنند از هویتی که در موقعیت بسیار آشنا و کاملاً تعریف شده (مدرسه) داشتند به هویت وقعیت نه چندان آشنا و نه چندان تعریف شده (کار) انتقال یابند اویر من و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) عاملیت خود از ساختارهای شناختی خودپنداره عمیق تر است خود از انگیزش درونی نیز برخوردار است که کیفیت عاملیت به آن میدهد (رایان (۱۹۹۳) عاملیت مستلزم علیت و عمل شخصی است دچارمز (۱۹۸۷) عاملیت بیانگر نظری درباره خود به صورت عمل و رشد از درون به عنوان فرایندها و انگیزشهای فطری است (دمی و رایان (۱۹۹۱) خود به عنوان عمل و رشد از درون در فصل ۶ درباره نیازهای روان شناختی ارگانیز می خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط بحث کردیم - نیازهایی که نیروی انگیزشی طبیعی برای پرورش عاملیت یعنی ابتکار عمل، عمل) فراهم می کنند. این نیازهای روان شناختی به طور جدایی ناپذیری با ماهیت فعال خود رشد کننده هماهنگ هستند دسی و رایان (۱۹۹۱) و منبع انگیزش زیربنای عاملیت را تشکیل می دهند. (یعنی دنبال کردن تمایلات جستجوی چالشهای محیطی به کار بردن مهارت ها و پرورش دادن استعدادها برای پی بردن به توانایی پرورش دادن آن و تحقق بخشیدن به آن). تمایز و یکپارچگی تمایز و یکپارچگی دو فرایند رشد فطری در خود (self) هستند. تمایز خود (self) را به صورت هستی به طور فزاینده ای پیچیده گسترش میدهد یکپارچگی این هستی پیچیده را در یک کل منسجم ترکیب میکند و به این ترتیب از خود پنداره منفرد و منسجم محافظت می نماید. تمایز زمانی صورت میگیرد که فرد از تمایلات ترجیحات و توانایی های خود به شیوه ای استفاده کند که خود نسبتاً کلی و نامتمایز در چند زمینه زندگی تخصص یابد. به عنوان مثال سابقه خود را در نظر بگیرید که یاد گرفتید تمام کامپیوترها تمام ورزشها، تمام سیاستمداران و تمام مذاهب همانند نیستند. تمایز جزئی خودش را در سادگی آشکار می سازد که در آن فرد فقط درک تک بعدی از زمینه دانش خاصی دارد تمایز غنی خودش را در درک تمایزهای دقیق و جنبه های منحصر به فرد زمینه خاصی از زندگی آشکار می سازد. انگیزش درونی تمایلات و نیازهای روان شناختی به صورت پیشتازانه خود را برای تعامل با دنیا به شیوه ای نیرومند می سازند که زمینه برای متمایز شدن آن به موجودیتی بسیار پیچیده 1. agency آماده شود. برای مثال کودکی که به هواپیماهای مدل علاقه دارد کاتالوگ ها را بررسی می کند. به باشگاه های مدل سازی میرود درباره ساختن مدل با همسالان خود صحبت می کند. مشترک مجله ای درباره آن میشود مواد جدید و روشهای ساختن گوناگون را امتحان میکند و در حال یادگیری مهارتهای تخصصی را پرورش میدهد. این انگیزش درونی خود است که به آن عاملیتی را میدهد که برای بررسی کاتالوگها رفتن به باشگاه مدل سازی، صحبت با همسالان و غیره به آن نیاز دارد و همین جریان تجربه جاری و عاملیت است که امکان تمایز و پیچیده شدن را به خود می دهد. تمایز به صورت کاهش ناپذیر پیچیدگی خود را گسترش نمیدهد، بلکه برای یکپارچگی پیچیدگی خود در خودپنداره واحد و وحدتی منسجم نوعی گرایش ترکیبی وجود دارد. یکپارچگی فرایندی سازمان دهنده است که اجزای متمایز خود را به صورت یک کل منسجم کنار هم قرار میدهد به جای اینکه خود با دهها خود طرحواره نامرتبط با حتی تا اندازه ای ناسازگار باقی بماند آن را به صورت خود پنداره واحدی در می آورد. مفاهیم عاملیت از طریق انگیزش درونی نمایز و یکپارچگی اعلام می دارند که خود از جنبه های فطری برخوردار است نیازهای روان شناختی و فرایندهای رشد نقطه شروعی را برای پرورش خود تأمین میکنند. وقتی افراد بالغ میشوند تماس بیشتری با موقعیت اجتماعی برقرار میکنند و برخی از این جنبه های دنیای اجتماعی در سیستم خود جذب و ادغام می شوند. بنابراین تصویر انگیزشی رشد خود با این دیدگاه که خود صرفاً دریافت کننده منفعل بازخورد دنیای اجتماعی خود طرحواره ها و هویت ها جایگاه ها در ترتیب اجتماعی است، مغایرت دارد. خود همچنین به صورت فعال خودش را از طریق عاملیت فطری اش پرورش می دهد. درونی سازی و یکپارچه کردن خود خود با نیازهای فطری تمایلات ،ترجیحات و توانایی هایش آماده رشد کردن و متمایز شدن است. با این حال نیاز به ارتباط فرد را در ارتباط نزدیک با مسائل و تنظیم های اجتماعی قرار می دهد و بنابراین خود هم در جهت استقلال و هم ارتباط پرورش می یابد. نیاز روان شناختی به ارتباط روابط گرم و صمیمانه با دیگران کیفیت انگیزشی است که به انگیزش پیشتازانه فرد برای درونی سازی مقررات ارزشها و مسائل اجتماعی کمک می کند. بنابراین رفتارها هیجانها و شیوه های تفکر نه تنها از درون خود، بلکه همچنین از درون موقعیت اجتماعی و جامعه سرچشمه میگیرند وقتی فرد بازی مطالعه، عمل و با دیگران تعامل میکند این افراد از او توقع دارند که از شیوه های خاص رفتار، احساس و فکر کردن تبعیت کند. بنابراین اعمال عمدی یعنی عاملیت گاهی از خود و گاهی از رهنمود و توصیه های دیگران ناشی میشوند فرایندی که افراد از طریق آن شیوه های تفکر احساس با رفتار کردن تجویز شده به صورت بیرونی را جذب میکنند و میپذیرند. درونی سازی نامیده می شود. درونی سازی به دو دلیل روی میدهد اول اینکه درونی سازی در اثر تمایل فرد به برقراری ارتباط معنی دار با دوستان ،والدین معلمان ،مربیان کارفرمایان کشیشان، خانواده و دیگران روی می دهد. بنابراین درونی سازی به وسیله نیاز به ارتباط برانگیخته می شود. دوم اینکه درونی سازی در اثر تمایل فرد به تعامل مؤثر با دنیای اجتماعی روی می دهد. بنابراین درونی سازی توسط نیاز به شایستگی برانگیخته میشود. بیشتر چیزهایی که فرد درونی میکند به عملکرد مؤثر او کمک میکنند مثل رفتن به مدرسه مسواک زدن دندان پوزش خواستن از دیگران این گونه درونی سازی برای خود ارزش بین فردی انطباقی دارد، زیرا نه تنها به کارآمدی بیشتر در تبادلهای محیطی بلکه همچنین به وحدت بیشتر بین خود و جامعه کمک می کند. مفهوم خود به عنوان عامل تأیید میکند که (۱) انسانها از یک خود اساسی برخوردارند که توسط انگیزش فطری نیرومند میشود و به وسیله فرایندهای رشد فطری تمایز و یکپارچگی هدایت می شود و (۲) تمام ساختارهای خود به طور برابر اصیل نیستند، به طوری که برخی از ساختارهای خود واقعاً خود اساسی در حالی که ساختارهای دیگر، فقط نیازها و اولویت های جامعه را منعکس میکنند رایان، ۱۹۹۳ دسی (۲۰۱۷) چون برخی از ساختارهای خود از جامعه سرچشمه میگیرند ممکن است درون خود تعارض ایجاد کنند. تعارض برعکس یکپارچگی است شرایط محیطی کنترل کننده باعث میشوند که خود نیازها و ترجیحات فطری را نادیده بگیرد و در عوض ساختار خودی را بر مبنای هدف تأیید بیرونی پرورش دهد (هاگینز و نی (۲۰۰۲) بنابراین افرادی که تأیید بیرونی خودی را که از لحاظ اجتماعی مطلوب است دنبال میکنند امکان دارد به جای شغلی که با تمایلات ترجیحات و نیازهای روان شناختی درونی آنها هماهنگ باشد شغلی را انتخاب کنند که ثروت مقام یا قدرت اجتماعی تأمین کند. خود واقعی خود واقعی درجه ای را که فرد با تجربه درونی ارتباط دارد منعکس می کند (یعنی فرد از نیازها، تمایلات و اهداف شخصی ذهن آگاه است با چنین آگاهی و ذهن آگاهی بین تجربه درونی و رفتار واقعی ارتباط نزدیکی وجود دارد در مقابل خود کاذب خودی است که در آن تجربه درونی نادیده گرفته شده سرکوب شده یا تحریف شده است. به طوری که بین تجربه درونی و رفتار فرد ارتباط اندکی وجود دارد. به طور کلی در صورتی که روابط از تلاش ها خود بیانگریها و مقاصد افراد حمایت کنند آنها از خود واقعی ذهن آگاهی و دانش شخصی کسب میکنند اما وقتی روابط و نیروهای اجتماعی عیب جویی ارزشیابی و کنترل کنند یا صرفاً بی تفاوت باشند در این صورت عملکرد خود مستقل لطمه میبیند و دفاعی می شود، درک خود تحریف شده پدیدار میشود تا با چنین نبود حمایتی انطباق یابد هورنی ۱۹۵۰ راجرز ۱۹۶۱؛ دسی و رایان ۲۰۱۷) خود هماهنگی سؤالهایی که توسط مدل خود هماهنگی پرسیده میشوند عبارت اند از: (۱) افراد چگونه تصمیم میگیرند در زندگی خود برای چه چیزی تلاش کنند؟ و (۲) چگونه این فرایند تلاش شخصی گاهی خود را پرورش میدهد و به بهزیستی کمک میکند و در مواقع دیگر به خطا می رود و بهزیستی را کاهش می دهد؟ وقتی افراد تصمیم میگیرند هدفهایی را دنبال کنند که با خود اساسی آنها هماهنگ هستند، هدف های هماهنگ با خود را دنبال میکنند شکل ۴-۱۱ به صورت نموداری این مفهوم را توضیح میدهد که هدفهای فرد ممکن است بیانگر نیازها، تمایلات و ارزشهای درونی شده او باشند یا نباشند. بر طبق نظریه خود مختاری (فصل ۵) هدف های درونی هدفهایی که از تمایلات شخصی ناشی میشوند و هدفهای خودپذیر هدف هایی که از اعتقاد یا ارزشهای فرد ناشی میشوند بیانگر هدفهای هماهنگ با خود هستند. هدف های هماهنگ با خود خود یکپارچه و عامل را منعکس و ابراز میکنند. هدف های درون فکنی شده هدف هایی که از الزامات اجتماعی ناشی میشوند و هدفهای بیرونی آنهایی که از میل به تحسین یا تقویت شدن ناشی میشوند بیانگر هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود هستند. هدف های شکل ۱۱۰۴ توضیح نموداری عمل منسجم و نامنسجم خود تا هماهنگ با خود اعمال نامنسجم را منعکس و ابراز میکنند که از فشارهای کنترل کننده درونی و بیرونی ناشی می شوند. مدل خود هماهنگی در شکل ۱۱۵ نشان داده شده است این مدل زمانی آغاز می شود که فرد هدفی را تعیین میکند برای مثال امکان دارد یک نفر هدف ازدواج دیگری هدف برقراری روابط دوستی جدید و نفر بعدی هدف ترک سیگار را تعیین کرده باشد. اولین سوالی که مدل خود هماهنگی در مورد چنین هدفی میپرسد صرفاً این است: چرا؟ چرا می خواهید ازدواج کنید؟ چرا میخواهید روابط دوستی جدید برقرار کنید؟ چرا میخواهید سیگار را ترک کنید؟ برخی هدفها از نیازها تمایلات و ترجیحات خود اساسی باشی میشوند و آنها را منعکس میکنند هدف های هماهنگ با خود در حالی که هدفهای دیگر چنین نیستند. هدف های هماهنگ با خود به این دلیل از لحاظ انگیزشی مهم هستند که تلاش بیشتر علاقه بیشتر و عاملیت بیشتر از هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود ایجاد میکنند و نگه می دارند شلدون و البوت (۱۹۹۹) تلاش علاقه و عاملیت بیشتر به ویژه وقتی با گذشت زمان ادامه یافته باشند. شکل ۱۱۵ مدل خود هماهنگی احتمال دستیابی به هدف را افزایش میدهند دستیابی به هدف هماهنگ با خود تجربیات ارضای نیاز را نیز پرورش میدهد. سرانجام اینکه همین تجربه ارضای نیاز اصیل خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط است که بهزیستی را افزایش میدهد (یعنی بالا رفتن خلق مثبت نشاط سلامت جسمانی یعنی دستیابی به هدفهای هماهنگ با خود خوراک روان شناختی برای خود تأمین میکند که بهزیستی و انگیزش عاملیت را حفظ می نماید (رایان (۱۹۹۵ هدفهای هماهنگ با خود هدفهای درونی هدفهای خودپذیر از احساس اصالت و Scanned with CamScanner انگیزش و هیجان مالکیت شخصی سرچشمه میگیرند (مثلاً می خواهم سیگار را ترک کنم، بنابراین تمایل به دنبال کردن هدف های هماهنگ با خود در زمینه عاطفه مثبت رشد شخصی و سلامت روان شناختی روی میدهد. از سوی دیگر هدفهای ناهماهنگ با خود هدف های بیرونی هدف های درون فکنی شده از احساس تعارض فشار و الزامات دیگران با ضروریات اجتماعی سرچشمه میگیرند (مثلاً من مجبورم سیگار را ترک کنم، بنابراین، میل به دنبال کردن هدف های ناهماهنگ با خود از اضطراب تعارض روان شناختی و فشار اجتماعی ناشی می شود (شلدون و کاسر (۱۹۹۸) هدفهای درونی و هدف های بیرونی فرض اساسی پژوهش درباره هدفهای درونی در برابر بیرونی این است که همه هدف ها یا آرزوهای زندگی برابر نیستند به طوری که برخی هدفها (درونی) برای سلامت روانی و عملکرد اجتماعی مفیدتر از هدفهای دیگر (بیرونی) هستند (کاسر ۲۰۱۶؛ رایان و دسی ۲۰۰۹؛ رایان و همکاران، ۱۹۹۶) برای اینکه نمونه ای از معنی این موضوع داشته باشید، یکی از هدفهای مهم زندگی خودتان را در جای خالی زیر وارد کنید هدف من در زندگی این است. هدفهای درونی آرزوها و فعالیتهای زندگی هستند که به صورت فطری خشنود کننده اند، زیرا دنبال کردن آنها فرصتهای مکرری را برای تلاشگر هدف ایجاد می کنند. تا ارضای نیاز خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط را در این راستا تجربه کند. برخی از هدف های درونی در نیمه بالای جدول ۲-۱۱ فهرست شده اند. وقتی افراد هدفهای درونی را دنبال می کنند، معمولاً جریان یکنواخت ارضای نیاز خود مختاری و شایستگی را تجربه می کنند و وقتی افراد هدفهایی را دنبال میکنند که به رشد رابطه و مشارکت در جامعه کمک می نمایند. معمولاً جریان یکنواخت ارضای رابطه را تجربه می کنند. هدفهای بیرونی آن دسته از آرزوها و فعالیتهای زندگی هستند که به توجه با تأیید دیگران نیاز دارند و بنابراین خنثی یا ناخوشایند هستند - دنبال کردن آنها افکار و رفتارهای تلاشگر را از هدف منحرف می سازد و ارضای نیاز او نادیده گرفته می شود با لطمه می بیند. برخی از هدفهای زندگی بیرونی در قسمت پایین جدول ۲-۱۱ فهرست شده اند و آرزو داشتن برای پول شهرت و ظاهر جذاب را شامل میشوند. وقتی افراد شهرت و ثروت را دنبال جدول ۲-۱۱ نمونه هایی از هدفهای درونی و هدف های بیرونی هدفهای درونی دنبال کردن خود مختاری رشد روان شناختی و رشد خود مثبت روابط صمیمی دنبال کردن پیوندهای عاطفی نزدیک صمیمیت عاطفی و رابطه بسیار رضایت بخش با دیگران مشارکت در جامعه دنبال کردن جامعه ای بهتر و دنیایی بهتر از طریق فعالیت نوع دوستانه موفقیت مالی (پول) دنبال کردن ثروت و نمادهای آن ثروت مانند اموال مادی شهرت اجتماعی دنبال کردن تحسین اجتماعی تأیید اجتماعی سرشناس بودن و تشخیص داده شدن توسط دیگران به عنوان آدم مشهور ظاهر جذاب دنبال کردن تحسین های اجتماعی و مقام اجتماعی بالا با جستجوی جذابیت از نظر بدن می کنند تجربیات ارضای نیاز خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط معمولاً ناچیز هستند. در زمینه های زندگی مثل کار ورزش دنبال کردن و رسیدن به هدفهای درونی در مقایسه با بیرونی نه تنها ارضای نیاز بیشتر بلکه همچنین مشغولیت (تلاش استقامت) یادگیری عملکرد و بهزیستی را پیش بینی میکند. علت این منافع این است که دنبال کردن هدفهای درونی ارضا کننده نیاز تلاش استقامت تفکر راهبردی و عاملیت فرد را به شیوه ای نیرومند میکند که هدفهای بیرونی این کار را انجام نمی دهند. خود تنظیمی خود تنظیمی با تعیین هدف بلند مدت آغاز میشود. هدفهای بلند مدت، مانند فارغ التحصیل 1. self-regulation Scanned with CamScanner شدن از دانشگاه یادگیری زبان خارجی و ابرقراری رابطه ای خوب، صرفاً خودشان تحقق نمی یابند. بلکه خود برای پیش بردن هدف مورد نظر به حالت نهایی مطلوب آن دستیابی به هدف باید تلاش شناختی انگیزشی و هیجانی به خرج دهد. این فرایند مدیریت خود برای تحقق بخشیدن به هدف بلند مدت خود تنظیمی نامیده میشود. به صورت رسمی تی خود تنظیمی عبارت است از برنامه ریزی اجرا نظارت و ارزیابی فراشناختی از تلاش های فرد برای هدف پینتریج، ۱۲۰۰۰ زیمر من (۲۰۰۲) آینده نگری از طریق تأمل خود تنظیمی فرایندی است که با تعیین هدف بلند مدت شروع میشود و هر یک از موارد زیر را دربر دارد که با گذشت زمان روی میدهد . برنامه ریزی و تفکر راهبردی . عمل کردن و خویشتنداری . نظارت و وارسی کردن . تأمل و تنظیم کردن بعد از اینکه فرد هدف بلند مدتی را تعیین میکند تا برای آن تلاش کند، رسیدن به آن هدف باید برنامه ریزی شود؛ فرد یک برنامه عمل به وجود می آورد؛ برای به ثمر رساندن این هدف راهبردهایی را به کار میبرد؛ و اجرای قصدها را ایجاد میکند بعد از اینکه فرایند تعیین هدف تشکیل شد فرد به سمت تلاش برای هدف و خویشتنداری پیش میرود. تلاش برای هدف به کار شناختی انگیزشی و هیجانی نیاز دارد زیرا برنامه ها راهبردها و اجرای قصدها باید عملی شوند در حالی که خویشتنداری به جلوگیری از تکانه های متعارض هدف کوتاه مدت حواسپرتی ها و وسوسه ها نیاز دارد وقتی تلاش برای هدف با گذشت زمان پدیدار می شود. فرد باید اختلاف هدف - عملکرد را زیر نظر بگیرد و ببیند آیا این اختلاف کاهش یافته و پیشرفت صورت گرفته است یا نه سرانجام فرد باید به این موضوع فکر کند که چرا خود تنظیمی موفق شده با شکست خورده است. بعد از اینکه فرد موفقیت یا شکست خود را تشخیص داد به آن فکر کرد و آن را درک کرد تلاشهای خود تنظیمی آینده باید اصلاح و به روز شوند تا فرد بتواند برای موفقیت در خود تنظیمی آینده در وضعیت بهتری قرار گیرد. به طوری که در شکل ۱۱۶ توضیح داده شده است خود تنظیمی یک فرایند جاری و چرخشی است زیمرمن (۲۰۰۰) و این موارد را شامل میشود آینده نگری (تعیین هدف برنامه ریزی راهبردی عمل تلاش برای هدف خویشتنداری و تأمل نظارت بر خود و ارزیابی خود که به آینده نگری بیشتر قبل از فرصت بعدی عملکرد منجر می شود. ماهیت جاری و چرخشی خود تنظیمی زمانی آشکار میشود که تأمل درباره موفقیت ها و شکست های خود تنظیمی فرد به آینده نگری جدید و بنابراین به خود تنظیمی مؤثرتر در آینده بینجامد. شکل ۱۱۶ مراحل چرخشی خود تنظیمی پرورش دادن خود تنظیمی شایسته تر هر کسی به خود تنظیمی می پردازد اما برخی افراد بهتر از دیگران از عهده آن بر می آیند. اکثر پژوهشگران خود تنظیمی را به صورت مهارت خود (self) مهارتی که باید فراگیری شود، بهبود یابد و اصلاح شود در نظر میگیرند شانک و زیمرمن (۱۹۹۷) خود تنظیمی به عنوان مهارت اکتسابی زمانی آشکارتر است که افراد هدف بلند مدتی را در زمینه ای نا آشنا دنبال کنند (مثل دانشجویی که برای اولین بار در کلاس ممتازی ثبت نام میکند کارمندی که شغل تازه ای را به طوری که در شکل ۷-۱۱ نشان داده شده است خود تنظیمی مستلزم توانایی

آنها این است که افراد بیشتر از ارضای به تأخیر افتاده که از هدفهای بلند مدت حاصل میشود، مجذوب ارضای فوری پاداش های کوتاه مدت میشوند رفتار تکانشی سریع و راحت است - صرفاً به جای اینکه به Scanned with CamScanner سر کار بروید تسلیم شوید و شیرینی بخورید الکل بنوشید و بازی ویدیویی کنید. مشکل این جذابیت های کوتاه مدت این است که اغلب با دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت، ناسازگار و حتی متضاد هستند. یعنی اگر بازی ویدیویی کنید به سختی میتوانید کار خود را به اتمام برسانید. جذابیت های کوتاه مدت این است که اغلب با دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت، ناسازگار و حتی متضاد هستند. یعنی اگر بازی ویدیویی کنید به سختی میتوانید کار

برای خوردن غذای سالم نه تنها باید میوه و سبزیجات بیشتری مصرف کنیم، بلکه به طور همزمان باید در برابر میل به خوردن کیک شکلاتی بستنی و هر چیز راحت دیگر بگیر و برو در فروشگاه مقاومت کنیم خویشتنداری توانایی جلوگیری مهار کردن و حتی نادیده گرفتن میل تکانشی به دنبال کردن هدف کوتاه مدت است بائر) و با میستر (۲۰۱۱) خویشتنداری توانایی قطع کردن گرایش ما به راهنمای خودکار و جذابیتهای کوتاه مدت و به جای آن هدایت کردن عمدی رفتار در مسیر هدف بلند مدت است. در سطح محاوره ای خویشتنداری نیروی اراده است. برای اینکه خویشتنداری را در عمل احساس کنید آزمایش تربچه را در نظر بگیرید با میستر بر اتسلاوسکی موراون و تایس (۱۹۹۸) شرکت کنندگان در گروه آزمایشی ابتدا تکلیفی را انجام میدهند که به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد در حالی که شرکت کنندگان در گروه گواه تکلیف مشابهی را انجام میدهند که به خویشتنداری نیاز ندارد بعداً، تمام شرکت کنندگان به تکلیف نامربوطی که به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد جابجا میشوند. فرضیه این است؛ چون خویشتنداری تحلیل برنده است خسته کننده پرزحمت شرکت کنندگانی که تکلیف اولیه خویشتنداری را انجام میدهند خسته میشوند و بنابراین در تکلیف خویشتنداری بعدی به طور نامناسب تر از شرکت کنندگان گروه گواه عمل می کنند. در تحقیق تربچه آزمایشگران از تمام شرکت کنندگان خواستند قبل از تحقیق، حداقل به مدت سه ساعت هیچ چیزی نخورند. وقتی شرکت کنندگان وارد آزمایشگاه شدند، آزمایشگران ترتیبی دادند تا بوی کیک شکلاتی که تازه پخته شده بود در هوا پخش شود. وقتی شرکت کنندگان نشستند تا تحقیق شروع شود جلوی آنها روی میز مقداری از آن کیک شکلاتی تازه و یک کاسه تربچه تازه قرار داشت برای شرکت کنندگان در گروه آزمایشی تکلیف خویشتنداری زیاد تعیین شده بود که در آن باید تربچه میخوردند و در برابر خوردن کیک شکلاتی مقاومت میکردند در حالی که برای شرکت کنندگان در گروه گواه چنین تکلیف خویشتنداری تعیین نشده بود و آنها میتوانستند هرچه میخواستند بخورند. بعد از پنج دقیقه شرکت کنندگان به اتاق دیگری برده شدند و چند مسئله هندسه به آنها داده شد که حل کردن آنها غیر ممکن بود (مثلاً، شکل هندسی را بدون ردیابی هر خط یا بلند کردن مداد از روی کاغذ دنبال کنید. آزمایش این بود که آزمودنیها قبل از دست کشیدن چه مدت مقاومت خواهند کرد. به طور میانگین شرکت کنندگانی که کیک شکلاتی خورده بودند به مدت ۱۹ دقیقه مقاومت کردند اما شرکت کنندگانی که تربچه خورده و جلوی میل به خوردن کیک شکلاتی را گرفته بودند، فقط ۸ دقیقه مقاومت کردند شرکت کنندگانی که تربچه خورده بودند، از سطح یکسان انرژی برای مقاومت در برابر مسائل دشوار برخوردار نبودند. متأسفانه زندگی تکلیف مداوم سعی در مقاومت کردن در برابر مسائلی است که با کیک شکلاتی تازه برابرند. اکنون پژوهشگران در حدود ۱۰۰ آزمایش با استفاده از الگوی پژوهشی که در فوق شرح داده شد انجام داده اند و هفت حوزه کلی خویشتنداری را مشخص کرده اند با میستر و وس ۲۰۰۷ ها گر وود استف و چانزیسار انتیس (۲۰۱۰) . جلوگیری از تکانه ها و امیال . مدیریت و جلوگیری از هیجانها . کنترل کردن و جلوگیری از افکار . کنترل کردن توجه . تصمیم گیری و انتخاب های زیاد . مدیریت اظهاری که فرد به دیگران بیان میکند . مهربان بودن با افراد پر توقع و دشوار و کنار آمدن با آنها در آزمایش های جداگانه ای درباره خویشتنداری پژوهشگران از شرکت کنندگان درخواست کردند با جلوگیری از تکانه ها و امیال مانند مقاومت در برابر شیرینی جات و غذاهای حاضر و آماده (وس، با میستر و سیاروچو (۲۰۰۵) و میل به مشروبخواری و کشیدن سیگار (موراون و شمولی (۲۰۰۶) خویشتنداری نشان دهند؛ با جلوگیری از واکنشهای هیجانی طبیعی مانند گریه نکردن در حال تماشای فیلم بسیار غم انگیز هیجانها را مدیریت کنند (موراون نایس و با میستر (۱۹۹۸) یا از واکنشهای انزجار در حال نگاه کردن به شینی آلوده جلوگیری کنند. دماری را بنسیون و پو (۲۰۰۶؛ با جلوگیری از افکار ناخواسته افکار را کنترل

مقدار زیادی تصمیم گیری و انتخاب کنند وس و همکاران، ۲۰۰۸)؛ با معرفی خود به صورت فردی شایسته و دوست داشتنی تأثیری که بر دیگران می گذارند مدیریت کنند (وس، با میستر و سیاروچی (۲۰۰۵) و با مؤدب بودن هنگام تعامل با افراد بسیار دشوار و پر توقع مهربان باشند فینکل و همکاران (۲۰۰۶) کاهش انرژی یافته های به دست آمده از آزمایش تربچه اشاره دارند که خویشتنداری بیش از یک مهارت است. خویشتنداری ذخیره انرژی است که به نظر می رسد فقط به مقدار محدود وجود دارد. افراد بعد از اعمال خویشتنداری به طور موقتی مقداری از توانایی خود را برای خویشتنداری آینده از دست میدهند. همچنین وقتی افراد توانایی خود را برای خویشتنداری از دست می دهند، به احتمال زیاد گرفتار امیال و وسوسه های تکانشی میشوند. این شیوه تفکر به ارائه مدل توان محدود خویشتنداری انجامیده است با میستر و همکاران ۲۰۰۷ موراون (۲۰۱۲) که میتوان آن را به صورت سه قضیه زیر بیان کرد: ۱ مقدار یا توان نیروی اراده برای خویشتنداری موفقیت آمیز حیاتی است. اعمال خویشتنداری مقداری از این منبع را کاهش می دهد و بنابراین تلاشهای بعدی برای خویشتنداری به احتمال زیاد شکست می خورند. چنین مدلی این سؤال را می طلبد که چه چیزی هنگام تلاشهای خویشتنداری کاهش می یابد. به نظر می رسد که پاسخ سوخت گلوکز مغز باشد گایلیوت و با میستر، ۲۰۰۷؛ گایلیوت و همکاران (۲۰۰۷) گلوکز در بدن از غذا ساخته میشود. هنگام گوارش این قند تولید و در جریان خون آزاد می شود و از آنجا به سمت عضلات قلب کند دستگاه ایمنی و مغز می رود. مغز مصرف کننده بزرگ انرژی است و حدود ۲۰ درصد از سوخت گلوکز بدن یعنی کالری ها را مصرف میکند. گلوکز عملاً وارد مغز نمی شود بلکه در عوض به چیزی که مغز مصرف میکند تبدیل می شود یعنی انتقال دهنده های عصبی اگر مغز بدون انتقال دهنده های عصبی بماند، در این صورت تفکر را متوقف میکند و اگر مغز تفکر را متوقف کند تکانشی تر می شود و کنترل اجرایی کمتری اعمال میکند تمام این زیست شناسی پیچیده به این درک ساده خلاصه می شود: «نبود گلوکز، نبود نیروی اراده با میستر و تیرنی ۲۰۱۱، ص ۴۹) اگر استدلال فوق درست باشد در این صورت افرادی که خویشتنداری اعمال میکنند باید کاهش چشمگیری در سطح گلوکز خود نشان دهند. پژوهش نشان می دهد که این دقیقاً همان چیزی است که اتفاق می افتد و علاوه بر آن کاهش گلوکز نسبتاً سریع و زیاد است گایلیوت و با میستر، ۲۰۰۷ گایلیوت و همکاران (۲۰۰۷) یعنی اگر شما از گلوکز در سطح «X» برخوردار باشید و بعد به تکلیف خویشتنداری مانند جلوگیری از یک هوس بپردازید. در این صورت به سرعت سطح گلوکز کمتر از X خواهید داشت. این کاهش گلوکز را به راحتی می توان به وسیله گلوکز سنج تأیید کرد. در آزمایش کاهش شرکت کنندگان به یک رشته تکالیف خویشتنداری پرداختند - یکی پس از دیگری گلوکز به طرز محسوسی کاهش یافت که به عملکرد ضعیف در تکلیف انجامید. وقتی به آزمودنی ها از قبل هشدار داده شد که آنها یک رشته تکالیف خویشتنداری انجام خواهند داد یعنی از شما درخواست خواهد شد تا سخت فکر کنید و تکانه را نادیده بگیرید، صرفاً انتظار خویشتنداری کافی بود تا گلوکز و عملکرد در تکلیف کاهش یابد موراون شمولی و بارکلی (۲۰۰۶) تکمیل انرژی خویشتنداری گلوکز را کاهش میدهد اما وقتی افراد از آن آگاه باشند، می توانند قبل از تکلیف خویشتنداری چالش انگیز یک لیوان آب پرتقال لیموناد یا شیر بستنی مملو از گلوکز بخورند. خویشتنداری چالش انگیز یک لیوان آب پرتقال لیموناد یا شیر بستنی مملو از گلوکز بخورند. انجام این کار به طور چشمگیری به افراد کمک میکند تا خویشتنداری مؤثری اعمال کنند (هاگر و همکاران (۲۰۱۰) لزومی ندارد که گلوکز از طریق نوشیدنی قند دار مصرف شود، بلکه این سریع ترین راه دریافت گلوکز برای مغز است به طوری که افراد دیابتی به شما خواهند گفت. غذاهایی که قند کم و پروتئین زیاد نیز دارند بادام ها میوه ها گوشت، پنیر به خوبی عمل میکنند ولی زمان بیشتری طول میکشد تا سوخت مغز را تولید کنند. این اثر غذایی باعث شد که پژوهشگران خویشتنداری به توصیه ای عملی برسند قبل از اینکه روز خود را که به مقدار زیادی خویشتنداری نیاز دارد آغاز کنید، صبحانه خوبی بخورید. خویشتنداری گلوکز را کاهش میدهد اما فقط زمانی این کار را انجام می دهد که خویشتنداری به معنی جلوگیری از میل کوتاه مدت جذابی باشد خوردن شیرینی جات، کشیدن سیگار بازی ویدیویی تا اینکه هدف بلند مدتی که جذابیت کمتری دارد، دنبال شود (مطالعه به مدت چند ساعت نوشتن فهرست طولانی از کارهای روزمره کنترل خشم هنگام یک مذاکره) جالب اینکه اگر ابتدا فرد در حالت خلق مثبت قرار داده شود مثلاً با تماشای فیلم خنده دار کاهش گلوکز و عملکرد ضعیف روی نمیدهند تایس با میستر شمولی و موراون (۲۰۰۷) همچنین وقتی افراد هدفهای بلندمدنی را دنبال میکنند که نیازهای روان شناختی خود مختاری شایستگی و ارتباط را ارضا میکنند کاهش گلوکز و عملکرد ضعیف روی نمی دهند (موراون (۲۰۰۸) در واقع دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدتی که نیاز روان شناختی را ارضا می کند به جای اینکه انرژی و عملکرد را کاهش دهد عملاً آنها را افزایش می دهد (مولان دسی و رایان ۲۰۰۶ موراون گاگن و روزمن (۲۰۰۸) نیرومندی خویشتنداری را میتوان از طریق تمرین نیز افزایش داد (با میستر، کایلیوت، دوال و اوتن (۲۰۰۶) برای مثال شرکت کنندگان به مدت دو هفته هر روز روی نظارت بر وضع اندامی و بهبود بخشیدن به آن یا زیر نظر گرفتن غذایی که هر روز میخوردند، خویشتنداری را تمرین کردند موراون و همکاران (۱۹۹۹) نظارت بر وضع اندامی به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد. زیرا فرد باید همواره عادت قوز کردن را نادیده بگیرد مثل موقع نشستن، ایستادن زیر نظر گرفتن مصرف روزانه غذا به خویشتنداری نیاز دارد زیرا فرد باید سبک خوردن بگیر و برو را مهار کند. بعد از دو هفته تمرین خویشتنداری شرکت کنندگان آموزش دیده خویشتنداری بیشتری از شرکت کنندگان گواه آموزش ندیده نشان دادند آرمیدگی نیز از افراد در برابر کاهش خویشتنداری و شکست خود تنظیمی محافظت میکند تیلر و برنز (۲۰۰۸) مدل نیروی محدود خویشتنداری نمایش نموداری مدل نیروی محدود خویشتنداری در شکل ۹-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. خویشتنداری مؤثر استفاده از نیروی اراده برای تبدیل دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت به دستیابی آن است. این هدف اساسی خود تنظیمی در سه بخش خاکستری شکل ۹-۱۱ نشان داده شده است. اما به طوری که با خط ضخیم رو به پایین نشان داده شده است، خویشتنداری منبع محدودی است که با جلوگیری مهار کردن و نادیده گرفتن تکانه ها و چیزهای جذاب کوتاه مدت کاهش می یابد کاهش به نوبه خود شکست در هدف بلند مدت و خود تنظیمی را پیش بینی و توجیه میکند همان گونه که خویشتنداری دستیابی به هدف بلند مدت و موفقیت خود تنظیمی را پیش بینی و توجیه میکند. مدل نیروی محدود همچنین توضیح می دهد که چگونه ممکن است خویشتنداری افزایش یابد - مثلاً از طریق تکمیل مواد غذایی و ارضای نیاز روان شناختی و همچنین چگونه ممکن است از طریق آموزش و تمرین محافظت شود. یک قلم که در شکل ۱۱۹ ترسیم نشده است باز هم نیاز به در نظر گرفتن و بحث کردن دارد. سمت چپ بالای این شکل مستطیل دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت را نشان می دهد، اما فصل ۱۱ ٫ خود و تلاشهای آن شکل ۹-۱۱ مدل کامل نیروی محدود خویشتنداری افراد غالباً سعی میکنند در هر زمان بیش از یک هدف بلند مدت را دنبال کنند. برای مثال دانشجویان سعی میکنند از لحاظ تحصیلی موفق شوند اما در عین حال می کوشند وضع مالی خود را بهتر کنند روابط متزلزل خود را اصلاح نمایند و برای کاهش وزن رژیم بگیرند. بنابراین مستطیل اضافی برای دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت ۲ و دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت نیز میتوانند به شکل ۹-۱۱ افزوده شوند. مسئله دنبال کردن هدف بلند مدت متعدد این است که مسیر مطمئنی به تحلیل بردن خود و شکست خود تنظیمی است. مسئله این است که مطالعه به مدت روزی چهار ساعت مستلزم جلوگیری از تعداد زیادی امیال و چیزهای جذاب کوتاه مدت است همانگونه که رژیم گرفتن و سعی در کاهش دادن وزن جلوگیری از تعداد زیادی امیال و چیزهای جذاب کوتاه مدت را ایجاب میکند. دنبال کردن چندین هدف بلند مدت به طور همزمان خیلی تحلیل برنده است. پژوهش نشان میدهد که بهتر است هر بار یک هدف بلند مدت دنبال شود و گنجایش محدود خویشتنداری صرف آن هدف بلند مدت شود شمولی و

Не то, чтобы я не любила тестя, но всё равно продолжала испытывать в его присутствии лёгкий трепет, так как ствол обреза, направленный в лицо, не смогла забыть даже спустя долгих пять лет. Но, всё же, зная, насколько сильно он не любит принимать отказы, пошла. Чтобы уже через добрых полтора часа сидеть в милой кафешке напротив мужчины, как обычно красующемуся в белоснежном костюме. - Тея, доброе утро, - поздоровался он и, решив не тратить ни минуты лишнего времени, перешёл к делу. – Я слышал, что ты с отличием окончила институт и… На что я лишь тяжко вздохнула от осознания, что информация дошла до него слишком быстро, так как свою учёбу окончила я всего лишь неделю назад, немногим раньше положенного срока сдав экзамены. И никому не говорила об этом, намереваясь немного отдохнуть. А теперь отдых явно провалился. - Да, закончила, - слишком тихо для хвастовства выдохнула я и, понадеявшись на удачу, добавила. – Мы с Медеей в честь этого хотели съездить… Но, разумеется, услышана всё равно не была, так как мужчина, зовущийся по мнению мамы Тори ругательным именем Адриан, уже углубился в недра своего телефона и вовсе перестал обращать на меня внимания. - Так, по экономике у тебя были отличные результаты, - пользуясь подсказкой, озвучил он плоды моих злосчастных трудов. – По делопроизводству и информатике тоже неплохо, - и закончил, разумеется, самым пугающим. – Так что думаю, что сейчас ты вполне готова встать у руля моего бизнеса. Я выдохнула, ещё надеясь на чудо в виде мнения любимой доченьки, и снова попыталась завести старую песню. - Но мистер Кранц, мне сейчас совсем некогда, - робко пропищала я, начиная на всякий случай оглядываться по сторонам, выискивая пути отступления. – У нас с Медеей уже куплена путёвка в тёплые страны. На что любимый тесть снова не отреагировал должным образом. - Думаю, месяца тебе хватит, чтобы показать свои способности, - немного задумчиво произнёс он, раскрывая мой обман и высказывая чудесную осведомленность в жизни единственного чада. – Как раз Медее нужно проходить практику. Приступаешь с понедельника, посмотрим, насколько сильно вы двое сможете разнести мой офис. - Доброе утро, госпожа директор, - поздоровалась длинноногая блондинистая секретарша, вежливо раскрывая передо мной двери изысканного кабинета. Из чего я и сделала два бесценных вывода. Первый из которых состоял в том, что выволоку сегодня устроят не только мне, так как моя ласковая половина никому не простит оставление меня в опасной близости с подозрительной красавицей секретаршей. Но не успела я, как следует вкусить предлагаемый плод мирового господства, как сладкие грёзы снова прервала длинноногая секретарша. - Миссис Кранц, я принесла Вам месячные отчёты по отделам и подготовленные ими проекты, - сообщила она, кладя на мой стол документы и бесстыдно демонстрируя бюст. Проверьте, пожалуйста, и поставьте свою подпись на тех, с которыми согласны. После чего девушка вышла, оставляя после себя аромат приятных духов, да воспоминая о весьма пышном бюсте, не как не проходили и поняв что больше не могу бороться со своими чувствами к ней , вызвала секретаршу к себе в кабинет, зайдя в него она закрыла дверь на ключ и игриво мне прошептала : “Миссис Кранц, я заметила, что вы мне интересуетесь. Если вы хотите, мы можем поговорить подробнее после работы…” Услышав эти слова, я замерла на месте, чувствуя смесь страха и возбуждения. Я неожиданно осознала, что мои чувства к этой секретарше гораздо сильнее, чем я хотела признать самой себе. Она была так красива и загадочна, и я не могла устоять перед искушением Как же я могла предаться таким непристойным мыслям? Я тут же отмахнулась от них и привела себя в порядок. Я была счастливо замужем и никогда не собиралась изменять мужу. Это просто была ситуация, вызывающая смущение и неприятные мысли. Я отложила отчеты в сторону, решив вернуться к ним позже. Мне нужно было сфокусироваться на своей работе и забыть о прошедшей секунде с искушением. Я взяла пару глубоких вдохов и включила компьютер. Весь день я старалась удержаться от мыслей о секретарше и сосредоточиться на делах. Она находилась в другом крыле офиса, и я аккуратно избегала встреч с ней. Но вечером, когда все уже ушли, и офис был тихим и пустынным, я не смогла устоять и решила отправиться на свидание с опасным искушением, встретившись в моём кабинете, мы провели незабываемые часы вместе, поняв что возвращаться домой поздно, она предложила поехать к ней, вызвав такси мы сели в машину, где она всю дорогу меня целовала и ласкала, подъехав к дому, она за руку вытащим меня из машины, стала целуя ввести к подъезду, подойдя к двери, целуя шею, она стала искать ключи от своей квартиры, найдя их открыв дверь, она втолкнула меня внутрь и закрыла за нами дверь, не отпуская меня она стала расстёгивать мою куртку, мою шапку она кинула на тумбочку, став толкать меня в спальню, упав на кровать, целуясь я вдруг услышала звук своего телефона и сквозь поцелуй сказала ей телефон, но она сказала, не думай об этом, сейчас ты моя, не желая тоже прерывать наш с ней поцелуй, я сказала любовь моя , я должна ответить, но увидев незнакомый номер, прижалась к ней сказала мне страшно, прижав меня сильнее, поцеловав меня она сказала : “Не бойся, я здесь с тобой. Ответь на звонок, если это важно, а потом мы продолжим то, что начали.” Я разлучилась от неё, взяла телефон и ответила на звонок. звонила незнакомая мне девушка, которая представилась любовницей моего мужа, поняв что мой муж мне изменял, я выключила телефон и вернулась в комнату, сказав ей что я больше не замужем и никто нам теперь не будет мешать, я спросила у неё, ты выйдешь замуж за меня?","output":"Я сжала ее руку и сказала, что это слишком рано говорить о замужестве, но я готова дать ей шанс.

The executive branch is headed by the President who serves as the head of state and the head of government. The President is elected by popular vote and has a term limit of one six-year term. The legislative branch, known as the Congress, is composed of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate consists of 24 members who are elected nationwide, while the House of Representatives has 297 members who are elected through district and sectoral representation. Lastly, the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting and applying the laws of the land. It is headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of a Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices. The Philippine political structure is built upon the principle of checks and balances, where each branch serves as a check on the other to prevent abuse of power. This structure ensures that no single branch dominates the government, thereby promoting accountability and transparency. The President is responsible for executing the laws, commanding the armed forces, and managing the affairs of the state. The Congress, on the other hand, is tasked with making laws, approving national budgets, and overseeing government actions. The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the constitution, settle legal disputes, and protect individual rights. This system of separation of powers helps maintain a balance of authority and promotes the democratic ideals on which the Philippines was founded. Reference: Philippine Information Agency. (n.d.).

Negotiation and Communication: The bank should engage in active negotiation and communication with the landowner or lessor to address their concerns and convince them to provide consent. This can involve explaining the benefits of the BSA for both parties and assuring the lessor of their rights and protections. 2. Offering Incentives: The bank can offer certain incentives to the lessor in exchange for their consent. This can include financial compensation, additional lease terms, or other favorable terms that could incentivize the lessor to agree to the BSA. 3. Guarantees and Indemnities: The bank can provide guarantees or indemnities to the lessor to mitigate their concerns regarding the potential termination or amendment of the lease. These guarantees can ensure that the lessor will receive adequate notice and compensation in case of any changes. 4. Legal Documentation: The bank should work with legal experts to draft a comprehensive and airtight BSA agreement that protects both parties' interests. This can include clear provisions regarding lease protection, termination rights, and amendment procedures to provide certainty and assurance to the lessor. Legal Comment: The lessor's consent is required for the BSA over the land lease agreement as per CIMBT's standard process. This consent ensures that the bank enjoys certain rights and protections, such as the lessor not amending the lease without the bank's knowledge, informing the bank prior to asset sale or disposal, not terminating the lease without the bank's consent, and enabling the purchaser of lease rights to continue as the lessee. However, in the event that the lessor does not provide consent, the bank can still register the BSA without it. Nevertheless, this course of action would result in the bank losing certain rights, particularly in relation to the lessor's amendment and termination rights. This is a significant concern, especially when the financed buildings are standing on the lease for which the bank has no certainty that the lessor will refrain from terminating or amending the lease without prior notice to the bank. Therefore, it is crucial for the bank to actively mitigate this risk by engaging in negotiation and communication, offering incentives, providing guarantees and indemnities, and carefully drafting legal documentation to minimize the potential negative implications of the lessor's non-consent."},{"instruction":"向我介绍下植物dna提取的CTAB法","output":"植物DNA提取的CTAB法是一种实验室常用的方法来提取和净化植物组织中的DNA。该方法非常适合高分子量DNA的提取，并且能够有效地去除蛋白质和多糖等杂质。CTAB全称是十六烷基三甲基溴化铵（Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide），是一种阳离子表面活性剂，它通过与DNA分子结合来使DNA沉淀，从而分离出来。 CTAB法大致的步骤包括： 1. 样本准备：首先，收集新鲜或冻存的植物组织样本并研磨成粉末，通常使用液氮冷冻的组织以防止DNA降解。 2. 细胞裂解：将研磨好的样本转移到含有CTAB提取缓冲液的试管中。提取缓冲液可能含有抗氧化剂如β-巯基乙醇，以防止DNA氧化，以及一些蛋白酶如蛋白酶K，用以降解蛋白质。 3. 去除杂质：使用氯仿：异丙醇混合液（24:1）进行液-液萃取，以分离DNA和蛋白质、多糖等。随后将上层含有DNA的水相转移到新的试管中。 4.

У меня есть modelpart для сущности и я хочу сделать её прозрачной.","output":"Для реализации прозрачности в модде Minecraft на Fabric, вам нужно будет работать с системой рендеринга и материалами, используемыми для отрисовки моделей сущностей. Вот основные шаги: 1. **Создайте свой материал** Чтобы сделать часть модели прозрачной, вам потребуется использовать специальный материал, который поддерживает прозрачность. Вы можете создать свой RenderLayer (это способ, с помощью которого Minecraft отрисовывает разные слои, такие как солидные блоки, прозрачные блоки, облака и т. д.). Пример создания RenderLayer с поддержкой прозрачности: \`\`\`java RenderLayer myTransparentLayer = RenderLayer.of( \\"my_transparent_layer\\", // Название слоя VertexFormats.POSITION_COLOR_TEXTURE_LIGHT, // Формат вершин VertexFormat.DrawMode.QUADS, // Способ рисования 256, // Максимальный размер буфера true, // Необходимость сортировки глубины true, // Использование прозрачности RenderLayer.MultiPhaseParameters.builder() .transparency(Transparency.TRANSLUCENT_TRANSPARENCY) .texture(new RenderPhase.Texture(texture, false, false)) // Текстура сущности // Добавьте остальные необходимые параметры для вашего слоя, такие как шейдер, свет и т.п. .build(true) ); \`\`\` 2. **Используйте новый слой при отрисовке** Вы должны убедиться, что ваш механизм отрисовки использует этот новый слой при отрисовке модели. Вам, возможно, придется переопределить метод отрисовки сущности, чтобы встроить использование вашего \`myTransparentLayer\`. \`\`\`java @Override public void render(MyEntity entity, float entityYaw, float partialTicks, MatrixStack matrixStack, VertexConsumerProvider buffer, int packedLightIn) { VertexConsumer vertexConsumer = buffer.getBuffer(myTransparentLayer); // Рендер модели с использованием vertexConsumer. } \`\`\` 3. **Настройка прозрачности текстуры** Если вы хотите, чтобы определенные части модели были прозрачными, вы должны также убедиться, что текстура этих частей имеет альфа канал (то есть формат текстуры поддерживает прозрачность, например, PNG). Помните, что рендеринг прозрачных объектов в Minecraft может быть сложным из-за того, как рендеринг выполняется в определенном порядке для предотвращения визуальных ошибок, таких как проблема сортировки глубины.

Your loop is not complete and doesn't use the variables defined in the \`continents_info\` list. Furthermore, the \`setup_continent\` function, which was correctly defined to handle the presentation, is not called within the loop. Here's what needs to be fixed: 1. You should call the \`setup_continent\` function within the loop, passing the proper parameters, so that it presents the continent, countries, and facts. 2. You should remove the extra \`stage.set_background(\\"summer\\")\` line inside the loop; instead, use the \`bg_image\` associated with each continent. 3. Ensure you initialize the stage with \`stage = codesters.Stage()\` at the beginning of your program if it hasn't been done elsewhere. 4. Finally, you'll notice the script lacks a correct environment to run \`stage.play()\`, but in Codesters, the \`stage.play()\` isn't required as the script runs in their custom environment. Here is the corrected loop: \`\`\`python # Assuming all your function and list definitions above this are correct. # Loop through each continent's info and call the setup function for continent, country1, fact1, country2, fact2, bg_image, x, y in continents_info: stage.set_background(bg_image) setup_continent(continent, country1, fact1, country2, fact2, bg_image, x, y) \`\`\` This will properly iterate through each continent's information, set the background, and call \`setup_continent\` to handle the details for each continent.

However, that line should not be inside the loop because each continent should have its specific background image set. Let me correct this for you. Just remove the line \`stage.set_background(\\"summer\\")\` from inside the loop and ensure that each call to the \`setup_continent\` function uses the \`bg_image\` variable to set the correct background for each continent. Here's how your corrected loop should look: \`\`\`python # Loop through each continent's info and call the setup function for continent, country1, fact1, country2, fact2, bg_image, x, y in continents_info: stage.set_background(bg_image) # will set the background specific to each continent setup_continent(continent, country1, fact1, country2, fact2, bg_image, x, y) \`\`\` If you intend to start the script with a \\"summer\\" background before displaying continent information, you can set the background to \\"summer\\" just once before the loop starts. So, if you want to start with a \\"summer\\" themed background, the top of the script, after creating the stage, would be: \`\`\`python # Create the stage stage = codesters.Stage() # Initial background before the loop stage.set_background(\\"summer\\") # List of continents, countries, fun facts, and positions # ... (this portion remains unchanged) # The loop and rest of the code # ... (this portion remains unchanged) \`\`\` Be sure to include the correct definitions for all parts of the script—the functions, the list of continent information, the loop to go through each continent, and the sprite if applicable.

Since your request is a bit unclear, I'll provide a couple of different interpretations. Please let me know if one of these fits your needs or provide more details if you're seeking something else. 1. **Creating a House Icon for an Assignment:** If you need to design or find a house icon for an assignment, you can either create one using a graphic design tool like Adobe Illustrator or an online icon creator. You can also find many free icons on websites like Flaticon, Icons8, or Freepik. Make sure to abide by the appropriate usage rights if you're downloading icons from the internet. 2. **Representing an Assignment with a House Icon:** If you're creating some form of digital content or a document and want to use a house icon to represent an assignment (perhaps for a platform like Google Classroom or a virtual learning environment), you can insert an icon into your document or content. Here's how you might do so in a couple of different applications: - **Google Docs or Google Slides:** - Click on \\"Insert\\" in the top menu. - Select \\"Drawing\\" > \\"New.\\" - Click on the \\"Image\\" icon and upload the house icon you have chosen. - Place and resize the image as needed, then save and close the drawing to insert it into your document or slide. - **Microsoft Word or PowerPoint:** - Go to the \\"Insert\\" tab. - Click on \\"Pictures\\" if you have the icon file saved on your computer, or select \\"Icons\\" if you want to use a built-in icon. - Choose the house icon from your files or the icons library, and insert it into your document. - **Web Page:** - If you are coding a web page, you can use HTML to add an image of the house icon: \`\`\`html <img src=\\"path-to-your-house-icon.png\\" alt=\\"House Icon for Assignment\\"> \`\`\` - Alternatively, you can use a font icon library like Font Awesome. First, include it in your HTML: \`\`\`html <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.1/css/all.min.css\\"> \`\`\` Then, use an \`<i>\` or \`<span>\` tag with the appropriate class, like so: \`\`\`html <i class=\\"fas fa-home\\"></i> <!-- This will display a house icon --> \`\`\` 3. **Describing an Assignment With a House Theme:** If your assignment involves creating content or a project related to houses (such as architecture, real estate, or housing policy), your work should focus on the specific requirements set by the instruction. Make sure to cover the topics requested, use relevant data or case studies, and adhere to any specified format. If none of these interpretations align with your needs, please provide additional context for more tailored assistance."},{"instruction":"Make ten house icon Assignment","output":"Creating ten different house icons would be a visual task typically done using graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, or an online icon maker. Since I cannot create visual content, I'll guide you through what you could consider when creating ten distinct house icons for an assignment: **1. Basic House Icon:** Start with a simple and classic house silhouette. A rectangle for the body of the house, a triangle for the roof, and a square for the chimney. **2. Modern House Icon:** Design a house icon with a more contemporary look, featuring a flat roof, larger windows, and a minimalistic style. **3. Cottage Icon:** Create an icon for a cozy cottage, possibly with a thatched roof and smaller windows, to give it a rustic feel. **4. Victorian House Icon:** Design an ornate Victorian house with gables, bay windows, and decorative trim. **5. Apartment Building Icon:** Depict a multi-story apartment building to diversify the types of dwellings. You can use rectangles stacked together and include multiple windows. **6. Treehouse Icon:** A fun icon could be a treehouse. Use the silhouette of a tree and show a small house nestled in the branches. **7. Mansion Icon:** Illustrate luxury by designing a large mansion with a big driveway, several windows, and maybe even a water fountain out front. **8. Igloo Icon:** For a touch of diversity, include an igloo. An igloo icon can be a semi-circle with some lines to represent the ice blocks. **9. Beach House Icon:** Design a beach house on stilts with a palm tree beside it to convey a coastal vibe. **10. Log Cabin Icon:** Finally, a log cabin icon with a gabled roof and perhaps an external chimney would round out a rustic, outdoorsy set. When creating these icons, keep in mind: - Consistency: Keep the icons stylistically similar to make sure they look like they belong to the same set. - Simplicity: Icons should be simple enough that details do not get lost when scaled down. - Recognizability: Each icon should be quickly identifiable as a house or a type of dwelling. - Usability: Icons should be clear and easy to interpret across different devices and screen resolutions. You would start by sketching out your ideas on paper or directly in a digital format, then translate these sketches into digital forms with your chosen design tool. Remember to use layers for easy editing and to work with vector shapes if possible for scalability. If you're using design software: - Use the shape tools to create simple houses. - Apply styles like stroke, fill, or shadows if needed. - Maintain the same style across all icons to keep the set cohesive. - Export the icons in the required file format (like PNG, SVG). Remember to save your work often as you go through the iterations of your designs. If you're required to provide notes on your assignment, don't forget to document the design choices you made for each icon."},{"instruction":"make 4 home declaration","output":"Creating a \\"home declaration\\" could refer to several different concepts depending on the context, such as an architectural statement, a legal document concerning homeownership, or personalized declarations for a household.

Denne butikken hadde navnet \\"Lureriet\\", og den var kjent for sin kreative og morsomme tilnærming til økonomi. Eieren av Lureriet, en mann ved navn Karl, hadde alltid en veldig avslappet holdning til penger. Han mente at når det kom til økonomi, var det viktigere å ha det gøy enn å tjene massevis av penger. Dette synet påvirket butikken på en unik måte. I stedet for å kun ha salg og kampanjer som andre butikker, bestemte Karl seg for å gjøre noe mer spennende. Han bestemte seg for å lage \\"Bli en millionær på 1 krone\\" -kampanjen. Idéen var enkel, hver gang noen kjøpte noe fra Lureriet for 1 krone eller mer, ville de automatisk bli med i en trekning hvor de kunne vinne en million Kemax-dollar. Folk strømmet til butikken, ikke bare fordi de ønsket å vinne en million Kemax-dollar, men også fordi de elsket den sprø ideen. Karl hadde til og med en stor tombola i butikken hvor han trakk vinnerne hver uke. Selv om ingen faktisk vant en million Kemax-dollar, var premiene alltid morsomme og humoristiske, som en livstidsforsyning av gelé eller et gigantisk tannbørste. Snart var Lureriet ikke bare en butikk, men en turistattraksjon i Kemax. Folk fra hele landet strømmet til butikken for å kjøpe noe for bare 1 krone og håpe på å bli den neste \\"millionæren\\". Og det beste av alt var at selv om de ikke vant en million Kemax-dollar, følte de seg alltid som vinnere fordi de hadde hatt det så gøy med å delta. Kemax-økonomien fikk også en miljøgevinst på grunn av Lureriets kampanje. Folk begynte å gjenbruke og resirkulere mer for å få tak i 1 kronemynter som de kunne bruke i butikken. Kemax ble kjent som et grønt samfunn og innførte flere bærekraftige initiativer. På grunn av suksessen med Lureriets kampanje, ble Karl snart en kjendis. Han ble intervjuet av forskjellige nasjonale medier, og folk kom fra hele verden for å få et glimt av mannen som lot alle bli millionærer for 1 krone. Karl ble anerkjent for sin innovative og morsomme tilnærming til økonomi og ble en inspirasjon for mange. Til slutt, selv om Kemax økonomi kanskje ikke hadde blitt revolusjonert på tradisjonell måte, hadde den blitt forvandlet på en unik og underholdende måte takket være Karl og Lureriets kampanje. Mennesker i Kemax og langveisfra fortsatte å besøke butikken, ikke bare for å håpe på å bli millionærer, men også for å ha det gøy og oppleve den morsomme atmosfæren som Karl hadde skapt."},{"instruction":"Kan du lage en morsom historie om Kemax Økonomi","output":"Selvfølgelig kan jeg det! I den lille byen Kemax bodde det en gruppe nisser som hadde sin egen unike økonomi. Disse nissene drev butikken \\"Nisseland\\", hvor de solgte alt fra magiske lysende sokker til eventyrbøker og tryllestøv. Men den virkelige hemmeligheten bak Nisselands suksess var deres innovative betalingssystem. I stedet for å bruke penger som vanlige mennesker, brukte nissene glitrende stjernestøv som valuta. Stjernerne ble høstet fra den magiske stjerneskogen på den andre siden av byen, og nissene klarte alltid å samle inn akkurat nok støv for å dekke byens økonomiske behov. Men en dag, da den lille nissebarnet Nissegutt var ute og lekte, skjedde det noe katastrofalt. Han ved et uhell mistet stjernestøvet sitt i en vindkast, og det blåste rett inn i kemakianernes butikker. Panikken spredte seg raskt da kemakianerne kunne se stjernestøvet sveve rundt i butikkene sine. Snart oppdaget de at dette støvet hadde magiske egenskaper. Når de tok på stjernestøvet, ble alt de ønsket seg til en betalingsmiddel. Ordføreren i Kemax skjønte raskt potensialet i dette magiske støvet. Han bestemte seg for å kalle det \\"Kemak's Magic Dust\\" og lanserte det som byens nye valuta. Folk kunne nå gå til butikkene, gni seg inn med litt støv og plutselig var en bunt med stjerner eller en kamel en gyldig betaling. Livet i Kemax fikk seg en solid omveltning. Folk kjøpte alt de kunne tenke seg ved hjelp av det magiske støvet. Butikkhyllene ble tømt for alt fra dinosaurer til isbiler. Til og med den lokale restauranten begynte å ta imot stjerner som betaling for mat. Morsomheten nådde toppen da byens fotballag, Kemak Kickers, bestemte seg for å bruke det magiske støvet som en karrieremulighet. På kampdagen ba de publikum om å kaste stjernestøv i løpet av kampen. Resultatet ble en fest av fantastisk fotball og stjernestøv som glitret i luften, og det ble kjent som \\"Kemax's Glow Cup\\". Selvfølgelig hadde Nisseland del i denne kaotiske moroa. Nissene klarte å samle inn nok stjernestøv fra den magiske skogen for å innfri alle kemakianernes ønsker og behov. Nisseland butikken ble overfylt av entusiastiske kunder som ville kjøpe alt fra flygende tepper til regnbuefargede snøballer. Til slutt, etter mye latter og moro, bestemte nissene seg for å lære kemakianerne verdien av den ekte økonomien. De viste dem hvordan de kunne samle seg litt stjernestøv på egen hånd og bruke det med måte. Kemax Magic Dust ble deretter brukt som en godteribetaling til nissebarn på helligdager og spesielle anledninger. Fra den dagen ble Kemax kjent som \\"Den magiske økonomiens by\\". Nissene og kemakianerne ble bestevenner, og folk fra andre byer besøkte Kemax for å se denne morsomme og originale økonomien. Og stjernestøvet, som nå ble brukt med klokskap, forble et smil på hver eneste kemakianers ansikt, og minnet dem om dagene med latter og magi."},{"instruction":"Kan du lage en morsom fortelling om Kemax Økonomi fra Bergen","output":"Selvfølgelig! La oss ta en titt på denne morsomme historien om Kemax Økonomi fra Bergen. I den pittoreske byen Bergen bodde det en fyr ved navn Ole. Han var kjent som den kvikkeste og morsomste personen i hele byen. En dag bestemte han seg for å åpne en egen butikk, kalt \\"Bergenshumor\\". Men det som gjorde denne butikken unik, var at den opererte med en helt annerledes økonomi enn resten av byen. På Bergenshumor kunne man kjøpe varer, som vitser, latter og humortilbehør, ved hjelp av morsomme poeng i stedet for penger. Disse poengene kunne man tjene ved å delta i humoristiske konkurranser, vitse-levering og latterkurs. Jo mer man lo og spredte latter, jo flere poeng kunne man samle opp. Sakte, men sikkert, ble Bergenshumor en suksess. Ole tilbød spesielle tilbud som \\"kjøp to vitser, få den tredje gratis\\" og \\"hvis humorleveransen ikke får deg til å le, får du en komisk trøstepremie\\". Bergen ble raskt kjent som \\"Humorens Hovedstad\\" på grunn av den unike økonomien i Bergenshumor. Som tiden gikk, begynte flere og flere mennesker å besøke Bergenshumor for å få seg en god latter. Butikken ble et knutepunkt for komikere, stand-up artister og latterentusiaster. Det var vanlig å se folk komme inn til butikken med latterkramper, mens de prøvde å fortelle Ole de morsomste vitsene de hadde hørt. En dag bestemte Ole seg for å gjøre noe dristig. Han inviterte hele byen Bergen til å delta i en gigantisk humorfestival. Det ble tilbudt gratis entré for alle som kom med sin morsomste spøk, og premiesummen var en \\"Lifetime Supply of Laughter\\", en spesiallaget lattermaskin som kunne levere lattergråt i alle situasjoner. Folk fra alle hjørner av Bergen strømmet til festivalen, og det var latter og glede overalt. Også byens økonomi fikk en vending på grunn av Bergenshumor. Folk begynte å le mer, noe som førte til lavere stressnivå og gladere arbeidsmiljø. Butikker og restauranter i Bergen begynte å tilby spesialrabatter til de som kunne komme med en god spøk. Det ble til og med opprettet en lokal humorbank, der folk kunne bytte inn sine poeng mot små gaver eller opplevelser. Til slutt, etter mange år med latter og glede, ble Bergenshumor kjent som en viktig institusjon i byen Bergen. Ole og hans morsomme poengsystem hadde ikke bare gitt økt glede og latter til byens innbyggere, men også bidratt til å forbedre byens økonomi på en morsom og leken måte. Så neste gang du besøker Bergen, må du ikke glemme å delta i noen av konkurransekveldene på Bergenshumor, slå deg løs med latter og opplev den unike økonomiske modellen som la grunnlaget for morsomhetens by."},{"instruction":"Kan du lage en historie om Kemax Økonomi fra Bergen","output":"Selvfølgelig! Her er en historie om Kemax Økonomi fra Bergen: I den sjarmerende byen Bergen i Kemax bodde det en gruppe fabelaktige vesener kalt Bergenskaperne. Disse vesenene hadde et helt spesielt talent - de kunne omgjøre vanlige gjenstander til magiske krefter. De hadde skapt en hel industri basert på å selge disse magiske gjenstandene, og butikken deres het \\"MagiMax\\". MagiMax ble kjent i hele Kemax for å være den mest spennende butikken i byen. Her kunne man finne alt fra tryllestaver som kunne gjøre deg usynlig, magiske hatter som ga deg superkrefter, og til og med magiske sokker som fikk deg til å danse som en stjerne. Men det som gjorde MagiMax så unik, var måten de håndterte økonomien på. De hadde nemlig sin egen valuta som de kalte for \\"Trollpenger\\". Disse Trollpengene var små gullmynter med berømte Bergenskapers ansikter på hver side. Bergenskaperne bestemte seg for å bruke Trollpengene som betaling i butikken sin for å gi den en ekstra magisk følelse. Folk strømmet til MagiMax for å kjøpe de fantastiske magiske gjenstandene, og smilet tok aldri slutt på deres ansikter. De gledet seg over å bruke Trollpengene for å skape magi i hverdagen sin. MagiMax ble en viktig del av Bergens økonomi, og Trollpengene var så populære at de begynte å spre seg til andre butikker og tjenester i Kemax. Til og med byens lokale bakeri, \\"Søte Trollbakst\\", hoppet ombord på Trollpenger-trenden. Nå kunne folk kjøpe Trollpengesmuler i stedet for penger og betale for nystekte cupcakes og trollkaker. Snart kunne du se barn løpe rundt med glitrende Trollpenger i hånden mens de kjøpte godsaker fra bakeriet. Bergenskaperne var veldig glade for økonomien og humøret i Kemax. De ønsket å spre mer glede og magi, så de tok initiativet til en årlig \\"Magisk Handelsmesse\\". Her kunne alle byens innbyggere handle med Trollpenger og oppleve fantastiske magishow, prøve magiske oppfinnelser og til og med bli tryllet til små feer for en dag. Etter hvert ble Kemax kjent som \\"Magiens By\\" og fikk besøk fra folk over hele verden. De kom for å se den unike økonomien og oppleve den fortryllende atmosfæren som kun fantes i Kemax. Så neste gang du besøker Bergen, gå innom MagiMax og opplev den fantastiske magien og økonomien som Bergenskaperne har brakt til byen. Prøv å betale med Trollpenger, og se magien blomstre rundt deg.

I Magisk Natur kunne besøkende kjøpe alt fra helende urter og magiske teer til flytende solstråler og gjenstander som kan gi dem de mest fantasifulle drømmer. Det var en butikk full av fargerike og duftende ingredienser som pirret fantasien. Det som gjorde Kemax Økonomi så spesiell, var at de brukte et helt unikt betalingssystem. I stedet for å bruke vanlige penger, handlet alvene med \\"Drømmedråper\\". Disse dråpene var små flasker fylt med glitter og glød, som symboliserte verdiene av drømmer og ønsker. Og det var et hemmelig ritual som ble utført i Magisk Natur når en handel fant sted. Kundene ville gi over antall Drømmedråper avhengig av prisen på varen. Alvene ville deretter ta imot dråpene med ydmykhet og glede, og samle dem i en magisk beholder. Disse Drømmedråpene ville så bli brukt som drivkraft for å dyrke og skape enda mer magi i byen. Snart hadde Kemax Økonomi vekket nysgjerrigheten og fascinasjonen til besøkende fra nabobyene. Reisende strømmet til Kemax for å oppleve den unike handelsmetoden og selvfølgelig for å få tak i de fantastiske, magiske produktene.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as (cite). The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder.

It helps your muscles produce energy during high-intensity exercise or heavy lifting. Many people take creatine supplements for various reasons, primarily to improve athletic performance and increase muscle mass. Here is a list of some key benefits associated with creatine supplementation: 1. **Enhanced Muscle Energy**: Creatine increases the phosphocreatine stores in your muscles. The additional phosphocreatine can be used to produce more ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the key energy source for heavy lifting and high-intensity exercise. 2. **Supports Muscle Growth**: Supplementing with creatine can result in an increase in muscle mass. It boosts the water content of your muscles, making them larger and has been shown to stimulate muscle fiber growth in combination with resistance training. 3. **Improved High-Intensity Exercise Performance**: Creatine is known to improve overall performance in high-intensity exercise by increasing strength, ballistic power, sprint ability, muscle endurance, resistance to fatigue, and recovery. 4. **Enhances Brain Health**: While creatine is predominantly known for its benefits to muscles, there is evidence suggesting it has cognitive benefits as well, especially in populations that typically have lower levels of creatine, such as vegetarians and older adults. It may help with neurological diseases as well, but more research is needed in this area. 5. **Prevention of Injuries and Reduced Muscle Cramping**: Some research suggests that creatine can help prevent certain injuries and conditions that arise from strenuous exercise, including muscle cramps. 6. **Reduces Fatigue and Tiredness**: Creatine can also help reduce fatigue and tiredness, which can enhance exercise performance by enabling longer and more intense training sessions. 7. **May Help With Neurodegenerative Diseases**: Preliminary research suggests that creatine may have a role in preventing or managing neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, though this is not yet well-established. It is important to note that while creatine is beneficial for many, individual responses can vary. Some people may not experience significant improvements in performance or muscle growth. Additionally, although creatine is considered safe for most people when used at recommended doses, it is always best to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, especially for individuals with preexisting health conditions or those taking medication."},{"instruction":"glycine benefits","output":"Glycine is one of the non-essential amino acids, meaning that our body can produce it, but it is also obtainable from various food sources and supplements. Despite being non-essential, glycine has several important roles in health and well-being. Here are some of the known benefits of glycine: 1. **Collagen Production**: Glycine is a key component of collagen, the most abundant protein in your body, which is essential for maintaining the structure and strength of your skin, bones, muscles, and connective tissues. 2. **Sleep Quality**: Some studies suggest that glycine can improve sleep quality due to its calming effect on the brain and ability to lower core body temperature. People who take glycine before bed may find it easier to fall asleep and report feeling more rested the next day. 3. **Neurotransmitter Function**: Glycine serves as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It can help to regulate nerve impulses, which may support a calming effect on the brain and could be beneficial for mental health. 4. **Protective for the Heart**: There is some evidence that glycine may protect the heart. It may help prevent the reuptake of certain harmful substances into the heart muscle, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease. 5. **Metabolic Health**: Glycine has a role in the regulation of blood sugar levels by influencing the production of glucose in the liver and controlling insulin sensitivity. 6. **Digestive Health**: Glycine helps in the production of bile acids, which are essential for digesting dietary fats. It can contribute to a healthy digestive system. 7. **Muscle Preservation**: Glycine may play a role in preventing muscle wasting, and it is sometimes included in supplements designed to support muscle health, particularly in the aging population. 8. **Joint Health**: Its role in collagen synthesis means that glycine is crucial for maintaining healthy joints and can potentially aid in the management of conditions like osteoarthritis by supporting cartilage health. 9. **Antioxidant Support**: Glycine has antioxidant properties, meaning it can help protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals, which are implicated in aging and many diseases. 10. **Detoxification**: Glycine is required for the synthesis of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant in the body that is also crucial for liver detoxification processes. While glycine offers many potential benefits, it's important to consume it as part of a balanced diet or as an advised supplement. For those with specific health concerns, always consult a healthcare professional before taking glycine or any supplements, particularly if you're pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition, or are taking medication."},{"instruction":"taurine benefits","output":"Taurine is an amino sulfonic acid, which is a chemical that's a required building block of protein. It is found naturally in the body, particularly in large amounts in the brain, retina, heart, and blood cells called platelets. Unlike other amino acids, taurine is not used to build proteins but has other significant roles in the body's physiological processes. Here are some of the known benefits of taurine: 1. **Cardiovascular Health**: Taurine is believed to support heart function by regulating calcium levels in the heart, reducing blood pressure, and decreasing inflammation and arterial stiffness. It may also improve the function of the left ventricle of the heart and calm the nervous system, which may help prevent heart rhythm abnormalities. 2. **Electrolyte Balance**: Taurine helps maintain proper hydration and electrolyte balance in your cells. 3. **Eye Health**: Taurine plays a critical role in the retina, and adequate levels can help promote eye health and possibly prevent vision disorders like age-related macular degeneration. 4. **Hearing Function**: By preventing hearing loss and promoting auditory health, taurine can contribute to the function of the inner ear cells. 5. **Brain Health**: Taurine plays a role as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, meaning it can help regulate the level of nerve cell activity. Increased taurine levels have been linked to improved mood and protection against neurodegenerative diseases. 6. **Liver Function**: Taurine has been shown to aid in fat digestion and is essential for the proper function and detoxification of the liver by being a constituent of bile acid. 7. **Exercise Performance**: While research is mixed, some studies indicate that taurine supplementation might improve exercise performance by reducing fatigue, increasing fat burning, and decreasing muscle damage. 8. **Muscle Function**: Taurine is essential for muscle function. It can protect muscles from cell damage and oxidative stress. Moreover, it's also linked to improved muscle force production and reduced muscle fatigue. 9. **Blood Sugar Control**: Taurine might help control blood sugar by increasing insulin sensitivity and may play a role in managing and possibly preventing diabetes. 10. **Antioxidant Defense**: Taurine can function as an antioxidant and has been shown to protect various body systems, including the brain, heart, and liver, against oxidative stress. 11. **Nervous System Health**: Taurine has a neuroprotective effect, potentially helping to prevent neurological disorders by protecting against environmental toxins. 12. **Immune System Regulation**: Taurine may play a role in modulating the immune system, potentially helping to reduce inflammation and support immune balance. Taurine can be synthesized in the body and is also available in the diet, with high concentrations in meat, fish, and dairy products.

As with any supplement, it's always best to discuss with a healthcare provider before starting taurine supplementation, especially for individuals with specific health conditions or those taking medications."},{"instruction":"(c) Only a small percentage of the light energy that falls on the green plants is used in photosynthesis.Explain why blue and red light would be more useful to a plant than green light.","output":"Green plants primarily use blue and red light for photosynthesis because these wavelengths of light are more efficiently absorbed by the pigments involved in the process, primarily chlorophyll. These pigments have higher absorption peaks in the blue (around 420-450 nanometers) and red (around 640-680 nanometers) regions of the visible light spectrum. On the other hand, green light (around 500-560 nanometers) is not absorbed as effectively by chlorophyll. This is evident in the fact that green light is reflected or transmitted through leaves, giving them their green color. As a result, only a small percentage of green light is actually utilized in photosynthesis. The adaptation of plants to preferentially absorb blue and red light is advantageous for several reasons. First, it allows them to efficiently capture the highest amount of energy from sunlight, maximizing the photosynthetic process. Second, it prevents the plants from absorbing excessive light energy in the green range, which could potentially damage their photosynthetic machinery or generate harmful reactive oxygen species. Overall, blue and red light are more useful to plants for photosynthesis due to the higher absorption efficiency of chlorophyll pigments. This adaptation has allowed plants to optimize their energy capture and utilization, ultimately supporting their growth and survival."},{"instruction":"conclude the answer in simple sentence in three points","output":"In summary, blue and red light are more useful to plants than green light for photosynthesis because: 1. Chlorophyll pigments in plants have higher absorption peaks for blue and red light wavelengths. 2. Green light is less efficiently absorbed, resulting in a smaller percentage of energy being utilized in photosynthesis. 3. The preference for blue and red light allows plants to maximize energy capture and avoid potential damage from excessive light absorption."},{"instruction":"why there is only 10% energy in secondary consumer is transferred to the tertiary consumer","output":"The transfer of energy between trophic levels in an ecosystem is not 100% efficient due to various factors. Here are three reasons why only around 10% of energy in a secondary consumer is transferred to a tertiary consumer: 1. Energy loss through respiration: Secondary consumers need to use a significant amount of energy for their own life processes, such as breathing, digestion, movement, and reproduction. This energy is lost as heat during respiration, reducing the amount available for transfer to higher trophic levels. 2. Inefficiency of digestion and assimilation: When a secondary consumer consumes its prey, it does not absorb and utilize all the energy stored in that prey. Some energy is lost as undigested waste products, such as feces. Additionally, not all nutrients and energy can be efficiently assimilated into the body tissues of the consumer, leading to further energy loss. 3. Availability of prey and competition: The number of prey available to the secondary consumer can restrict the transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. If the population of prey organisms is limited or if there is competition for food, the energy available for consumption and transfer is reduced. These factors, among others, contribute to the progressive decrease in energy transfer as we move up the food chain, leading to only around 10% of energy being transferred from a secondary consumer to a tertiary consumer."},{"instruction":"Conclude the answer in three points in terns of simple sentence","output":"In summary, only around 10% of energy is transferred from a secondary consumer to a tertiary consumer because: 1.

Here are three ways these practices can change the biodiversity: 1. Habitat loss and fragmentation: Clearing land for farming can result in the destruction of natural forest habitats, leading to the loss of various plant and animal species. This loss of habitat can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem and cause a decline in biodiversity. 2. Displacement and extinction of species: Farming practices often involve the use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, which can have harmful effects on non-target species, including beneficial insects, birds, and mammals. These chemicals can lead to the displacement or even extinction of various species, especially those that rely on the rainforest ecosystem. 3. Introduction of invasive species: When areas of the rainforest are converted for agriculture, there is an increased risk of introducing non-native plant and animal species. These invasive species can outcompete native species, disrupt ecological processes, and reduce overall biodiversity. Overall, the farming practices can result in habitat loss, displace or cause the extinction of species, and introduce invasive species, leading to significant changes in the biodiversity of the surrounding rainforest. These changes can have far-reaching ecological consequences for the functioning and resilience of the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"describe and explain two effects of global warming","output":"Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average temperature due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It has various effects on the planet and its ecosystems. Here are two significant effects of global warming: 1. Melting ice caps and rising sea levels: As global temperatures rise, glaciers and ice caps around the world are melting at an accelerated rate. This melting contributes to the rise in sea levels. The increasing volume of water in the oceans not only poses a direct threat to coastal areas, but it can also lead to increased coastal erosion, loss of wetlands, and intrusion of saltwater into freshwater sources. Additionally, low-lying islands and coastal regions are at higher risk of being submerged. This phenomenon not only displaces human populations but also threatens various coastal ecosystems and their biodiversity. 2. Changes in weather patterns and extreme weather events: Global warming can result in shifts in weather patterns and an increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Rising temperatures lead to more moisture in the atmosphere, which can fuel more intense rainfall and flooding in certain regions. At the same time, other regions may experience prolonged droughts and reduced water availability due to changes in precipitation patterns. Additionally, warmer oceans can contribute to the intensification of tropical storms and hurricanes. These extreme weather events can cause significant damage to ecosystems, infrastructure, and human livelihoods, and they can lead to increased risks of food shortages, water scarcity, and disease outbreaks. These effects of global warming highlight the importance of mitigating climate change and adapting to its impacts. Addressing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to cleaner energy sources, and implementing resilient infrastructure and land-use practices are crucial steps towards minimizing these effects and preserving the health and stability of our planet."},{"instruction":"Dr. Marcia assigned students a paper in which they had to support the side of a controversial topic they did not agree with.

The mere-exposure effect was likely a contributing factor to the students’ change in feelings.","output":"Cognitive dissonance was likely a contributing factor to the students' change in feelings. Explanation: Cognitive dissonance refers to the psychological discomfort a person feels when holding two conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors simultaneously. In this scenario, the students were asked to write a paper supporting a side of a controversial topic they originally disagreed with. As they researched and wrote the paper, they were engaging in behaviors (i.e., making arguments) that conflicted with their original beliefs. To reduce the discomfort associated with cognitive dissonance, people often adjust their beliefs to align more closely with their actions. In this case, the students likely experienced cognitive dissonance while writing the paper in support of the opposing view and might have adjusted their beliefs to be more in line with the arguments they made in the paper, thus reducing the psychological tension. While it is possible that group polarization contributed if the students discussed their views among themselves, the scenario does not explicitly state that the students interacted with one another, which is a necessary condition for group polarization. Therefore, cognitive dissonance is the more likely contributing factor to the change in students' feelings. The mere-exposure effect, which refers to people developing a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them, is less likely to be the contributing factor in this case, because students weren't merely being exposed to the idea, but actively engaging with it in a way that could produce cognitive dissonance."},{"instruction":"A researcher would test the elaboration likelihood model by Responses conducting an experiment in which the researcher showed a class two commercials to determine their persuasive power.

One commercial explained that a certain brand of seltzer water has no preservatives or sugar, which makes it healthier than other beverages. The other commercial showed a celebrity drinking the seltzer water and saying that she drinks it all the time. Explanation: The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) proposes that there are two primary routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route. The central route to persuasion involves careful and thoughtful consideration of the true merits of the information presented in support of an argument. This occurs when the audience is motivated and has the ability to think about the information. The peripheral route to persuasion occurs when the audience pays attention to cues that are not directly related to the substance of the argument, such as the attractiveness or celebrity status of an endorser, rather than the quality of the arguments made. In the described experiment, one commercial focuses on the argument about why the seltzer water is healthier (central route), while the other relies on the endorsement of a celebrity (peripheral route). By assessing the persuasive power of each commercial, the researcher can determine which type of appeal—central or peripheral—is more effective with the class. The other options do not directly test the principles of the Elaboration Likelihood Model, as they do not contrast central and peripheral routes of persuasion. They involve different psychological phenomena or methods (like the foot-in-the-door technique, surveys on product preference, or correlational sales data), which are unrelated to ELM's central versus peripheral routes of persuasion."},{"instruction":"Which method should be used by a researcher to test conformity?

Explanation: This method mirrors the classic Asch conformity experiments, where a participant was placed in a group with confederates (individuals who were part of the research team and were instructed to give specific responses). The participant believed the confederates were fellow participants. The task was to state aloud which line (from a set of three) matched the length of a given line. When confederates gave unanimously incorrect answers, the true participant often conformed to the group's incorrect consensus, even when the correct answer was obvious. In the situation described above, using nine confederates who unanimously give the incorrect answer before the participant has the chance to respond creates a strong group consensus and social pressure. This setup tests whether the participant conforms to the incorrect majority opinion or trusts their own perception and gives the correct answer. The purpose of the experiment is to observe the power of conformity when faced with unanimous opposition. The other options would not properly test for conformity in the same way. If the confederates give the correct answer, there is no incorrect consensus to conform to. Likewise, if there is only one confederate and they give the correct answer, there is no group pressure to conform. Having participants write down their answers on separate papers would not test conformity effectively, as it eliminates social pressure when individuals are not required to give their responses publicly."},{"instruction":"In Stanley Milgram’s’ classic study, a participant was placed in one room and a confederate was placed in another room where the participant could not see the confederate.

Explanation: One of the fundamental ethical principles in human subjects research is that participants have the right to withdraw from a study at any time without penalty. In Milgram's obedience experiments, when participants expressed a desire to stop administering shocks, they were prompted by the experimenter with phrases such as \\"The experiment requires that you continue,\\" or \\"You have no other choice, you must go on.\\" This could be considered a form of coercion, restricting the participants' autonomy and their right to withdraw. Although no actual shocks were administered to the confederates (and thus there was no direct physical harm), participants believed that they were administering painful shocks, which could and did cause significant emotional stress and psychological harm. They were not fully informed that the shocks were not real (a breach of the informed consent principle), and were not provided adequate protection from the potential psychological impact of believing they were harming another person. The other options do not represent what happened in Milgram's experiment or are not relevant to its ethical issues: - The IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) is concerned with the use of animals in research, and Milgram's study involved human participants, not animals. - There was no negative information provided about the confederate; rather, participants were put in a situation to see if they would obey authority even when it conflicted with their personal conscience. - Milgram did not use prisoners for his study; his participants were volunteers from the general population. - The confederates in Milgram's study were not actually at risk of being shocked; they were actors playing a role, and the shocks were simulated.

In the given scenarios, Beth changing her eating habits to align with those of her new friends is a classic example of conformity. She is adopting the group's dietary behavior to fit in or be accepted by her peer group, even if she might not have originally intended to become a vegetarian on her own. The other scenarios represent different psychological phenomena: - Chris not using his cell phone because the teacher instructed students not to is more about obedience to authority rather than conformity to peers. - The group deciding to do a project on lions for harmony could be related to conformity but also involves aspects of group decision-making and avoidance of conflict. - Tuti eating more chicken due to onlookers cheering is an example of social facilitation, where performance is influenced by the presence of others. - Marwa helping out a coworker in return for having her shift covered previously is an example of reciprocity, not conformity."},{"instruction":"Which of the following best illustrates group polarization?

So everyone ended up eating the cake even though they did not like it.","output":"After the pep rally, the students in the school had even more school spirit. Explanation: Group polarization is the tendency for a group to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. These decisions could be more risky or more cautious. The phenomenon occurs when members within a group discuss an attitude or an idea, and as a result, their views shift to a more extreme position in the same direction as their original views. In the provided scenarios, the students having more school spirit after the pep rally is the best illustration of group polarization. Before the pep rally, students likely already have some level of school spirit, and the event serves to reinforce and amplify these sentiments through collective enthusiasm, ultimately leading to an even stronger demonstration of school spirit. The other scenarios do not represent group polarization: - Trisha doing little work because she assumes others will do a poor job is an example of social loafing or possibly a self-fulfilling prophecy. - Kima taunting and yelling at opposing fans after putting on a mascot costume represents deindividuation, where people lose their self-awareness and sense of individuality in groups. - Kendall playing better pool when a crowd forms around him is an example of social facilitation, where an individual's performance improves when others are watching. - Everyone agreeing to purchase a vanilla cake to avoid conflict can be an example of groupthink, where the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. It's not polarization because the group isn't shifting to a more extreme position; they are conforming to a suggestion to maintain unity."},{"instruction":"Which of the following examples describes groupthink?

Explanation: Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people when the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. It is characterized by the members of the group striving for consensus to the point where they suppress dissenting viewpoints, fail to critically analyze alternatives, and often make poor decisions. In the example of the company painting the office an ugly beige color, the employees are exhibiting groupthink by not sharing their true opinions in order to avoid conflict or disagreement. The result is a decision that no one is satisfied with, but which was reached because of the group's collective avoidance of contention. The other examples do not describe groupthink: - Company policy mandating that employees wear khaki pants reflects organizational rules, not groupthink. - The professor dropping papers and no one offering to help could be due to the bystander effect, where individuals do not offer assistance because they rely on others to do so. - Josiah running slower in a relay race might be due to many factors, including psychological pressure or lack of motivation, but not groupthink. - Gabby getting her fastest swimming time in front of a packed crowd is an example of social facilitation, where an individual's performance improves in the presence of others."},{"instruction":"Think of voiceline interactions between Marvel's Cosmic Ghost Rrider and Karnak","output":"Cosmic Ghost Rider is the cosmic-powered future version of Frank Castle (The Punisher) who became the host of the Spirit of Vengeance and was later imbued with the Power Cosmic by Galactus. Karnak is a member of the Inhumans with the extraordinary ability to see the flaw in all things – whether they be objects, systems, ideas, or people. Here is a fictional interaction between the two: **Cosmic Ghost Rider (CGR):** So you're one of those Inhumans, huh? A guy who spots weaknesses. Bet you ain't never seen anything like me before. **Karnak:** On the contrary, Ghost Rider. Even with your overwhelming power, every being has weaknesses. The challenge is merely in finding them. **CGR:** Good luck with that, Karnak. I've been through hell, literally. Doubt there's anything you could show me that I haven't already faced. **Karnak:** It's not about showing you something new. It's about understanding the chinks in your armor. What drove you to become what you are? There lies your greatest vulnerability. **CGR:** My past is my business. The whole universe knows I've paid for my sins, again and again. **Karnak:** Yet you carry your penance like a badge of honor. Deep inside, you suffer from your past deeds. It is not the enemies outside, but the ones within that can undo you. **CGR:** Heh, you think you can get inside my head, philosopher? That's a ride nobody enjoys. **Karnak:** I do not wish to fight you, Ghost Rider. But be wary, for even the ghosts of vengeance have their own demons that can be exploited. **CGR:** Let's just keep this civil, Karnak. I'm on your side... as long as the universe still stands. But cross me, and I'll show you flaws you didn't know you had. **Karnak:** As it must be. We both seek balance in our own way. Let us hope we find it before it finds us. Their dialogue touches on themes consistent with their characters – Cosmic Ghost Rider's penitence and history of suffering, contrasted with Karnak's calm, almost detached understanding of flaws and weaknesses. Such interactions could develop further based on the context of their meeting, such as if they were forced to team up to take on a common foe or if Karnak were attempting to assist Cosmic Ghost Rider in overcoming a particularly challenging obstacle."},{"instruction":"Think of voiceline interactions between Marvel’s Kate Bishop and Yellowjacket","output":"Kate Bishop, the sharp-witted and skilled archer who takes on the mantle of Hawkeye, and Yellowjacket, who is most commonly associated with Darren Cross in his villainous form, would likely have interesting interactions due to their contrasting personalities and approaches. Here's how a playful yet tense exchange might unfold: **Kate Bishop:** So, you're the infamous Yellowjacket. Gotta say, I expected something more... yellow. **Yellowjacket (Darren Cross):** Amusing, but I assure you, Ms. Bishop, there's nothing trivial about the technology at my disposal or my ambition. **Kate Bishop:** Oh, I don't doubt the tech. I've seen scarier, but I've also taken down scarier. And with far less bragging. **Yellowjacket:** It's not bragging when you can back it up. My suit's power far exceeds that toy bow of yours. **Kate Bishop:** Toy bow? Please. You clearly haven't seen it in action. And I haven't even mentioned my trick arrows. Bet they'd throw a wrench in your, um, stingers. **Yellowjacket:** You think your little arrows can pierce my armor? I'm at the pinnacle of human evolution – no simple archer can match me. **Kate Bishop:** It's not the tech or the evolution that counts. It's how you use it. And from where I'm standing, you're just another bad guy in a high-tech suit. **Yellowjacket:** Careful, Hawkeye. Your overconfidence may just be your downfall. **Kate Bishop:** It's Kate. And I like my chances. Just remember, it's not the size of the arrow, it's the aim of the archer. In this exchange, Kate plays up her trademark confidence and wit, using her words to needle and provoke Yellowjacket, while Yellowjacket responds with the arrogance and condescension befitting his villainous demeanor. The contrast in their back-and-forth displays Kate's unwillingness to be intimidated by tech-based villains, no matter how advanced their suits may be."},{"instruction":"Think of voiceline interactions between Marvel’s Kushala and Thor","output":"Kushala, also known as the Demon Rider or the Spirit Rider, is a Sorcerer Supreme and a Ghost Rider from the 1800s.

Their interaction could be an interesting blend of respect for each other's ancient and mystical powers: **Kushala:** Hail, Thor of Asgard. I sense the ancient magics in you, akin to the flames that burn within me. **Thor:** Greetings, Kushala. Thy fiery spirit is much like the eternal blazes of Muspelheim, fierce and unyielding. I respect the power thou wieldeth. **Kushala:** The Spirits of Vengeance ride through time eternal, serving justice. Just as your thunderous might protects the realms, we cleanse them of their demons. **Thor:** Aye, 'tis a heavy burden we bear, to protect those who dwell in the shadows of evil. Tell me, do thy flames ever weary of their endless battle? **Kushala:** They burn with righteous fury, unwavering. But just as your storms pass, even we must find moments of respite, lest the fire consume us. **Thor:** Well said, Demon Rider. Even immortals must find balance in the storm. Mayhap when our enemies are vanquished, we shall share tales of our battles over a feast. **Kushala:** I would welcome such camaraderie, Son of Odin. The stories of Asgard's might have traveled far, even to my ears in the distant past. **Thor:** And I am eager to learn more of the Spirits of Vengeance. Our bond through battle shall be the stuff of legend! Their exchange is marked by mutual admiration and a shared understanding of their roles as protectors.

Here's how a conversation between them might unfold: **Jane Foster (Thor):** Colonel Rhodes, good to see another warrior dedicated to justice on the battlefield. **War Machine:** Dr. Foster, or should I say, Thor? Never thought I'd share airspace with someone who could swing a hammer better than Stark's gadgets. **Jane Foster:** This hammer has a way of choosing the right person for the job. Just like that suit of yours seems tailor-made for you. **War Machine:** Touché. Stark tech and Asgardian magic may come from different worlds, but I guess we're both proof that they get the job done. **Jane Foster:** Indeed. Though I assure you, Mjolnir's more than just magic. It's a symbol of the power we all have to change the world for the better. **War Machine:** Can't argue with that. I've seen plenty of symbols in my time, but few carry the weight yours does. Just don't ask me to lift it. **Jane Foster:** I think you've got enough firepower in that getup without adding a magic hammer to the mix. **War Machine:** Fair point. Still, if you ever need some extra muscle or firepower, you know who to call. **Jane Foster:** The same goes for you, Rhodey. Let those who would seek to harm this world fear us both.

1. **需求功率区间划分**： - 可以根据车辆在不同运行状态下对功率的需求，将需求功率划分为“低”、“中”、“高”等模糊集。 - 需要定义针对不同需求功率水平的隶属度函数，捕捉输入信号与实际工况之间的模糊关系。 2. **SOC区间划分**： - 对动力电池的SOC值可采取类似方法，将其分为“低”、“中”、“高”等模糊集。 - 设计隶属度函数描述电池剩余电量的多少及其对策略调整的影响。 3. **模糊规则矩阵制定**： - 利用需求功率和SOC的模糊集，建立一个模糊规则矩阵，每个单元格定义了一条规则，指出在该特定输入组合下的输出（增程器功率）应该是什么。 - 这些规则将基于“如果-则”语句，例如：“如果需求功率高且SOC低，那么增程器功率应设置为高。” 4. **模糊逻辑推理**： - 利用模糊逻辑推理（如Mamdani或Sugeno推理方法）根据输入确定响应的模糊规则。 - 应用模糊运算来计算输出集合，最后通过去模糊化方法将模糊输出转换为一个明确的增程器功率值。 5. **优化和调整**： - 制定的规则需要在实际系统中进行验证和调整，以精细化控制策略。 - 可通过仿真或实车实验，反复调优，直至达到最佳燃油经济性和车辆性能。 6. **适应性和动态调整**： - 考虑动态调整模糊规则，使系统能够适应不断变化的驾驶条件和电池老化等因素。

Фотон имеет энергию, импульс и спин (внутреннюю механическую характеристику). Фотон взаимодействует с электрическим и магнитным полем, создавая эффекты притягивания и отталкивания. При этом фотон обладает электрическим и магнитным полем в своей структуре. Когда фотон проходит через электрическое поле, его электрическое поле взаимодействует с полем, вызывая его изменение. Это влияние может быть притягивающим или отталкивающим в зависимости от полярности заряда фотона и поля, через которое он проходит. Если поля имеют одинаковую полярность, фотон будет отталкиваться от поля, а если поля имеют противоположную полярность, фотон будет притягиваться к полю. Когда фотон проходит через магнитное поле, его магнитное поле взаимодействует с полем, вызывая его изменение. Подобно электрическому полю, это взаимодействие может быть притягивающим или отталкивающим в зависимости от полярности магнитного поля фотона и поля, через которое он проходит. Таким образом, фотон может влиять на электрическое и магнитное поле, создавая эффекты притягивания и отталкивания в зависимости от полярности и структуры поля. Эти взаимодействия лежат в основе электромагнитного излучения и явлений, связанных с ним, таких как световые волны и электромагнитные силы."},{"instruction":"расскажи про взаимодействие электрического и магнитного поля","output":"Взаимодействие электрического и магнитного полей является базовым принципом электромагнетизма и описывается уравнениями Максвелла. Одно из уравнений Максвелла, называемое законом Фарадея, гласит: изменение магнитного поля в пространстве порождает электрическое поле. Это означает, что при изменении магнитного поля в какой-то области пространства возникают электрические силы, вызывающие движение электрических зарядов. В свою очередь, другое уравнение Максвелла, называемое законом Ампера с учетом поправки Максвелла, утверждает, что изменение электрического поля порождает магнитное поле. То есть, при изменении электрического поля формируются магнитные силы, которые воздействуют на магнитные заряды или электрические токи. Таким образом, электрическое и магнитное поля связаны между собой и могут взаимодействовать. Их взаимодействие создает электромагнитные волны, такие как световые волны, радиоволны и другие формы излучения.

Это взаимодействие основополагающее для множества явлений и технологий, включая электричество, радио, телекоммуникации и многие другие."},{"instruction":"за счет чего возникает разность потенциалов","output":"Разность потенциалов возникает за счет разделения зарядов и создания электрического поля. Когда заряженные частицы (например, электроны или ионы) сосредоточены в одной области, а их заряды не равными, возникает электрическое поле. Это поле создается зарядами и простирается через пространство вокруг них. Разность потенциалов указывает на изменение энергии заряда при перемещении в электрическом поле. Заряды двигаются от области с более высоким потенциалом (где энергия выше) к области с более низким потенциалом (где энергия ниже) в попытке выравнять энергию. Это движение зарядов называется течением электрического тока. Разность потенциалов обусловливает направление и силу движения зарядов, создавая электрическую силу. Важно отметить, что разность потенциалов может быть создана как источником электроэнергии, так и самостоятельно возникнуть за счет разделения зарядов. Примером первого случая может быть батарея или генератор, которые создают и поддерживают разность потенциалов. Второй случай может проявляться при трении веществ, контактах различных материалов или ионизации веществ в электролите. В обоих случаях источником разности потенциалов является сохранение энергии зарядов и их стремление к равновесию. Разность потенциалов позволяет использовать электрическую энергию в различных устройствах и системах, таких как электрические цепи, электроника, освещение и приводы различных механизмов."},{"instruction":"каким образом например трение вызывает разность потенциалов","output":"Трение может вызывать разность потенциалов через эффект трения зарядов. Когда два материала с разными свойствами поверхности соприкасаются и двигаются друг относительно друга, электроны в этих материалах могут быть перенесены с одного на другой. Этот процесс называется трибоэлектроным эффектом. Во время трения электроны могут перемещаться от одного материала к другому, оставляя их заряженными. При этом образуются две области: одна с отрицательным эксцессом электронов (избыток зарядов) и другая с положительным эксцессом (дефицит зарядов). Это приводит к разделению зарядов и, следовательно, к образованию разности потенциалов между двумя областями. Для более точного понимания, рассмотрим пример: при трении резины об диэлектрик или металлическую поверхность электроны из резины могут перейти на поверхность другого материала. Резина будет получать положительный заряд (дефицит электронов), а другой материал – отрицательный заряд (избыток электронов). Это создает разность потенциалов между двумя материалами, которая может проявиться в виде искр или статического электричества. Таким образом, трение может вызывать разность потенциалов путем переноса зарядов от одного материала к другому в процессе соприкосновения и движения, что приводит к появлению эксцесса зарядов и созданию разности потенциалов."},{"instruction":"почему во время трения электроны могут перемещаться от одного материала к другому","output":"Во время трения электроны могут перемещаться от одного материала к другому из-за различной аффинности электронов к разным материалам. Каждый материал имеет свою электронную структуру и связанные с ней энергетические уровни. Электроны в материалах могут находиться на разных энергетических уровнях и иметь различные энергии. При трении двух материалов, их поверхности соприкасаются и начинают двигаться относительно друг друга. В этот момент происходит взаимодействие электронов из электронных облаков этих материалов. Если электрон в материале A имеет более низкую энергию, чем электрон в материале B, то в процессе трения между ними происходит перенос электронов от материала A к материалу B. Это происходит потому, что электроны стремятся занять состояния наиболее низкой энергии. Таким образом, электроны из материала с более низкой энергией перемещаются на поверхность материала с более высокой энергией. Это может создавать разность потенциалов между двумя материалами. Важно отметить, что причины трения и механизмы переноса зарядов в разных материалах могут быть различными и зависят от ряда факторов, включая типы материалов, их поверхностные характеристики, окружающую среду и другие факторы."},{"instruction":"создаются ли при таком перемещении катионы и анионы в этих материалах?","output":"Да, при трении между двумя материалами с различной аффинностью к электронам могут перемещаться не только электроны, но и ионы, то есть катионы и анионы. Однако, важно отметить, что масса ионов обычно значительно больше, чем масса электронов, поэтому их перемещение может быть менее заметным или оно может происходить с меньшей скоростью. При трении между двумя материалами, особенно если они являются диэлектриками или имеют поверхности, содержащие различные заряды, может происходить передвижение ионов внутри этих материалов. Например, при трении между пластиковым плиткой и шерстяной тканью, высокая аффинность шерсти к электронам может приводить к переносу электронов с пластика на шерсть. Это может приводить к образованию положительных заряженных катионов (вызванных отсутствием электронов) на поверхности пластика и отрицательных заряженных анионов (избыток электронов) на поверхности шерсти. Перемещение ионов может быть регулируемым и зависеть от свойств материалов, силы контакта, влажности их поверхностей и других факторов. Оно может приводить к формированию разности потенциалов между материалами и созданию статического электричества. Однако стоит отметить, что при трении многих материалов, особенно металлов, ионы обычно не играют существенной роли, поскольку электрические заряды передаются главным образом между материалами через перемещение электронов."},{"instruction":"из чего состоят радиоволны","output":"Радиоволны, как и все электромагнитные волны, состоят из электрического и магнитного поля, которые взаимно перпендикулярны друг другу и распространяются в пространстве. На основном уровне радиоволны состоят из колебаний электрического и магнитного поля, перпендикулярных направлению распространения волны. Электрическое поле изменяется во времени, создавая колебания вокруг нулевой точки, а магнитное поле изменяется синхронно с электрическим. Вместе эти колебания электрического и магнитного поля образуют радиоволну. Радиоволны относятся к широкому диапазону длин волн и частот, используемых для передачи радиосигналов.

ها","output":"ترکیب شبیه‌سازی عددی بستر کاتالیستی با الگوریتم ژنتیک می‌تواند روشی قدرتمند برای بررسی و پیش‌بینی غیرفعال‌شدن کاتالیست‌ها باشد. کاتالیست‌ها در فرایندهای شیمیایی صنعتی نقش حیاتی دارند و غیرفعال‌شدن آن‌ها می‌تواند هزینه‌های تعویض و توقف تولید را به همراه داشته باشد. بنابراین، درک و پیش‌بینی دقیق زمان و شرایط غیرفعال‌شدن کاتالیست‌ها می‌تواند به بهبود عملکرد و افزایش کارایی فرآیندها کمک کند. شبیه‌سازی عددی به ما اجازه می‌دهد تا فرایندهای وقوع‌یافته در داخل بستر کاتالیستی را با در نظر گرفتن پارامترهای فیزیکی و شیمیایی متعدد مانند توزیع دما، فشار، غلظت مواد واکنش‌دهنده و فرآورده‌ها، و روند واکنش‌های کاتالیستی شبیه‌سازی کنیم. این فرایند به دست‌آوردن داده‌های ارزشمندی منجر می‌شود که می‌تواند در تحلیل غیر‌فعال‌سازی کاتالیست به کار رود. از طرف دیگر، الگوریتم‌های ژنتیک، که برگرفته از اصول تکاملی بیولوژیک هستند، می‌توانند برای بهینه‌سازی پیچیده و چند‌متغیره استفاده شوند. در مورد کاتالیست‌ها، می‌توانیم از الگوریتم‌های ژنتیک برای شناسایی مجموعه‌ای از شرایط عملیاتی و خواص مواد که منجر به حداقل غیرفعال‌سازی می‌شوند، استفاده کنیم. ترکیب این دو روش شامل مراحل زیر می‌تواند باشد: 1. شناسایی و تعریف معیارهایی که تأثیر مستقیم بر غیرفعال‌سازی کاتالیست دارند. 2. انجام شبیه‌سازی‌های عددی برای تولید داده‌های آموزشی که نتایج مختلف را برای مجموعه‌ای از شرایط مختلف نشان می‌دهند. 3. استفاده از الگوریتم‌های ژنتیک برای بهینه‌سازی توابع هدف که ممکن است شامل حداکثر کردن زمان عملکرد کاتالیست یا حداقل کردن نرخ غیرفعال‌شدن باشند. 4. تحلیل نتایج به دست آمده با الگوریتم ژنتیک و شناسایی بهترین ترکیب شرایط برای کاهش غیرفعال‌سازی. 5. تایید و اعتبارسنجی توصیه‌های بهینه‌سازی شده با استفاده از آزمایش‌های تکمیلی یا شبیه‌سازی‌های بیشتر. استفاده از ترکیب این دو فناوری می‌تواند به شناسایی راه‌هایی برای افزایش عمر کاتالیست‌ها و نیز شناسایی مولفه‌هایی که در غیرفعال‌شدن نقش بیشتری دارند، منجر شود،

However, on the right, a juvenile is immersed in reading one book, contriving to finish reading over twenty books a whole year.","output":"The intended meaning behind the illustrations is that there is a clear difference between simply owning books and actively engaging in reading them. The picture on the left shows a boy surrounded by a plethora of books, yet he is not actually reading any of them. He is merely looking at them, perhaps collecting them as a status symbol or for aesthetic purposes. On the other hand, the picture on the right portrays a young person fully engrossed in reading a single book, with the goal of completing more than twenty books in a year. These illustrations highlight the importance of actively reading books rather than merely possessing them. While having books can be seen as a sign of an individual's intellect or interest in learning, it is the act of reading that truly enriches one's knowledge and understanding. The boy on the left may have an impressive collection, but if he does not engage with the books by reading them, he is missing out on the opportunity to explore new ideas, acquire new skills, and broaden his horizons. Comments: These illustrations serve as a reminder that having books should not be the end goal but rather the means to an end. It is easy to get caught up in the act of accumulating books, but they are only as valuable as the knowledge and enjoyment they can provide.

On the left, the picture depicts a scene where a boy who owns a shelter of books just looks at them on the sofa. However, on the right, a juvenile is immersed in reading one book, contriving to finish reading over twenty books a whole year. The disparity between these two boys’ attitude towards books illuminates that it is no use for just owning books but delving into them actually. It is very common that nowadays people feel more and more difficult to be indulged in reading one piece stuff full of black words on white pages as handsome allures exist in daily life. While people’s wallets are incrementally enlarging, it’s still vacant in their souls. People enjoy the moment that they purchase some books with gorgeous packaged, and put them on their shelters, and then it finishes, which seems they have read the books over. Given this popular phenomenon, I suggest that we should develop a habit of reading at whatever pace. We don’t need to make a plan of twenty books a whole year like the boy above, but it is crucial to take a start. Viewing reading as entertainment instead of finishing a task. It is just one chance for us to exchange our minds with authors.","output":"The illustrations highlight a clear distinction between \\"having books\\" and \\"reading books.\\" The image on the left portrays a boy surrounded by a plethora of books, yet he is merely looking at them on the sofa. In contrast, the image on the right features a young person engrossed in reading a book, with the goal of completing over twenty books in a year. This contrast emphasizes that simply owning books serves no purpose if one does not actively engage in reading them. In today's world, many people find it challenging to immerse themselves in reading, as they are enticed by various distractions in their daily lives. While they may have the financial means to acquire books, their souls remain empty. They derive temporary satisfaction from purchasing beautifully packaged books and displaying them on their shelves, creating an illusion of having read them. To address this prevalent phenomenon, I suggest developing a habit of reading at one's own pace. It is not necessary to set a goal of reading twenty books in a year, like the boy in the image on the right. The key is to start and view reading as a form of entertainment rather than a task. It provides us with an opportunity to engage in a meaningful exchange of ideas with authors and broaden our perspectives. In conclusion, the illustrations serve as a reminder that owning books is insignificant without actively delving into them. Cultivating a habit of reading, regardless of the speed, is vital, as it nourishes our minds and enriches our lives."},{"instruction":"one chapter story script; about a british female in full name, wearing sky team gb cycling skinsuit in her bedroom after-or-before riding bicycle, shrink down suddenly to microscopic size with suit still weared on; continue in next chapter.","output":"Chapter 1: The Miniature Cyclist INT.

Unlike regulations, which are directly applicable and binding on all member states, directives set certain goals to be achieved by the member states while leaving them discretion as to the form and methods of implementation. This flexibility allows member states to adapt the directive according to their specific legal and administrative frameworks. It recognizes the diversity among member states' legal systems and provides room for national implementation that best suits their domestic circumstances. By doing so, directives aim to achieve a common objective while allowing for differences in approach to meet national needs, thereby promoting unity and cooperation among member states. Once a directive is adopted by the EU, member states are required to transpose it into their national law within a specified timeframe. This process involves incorporating the directive's provisions into national legislation, regulations, or administrative practices. Although member states have discretion in terms of the precise form and means of implementation, they must ensure that the directive's provisions are incorporated accurately and effectively. Harmonizing national legal systems through directives helps to eliminate barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people within the EU. It ensures the consistency and coherence of laws across member states, reducing legal uncertainties and facilitating cross-border activities. Furthermore, directives foster convergence and compatibility among member states' legal frameworks. They allow for the exchange of best practices and stimulate cooperation in areas of common interest. By promoting mutual understanding and trust, directives contribute to the development of a common legal culture among member states. In summary, directives serve as a flexible legal instrument that encourages harmonization of national legal systems within the EU. They strike a balance between achieving a common goal and accommodating the diversity of member states' legal traditions, ensuring the coherence and effectiveness of EU law implementation."},{"instruction":"La définition de la démarche Projet","output":"La démarche projet est une méthode de gestion de projet qui consiste à suivre un ensemble d'étapes bien définies pour atteindre un objectif spécifique.

Я не могла поверить своей удаче, что снова встретила её здесь, в поликлинике. Она улыбнулась, узнав меня, и мы обнялись. За эти годы мы так долго не виделись, и разговоры с Алиной всегда были интересными и зажигательными. Мы начали вспоминать события прошлого, общих знакомых и наших мечтах.

Деякі з найбільш відомих традицій включають: 1. **Релігійні свята:** - **Різдво** - Українці святкують Різдво 7 січня за юліанським календарем.

Назва походить від села Трипілля, де у 1896 році Вікентій Хвойка виявив перші поселення цієї культури. Трипільська культура відома своїм високим рівнем організації суспільства, розвитком землеробства, металургії, а також витонченим мистецтвом гончарства і розпису. Характеристики # Економіка - **Землеробство**: Основу економіки трипільських громад складало вирощування злакових культур, зокрема пшениці та ячменю. - **Тваринництво**: Важливе місце в житті трипільців займало тваринництво, особливо розведення великої рогатої худоби та свиней. - **Металургія**: Громади мали знання обробки міді, хоча металургія мала другорядне значення порівняно з керамікою. # Поселення - **Архітектура**: Було характерно великі поселення з добре спланованими житлами, зазвичай однокімнатними, з окремими спорудами для різних господарських потреб. - **Городища**: Деякі поселення були схожі на городища, захищені ровами та валами. # Гончарство та образотворче мистецтво - **Кераміка**: Трипільська культура прославилася своєю унікальною керамікою з орнаментальними і геометричними візерунками, виконаними з використанням мальованого, ритого чи накладеного декору. - **Скульптура**: Малі скульптурні фігурки, які, імовірно, використовувалися в релігійних цілях. # Релігія і обряди - **Релігійні вірування**: Переконання базувалися навколо родючості і циклічності природи, що відображалося в символіці та ритуалах. - **Погребальні звичаї**: Типовим є поховання в ямах, з деякими регіональними відмінностями. Падіння та спадщина Кінець трипільської культури не є добре зрозумілим: існують теорії про кліматичні зміни, вичерпання родючої землі або інвазії кочівників. Її спадщина, особливо у гончарстві, продовжувала впливати на наступні культури, що сформували основу для розвитку сучасних слов'янських народів. Висновок Трипільська культура є важливою частиною історико-культурної спадщини, що продемонструвала високий рівень розвитку ранніх суспільств на території Європи.

Ці культури включали: 1. **Сточно-криська культура** 2. **Культура з лінійно-стрічковою керамікою** Ці культури внесли до формування Трипільської культури знання з питань землеробства, особливостей ведення господарства і обробки землі. # Географічне поширення: Трипільська культура поширилася на території сучасної України, Румунії та Молдови, в районах з родючими чорноземами, що сприяли розвитку продуктивного землеробства. # Хронологія виникнення: Трипільська культура зазвичай датується періодом між 5400 та 2750 роками до нашої ери, розподіляючись на ранню, розквіт та пізню фази її розвитку. # Технологічні інновації: Ранні трипільці продовжили освоєння технік землеробства та тваринництва від своїх попередників, вирощуючи різні види пшениці та інших злаків, таких як ячмінь, а також удосконалили гончарство, зумівши створювати характерні розписні керамічні вироби. # Соціальні зміни: З розвитком землеробства і зростанням завдяки цьому населення, трипільські громади формували все більші та організовані поселення, що свідчить про зростання соціальної комплексності, в тому числі і в ієрархічних відносинах та владних структурах. # Релігійні та ритуальні практики: Культові практики трипільців, залишки яких можна знайти в археологічних знахідках, таких як фігурки богині-матері та знаки зооморфної (тваринних форм) і антропоморфної (людських форм) скульптури, вказують на те, що виникнення цієї культури було пов'язано з розвитком релігійних вірувань і обрядовості. # Зв'язки із сусідніми культурами: Взаємодія з іншими сусідніми культурами не може бути виключена, адже обмін технологіями, товари і ідеї могли переходити між регіональними групами через торгівлю та міграцію, що сприяло подальшому розвитку та еволюції самої Трипільської культури. У сукупності, коріння Трипільської культури свідчать про динамічний розвиток ранніх неолітичних суспільств і важливість місцевих і регіональних контекстів у формуванні однієї з найвпливовіших давніх культур Європейського континенту."},{"instruction":"Nightblue Music list","output":"Nightblue Music is a record label and YouTube channel known for promoting electronic dance music (EDM), particularly in genres such as dubstep, drum & bass, glitch hop, and melodic EDM.

Концепция стартапа: TrustCycle – это платформа циркулярной экономики, основанная на принципах экономики доверия и намеренная создать сообщество, где пользователи могут обмениваться отходами для повторного использования и переработки. Платформа будет объединять всех участников процесса от индивидуальных потребителей до компаний и перерабатывающих заводов. Проблема: Слишком много отходов не попадает в переработку из-за неэффективной системы сбора и пунктов приема, что ведет к увеличению экологического загрязнения. Решение: Создание децентрализованной платформы, которая позволит пользователям легко перерабатывать отходы, доверяя друг другу и внося вклад в благотворительность и улучшение экологической обстановки. Основные характеристики стартапа: 1. Регистрация пользователей удостоверяется с помощью цифровых идентификаторов, повышая уровень доверия между участниками системы. 2. Пользователи могут выставлять на платформе объявления о готовности сдать вторсырье, а также искать доступные ресурсы для переработки в своем регионе. 3. Внедрение системы рейтингов и отзывов для повышения доверия и прозрачности в действиях участников. 4. Взаимодействие с местными перерабатывающими заводами для организации вывоза и переработки отходов. 5. Каждое сданное вторсырье конвертируется в баллы на платформе, которые можно обменять на скидки у партнеров или направить в благотворительные проекты, поддерживаемые платформой. 6. Проведение образовательных кампаний по вопросам переработки и управления отходами среди пользователей. 7. Объединение с другими стартапами и организациями, которые работают в направлении устойчивого развития и экологической ответственности. Монетизация: - Партнерская программа с продавцами экологически чистых товаров и услуг, где платформа получает процент от сделок; - Продажа данных о потоках вторсырья для планирования производства и маркетинговых исследований (с соблюдением политики конфиденциальности); - Премиум-аккаунты для компаний, желающих выделиться и показать свою социальную ответственность. Чтобы проект был успешным, платформе необходимо будет укрепить партнерство с муниципальными службами, экологическими НПО и социальными предприятиями.

As the respected law enforcement officer of Maycomb County, his words carried a weighty significance. Sheriff Tate began by acknowledging his longtime acquaintance with Tom Robinson. He described Tom as a humble and hardworking man, completely incapable of the crimes he was being accused of. The sheriff firmly believed in Tom's innocence. With a confident demeanor, Sheriff Tate then addressed the perplexing issue of the knife. He explained that there was no doubt that Tom had been unlawfully stabbed, but the circumstances surrounding the incident were far from straightforward. He revealed that the blade found in Tom's body was indeed consistent with a kitchen knife. However, there was more to the story. Sheriff Tate divulged that Tom's injuries were not self-inflicted but rather a result of a desperate act committed by Bob Ewell. The sheriff revealed that he had conducted a thorough investigation and found evidence suggesting that Ewell had fallen on his own knife while attempting harm against Tom. The wounds were not Tom's doing, but rather the accidental outcome of Ewell's malevolence. As Sheriff Tate continued his testimony, he highlighted another crucial fact. It was well-known in the community that Bob Ewell was left-handed, whereas Mayella Ewell had a visible black eye on her right side. This contradiction painted a clear picture of the true assailant in the incident. Sheriff Tate's eyes bore a determined gaze as he unveiled this compelling evidence. To solidify his case, Sheriff Heck Tate asked Tom Robinson to stand from his seat, revealing to the courtroom that Tom's left arm was deformed and rendered useless. This physical limitation lay at the core of Tom's inability to commit any acts of violence, let alone the alleged assault against Mayella Ewell. As Sheriff Heck Tate's testimony came to a close, the courtroom fell into a deep silence. Many found themselves questioning the veracity of the accusations made against Tom Robinson. The sheriff's words had exposed the truth behind the events that unfolded, challenging the prevailing prejudices that clouded the minds of the community. In that moment, Sheriff Heck Tate became a beacon of justice, upholding the principles of fairness, truth, and integrity. His unwavering dedication to seeking the truth shone through, igniting a flicker of hope in the hearts of those present.

The latest FDA-approved treatments include: 1. **Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**: These are the most recent class of drugs that have shown promise for the treatment of alopecia areata. They work by interfering with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is believed to be involved in the autoimmune attack on hair follicles. Two JAK inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, have been used off-label with some success prior to any targeted therapies being approved specifically for alopecia areata. 2. **Corticosteroids**: These are often used for their anti-inflammatory properties and can be administered as a topical treatment, injection into the affected area, or taken orally. 3. **Minoxidil (Rogaine)**: Often used for pattern hair loss, minoxidil can also encourage hair growth in some individuals with alopecia areata when applied to the scalp. 4. **Anthralin**: This is a topical medication that can alter the skin's immune function and is sometimes used in alopecia areata treatment regimens. 5. **Diphencyprone (DPCP)**: This topical immunotherapy is another treatment modality where a substance is applied on the scalp to induce an allergic rash, which can alter the immune response that affects hair follicles. 6. **Immunosuppressants**: While not a typical first-line treatment due to their side effects, drugs like cyclosporine can be used in severe cases.

As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, there were no guaranteed or universally effective treatments; however, several approaches may provide relief or improve the condition for some individuals. These treatments include: 1. **Corticosteroids**: Systemic corticosteroids are sometimes used to suppress the immune response that leads to hair loss. They can be taken orally, injected, or applied topically, but long-term use can have significant side effects. 2. **Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**: Recent advancements have shown JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, to be promising for some cases of severe alopecia areata and could extend to alopecia totalis as off-label use. These drugs work by blocking a specific pathway believed to play a key role in the autoimmune attack on hair follicles. 3. **Immunosuppressants**: Drugs such as cyclosporine that suppress the immune system may be considered, particularly in refractory cases, but they come with potential risks and side effects. 4. **Contact allergens**: Topical immunotherapy using contact allergens like diphencyprone (DPCP) might be attempted, although their effectiveness can vary. 5. **Ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids**: Occasionally used under occlusion for localized patches of hair loss, although less commonly in cases of alopecia totalis. 6. **Biologics**: Although not specifically approved for alopecia totalis, biologics that target immune system pathways might offer another treatment angle, but more research is needed in this area. It's essential for individuals with alopecia totalis to work closely with dermatologists with experience in treating hair loss disorders. Treatment plans are often individualized and may involve trial and error. Additionally, because alopecia totalis can affect a person's mental health and quality of life, psychological support and counseling may also be recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advances in understanding the molecular and genetic underpinnings of alopecia areata and related conditions continue to provide hope for the development of more targeted and effective treatments in the future. New therapies and drugs are continually being researched and may become available.

What do you think are the main causes of this problem and what measures could be taken to solve it?","output":"The issue of waste material filling up the earth, particularly plastic bags and other rubbish, has become a grave concern in today's society. This essay will delve into the major causes responsible for this problem and propose several effective measures that can be adopted to tackle it. Firstly, the surge in consumerism has played a pivotal role in exacerbating waste production. As modern societies become more affluent, there is an insatiable desire for material possessions, resulting in excessive production and consumption. Consequently, this leads to a substantial increase in waste generation. For instance, plastic bags, which are often given freely in supermarkets, are discarded after a single-use, contributing heavily to the landfill crisis. Furthermore, improper waste management systems contribute significantly to the accumulation of waste material. In many developing countries, there is a lack of effective waste disposal infrastructure, leading to waste mismanagement. Garbage dumps and landfills often overflow, with no proper measures taken to ensure waste is disposed of appropriately. This situation is further compounded by the absence of awareness and education regarding waste reduction and recycling practices. Several measures can be implemented to address this growing problem. Firstly, governments should impose stricter regulations on the production and distribution of plastic bags. Levying heavy taxes on single-use plastic bags and promoting the use of eco-friendly alternatives would encourage individuals to adopt environmentally-friendly practices. Moreover, the introduction of recycling initiatives at community and national levels should be prioritized. Providing accessible recycling bins, alongside awareness campaigns, would educate individuals on the importance of recycling and reduce waste material significantly. In addition, education plays a fundamental role in tackling this issue. Governments should collaborate with schools and organizations to incorporate waste management and environmental conservation into the curriculum. This would instill a sense of responsibility and awareness of waste reduction among the future generation. Furthermore, public awareness programs through media platforms and social organizations can inform individuals about the consequences of irresponsible waste disposal and promote sustainable practices. To conclude, the rapid accumulation of waste material, including plastic bags and other rubbish, is primarily caused by increasing consumerism and inadequate waste management systems. Effective solutions must be adopted to combat this problem. These include implementing strict regulations on plastic bag usage, encouraging recycling initiatives, enhancing waste management infrastructure, and promoting education and awareness programs. Only through a concerted effort from governments, individuals, and organizations can we reduce waste material and preserve our planet for future generations."},{"instruction":"Why as modern societies become more affluent, there is an insatiable desire for material possessions?","output":"As modern societies become more affluent, there are several factors that contribute to an insatiable desire for material possessions. One key factor is the pervasive influence of consumer culture, which emphasizes the importance of material wealth and possessions as symbols of success and social status. Advertisements, media, and peer pressure often perpetuate the idea that owning more and newer items leads to a better quality of life and happiness. In addition, advancements in technology and globalization have made luxury goods and products more accessible than ever before. The constant exposure to innovative gadgets, fashionable clothing, and desirable lifestyle choices through various media channels creates a sense of aspiration and a desire to acquire these possessions. Moreover, the rise of social media platforms has contributed to the culture of showcasing material possessions as a form of validation and self-expression. People often feel compelled to display their wealth and status by flaunting the latest gadgets, designer clothing, and exotic travel experiences on their social media profiles. This constant exposure further fuels the desire for material possessions among individuals as they strive to keep up with societal expectations and trends. Furthermore, there is also a psychological aspect to the desire for material possessions. Studies have shown that individuals often seek comfort and reassurance in acquiring objects as a means of filling emotional voids or boosting self-esteem. The temporary pleasure and sense of accomplishment derived from acquiring new possessions provides a short-term sense of happiness and satisfaction. In summary, as modern societies become more affluent, an insatiable desire for material possessions arises due to the influence of consumer culture, accessibility to luxury goods, social media influence, and psychological factors such as self-validation. It is important to recognize and address these underlying causes to promote a more sustainable and mindful approach towards consumption."},{"instruction":"Nightblue Music playlist","output":"Nightblue Music was a popular YouTube channel known for promoting electronic dance music, particularly focusing on EDM subgenres like melodic dubstep, glitch hop, future bass, and more.

Komunikacja: Staraj się nawiązać otwartą i szczerą komunikację z dzieckiem. Zaproponuj mu, że jesteś gotów wysłuchać i zrozumieć jego uczucia i trudności. Daj mu przestrzeń, aby wyraził swoje obawy i pytania. 2. Słuchaj: Bądź empatycznym słuchaczem i staraj się zrozumieć perspektywę dziecka. Nie oceniaj go, ale pokaż, że jesteś tam, aby wspierać i pomagać. 3. Inne formy wsparcia: Zaproponuj dziecku inne formy wsparcia, które mogą się mu spodobać i które mogą być łatwiej dostępne. Może być to rozmowa z zaufaną osobą, czytanie książek o podobnych tematach, czy oglądanie filmów lub programów, które opowiadają o doświadczeniach dzieci z rodzin patchworkowych. Inne konteksty społeczne, takie jak grupy wsparcia dla rodzeństwa lub dzieci, które doświadczają podobnych sytuacji, mogą dostarczyć dziecku poczucia przynależności i zrozumienia. 4. Wzmocnij pozytywne aspekty: Skup się na budowaniu pozytywnych aspektów związanych z rodziną patchworkową. Pomóż dziecku zauważyć dobre strony przybranego rodzica i budować więzi w rodzinie. Wspieraj ich w rozwijaniu autonomii i zdolności do radzenia sobie. Ważne jest, aby być cierpliwym i uprzejmym w procesie wsparcia dziecka. W końcu każda osoba ma różne preferencje i nie zawsze otwarcie przyjmuje wsparcie w tradycyjnych formach terapeutycznych. Szukaj sposobów, które są dla dziecka najbardziej odpowiednie i akceptowalne."},{"instruction":"why doesn't it add new lines on n \\"Hej!

In HTML, new lines are generally represented by \`<br>\` tags or by styling elements with CSS to preserve whitespace formatting. From the JavaScript code you've provided, it looks like you're already aware of the need to preserve whitespace since you have a \`span\` element styled with \`white-space: pre-wrap;\` in your HTML. The \`pre-wrap\` value is supposed to preserve white spaces and line breaks. However, if \`n\` new lines are still not appearing as breaks, there could be a few things to look at: 1. Make sure that the surrounding HTML structure doesn't interfere with the rendering of the span. Sometimes, other styles can override \`white-space\` property. 2. Double-check that the content being inserted into the \`v-html\` directive is correctly formatted and that no other transformation is removing or altering the newline characters before they are passed to the HTML. 3. Ensure that there are no CSS rules that are overriding the \`white-space: pre-wrap;\` style on elements that contain the \`v-html\` directive. 4. If you're dealing with raw text strings with \`n\` characters, and you want them to be converted into HTML line breaks (\`<br>\`), you might need to add this transformation explicitly in your JavaScript before setting it as HTML content: \`\`\`javascript parsedText = parsedText.replace(/n/g, '<br>'); \`\`\` 5. If there is some other preprocessing or sanitization of the HTML content which converts the \`<br>\` tags back into text or removes them, ensure that this process is configured correctly. Remember that Vue's \`v-html\` is a directive that updates the \`innerHTML\` of the DOM element, so the string you provide should contain valid HTML markup. If \`parsedText\` directly uses \`n\`, these won't automatically become line breaks in the HTML — you need to convert them into \`<br>\` tags or ensure that the container element respects the newline characters through CSS."},{"instruction":"Một xe tải A khối lượng 3 tấn, kéo một xe tải B khối lượng 2 tấn bằng một dây nhẹ.

This paper aims to explore the origins and development of hip-hop, as well as analyze its current state and future trends within the American music scene. 1. Origins of Hip-Hop: Hip-hop's origins can be traced back to the South Bronx, New York City, where young African American and Latino communities sought an outlet for self-expression. Elements of rap music, DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti art combined to create a unique culture, reflecting the social issues and urban realities of the time. 2. The Growth and Evolution of Hip-Hop: 2.1 Early Years: In the late 1970s and early 1980s, hip-hop pioneers such as Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa used turntables to mix beats and create a new sound. This gave birth to rap music, where artists would rhythmically deliver lyrics over beats, addressing issues of social injustice, inequality, and life in urban neighborhoods. 2.2 Golden Age: The 1980s and early 1990s saw the emergence of influential hip-hop artists like Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, and N.W.A. Their lyrics addressed political and social concerns, becoming a powerful form of protest and advocacy. The beats became more complex, and sampling from various genres, including funk, soul, and jazz, became prominent. 2.3 Mainstream Success: By the late 1990s and early 2000s, hip-hop had achieved mainstream success and started to dominate the music industry. Artists like Jay-Z, Nas, and Eminem explored themes of personal experiences, success, and tragedy, creating a space for diverse narratives within hip-hop. 3. Contemporary Hip-Hop: 3.1 Subgenres and Fusion: Today, hip-hop has diversified into various subgenres, including gangsta rap, conscious rap, trap, and mumble rap. Artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Chance the Rapper have focused on storytelling and introspective lyrics, while artists like trap music pioneers Gucci Mane and Migos have brought a new wave of club-oriented beats and lyrical stylings. 3.2 Social and Cultural Impact: Hip-hop has become a dominant force in shaping popular culture, influencing fashion, language, and artistic expression globally. From fashion labels collaborating with hip-hop artists to cultural movements like Black Lives Matter, hip-hop's influence extends beyond music. 4. Future Trends in American Hip-Hop: 4.1 Embracing Diversity: As the hip-hop community continues to evolve, there is a growing emphasis on inclusivity and representation. Female artists, LGBTQ+ voices, and artists from diverse ethnic backgrounds are emerging and finding mainstream success, broadening the range of narratives within hip-hop. 4.2 Shifting Musical Landscape: The increasing accessibility of production tools and the rise of streaming platforms have democratized the music industry, allowing for more independent artists to thrive. This has led to a resurgence of underground and alternative hip-hop movements, challenging existing norms and commercial expectations. 4.3 Socio-Political Commentary: With ongoing social and political issues shaping the world, hip-hop is likely to continue addressing these concerns and acting as a catalyst for change. Artists will use their platforms to shed light on racial inequality, police brutality, civil rights, and other pressing matters. Conclusion: American hip-hop has grown from its humble beginnings in the South Bronx to become a globally recognized cultural and musical phenomenon. Its evolution, from addressing societal issues to dominating mainstream media, has made it an influential art form. Looking ahead, hip-hop will continue to push boundaries, embrace diversity, and serve as a powerful tool for social and political commentary.

Enhancing democratic processes: Public participation ensures that decisions made by municipal governments are based on the will and needs of the community. It allows citizens to have a say in shaping policies, programs, and services that directly affect their lives. This leads to a more inclusive and representative democracy. 2. Building trust and accountability: When citizens are engaged in decision-making processes, it fosters trust and transparency in municipal governance. It helps to establish an open and accountable relationship between citizens and their local government. Increased public participation can reduce the skepticism and cynicism that often exist between the public and their elected officials. 3. Leveraging local knowledge and expertise: Public participation allows municipalities to tap into the knowledge and expertise of its residents. By involving a diverse range of stakeholders, including community organizations, businesses, and residents, governments can benefit from a broader perspective and access local knowledge that may otherwise be overlooked. This can lead to more informed and effective decision-making. 4. Ensuring equitable and inclusive policies: Public participation helps to prevent the exclusion of certain groups or communities from decision-making processes. It allows marginalized and underrepresented populations to have a voice in shaping policies and programs that impact them. By actively involving diverse stakeholders, municipalities can ensure that policies and services are equitable and inclusive. 5. Improving the effectiveness of local governance: Engaging citizens in municipal governance can lead to better policy outcomes and more efficient service delivery. By involving the public in the decision-making process, governments can gain insights and feedback that may improve the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies and programs. This can result in more effective solutions that better meet the needs of the community. In summary, improving public participation in municipal governance is essential for enhancing democracy, building trust and accountability, leveraging local knowledge and expertise, ensuring equitable policies, and improving the effectiveness of local governance.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её из своего взгляда, я задала ещё пару вопросов, на которые она вежливо и профессионально ответила. Её голос был мелодичным и мягким, а каждое её движение будто подчеркивало её женственность и очарование. И когда, наконец, получив талон, я пошла к нужному кабинету, я уже не могла сдерживать свои мысли. Моё сердце билось сильнее, а в голове мелькали образы этой прекрасной медсестры. Весь день я думала о ней, пытаясь понять, что ко мне произошло. Меня привлекла не только её внешность, но и то, как она выполняла свою работу. Её уверенность и профессионализм заставили меня восхищаться ею. Я решила, что должна узнать её имя. На следующий день я снова пришла в поликлинику, надеясь увидеть её. И как бы банально это не звучало, но хотела поблагодарить её за её работу и прекрасное обслуживание. хочу увидеть продолжение истории Однако, когда я подошла к регистратуре, она не была там. Моё разочарование было неописуемо. Я старалась скрывать своё разочарование, но не смогла сдержать слезы, которые начали непроизвольно набираться в глаза. Взглянув на меня, одна из медсестер, заметив мою растерянность, спросила, что со мной произошло. Я попыталась улыбнуться ей и ответила, что я ищу ту медсестру, которая тут работала вчера и очень хотела ее поблагодарить. Медсестра понимающе кивнула и сказала, что её зовут Анна и она приходит работать только раз в неделю. Она посоветовала мне оставить записку для Анны, чтобы она могла узнать о моих благодарностях. Я благодарно кивнула и неохотно оставила записку с моими контактными данными. Возвращаясь домой, я с нетерпением ждала, что Анна свяжется со мной. Прошло несколько дней, и я начала сомневаться, что она когда-либо найдет мою записку. Но однажды утром, получив звонок от незнакомого номера, я почувствовала, как сердце снова застучало сильнее. “Привет, я Анна,” - прозвучало в трубке. Мой голос дрогнул от эмоций, и я рассказала ей о том, как сильно она меня впечатлила и я пригласила её к себе домой","output":"на ужин. Анна согласилась и мы договорились о времени.

Мы расставались только на несколько часов и с нетерпением ждали следующей встречи. Наша связь становилась сильнее с каждым днем, и я поняла, что влюбилась в Анну. Она была такой потрясающей женщиной, с яркими глазами и улыбкой, которая растворяла сердца. Мы планировали наше будущее вместе - путешествия, карьера и даже семью. Я не могла представить свою жизнь без неё. Но в один день, в поликлинике, где мы встретились впервые, произошло несчастье. Анна несчастным случаем получила серьезную травму. Моя жизнь перевернулась с ног на голову. Я проводила каждый день в больнице, поддерживая Анну и надеясь, что она скоро поправится. Моя любовь и забота были единственными вещами, которые держали ее на плаву. Я переживала каждую минуту, молясь за ее выздоровление. С каждым днем Анна становилась все сильнее и более оптимистичной. Ее глаза засияли отново, а улыбка вернулась на ее лицо. Мы пережили трудности вместе и выросли в сильную пару. Сегодня, когда вспоминаю тот день, когда я первый раз увидела Анну, я не могу не улыбнуться. Она изменила мою жизнь и принесла в нее невероятную любовь и счастье. Сейчас мы живем счастливо вместе, поддерживая и любя друг друга. Анна продолжает работать в поликлинике, помогая людям, как она помогла мне.

补肝肾类：六味地黄丸、左归丸等。 - 清热解毒类：龙胆泻肝汤、解毒消斑饮等。 - 活血化瘀类：桃红四物汤、独活寄生汤等。 2. 中药外用：选取具有活血化瘀，行气解毒作用的中药进行研磨制成粉末或泥状，外敷白斑。 - 外用敷剂：如三七粉、黄柏、土茯苓、白鲜皮等。 - 药浴：使用苦参、泽泻、蝉蜕等中药材熬水洗浴患处。 3. 针灸疗法：根据患者的病情和体质，在相应的穴位上施行针灸，常用穴位包括： - 配伍穴位：大椎、曲池、三阴交、肝俞等。 - 选择患处周围穴位：进行局部治疗，如皮肤病区域的环刺法或梅花针敲打法。 4. 食疗调养：根据患者的体质调整饮食，增强身体素质。 - 补益食物：黑芝麻、核桃、黑豆等。 - 忌食刺激性食物：酒、辛辣、海鲜、羊肉等可能会加重病情的食物。 5. 生活方式调整：包括心理疏导、避免紫外线过度曝晒、减少皮肤刺激等措施。 在采用上述任何一种治疗手段之前，强烈建议咨询专业的中医师或皮肤科医生，以便根据您的具体情况制定合适的治疗方案。中医治疗白癜风需要一个较长的疗程，并耐心观察效果，因此，患者在治疗时应该保持积极配合医生，调整生活习惯，并保持良好的心态。"},{"instruction":"可以给我推荐基本有关救治的医书供我参考一下吗","output":"关于白癜风的中医救治方法，您可以参考以下一些经典的中医书籍和现代中医皮肤病学著作，它们提供了中医理论背景、治疗原则与具体方剂用药： 1. 《黄帝内经》：中医学的基石，介绍了中医的基本理论和原则，有助于理解中医对疾病的基本看法和治疗原则。 2. 《伤寒杂病论》：张仲景所著，包含对很多疾病的病因分析和方剂治疗，有许多经典方剂至今仍在使用。 3. 《本草纲目》：明代李时珍所著，详细记载了大量草药的性质和治疗效果，是中药学的重要著作。 4. 《皮肤性病中医治疗学》：由张永祥等编著，该书系统地介绍了皮肤性病的中医治疗方法，包括白癜风在内的各种皮肤病。 5. 《中医皮肤病学》：作者常宏，系统介绍了各类皮肤病的中医治疗方法和临床经验。 6. 《中医临床治疗手册》：是临床实用性较强的参考书，涵盖了广泛的疾病，包括皮肤病和白癜风，非常适合临床医生参考。 7. 《中医皮肤科学》：该书内容全面，针对皮肤科的各种病证进行详细论述，包括白癜风。 请您注意，医书只能作为参考和学习之用，诊断和治疗白癜风还是应当在专业的医生指导下进行。中医学强调辨证施治，不同的患者可能需要不同的治疗方案，因此，患者或者学习者在使用这些书籍作为参考时，最好能够有资深的中医师的指导与建议。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу.

Не хотя отпускать её из своего взгляда, я задала ещё пару вопросов, на которые она вежливо и профессионально ответила. Её голос был мелодичным и мягким, а каждое её движение будто подчеркивало её женственность и очарование. И когда, наконец, получив талон, я пошла к нужному кабинету, я уже не могла сдерживать свои мысли. Моё сердце билось сильнее, а в голове мелькали образы этой прекрасной медсестры. Весь день я думала о ней, пытаясь понять, что ко мне произошло. Меня привлекла не только её внешность, но и то, как она выполняла свою работу. Её уверенность и профессионализм заставили меня восхищаться ею. Я решила, что должна узнать её имя. На следующий день я снова пришла в поликлинику, надеясь увидеть её.

Мой голос дрогнул от эмоций, и я рассказала ей о том, как сильно она меня впечатлила и я пригласила её к себе домой на ужин. Анна согласилась и мы договорились о времени.

NBT позволяет сохранять данные с детализацией до отдельных качеств и свойств, что открывает широкие возможности для настройки геймплея и создания разнообразного контента. Чтобы работать с NBT в Minecraft, нужно использовать либо игровые команды, либо сторонние редакторы (например, NBTExplorer) при редактировании save файлов игры. # Основы NBT NBT состоит из различных тегов, которые хранят данные. Каждый тег имеет тип и могут быть вложенными. Основные типы тегов: - \`Byte\` – это 8-битное целое число от -128 до 127. - \`Short\` – это 16-битное целое число от -32,768 до 32,767. - \`Int\` – это 32-битное целое число от -2^31 до 2^31-1. - \`Long\` – это 64-битное целое число от -2^63 до 2^63-1. - \`Float\` – это 32-битное число с плавающей точкой. - \`Double\` – это 64-битное число с плавающей точкой. - \`ByteArray\` – массив байтов. - \`String\` – строка текста. - \`List\` – список, содержащий теги других типов. - \`Compound\` – объект, содержащий другие теги в формате ключ-значение. - \`IntArray\` – массив целых чисел. - \`LongArray\` – массив чисел типа Long. # Примеры команд с использованием NBT в Minecraft 1. **Дать игроку предмет с особыми свойствами:** \`\`\` /give @p minecraft:enchanted_book{StoredEnchantments:[{id:\\"minecraft:sharpness\\",lvl:5s}]} 1 \`\`\` Эта команда даст игроку зачарованную книгу с уровнем остроты 5. 2. **Спавн моба с заданными характеристиками:** \`\`\` /summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {powered:1b,ExplosionRadius:10} \`\`\` Это вызовет заряженного крипера с радиусом взрыва 10 блоков. 3. **Изменение NBT существующего сущности:** \`\`\` /data merge entity @e[type=creeper,limit=1] {powered:1b} \`\`\` Эта команда сделает ближайшего крипера заряженным. 4. **Изменение NBT тайла (например, сундука)** \`\`\` /data merge block ~ ~ ~ {Items:[{Slot:0b,id:\\"minecraft:diamond\\",Count:64b}]} \`\`\` Это добавит стак алмазов в первый слот сундука, который стоит точно на позиции, где стоит игрок. # Использование NBT в командных блоках и скриптах Командные блоки и скрипты в Minecraft могут использовать NBT для того, чтобы реализовывать сложные механики в кастомных картах и мирах. Например, можно создавать задания с детализированными условиями, контролировать поведение мобов, настраивать сложные машинерии. # Анализ и редактирование NBT с помощью сторонних инструментов Для анализа и редактирования NBT вне игры можно использовать программы типа NBTExplorer. Эти инструменты позволяют открывать файлы с сохранениями мира Minecraft и вносить изменения в NBT данных различных объектов напрямую. # Примечания и советы: - Будьте осторожны при работе с NBT, поскольку некорректные значения могут привести к нежелательным результатам или даже повредить ваш мир. - Всегда делайте резервные копии миров, прежде чем вносить изменения. - NBT редактирование может быть недоступно на некоторых серверах из-за ограничений и правил сервера. - Всегда старайтесь понимать структуру NBT для конкретного объекта, с которым вы работаете. Minecraft Wiki может быть полезным ресурсом для этого."},{"instruction":"В самом начале ты написал все типы нбт. Сделай гайд по каждому. Например, байт, шорт...","output":"Давайте рассмотрим каждый тип NBT данных в Minecraft и примеры их использования. Это поможет вам понять, как работать с различными типами данных при создании предметов, мобов и других элементов в игре. # Byte Тип \`Byte\` используется для хранения очень маленьких целых чисел от -128 до 127. В Minecraft он часто используется для флагов, например, для определения состояния (включено/выключено). **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /summon zombie ~ ~ ~ {IsBaby:1b} \`\`\` Эта команда призовет маленького зомби (ребенка). # Short Тип \`Short\` представляет собой 16-битное целое число, которое может хранить значения от -32,768 до 32,767. Он используется реже, но может применяться для хранения данных, где значения \`Byte\` недостаточно. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /give @p minecraft:firework_rocket{Flight:3s} 1 \`\`\` Эта команда даст игроку фейерверк с продолжительностью полета 3. # Int Тип \`Int\` — это 32-битное целое число, которое может хранить значения от -2,147,483,648 до 2,147,483,647. Он используется для хранения больших чисел, например, в координатах или количестве опыта. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /xp add @p 1000 \`\`\` Эта команда добавит игроку 1000 очков опыта. # Long Тип \`Long\` — это 64-битное целое число, которое может хранить очень большие значения от -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 до 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. В Minecraft он используется редко и чаще всего в системных целях, например, для хранения уникальных идентификаторов. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /data get entity @p UUIDMost \`\`\` Эта команда покажет старшую часть UUID (уникального идентификатора) игрока. # Float Тип \`Float\` — это 32-битное число с плавающей точкой, которое используется для хранения дробных чисел. В Minecraft оно может использоваться для определения скорости, например, при выстреле стрелы. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /summon arrow ~ ~1 ~ {Motion:[0.0,0.6,0.0]} \`\`\` Эта команда призовет стрелу, которая будет двигаться вверх с определенной скоростью. # Double Тип \`Double\` — это 64-битное число с плавающей точкой, которое используется для более точного хранения дробных чисел. В Minecraft оно может использоваться для точных координат или скоростей. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /tp @p ~ ~ ~ {Rotation:[0.0f,90.0f]} \`\`\` Эта команда телепортирует игрока с поворотом на 90 градусов по оси Y. # ByteArray Тип \`ByteArray\` — это массив байтов, который может использоваться для хранения больших объемов двоичных данных. В Minecraft он используется редко и чаще всего в системных целях. # String Тип \`String\` — это строка текста. В Minecraft он используется для хранения текстовой информации, например, имен предметов, тегов и команд. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /give @p minecraft:stone{display:{Name:'{\\"text\\":\\"Magic Stone\\"}'}} \`\`\` Эта команда даст игроку камень с названием \\"Magic Stone\\". # List Тип \`List\` — это список, который содержит теги других типов. В Minecraft он используется для хранения списков предметов, эффектов, зачарований и т.д. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /give @p minecraft:potion{CustomPotionEffects:[{Id:6b,Amplifier:1b,Duration:200}]} \`\`\` Эта команда даст игроку зелье с эффектом мгновенного лечения II. # Compound Тип \`Compound\` — это объект, который содержит другие теги в формате ключ-значение. Это основной тип для структурирования данных в NBT. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /give @p minecraft:stick{display:{Name:'{\\"text\\":\\"Wizard Stick\\"}',Lore:['{\\"text\\":\\"This stick has magical powers.\\"}']}} \`\`\` Эта команда даст игроку палку с названием \\"Wizard Stick\\" и описанием \\"This stick has magical powers.\\" # IntArray и LongArray Типы \`IntArray\` и \`LongArray\` — это массивы целых чисел и чисел типа Long соответственно. Они используются для хранения больших массивов чисел. **Пример:** \`\`\`minecraft /data modify entity @p Inventory append value {Slot:0b,id:\\"minecraft:diamond\\",Count:64} \`\`\` Эта команда добавит в инвентарь игрока 64 алмаза в первый слот. Это основы каждого типа NBT в Minecraft. При работе с NBT важно помнить о правильном использовании типов данных и синтаксисе команд."},{"instruction":"Подробнее про массивы, список и compoud","output":"Давайте более подробно рассмотрим три типа NBT-тегов в Minecraft: \`List\`, \`Compound\`, и массивы (\`ByteArray\`, \`IntArray\`, \`LongArray\`). # List (Список) Тег \`List\` используется для хранения упорядоченного списка тегов. Все теги в списке должны быть одного и того же типа. Список может содержать теги, такие как \`Byte\`, \`Short\`, \`Int\`, \`Long\`, \`Float\`, \`Double\`, \`ByteArray\`, \`String\`, \`List\`, \`Compound\`, \`IntArray\`, или \`LongArray\`. **Пример использования List:** \`\`\`minecraft /give @p minecraft:potion{CustomPotionEffects:[{Id:6b,Amplifier:1b,Duration:200},{Id:9b,Amplifier:2b,Duration:400}]} \`\`\` Эта команда даст игроку зелье с двумя эффектами: мгновенное лечение II (Id:6, Amplifier:1) и отравление III (Id:9, Amplifier:2), каждый из которых имеет свою продолжительность. # Compound (Соединение) Тег \`Compound\` представляет собой сложный объект, который содержит пары ключ-значение, где ключ — это строка, а значение — это тег любого типа. Теги \`Compound\` могут быть вложенными, что позволяет создавать сложные структуры данных. **Пример использования Compound:** \`\`\`minecraft /give @p minecraft:golden_apple{display:{Name:'{\\"text\\":\\"Golden Apple of Immortality\\"}',Lore:['{\\"text\\":\\"This apple grants eternal life.\\"}']},Enchantments:[{id:\\"minecraft:unbreaking\\",lvl:3s}]} \`\`\` Эта команда даст игроку золотое яблоко с пользовательским названием и описанием, а также с зачарованием на \\"Неуничтожимость III\\". # Массивы (ByteArray, IntArray, LongArray) Массивы в NBT используются для хранения последовательности чисел одного типа. \`ByteArray\` содержит последовательность байтов, \`IntArray\` — последовательность целых чисел (\`Int\`), а \`LongArray\` — последовательность чисел типа \`Long\`. **Пример использования IntArray:** \`\`\`minecraft /setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:chest{Items:[{Slot:0b,id:\\"minecraft:diamond\\",Count:64b},{Slot:1b,id:\\"minecraft:emerald\\",Count:32b}]} \`\`\` Эта команда создаст сундук с алмазами в первом слоте и изумрудами во втором. Хотя здесь не используются массивы напрямую, каждый слот представляет собой \`Compound\` с \`Byte\`, \`String\`, и \`Byte\` для слота, ID и количества соответственно. **Пример использования ByteArray:** \`\`\`minecraft /setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:structure_block{metadata:\\"Custom\\",integrity:1.0f,powered:0b,seed:0L,showair:0b,showboundingbox:1b,size:[10,10,10]} \`\`\` В этом примере мы используем \`setblock\` для создания структурного блока с определенными параметрами. Хотя здесь не используется \`ByteArray\`, параметр \`size\` представляет собой массив из трех целых чисел, определяющих размер структуры. Обратите внимание, что в Minecraft не существует прямой команды для создания \`ByteArray\`, \`IntArray\`, или \`LongArray\` через чат или командные блоки. Эти типы данных в основном используются внутри игровых файлов и могут быть отредактированы с помощью редакторов NBT вне игры. При работе с NBT важно помнить о правильном форматировании и использовании типов данных. Неправильное использование может привести к нежелательным результатам или даже к повреждению вашего мира в Minecraft."},{"instruction":"Про компауд не понял. Давай подробнее с примерами где конкретно указано что из них компауд","output":"Тег \`Compound\` в NBT (Named Binary Tag) — это структура, которая хранит в себе набор пар ключ-значение. Каждый ключ — это уникальная строка, а значение может быть любым NBT-тегом, включая другие \`Compound\` теги, что позволяет создавать вложенные структуры данных. В Minecraft \`Compound\` теги используются практически везде, где требуется хранение сложных данных, таких как характеристики предметов, данные сущностей (мобов), информация о блоках и многое другое. Давайте рассмотрим пример с использованием \`Compound\` тегов: \`\`\`minecraft /give @p minecraft:stick{display:{Name:'{\\"text\\":\\"Magic Wand\\"}',Lore:['{\\"text\\":\\"Wield the power of the elements!\\"}']},ench:[{id:16,lvl:1}]} \`\`\` В этой команде: - \`minecraft:stick\` — это ID предмета, который мы хотим дать игроку. - \`{display:{...},ench:[{...}]}\` — это \`Compound\` тег, который содержит в себе другие теги и массивы тегов. - \`display\` — это \`Compound\` тег внутри основного \`Compound\` тега, который определяет отображение предмета. - \`Name:'{\\"text\\":\\"Magic Wand\\"}'\` — это строка (тип \`String\`), которая задает название предмета. - \`Lore:['{\\"text\\":\\"Wield the power of the elements!\\"}']\` — это список (тип \`List\`), содержащий строки с описанием предмета. - \`ench:[{id:16,lvl:1}]\` — это список зачарований (тип \`List\`), каждый элемент которого является \`Compound\` тегом, содержащим информацию о конкретном зачаровании. - \`id:16\` — это ID зачарования (в данном случае острота). - \`lvl:1\` — это уровень зачарования. Каждый уровень вложенности в \`Compound\` теге обозначается фигурными скобками \`{}\`. Внутри этих скобок находятся пары ключ-значение, разделенные двоеточием. Если значение является другим \`Compound\` тегом или списком, оно также заключается в фигурные или квадратные скобки соответственно. Важно понимать, что \`Compound\` теги могут быть очень вложенными и содержать множество уровней структуры.

Расположение этой директории может отличаться в зависимости от операционной системы и того, используете ли вы стандартный Minecraft Launcher или сторонний лаунчер, такой как MultiMC или Twitch/CurseForge. Для стандартного Minecraft Launcher расположение папок с зависимостями обычно выглядит следующим образом: # Windows: \`\`\` C:Users<Ваше имя пользователя>AppDataRoaming.minecraftlibraries \`\`\` # macOS: \`\`\` /Users/<Ваше имя пользователя>/Library/Application Support/minecraft/libraries/ \`\`\` # Linux: \`\`\` /home/<Ваше имя пользователя>/.minecraft/libraries/ \`\`\` В этих директориях вы найдете папку \`libraries\`, которая содержит подпапки с различными зависимостями, используемыми Minecraft. Каждая зависимость разделена по своим соответствующим пакетам и версиям. Например, LWJGL будет храниться в подпапке, соответствующей его имени и версии. Обратите внимание, что папка \`.minecraft\` может быть скрытой в вашей файловой системе, поэтому вам может потребоваться включить отображение скрытых файлов и папок, чтобы увидеть её. Если вы используете сторонний лаунчер, путь к папке с библиотеками может отличаться. В таком случае обычно лучше всего обратиться к документации лаунчера или его настройкам, чтобы найти точное расположение файлов. Кроме того, важно помнить, что редактирование или удаление файлов в этих папках может привести к неправильной работе игры или даже к её поломке.

Прежде чем продолжить, важно отметить, что запуск Minecraft без официального лаунчера может нарушить условия лицензионного соглашения и не поддерживается Mojang. Также это может привести к проблемам с безопасностью и стабильностью игры. Тем не менее, если вы хотите попробовать это сделать, вам потребуется: 1. Указать путь к основному классу игры, который обычно находится в файле \`net.minecraft.client.main.Main\`. 2. Передать аргументы, которые обычно генерируются лаунчером, включая: - Пути к библиотекам, используемым игрой. - Параметры входа в аккаунт (имя пользователя, UUID, токен доступа). - Параметры конфигурации игры, такие как размер окна, версия игры и т.д. - Параметры JVM для оптимизации работы игры.

Ainsi, pour que F(x) soit définie, il faut que 4-x² ≥ 0 (c'est-à-dire que 4-x² soit positif ou nul) et que x+1 ≠ 0 (c'est-à-dire que x+1 ne soit pas égal à zéro). Pour résoudre cela, on peut résoudre l'inéquation 4-x² ≥ 0 et l'équation x+1 ≠ 0. 2- Pour résoudre l'inéquation quadratique 5x²-4x+1 < 0, on peut utiliser la méthode du discriminant. Le discriminant est calculé en utilisant la formule Δ = b²-4ac, où a, b et c sont les coefficients de notre équation. Dans notre cas, a = 5, b = -4 et c = 1. Calculons le discriminant : Δ = (-4)² - 4(5)(1) = 16-20 = -4 Comme le discriminant est négatif, cela signifie qu'il n'y a pas de solutions réelles à cette inéquation.

La dérivée de g(x) est g'(x) = 2x-6. Le taux de variation de g(x) est donné par la dérivée, donc il suffit de trouver les valeurs de x pour lesquelles g'(x) est supérieur à zéro, nul ou inférieur à zéro. Si g'(x) > 0, alors la fonction g(x) est croissante. Si g'(x) = 0, alors la fonction g(x) présente un point d'extremum (maximum ou minimum). Si g'(x) < 0, alors la fonction g(x) est décroissante. En résolvant g'(x) = 0, on trouve : 2x-6 = 0 2x = 6 x = 3 Ainsi, pour x < 3, g(x) est décroissante, pour x = 3, g(x) atteint un minimum local, et pour x > 3, g(x) est croissante."},{"instruction":"В один прекрасный день, я пришла в поликлинику за талоном к врачу и стоя в очереди к свободному окну регистратуры, приметила симпатичную медсестру, и пока шла очередь я не могла отвести от неё глаз, с каждым человеком кому она выдавала талон, я всё ближе и ближе приближалась к ней и вот он тот самый момент, когда во всей очереди осталась стоять только я, подойдя к стойке регистратуры я взглянула на неё в полной мере и неожиданно замерла. Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её из своего взгляда, я задала ещё пару вопросов, на которые она вежливо и профессионально ответила. Её голос был мелодичным и мягким, а каждое её движение будто подчеркивало её женственность и очарование. И когда, наконец, получив талон, я пошла к нужному кабинету, я уже не могла сдерживать свои мысли. Моё сердце билось сильнее, а в голове мелькали образы этой прекрасной медсестры. Весь день я думала о ней, пытаясь понять, что ко мне произошло. Меня привлекла не только её внешность, но и то, как она выполняла свою работу. Её уверенность и профессионализм заставили меня восхищаться ею. Я решила, что должна узнать её имя. На следующий день я снова пришла в поликлинику, надеясь увидеть её. И как бы банально это не звучало, но хотела поблагодарить её за её работу и прекрасное обслуживание. Однако, когда я подошла к регистратуре, она не была там. Моё разочарование было неописуемо. Я старалась скрывать своё разочарование, но не смогла сдержать слезы, которые начали непроизвольно набираться в глаза. Взглянув на меня, одна из медсестер, заметив мою растерянность, спросила, что со мной произошло. Я попыталась улыбнуться ей и ответила, что я ищу ту медсестру, которая тут работала вчера и очень хотела ее поблагодарить. Медсестра понимающе кивнула и сказала, что её зовут Анна и она приходит работать только раз в неделю. Она посоветовала мне оставить записку для Анны, чтобы она могла узнать о моих благодарностях. Я благодарно кивнула и неохотно оставила записку с моими контактными данными. Возвращаясь домой, я с нетерпением ждала, что Анна свяжется со мной. Прошло несколько дней, и я начала сомневаться, что она когда-либо найдет мою записку. Но однажды утром, получив звонок от незнакомого номера, я почувствовала, как сердце снова застучало сильнее. “Привет, я Анна,” - прозвучало в трубке. Мой голос дрогнул от эмоций, и я рассказала ей о том, как сильно она меня впечатлила и я пригласила её к себе домой на ужин. Анна согласилась и мы договорились о времени. Вечером, когда Анна пришла ко мне домой, я была сильно взволнована. одев красивые шортики и том, я стала ждать звонка в дверь Когда Анна появилась передо мной, я ощутила прилив счастья.

Начнем с упрощения: ( y = (x + 3)^2 cdot e^{2 - x} ) Это уравнение не упрощается в алгебраическом смысле без дополнительного контекста. Можно разложить квадрат суммы, но это не упростит выражение существенно. Но если вы хотите найти производную функции ( y ) по переменной ( x ), тогда это становится задачей вычисления производной. Пользуясь правилами дифференциации и правилом произведения, мы можем найти ( y' ), производную функции ( y ): ( y = (x + 3)^2 cdot e^{2 - x} ) Применим правило произведения (правило Лейбница): ( y' = (x + 3)^2 cdot frac{d}{dx}(e^{2 - x}) + e^{2 - x} cdot frac{d}{dx}((x + 3)^2) ) Теперь найдем производные отдельно для каждого множителя: Для ( e^{2 - x} ): ( frac{d}{dx}(e^{2 - x}) = -e^{2 - x} ) (используем факт, что производная от ( e^{u} ) по переменной ( x ) есть ( e^{u} cdot frac{du}{dx} ), где ( u = 2 - x ) и ( frac{du}{dx} = -1 )) Для ( (x + 3)^2 ): ( frac{d}{dx}((x + 3)^2) = 2(x + 3) cdot frac{d}{dx}(x + 3) = 2(x + 3) ) (используя цепное правило и факт, что производная от ( x ) по ( x ) есть 1) Теперь подставляем найденные производные обратно в исходное выражение: ( y' = (x + 3)^2 cdot (-e^{2 - x}) + e^{2 - x} cdot 2(x + 3) ) Раскроем скобки для окончательного вида производной: ( y' = -e^{2 - x} cdot (x + 3)^2 + 2(x + 3) cdot e^{2 - x} ) Мы можем немного упростить это, вынеся общий множитель ( e^{2 - x} ): ( y' = e^{2 - x} cdot (- (x + 3)^2 + 2(x + 3)) ) И в этом виде у нас есть производная исходной функции ( y ) по ( x )."},{"instruction":"noi tieng viet di","output":"Chào bạn!

Also, here I've used the Tailwind CDN for simplicity, but in a real project, you should set up Tailwind with PostCSS for a production build to help reduce the final size of the CSS. Remember, this is just a starting point.

Добавление одного камня приводит к победе, если перед ходом Пети в куче было ровно 39 камней: [ n + 1 = 40 ] [ n = 39 ] 2. Удвоение приводит к победе, если перед ходом Пети в куче было ровно 20 камней: [ 2 cdot n = 40 ] [ n = 20 ] Таким образом, Петя может выиграть в один ход только если в куче изначально 20 или 39 камней.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу.

Не хотя отпускать её из своего взгляда, я задала ещё пару вопросов, на которые она вежливо и профессионально ответила. Её голос был мелодичным и мягким, а каждое её движение будто подчеркивало её женственность и очарование. И когда, наконец, получив талон, я пошла к нужному кабинету, я уже не могла сдерживать свои мысли. Моё сердце билось сильнее, а в голове мелькали образы этой прекрасной медсестры. Весь день я думала о ней, пытаясь понять, что ко мне произошло. Меня привлекла не только её внешность, но и то, как она выполняла свою работу. Её уверенность и профессионализм заставили меня восхищаться ею. Я решила, что должна узнать её имя. На следующий день я снова пришла в поликлинику, надеясь увидеть её. И как бы банально это не звучало, но хотела поблагодарить её за её работу и прекрасное обслуживание. Однако, когда я подошла к регистратуре, она не была там. Моё разочарование было неописуемо. Я старалась скрывать своё разочарование, но не смогла сдержать слезы, которые начали непроизвольно набираться в глаза.

Я попыталась улыбнуться ей и ответила, что я ищу ту медсестру, которая тут работала вчера и очень хотела ее поблагодарить. Медсестра понимающе кивнула и сказала, что её зовут Анна и она приходит работать только раз в неделю. Она посоветовала мне оставить записку для Анны, чтобы она могла узнать о моих благодарностях. Я благодарно кивнула и неохотно оставила записку с моими контактными данными. Возвращаясь домой, я с нетерпением ждала, что Анна свяжется со мной. Прошло несколько дней, и я начала сомневаться, что она когда-либо найдет мою записку. Но однажды утром, получив звонок от незнакомого номера, я почувствовала, как сердце снова застучало сильнее. “Привет, я Анна,” - прозвучало в трубке. Мой голос дрогнул от эмоций, и я рассказала ей о том, как сильно она меня впечатлила и я пригласила её к себе домой на ужин. Анна согласилась и мы договорились о времени. Вечером, когда Анна пришла ко мне домой, я была сильно взволнована. одев красивые шортики и том, я стала ждать звонка в дверь Когда Анна появилась передо мной, я ощутила прилив счастья.

В предоставленном коде сообщение сначала преобразуется из текстового файла в строку двоичных значений, каждый символ кодируется как последовательность из 8 бит (или 1 байт). Если ваше сообщение содержит 205 символов (включая пробелы и знаки препинания), то оно будет содержать 205 * 8 = 1640 бит, так как каждый символ кодируется в 8 бит. Допустим, у вас есть текстовый файл \`студбилет.txt\`, содержание которого вы хотите использовать в качестве ЦВЗ. Возможно, в файле 205 символов (если это помещается в 1640 бит).

В зависимости от размера и разрешения исходного изображения может быть ограничено количество информации, которое можно безопасно встроить в изображение. Перегруженное изображение может привести к заметным артефактам или быть легко обнаруженным при стеганографическом анализе."},{"instruction":"Но в измененных блоках у меня вывод 1441 блок, это не равно длине цвз","output":"Из вашего вопроса видно, что вы имеете дело с двумя различными величинами: длиной цифрового водяного знака (ЦВЗ) в битах (в данном случае 1640) и количеством измененных блоков изображения (1441 блок). Эти две величины не обязательно должны быть равными друг другу, так как они описывают разные аспекты процесса стеганографии. Длина ЦВЗ в битах определяется количеством информации, которую вы хотите встроить в изображение. В данном случае сообщение состоит из 1640 бит информации. Это сообщение разбито на отдельные биты, которые затем встраиваются в изображение. Количество изменённых блоков изображения — это количество блоков, в которые был встроен хотя бы один бит ЦВЗ. В данном случае 1441 блок содержит изменения, связанные с встраиванием ЦВЗ. Это число может быть меньше или больше длины ЦВЗ в битах и зависит от способа распределения битов ЦВЗ по блокам изображения. Так происходит по нескольким причинам: 1. **Способ встроения**: Возможно, что каждый измененный блок несет не один бит, а несколько. Это зависит от метода встраивания ЦВЗ. Например, если вы используете блоки изображения размером 8x8 пикселей и можете вместить 4 бита информации на каждый блок (один бит на две строки в условном блоке маски), тогда вам потребуется 1640/4 = 410 блоков для полного встраивания сообщения. Однако, достичь точного соответствия не всегда возможно, так как размер изображения или способ распределения битов может накладывать ограничения. 2. **Стоп-сигналы и дополнительные данные**: В конце ЦВЗ могут быть добавлены дополнительные биты, чтобы указать на конец сообщения. Это может включать стоп-сигналы или паддинг для выравнивания данных. 3. **Результаты**: Сумма измененных блоков не обязательно равна длине ЦВЗ, потому что изменения могут быть распределены по блокам неравномерно, и некоторые блоки могут содержать больше информации, чем другие. Если вы обнаружили, что изменилось 1441 блок, это может означать, что каждый блок содержит несколько битов ЦВЗ, или что некоторые блоки изменились из-за специфики алгоритма встраивания ЦВЗ.

Вот некоторые из возможных причин: 1. **Ошибки в алгоритме встраивания**: Если алгоритм встраивания ЦВЗ был реализован с ошибками или неадекватно обрабатывал исходные данные, это может привести к неверному встраиванию сообщения и соответственно к проблемам при его извлечении. 2. **Ошибки в алгоритме извлечения**: При аналогичных недочётах в алгоритме извлечения информации цифровой водяной знак может быть прочитан неправильно, что приведет к расхождению с исходным ЦВЗ. 3. **Изменение изображения после встраивания ЦВЗ**: Если изображение было модифицировано после встраивания ЦВЗ (например, пересохранено в формате с потерями, подвергнуто редактированию или обработке), это может нарушить встроенные данные, делая невозможным точное извлечение ЦВЗ. 4. **Неадекватные параметры алгоритма**: Возможно, параметры, используемые в алгоритме встраивания (такие как маска, коэффициенты яркости, значение \`alpha\` и пр.), не были оптимальными, и это привело к недостаточно устойчивому встраиванию ЦВЗ. 5. **Неверная синхронизация между встраиванием и извлечением**: Если процесс извлечения ЦВЗ не использует те же самые параметры или не следует тому же алгоритмическому протоколу, что и процесс встраивания, извлечение может привести к ошибочным результатам. 6. **Превышение емкости изображения**: Если в изображение пытаются встроить больше информации, чем это возможно без заметных искажений, это тоже может нарушить процесс извлечения. Для решения этой проблемы проверьте следующее: - Убедитесь, что изображение не было изменено после встраивания ЦВЗ. - Проверьте корректность параметров алгоритма встраивания и извлечения. - Посмотрите, не происходят ли ошибки при кодировании и декодировании символов (кодировка символов должна быть согласована между встраиванием и извлечением). - Удостоверьтесь, что используемые алгоритмические функции \`embedDataInBlock\` и \`extractDataFromBlock\` совпадают и работают правильно. - Убедитесь, что стоп-сигнальных биты в конце сообщения определяются верно и адекватно обрабатываются.

Однако при извлечении ЦВЗ вам также необходимо обратить внимание на то, чтобы корректно интерпретировать извлеченные двоичные данные. Если двоичное представление было изменено алгоритмом встраивания, нужно убедиться, что при извлечении вы правильно разделяете поток извлеченных бит на группы по 8 бит (1 байт), прежде чем перевести их обратно в символы. Этот процесс должен быть точным обратным к встраиванию, чтобы гарантировать точное восстановление исходного сообщения. Ваш текущий код не показывает процесс извлечения ЦВЗ в деталях, но вам нужно убедиться, что извлеченные данные обрабатываются тем же способом, что и данные при встраивании. Это означает, что после извлечения битов ЦВЗ их можно группировать по 8 бит и затем преобразовывать в соответствующие символы, учитывая использованную кодировку.

Количество белого или однородного пространства в изображении может в некоторых случаях уменьшить эффективность процесса стеганографии, потому что обнаружение изменений на однородных областях может быть более заметным. Рассмотрим следующие аспекты: 1. **Восприимчивость к изменениям**: Белые или однородные участки изображения более чувствительны к видимым искажениям, вызванным встраиванием информации. Такие изменения могут быть заметны на фоне однотонных областей, особенно если используется метод стеганографии на основе наименее значимых битов (LSB). 2. **Контрастность**: Высококонтрастные участки (где белый резко сменяется черным или другим темным цветом) могут скрывать изменения лучше, чем области с низким уровнем контрастности, что делает встраивание ЦВЗ в такие места менее заметным. 3. **Наличие шума**: Изображения с естественным шумом или текстурой обычно лучше подходят для стеганографии, так как небольшие изменения в пикселях скрываются среди естественных неравномерностей изображения. 4. **Размер и разрешение**: Большее разрешение изображения предлагает больше пикселей для встраивания ЦВЗ и позволяет распределить изменения более утонченно, что также способствует незаметности встроенной информации. 5. **Характеристики встраивания**: Некоторые методы стеганографии могут адаптироваться к свойствам изображения, например, выбирая участки с высокой сложностью текстуры для встраивания данных и избегая однотонных участков. Когда дело доходит до изображений с большим количеством белого или однородного пространства, стеганографические методы должны быть выбраны и настроены так, чтобы минимизировать риск детектирования изменений. В случае метода LSB, вы можете соответствующим образом подкорректировать алгоритм, чтобы он выбирал для встраивания ЦВЗ более сложные участки изображения, при условии что всегда есть достаточное количество таких участков для размещения всей нужной информации. Таким образом, тип изображения, его размер, разрешение, контраст и текстура играют важную роль в методах стеганографии и их способности эффективно скрывать встроенную информацию без значительного ущерба для качества изображения или риска обнаружения."},{"instruction":"Проверь на смысловую логику мой алгоритм встраивания и вытаскивания цвз, верно ли он работает","output":"Чтобы оценить смысловую логику вашего алгоритма встраивания и извлечения цифрового водяного знака (ЦВЗ) на основе предоставленного кода на языке Wolfram Language, давайте рассмотрим основные этапы алгоритма.

Важно убедиться, что этот процесс выполняется последовательно и не приводит к потере информации. - Алгоритмы \`embedDataInBlock\` и \`extractDataFromBlock\` должны быть взаимно обратимы, чтобы изменения, внесённые в процессе встраивания, могли быть точно обнаружены и правильно интерпретированы при извлечении. - Весь процесс должен учитывать возможное изменение формата или обработку изображений после встраивания ЦВЗ, которые могут нарушить встроенные данные.

Он используется для скрытой передачи информации путем незначительной модификации пикселей изображения. Один из популярных способов, основанный на этом методе, модифицирует коэффициенты дискретного косинусного преобразования (DCT) в сжатии JPEG. Процесс обычно включает следующие шаги: 1. **Выбор блоков**: Изображение делится на блоки (обычно 8x8 пикселей для формата JPEG). 2. **Вычисление DCT**: Для каждого блока вычисляются коэффициенты дискретного косинусного преобразования (DCT). 3. **Квантование**: Коэффициенты DCT квантуются с использованием таблицы квантования, специфичного для JPEG. 4. **Встраивание информации**: Изменение одного из квантованных коэффициентов DCT (не включая DC-коэффициент) в каждом блоке согласно встраиваемому биту информации. Например, если встроенный бит равен 1, выбранный коэффициент может быть увеличен, и наоборот, если бит равен 0, коэффициент может быть уменьшен. 5. **Обратное DCT**: Коэффициенты DCT, измененные и нет, преобразуются обратно, чтобы получить модифицированные блоки изображения. 6. **Сборка изображения**: Измененные блоки собираются в стеганографическое изображение. Для извлечения измененные коэффициенты DCT блоков проверяются, и в зависимости от их значения, определяется, какой бит был встроен. Обратите внимание, что ваш код, скорее всего, реализует иной вариант этой методики (или её часть), потому что он работает с изображениями в формате BMP, а не JPEG, и не включает обработку коэффициентов DCT и квантование. Для изучения вашего кода и его соответствия методу Лангелара потребуются подробности, связанные с форматом входных изображений и детали реализации.

Для оценки корректности реализации алгоритма и соответствия методу Лангелара, необходимо тщательно сравнить ваш код с описаниями этого метода в научных публикациях или специализированных источниках."},{"instruction":"Мой формат фото bmp и метод основ на средних значениях контрастности, напиши про это","output":"Если ваш метод стеганографии для формата BMP основан на средних значениях контрастности, то вероятно, что он работает с изменением яркости пикселей или их групп для встраивания информации в изображение. Подход, основанный на контрастности, предполагает использование разницы в яркости между соседними пикселями или группами пикселей для передачи данных. Рассмотрим эту идею более детально: В BMP формате цвет каждого пикселя обычно представлен его RGB (красным, зеленый и синим) компонентами. Изменения в значениях этих компонентов могут влиять на воспринимаемую контрастность изображения. **Принципы метода на основе контрастности:** 1. **Разбиение на блоки**: Изображение делится на блоки фиксированного размера (например, 8x8 пикселей), и для каждого блока анализируется контрастность. 2. **Вычисление средних значений контрастности**: Для каждого блока вычисляется среднее значение контрастности, возможно, с использованием определенных коэффициентов для R, G и B компонентов. Контрастность может быть определена различными способами, например, как разница между самым темным и самым светлым пикселями или как среднеквадратическое отклонение значений яркости. 3. **Модификация контрастности**: Контрастность каждого блока изменяется путем модификации яркости определенных пикселей в блоке. Например, внедряемый бит может определять, должно ли среднее значение контрастности увеличиваться или уменьшаться относительно некоторого порогового значения. 4. **Встраивание ЦВЗ**: Биты встраиваемого ЦВЗ логически распределяются по изменениям контрастности. Например, бит \\"1\\" может кодироваться увеличением контрастности, а бит \\"0\\" — уменьшением. 5. **Сохранение изображения**: После встраивания данных измененные блоки сохраняются в новом изображении формата BMP, содержащем скрытую информацию. **Извлечение данных:** 1. **Анализ контрастности**: При извлечении информации анализируются изменения в контрастности в блоках измененного изображения. 2. **Интерпретация битов**: Исходя из анализа контрастности и зная, как должны быть представлены биты, извлекается встроенный ЦВЗ. **Преимущества и недостатки:** Преимуществами метода на основе контрастности являются: - Сложность обнаружения: Если изменения в контрастности незначительны, обнаружение ЦВЗ может быть затруднено, что увеличивает устойчивость к невооруженному глазу и программному анализу. - Простота реализации: Алгоритм не требует сложных преобразований и может быть реализован относительно просто. К недостаткам можно отнести: - Влияние на качество изображения: Чрезмерное изменение контрастности может привести к видимым искажениям. - Ограниченная емкость: Количество встроенной информации может быть ограничено, чтобы избежать легко уловимых изменений в изображении."},{"instruction":"implement playwright typescript parametrized test by using parameters as values from csv file","output":"To implement a parametrized test using parameters as values from a CSV file in Playwright with TypeScript, you can follow these steps: 1.
