Given the below context:  Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In Symphony No. 2 (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).The title of Symphony No. 3, Sinfonia Espansiva (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \\"outward growth of the mind's scope\\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. Symphony No. 4, The Inextinguishable (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of timpani are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\\".Also frequently performed is the Symphony No. 5 (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In Symphony No. 6 (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony...  Guess a valid title for it!","output":"Considering the context provided and the themes explored in Nielsen's previous symphonies, a valid title for Symphony No. 6 could be \\"The Essence of Humanity.\\" This title would reflect the continuation of the exploration of human character and emotions, while also highlighting the 'simple' aspect of the subtitle, Sinfonia Semplice, as it gets to the core essence of what it means to be human."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I bought the book and couldn't wait to get started. It didn't take long however before I became quite annoyed with it. The characters were very vanilla and very predictable. The plot was so paper thin that one could see through it without trying. Worst of all, the humor was NON-EXISTANT!! Honestly, I didn't even get so much as a single chuckle in a book billed as a work of fictional humor. I'm a teacher and the entire work reminded me of something that a junior-high student would have written. A bad \\"joke\\" was made and then beat into the ground, being repeated over and over, ad nauseum. I honestly considered not even finishing the book, it was that bad.

Sentence 2: There settlement was self dependent and relied on ships. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. To provide a detailed explanation, we can break down the information given in both sentences and analyze the correlation between them.  In the first sentence, we are given information about a certain settlement. The settlement is described as \\"fiercely independent,\\" which suggests that it relies largely on its own resources and capabilities. The sentence also explicitly states that the settlement possesses its own fishing fleet and shipbuilding industry. This information tells us that the people in the settlement have the means to generate their food and resources from the sea (e.g., fishing) and the ability to construct the necessary tools and equipment to do so (e.g., shipbuilding). Now, let's turn to the second sentence. It asserts that \\"the settlement was self-dependent and relied on ships.\\" The notion of self-dependency aligns with the \\"fiercely independent\\" characteristic mentioned in the first sentence. It conveys the idea that the settlement sustains itself without depending heavily on external assistance. Furthermore, the phrase \\"relied on ships\\" in the second sentence also connects with the information in the first sentence, which established that the settlement had its own fishing fleet and shipbuilding industry. In summary, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence as both convey the idea of the settlement being independent and self-reliant, with a significant focus on ships for sustenance and resource generation. The second sentence serves as a concise summary or paraphrase of the main ideas presented in the first sentence without adding any contradictory information."},{"instruction":"Article: John had been on a business trip for three weeks.

Article: FILE - In this Aug. 12, 2009 file photo, President Barack Obama presents the 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Sandra Day O'Connor. O’Connor has stepped back from public life. The nation’s first... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, has stepped back from public life.      For more than a decade after leaving the court in 2006, O'Connor kept up an active schedule: serving as a visiting federal appeals court judge, speaking on issues she cared about and founding her own education organization. But the 88-year-old, for more than two decades often the deciding vote in important cases, is now fully retired. She made her last public appearances over two years ago.      This summer she turned over an office she had kept at the Supreme Court to the court's most recently retired justice, Anthony Kennedy.      Her son Jay O'Connor said in a recent telephone interview with The Associated Press that his mother, like many who reach their upper 80s, began to have challenges with her short-term memory. That made some public events more difficult. Hip issues have meant she now primarily uses a wheelchair. And she now stays close to her home in Phoenix, he said.      \\"When she hit about 86 years old she decided that it was time to slow things down, that she'd accomplished most of what she set out to do in her post-retirement years, that she was getting older physically and her memory was starting to be more challenging, so the time came to dial back her public life,\\" said Jay O'Connor. His mother is no longer doing interviews.      Over about the past year, Jay O'Connor and his brother Brian cleared out O'Connor's Supreme Court office and went through hundreds of boxes of files and other items she had in the building's basement. A gavel used at her 1981 confirmation hearing, her Presidential Medal of Freedom and T-shirts made annually by an exercise class she started at the high court are among the items O'Connor has now donated to the court's collection, the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian.      O'Connor was a state court judge before being unanimously confirmed to the Supreme Court at 51. She had graduated third in her class from Stanford Law School and was the first woman to lead the Arizona state senate. On the Supreme Court, her votes were key in cases about abortion, affirmative action and campaign finance as well as the Bush v. Gore decision effectively settling the 2000 election in George W. Bush's favor.      She was 75 when she announced her retirement from the court in 2005. It was a decision influenced by the decline in the health of her husband, John O'Connor III, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.      Her departure was a moment not unlike Kennedy's retirement this summer. The fellow Reagan appointees were moderate conservatives who often held the key vote in high-profile cases. O'Connor's retirement and replacement by Justice Samuel Alito shifted the court right, making Kennedy's vote the often-pivotal one. Kennedy's replacement by Justice Brett Kavanaugh is expected to shift the court right again.      For her part, O'Connor wasn't always delighted with the court's more conservative direction after she left. Asked at a 2009 event how she felt about the court retreating from or undoing rulings she was instrumental in shaping, she responded: \\"What would you feel? I'd be a little bit disappointed. If you think you've been helpful, and then it's dismantled, you think, 'Oh, dear.' But life goes on. It's not always positive.\\"      After the court's 2010 Citizens United ruling allowing corporations to spend freely on elections for Congress and president, she told an audience: \\"Gosh, I step away for a couple of years and there's no telling what's going to happen.\\" Still, that year she told an interviewer that she didn't \\"regret for one minute\\" retiring when she did.      O'Connor found other ways to make a mark off the court. In 2009, the same year her husband died, she founded the group iCivics, which promotes civic education in schools through free, educational online games. O'Connor has called it \\"the most important work I've ever done.\\" Last year, the group's 19 games were played by 5 million students.      Even as she was championing iCivics, O'Connor was working on other projects. She wrote a children's book and a book about the history of the court. She served as a visiting appeals court judge, participating in more than 175 cases on appeals courts nationwide. And she campaigned to persuade states that judges should be appointed, not elected, to preserve judicial independence.      One of the last times O'Connor made public comments was in 2016, after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Interviewed by an Arizona television station, O'Connor was asked what she thought about Republican senators' argument that the conservative justice's seat should be filled not by President Barack Obama but his successor because the vacancy happened in a presidential election year. She said she disagreed.      \\"I think we need somebody there, now, to do the job, and let's get on with it,\\" she said, a recommendation Republicans didn't heed, holding the seat open until President Donald Trump could choose Scalia's successor, Neil Gorsuch.      Though O'Connor has stepped back from public life, the court's other retired justices have varying degrees of public presence. David Souter, 79, lives in New Hampshire but rarely speaks publicly. Kennedy, 82, has already started making post-retirement appearances. Florida resident John Paul Stevens is still making appearances at 98.      Three women now serve on the Supreme Court, a development O'Connor approved of.      \\"It's all right to be the first to do something, but I didn't want to be the last woman on the Supreme Court,\\" she said in 2012.      ___      Follow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jessicagresko ||||| FILE - In this Aug. 12, 2009 file photo, President Barack Obama presents the 2009 Presidential Medal of Freedom to Sandra Day O'Connor.

The young secretary behind her looked on in disbelief. She was so ready for the weekend. But first she had to get to the office and put in her lousy eight hours. Why couldn't this woman just pay and get out of the way? Rebecca tossed the box at the clerk. A couple of donuts flew out and fell on the floor behind the counter. \\"Those are yesterday's donuts. I told you to give me the fresh ones.\\" \\"But, ma'am, these are the fresh--.\\" The look in her eyes stopped him cold. He dumped the box in the trash and picked out a fresher dozen. \\"Now, that'll be 9.87, please.\\" \\"Keep your drawers on, Jack.\\" She sampled the new batch. \\"That's more like it.\\" She threw a ten dollar bill on the counter and walked out with her donuts and large bottle of orange juice. Her enormous black 1979 Lincoln Continental Town Car was four feet longer and twice the weight of the young secretary's Toyota Corolla parked next to it. It was costing her a fortune to drive her dad's old car. But it made her feel close to him--even though he had been dead for eleven years. She rarely had an occasion to drive out of town--and it was not a big town. Sherman, Texas has about 36,000 residents. She pulled into the old strip mall parking lot. Most of the stores and other businesses were barely hanging on. The place hadn't seen decent shopping traffic since the 1980s. But it was the perfect location for Rebecca and her partner. They didn't need shoppers. All they needed was cheap office space. Theirs was narrow, but deep, with a reception area, two offices and a bathroom. Why did the secretary look on in disbelief?

We are given this equation:  0 = 719*z + 74*z - 87*z + 16944 Our job is to find the value of z. To do that, let's first add up all the z parts: 719*z + 74*z - 87*z = (719 + 74 - 87) * z = 706 * z Now, the equation looks like this: 0 = 706*z + 16944 We want to get z all by itself. So, let's move the 16944 to the other side of the equation by subtracting 16944 from both sides: 0 - 16944 = 706*z -16944 = 706*z Now, we need to get z by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 706: -16944 ÷ 706 = z After dividing, we will find the value for z: z ≈ -24 So, z is approximately equal to -24.

Answer the question...who lost his head in the french revolution??","output":"Several notable figures lost their heads during the French Revolution, a period of radical social and political upheaval that lasted from 1789 to 1799. The revolution was marked by widespread violence, and the guillotine became a symbol of its brutality. Below are some of the most well-known individuals who were executed during this tumultuous period: 1. King Louis XVI: Louis XVI was the last king of France before the fall of the monarchy during the French Revolution. He was convicted of high treason and executed by guillotine on January 21, 1793. His execution marked a significant turning point in the revolution, as it effectively ended France's centuries-long monarchy and paved the way for the radical phase of the revolution. 2. Marie Antoinette: Marie Antoinette was the wife of King Louis XVI and the last Queen of France. She became a symbol of the monarchy's excesses and was accused of treason and collusion with foreign powers. She was convicted and executed by guillotine on October 16, 1793, nine months after her husband's execution. 3. Maximilien Robespierre: Robespierre was a prominent leader of the French Revolution and the architect of the Reign of Terror, a period of extreme violence and political repression. Ironically, he would eventually become a victim of the very terror he helped create. He was arrested on July 27, 1794, and executed without trial alongside 21 of his supporters on July 28, 1794. 4. Georges Danton: Danton was a leading figure in the early stages of the French Revolution and served as the first President of the Committee of Public Safety. However, he later fell out of favor due to his opposition to the Reign of Terror. He was arrested, tried for conspiracy and corruption, and executed by guillotine on April 5, 1794. 5. Camille Desmoulins: Desmoulins was a journalist and politician who played a significant role in the French Revolution. He was a close friend of Robespierre and Danton and supported their radical policies. However, his opposition to the Reign of Terror contributed to his downfall. He was arrested, tried, and executed by guillotine on April 5, 1794, alongside Danton and other members of their political faction. 6. Charlotte Corday: Corday was a Girondin sympathizer who assassinated radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat in his bathtub on July 13, 1793. She believed that by killing Marat, she could help end the Reign of Terror. She was quickly arrested and tried for the crime, and she was executed by guillotine on July 17, 1793. These are just a few examples of prominent figures who were executed during the French Revolution. The period was marked by widespread fear, suspicion, and violence, which led to the deaths of thousands of individuals, both famous and ordinary. The guillotine came to symbolize the harsh and arbitrary nature of revolutionary justice during this tumultuous time."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Sasha touched the precious and fragile vase even after being told not to.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The second part of Snorri Sturluson's \\"Prose Edda\\" the Skáldskaparmál ([skaldskaparmal], , \\"language of poetry\\"; c. 50,000 words) is effectively a dialogue between Ægir, the Norse god of the sea, and Bragi, the god of poetry, in which both Norse mythology and discourse on the nature of poetry are intertwined. The origin of a number of \\"kennings\\" is given; then Bragi delivers a systematic list of \\"kennings\\" for various people, places and things. He then goes on to discuss poetic language in some detail, in particular \\"heiti\\", the concept of poetical words which are non-periphrastic (like \\"steed\\" for \\"horse\\"), and again systematises these. This in a way forms an early form of poetic thesaurus.  - Skoglar Toste or Skoglar Tosti ( there are several variations ) was a legendary chieftain from the Swedish province of West Götaland . His name ( skoglar , skauglar or skagul ) was reportedly due to his experience in battle . Toste is mentioned in several sagas , most notable in Heimskringla . According to Snorri Sturluson , he was the father of Sigrid the Haughty . For some time he gave refuge to Harald Grenske , who later came back to woo Sigrid , only to be killed by her for his persistence . According to the sagas , Skagul Toste was also the father of Ulf Tostesson , father of Ragnvald Ulfsson and grandfather of Stenkil who became the King of Sweden in 1060 . Toste is said to have collected great riches when he demanded danegeld as he led a Viking army to England in 970 . At Vallentuna , near Stockholm , the runestone of Orkesta ( U 344 ) reads : in ulfr hafir onklati  - Stenkil (Old Norse: Steinkell) was a King of Sweden who ruled c. 1060 until 1066. He succeeded Emund the Old and became the first king from the House of Stenkil. He was not from Uppsala, but probably from Västergötland and related to the previous dynasty by marriage to Emund's daughter.  - Västergötland, also known as West Gothland or the Latinized version Westrogothia in older literature, is one of the 25 traditional non-administrative provinces of Sweden (\\"landskap\\" in Swedish), situated in the southwest of Sweden.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Sigrid the Haughty, also known as Sigríð Storråda, is a queen appearing in Norse sagas as wife, first of Eric the Victorious of Sweden, then Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. Sigrid appears in many sagas composed generations after the events they describe, but there is no reliable evidence as to her existence as they describe her. The figure of Sigrid appears mainly in late Icelandic sagas, while more contemporary sources such as Thietmar of Merseburg and Adam of Bremen instead claim that Sweyn was married to a Polish princess, identified as witosawa. Snorri Sturlason gives conflicting information and in one place says that Sweyn was married to Sigrid and in another that he was married to a Gunhild of Wenden.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Snorri Sturluson (1179  23 September 1241) was an Icelandic historian, poet, and politician. He was elected twice as lawspeaker at the Icelandic parliament, the Althing. He was the author of the \\"Prose Edda\\" or \\"Younger Edda\\", which consists of \\"Gylfaginning\\" (\\"the fooling of Gylfi\\"), a narrative of Norse mythology, the \\"Skáldskaparmál\\", a book of poetic language, and the \\"Háttatal\\", a list of verse forms. He was also the author of the \\"Heimskringla\\", a history of the Norwegian kings that begins with legendary material in \\"Ynglinga saga\\" and moves through to early medieval Scandinavian history. For stylistic and methodological reasons, Snorri is often taken to be the author of \\"Egil's saga\\".  - The Alþingi (anglicised as or ) is the national parliament of Iceland. It is one of the oldest extant parliamentary institutions in the world. The Althing was founded in 930 at , the \\"assembly fields\\" or \\"Parliament fields\\", situated approximately east of what later became the country's capital, Reykjavík. This event marked the beginning of the Icelandic Commonwealth. Even after Iceland's union with Norway in 1262, the Althing still held its sessions at until 1799, when it was discontinued for 45 years. It was restored in 1844 and moved to Reykjavík, where it has resided ever since. The present parliament building, the , was built in 1881, of hewn Icelandic stone.  - Gylfaginning ([glvagng] either \\"Tricking of Gylfi\\" or \\"Gylfi's empowerment\\"; c. 20,000 words), is the first part of Snorri Sturluson's \\"Prose Edda\\" after Prologue. The \\"Gylfaginning\\" deals with the creation and destruction of the world of the Norse gods, and many other aspects of Norse mythology. The second part of the Prose Edda is called the \\"Skáldskaparmál\\" and the third \\"Háttatal\\".  - Harald Grenske (10th century) was a petty king in Vestfold in Norway.  - Egil's Saga is an Icelandic saga. The oldest manuscript (a fragment) dates back to 1240 AD. The saga is centered on the life of Egill Skallagrímsson (often Anglicised as Egil Skallagrimsson), an Icelandic farmer, viking and skald. It is generally referred to as Egla by Icelandic scholars. The saga is the only source of information on the exploits of Egill whose life is not historically recorded. Stylistic and other similarities between \\"Egil's Saga\\" and \\"Heimskringla\\" have led many scholars to believe that they were the work of the same author, Snorri Sturluson.  - The Háttatal (\\"conversation of meters\\"; c. 20,000 words) is the last section of the \\"Prose Edda\\" composed by the Icelandic poet, politician, and historian Snorri Sturluson. Using, for the most part, his own compositions, it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in Old Norse poetry. Snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach; he has systematized the material, and often notes that \\"the older poets did not always\\" follow his rules.  - Emund the Old or Edmund (Swedish: \\"Emund den gamle\\", Old Swedish: \\"Æmunðær gamlæ\\", \\"Æmunðær gammal\\", \\"Æmunðær slemæ\\") was King of Sweden from 1050 to 1060.   - Uppsala (older spelling \\"Upsala\\") is the capital of Uppsala County and the fourth largest city of Sweden, after Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. It had 140,454 inhabitants in 2010.  - The House of Stenkil was a dynasty on the Swedish throne from c. 1060 to c. 1125. Stenkil probably originated from Västergötland.  - Thietmar (also Dietmar or Dithmar; 25 July 975  1 December 1018), Prince-Bishop of Merseburg from 1009 until his death, was an important chronicler recording the reigns of German kings and Holy Roman Emperors of the Ottonian (Saxon) dynasty. Two of Thietmar's great-grandfathers, both referred to Liuthar, were the Saxon nobles Lothar II, Count of Stade, and Lothar I, Count of Walbeck. They were both killed fighting the Slavs at the Battle of Lenzen.  - Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: \\"Sveinn Tjúguskegg\\"; Danish: \\"Svend Tveskæg\\"; 960  3 February 1014) was king of Denmark, England, and parts of Norway. His name appears as Swegen in the \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\". He was the son of King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, and the father of Cnut the Great.  - Ragnvald Ulfsson the Old (beginning 11th century) was a jarl of Västergötland or Östergötland, and married to a sister of Olav Tryggvason.  - Ynglinga saga is a legendary saga, originally written in Old Norse by the Icelandic poet and historian Snorri Sturluson about 1225. It is the first section of his \\"Heimskringla\\". It was first translated into English and published in 1844 by Samuel Laing.  - Heimskringla is the best known of the Old Norse kings' sagas. It was written in Old Norse in Iceland by the poet and historian Snorri Sturluson (1178/791241) ca. 1230. The name \\"Heimskringla\\" was first used in the 17th century, derived from the first two words of one of the manuscripts (\\"kringla heimsins\\" - \\"the circle of the world\\").  - Eric the Victorious (Old Norse: \\"Eiríkr inn sigrsæli\\", Modern Swedish: \\"Erik Segersäll\\") (c. 945?  c. 995) was the first Swedish king (c. 970995) about whom anything definite is known. Whether he actually qualifies as King of Sweden has been debated, as his son Olof Skötkonung was the first ruler documented to have been accepted both by the Svear around Lake Mälaren and by the Götar around Lake Vättern.  - Gunhilda of Wenden was a semi-legendary Polish or other Slavic princess and Danish Viking age queen consort, the supposed spouse of 10th-century King Sweyn I of Denmark (9861014).  - The Prose Edda, also known as the Younger Edda, Snorri's Edda or, historically, simply as Edda, is an Old Norse work of literature written in Iceland in the early 13th century. The work is often assumed to have been written, or at least compiled, by the Icelandic scholar and historian Snorri Sturluson around the year 1220.  - Ulf Tostesson was a jarl and the son of the legendary Viking Skogul Toste. He was the brother of Sigrid the Haughty, and his son, Ragnvald Ulfsson, a jarl, was the father of Stenkil, who was elected king when the old House of Munsö died out.

Step 1: Understand the problem The problem states that there is a 50% probability of rain on any given day during summer in Chicago. We need to find the probability of exactly 3 rainy days from July 4 through July 7 (4 days in total). Step 2: Analyze the given information - Probability of rain on any given day is 50%, so the probability of it not raining on any given day is also 50%. - We have a total of 4 days (July 4, 5, 6, and 7). Step 3: Calculate the probability of exactly 3 rainy days - There are 4 possible ways to have exactly 3 rainy days: RRRN, RRNR, RNRR, and NRRR (where 'R' represents a rainy day and 'N' represents a non-rainy day). - The probability of each of these cases happening is (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^1, which equals 1/16. - Since there are 4 such possibilities, add up their probabilities: 4 * (1/16). Step 4: Find the correct answer choice The calculated probability is 4 * (1/16) = 1/4. The answer is: a) 1/4"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with “Teen Lab” splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In early 1900s London, magician Robert Angier performs his trick, 'The Real Transported Man,' to a sold out theater. Rival magician Alfred Borden, in disguise, sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap door and into a waiting water tank, where Borden watches him drown. At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingÃ©nieur, John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads. In flashback, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, alongside ingÃ©nieur John Cutter and assistant Julia, who is also Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank, from which she frees herself and escapes.

He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada).

I was walking through the house one morning and suddenly I could see NOTHING out of one eye. When I told my husband,who was right there when it happened, he assumed my eye was just blurry or something had gotten in the eye. He took me to the ophthalmologist who verified that I could not see out of the eye. Then we subsequently got the worse news that it was a neurological condition with a long name I do not remember that there was nothing he could do about. He said that I would either get my sight back or I you and all we could do was wait and see if it came back. This was right before finals that semester but he told me I absolutely could not be studying or using my good eye for reading or basically anything that would strain it or I could end up losing sight in that eye also. Needless to say, as a mom of two children ages 2 1/2 and 6 months,I could not afford to lose ALL of my sight! So, I had to wait. I could not drive like that either which made matters worse. Both my husband and I were in school fulltime (until then), fortunately it was the end of the semester, unfortunately it was BEFORE finals. My sight did come back but not for about 5 months. When it first started to come back I still couldn't drive because although I could see I did not have my peripheral vision, that did not fully come back for quite a while. I cannot imagine it a person who goes totally blind goes through, I just know for me it was not an easy to to go through. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Sarah's publisher, John Bosload (Charles Dance), offers her his country house near Lacoste, France for some rest and relaxation. After becoming comfortable with the run of the house, Sarah's quietude is disrupted by a young woman claiming to be the publisher's daughter, Julie (Ludivine Sagnier).

He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present.

Question: What does Joey do after Jake asks him if he had an affair with Vikki? Title: Raging Bull Movie plot: In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight.

In some ways, calling it a \\"joint\\" (singular) is a misnomer, since the lumbosacral junction includes a disc between the lower lumbar vertebral body and the uppermost sacral vertebral body, as well as two lumbosacral facet joints (right and left zygapophysial joints).  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - The cecum or caecum (plural ceca ; from the Latin \\"caecus\\" meaning blind) is an intraperitoneal pouch that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine. It is typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of the body as the appendix, to which it is joined).   - In human anatomy, the thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm, is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases and air is drawn into the lungs.  - An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. Their role as shock absorbers in the spine is crucial.  - The pelvic inlet or superior aperture of the pelvis is a planar surface which defines the boundary between the pelvic cavity and the abdominal cavity (or, according to some authors, between two parts of the pelvic cavity, called lesser pelvis and greater pelvis).  - The ascending colon is the part of the colon located between the cecum and the transverse colon.  - The thorax or chest (from the Greek  \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain.  - In anatomy, the abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls.  - The rectum (from the Latin \\" \\", meaning \\"straight intestine\\") is the final straight portion of the large intestine in some mammals, and the gut in others. The human rectum is about long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge.  - The transverse colon is the longest and most movable part of the colon . It crosses the abdomen from the ascending colon at the hepatic or right colic flexure with a downward convexity to the descending colon where it curves sharply on itself beneath the lower end of the spleen forming the splenic or left colic flexure . In its course , it describes an arch , the concavity of which is directed backward and a little upward . Toward its splenic end there is often an abrupt U-shaped curve which may descend lower than the main curve . It is almost completely invested by peritoneum , and is connected to the inferior border of the pancreas by a large and wide duplicature of that membrane , the transverse mesocolon . It is in relation , by its upper surface , with the liver and gall - bladder , the greater curvature of the stomach , and the lower end of the spleen ; by its under surface , with the small intestine ; by its anterior surface , with the posterior layer of the greater omentum and the abdominal wall ; its posterior surface is in relation from right to left with the descending portion of the duodenum , the head of the pancreas , and some of the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum . The transverse colon absorbs water and salts .  - The pubic symphysis or symphysis pubis is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting the superior rami of the left and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2 mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth.  - The sigmoid colon (pelvic colon) is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. It forms a loop that averages about 35-40 cm in length. The loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma () or Latin letter S (thus \\"sigma\\" + \\"-oid\\"). This part of the colon normally lies within the pelvis, but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity.  - The pelvic brim is the edge of the pelvic inlet. It is an approximately apple-shaped line passing through the prominence of the sacrum, the arcuate and pectineal lines, and the upper margin of the pubic symphysis.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys.  - The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans and many other animals that contains many organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet , opening into the pelvis.  - The descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum.  - The spleen (from Greek \\"spln\\") is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter.  - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear.  - The cephalothorax, also called prosoma in some groups, is a tagma of various arthropods, comprising the head and the thorax fused together, as distinct from the abdomen behind. (The terms \\"prosoma\\" and \\"opisthosoma\\" are equivalent to \\"cephalothorax\\" and \\"abdomen\\" in some groups.) The word \\"cephalothorax\\" is derived from the Greek words for head  and thorax . This fusion of the head and thorax is seen in chelicerates and crustaceans; in other groups, such as the Hexapoda (including insects), the head remains free of the thorax. In horseshoe crabs and many crustaceans, a hard shell called the carapace covers the cephalothorax.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells.  - The large intestine, or the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.

Plot title: The Exorcist III Movie plot: The film begins with the point of view of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us \\"I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs.\\" The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard. Leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered. Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer, out to see their mutually favorite film It's a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes placeâa priest is found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalizedâand found murdered the next dayâwith the words \\"IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\\" [sic] written on a wall in Dyer's blood. The fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer James \\"The Gemini\\" Venamun, was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \\"L\\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \\"usefull\\" or \\"carefull\\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim.

(2) David Foster called her rehearsal performance \`\` very nice '' , and Andrea Bocelli called her voice spectacular . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these two sentences may initially appear to convey the same general idea, they do not mean exactly the same thing. The discrepancies between the two sentences can be seen when we closely examine the attributes, the subjects, and the actions involved. In Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli called her sample performance \\"very nice.\\" - David Foster called her voice spectacular. In Sentence 2: - David Foster called her rehearsal performance \\"very nice.\\" - Andrea Bocelli called her voice spectacular. Now, let's break down the differences between the two sentences: 1. Difference in Subjects: Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli comments on the sample performance. - David Foster comments on her voice. Sentence 2: - David Foster comments on the rehearsal performance. - Andrea Bocelli comments on her voice. In Sentence 1, Andrea Bocelli is commenting on the sample performance, while David Foster is commenting on her voice. In contrast, Sentence 2 has David Foster commenting on the rehearsal performance, while Andrea Bocelli is focusing on her voice. Although Bocelli comments on her voice in both scenarios, the context differs as David Foster evaluates separate aspects of her performances. 2. Difference in Attributes: Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli: sample performance. - David Foster: her voice. Sentence 2: - David Foster: rehearsal performance. - Andrea Bocelli: her voice. Here, we notice that Andrea Bocelli is evaluating a sample performance in Sentence 1 and David Foster is assessing a rehearsal performance in Sentence 2. These two types of performances could possess distinct characteristics, and the feedback might not be interchangeable or identical. 3. Difference in Actions: Sentence 1: - Andrea Bocelli: called the sample performance \\"very nice.\\" - David Foster: called her voice spectacular. Sentence 2: - David Foster: called the rehearsal performance \\"very nice.\\" - Andrea Bocelli: called her voice spectacular. While both sentences include the phrase \\"called her voice spectacular,\\" the adjectives used to describe her performances differ. In Sentence 1, Andrea Bocelli describes the sample performance as \\"very nice,\\" while David Foster uses the same adjective for the rehearsal performance in Sentence 2. This difference implies that the feedback for the performances in each sentence may not be entirely the same. In conclusion, although Sentence 1 and Sentence 2 both highlight Andrea Bocelli and David Foster providing feedback on a performance, the nuances that differentiate the subjects, attributes, and actions involved make the two sentences distinct in their meanings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's?  Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jeff's soil has more toxic compounds than Brandon's. This is because Jeff's soil is hypoxic, which means it has low oxygen levels.

Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself?

Possible answers: get cash, Advertise the business to get customers, earn a promotion at their job Answer:","output":"Before opening their own business, Jesse has several steps to complete to lay a solid foundation for their entrepreneurial venture. While getting cash, advertising the business to get customers, and earning a promotion at their job can all be helpful steps, there is a myriad of other aspects to consider which can contribute to the success of their business. 1. Conduct market research: It's crucial for Jesse to investigate and understand the market in which they plan to operate. This entails analyzing target demographics, identifying consumer needs, and studying competitors. Armed with this data, Jesse can tailor their business to address existing gaps and target their ideal customers more effectively. 2. Develop a business plan: A well-structured business plan outlines the strategy, goals, and financial projections for Jesse's business. This document proves invaluable when seeking investment or loans and acts as a roadmap for business growth. 3. Legal structure and permits: Jesse must decide on the appropriate legal structure for their business, such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. This decision can have significant tax and legal implications, so it's critical to research which option best suits the business. Additionally, securing the necessary licenses and permits is crucial to operate legally. 4. Financing: As suggested, getting cash is a vital step before launching a business. Jesse can look for various sources of funding, including personal savings, loans, angel investors, and grants. A strong business plan and financial projections will improve their chances of securing these funds. 5. Brand identity: Establishing a cohesive brand identity helps convey the business's message, ideals, and value proposition to potential customers. Jesse should consider elements such as the name, logo, color scheme, and tone of voice when crafting their business's image. 6. Advertise the business: Garnering attention and attracting customers to the newly opened business is crucial for its success. Jesse should adopt various marketing channels such as social media, local newspapers, business directories, and promotional events to increase brand visibility and draw in customers. 7. Networking: Connecting with other entrepreneurs, potential clients, suppliers, and industry leaders can provide valuable insights and resources for Jesse's business. Networking events, conferences, or online communities offer opportunities for Jesse to forge meaningful connections and learn from others' experiences. 8. Set up operations: Before opening their business, Jesse needs to establish the necessary infrastructure, such as hiring staff, setting up office space or a storefront, and implementing efficient workflow processes. Effective management and delegation of tasks can help optimize productivity and ensure smooth day-to-day operations. 9. Develop a customer acquisition strategy: Acquiring and retaining customers is crucial for any business. Jesse should carefully consider their target audience and the specific channels, tools, and techniques required to generate sales leads and conversions. 10. Continuous improvement: Once the business is up and running, Jesse must be prepared to monitor its performance, identify any weaknesses or opportunities, and adapt their strategies accordingly. Engaging in ongoing market research, soliciting customer feedback, and being open to change will help ensure the business's continued growth and success. In summary, Jesse must conduct thorough market research, create a comprehensive business plan, secure financing, develop a strong brand identity, advertise the business, network with industry professionals, set up operations, devise a customer acquisition strategy, and commit to continuous improvement before opening their own business. Attending to these factors can significantly increase the likelihood of the business's success and sustainability in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh? is inside the article: Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts., can you guess it ?

Question: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the author probably think about killer whales?

It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself. The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt.

He went further in this interview, saying women must be involved in top decision-making matters.      _\\"The feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions.

In a wide-ranging interview published Thursday, the pope also said that women must play a key role in church decisions and brushed off critics who say he should be more vocal about fighting abortion and gay marriage.      Moreover, if the church fails to find a \\"new balance\\" between its spiritual and political missions, the pope warned, its moral foundation will \\"fall like a house of cards.\\"      The interview, released by Jesuit magazines in several different languages and 16 countries on Thursday, offers perhaps the most expansive and in-depth view of Francis' vision for the Roman Catholic Church.      The pope's comments don't break with Catholic doctrine or policy, but instead show a shift in approach, moving from censure to engagement.      Elected in March with the expectation that he would try to reform the Vatican, an institution that many observers say is riven by corruption and turf wars, Francis said his first mission is to change the church's \\"attitude.\\"      \\"The church has sometimes locked itself up in small things,\\" the pope said, \\"in small-minded rules.\\"      \\"The people of God want pastors,\\" Francis continued, \\"not clergy acting like bureaucrats or government officials.\\"      MORE ON CNN: New interview shows why the pope is so beloved      The interview was conducted by the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, editor of La Civilta Cattolica, a Jesuit journal based in Rome, over three meetings this August at Francis' apartment in Rome.      The pope approved the transcript in Italian, according to America magazine, a Jesuit journal based in New York that initiated the interview and supervised its translation into English.      Advance copies of the interview were provided to several news organizations, including CNN.      Jesuits from around the world submitted questions to Spadaro. Francis answered them with the frankness that has become a hallmark of his young papacy.      To begin the interview, Spadoro bluntly asks, \\"Who is Jorge Mario Bergolio?\\" - Francis's name before he was elected pope.      \\"I am a sinner,\\" the pope answers. \\"This is the most accurate definition. It is not a figure of speech, a literary genre. I am a sinner.”      The pope didn't mention any particular sins, and Catholic theology holds that all humans are sinners, a consequence of Adam and Eve's original transgression. Still, a pope describing himself foremost as \\"sinner\\" is striking.      MORE ON CNN: The pope said what? Six stunners from Francis      Offering new glimpses of his personal life, Francis said he prays at the dentist's office and felt trapped in the Vatican's traditional papal apartments. (He moved to a smaller one in a nearby building.) He has a taste for tragic artists and Italian films and keeps the will of his beloved grandmother in his prayerbook.      But it was the pope's vision for the church's future - painted in broad strokes - that's sure to rile or inspire Catholics, depending on which side of the church they sit.      Here are some highlights:      On Women      In July, Francis said, emphatically, that the \\"door is closed,\\" on women's ordination, a statement that disappointed many Catholic liberals.      But that doesn't mean the church should consider women secondary or inferior, Francis said. \\"The feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions,\\" he told Spadora.      Francis also called on Catholics to think hard about the function of women in the church.      \\"Women are asking deep questions that must be addressed,\\" the pope said. \\"The church cannot be herself without the woman and her role.\\"      On Homosexuality      When Francis was a bishop in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he received letters from gays and lesbians who said they were \\"socially wounded\\" by the church, he said.      \\"But the church does not want to do this,\\" Francis said in the interview.      The pope then recalled his comments in July, when he told the media aboard a flight to Rome, \\"Who am I to judge\\" gay people?      MORE ON CNN: Pope Francis on gays: 'Who am I to judge?'      \\"By saying this, I said what the catechism says,\\" the pope told Spadaro. The catechism, the Catholic Church's book of official doctrine, condemns homosexual acts, but says gays and lesbians \\"must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity.\\"      \\"Religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people, but God in creation has set us free: it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person.\\"      Francis said that someone once asked him if he \\"approved\\" of homosexuality.      \\"I replied with another question,\\" he said. \\"\`Tell me, when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?’ We must always consider the person. Here we enter into the mystery of the human being.\\"      Abortion, gay marriage and contraception      Some American Catholics grumble that Francis has been largely silent on signature Catholic political issues.      \\"I’m a little bit disappointed in Pope Francis that he hasn’t, at least that I’m aware of, said much about unborn children, about abortion, and many people have noticed that,\\" Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, said earlier this month.      Francis said that he's aware of the criticism, but he is not going to change.      “We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods,\\" he told his Jesuit interviewer. \\"I have not spoken much about these things, and I was reprimanded for that.\\"      But the pope said the church's teachings on those issue are clear, and he clearly believes in those teachings, so what else is there to say?      \\"It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,\\" Francis said.      False prophets and quick decisions      Only false prophets claim to have all the answers, Francis said.      \\"The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt,\\" he said. \\"You must leave room for the Lord.\\"      But church leaders, including himself, haven't always practiced humility, the pope admitted.      Many of the bad decisions he made while leading Catholics in Argentina came about because of his \\"authoritarianism and quick manner of making decisions,\\" the pope said.      That won't happen again, Francis said, as he begins to steer the church in a new direction.      He didn't offer an exact course, but he said change will come. Sooner or later.      \\"Many think that changes and reforms can take place in a short time,\\" he said. \\"I believe that we always need time to lay the foundations for real, effective change. And this is the time of discernment.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In an interview with La Civilta Cattolica, a Jesuit journal in Rome, Pope Francis, the first Jesuit pope, reflected on his style, influences, and priorities.

You should use a dry dust mop instead of a broom, as the broom could scratch the tiles. Make sure you use the dust mop in any corners of the room and between the tiles. Removing the surface dirt and dust will make cleaning the tiles easier. You should then use a mild cleaning solution on the floor to get rid of any stains and dirt. You can use a commercial cleanser or make your own solution using water and vinegar.  Combine ¼ cup white vinegar with two gallons of warm water to make a home cleaning solution. Mop the floor and let it sit for five to ten minutes. The vinegar will help to disinfect, deodorize, and clean the tiles. You can look for commercial cleaner at your local hardware store or in the cleaning aisle. Make sure the cleaner is made for use on unpolished or unglazed porcelain tiles. Once you apply the cleanser, you should let it sit on the floor for about 10 minutes. Then, use a soft bristle brush to scrub at any stains. Scrub in circular motions at the stains until they are removed. You should wipe away any remaining cleaner solution on the floor and then rinse it well with hot water.

Maid Reportedly Described Alleged Sex Assault by IMF Chief in Phone Call to Brother The woman accusing IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of a sexual assault told her brother \\"somebody did something really bad to me\\" in a phone call shortly after the alleged attack, the U.K. Daily Mail reports. The 32-year-old woman, a maid at the Sofitel Hotel in Manhattan, reportedly told her brother that she was trapped inside Strauss-Kahn's bedroom while he twice tried to force himself on her. \\"She rang me and she said, 'Somebody has done something really bad to me. I've been attacked,'\\" the woman's brother told the newspaper. Strauss-Kahn, who heads the International Monetary Fund, spent the night in jail at Rikers Island, a 400-acre penal complex that offers a strikingly different level of comfort than the 3,000-a-night Manhattan hotel suite where authorities say he tried to rape the maid. Strauss-Kahn was being held on a charge that would normally result in release, but he was denied bail Monday after prosecutors warned the wealthy banker might flee to France and put himself beyond the reach of U.S. law like the filmmaker Roman Polanski. Strauss-Kahn's weekend arrest rocked the financial world as the IMF grapples with the European debt crisis, and upended French presidential politics. Strauss-Kahn, a member of France's Socialist party, was widely considered the strongest potential challenger next year to President Nicolas Sarkozy. Making his first appearance Monday on the sex charges, a grim-looking Strauss-Kahn stood slumped before a judge in a dark raincoat and open-collared shirt. The 62-year-old, silver-haired economics chief said nothing as a lawyer professed Strauss-Kahn's innocence and strove in vain to get him released on bail. \\"This battle has just begun,\\" defense attorney Benjamin Brafman told scores of reporters outside the courthouse, adding that Strauss-Kahn might appeal the bail denial. Because of his high profile, Strauss-Kahn will be held in protective custody on Rikers Island, away from most detainees, said city Correction Department spokesman Stephen Morello. Unlike most prisoners who share 50-bed barracks, he will have a single-bed cell and will eat all of his meals alone there. He'll have a prison guard escort when he is outside his cell. Rikers is one of the nation's largest jail complexes, with a daily inmate population of about 14,000 — more than the prison populations of many states. The complex's notable history includes accounts of run-ins between inmates and guards. In one such case last year, a guard was sentenced to six years in prison for ordering inmate beatings as part of a rogue disciplinary system. Prosecutors said he imposed order in a unit at the complex by having teenage inmates beat other teenagers who had stepped out of line. The union that represents jail guards said the prisoners fabricated the allegations. Also last year, more than a dozen correction officers were injured while stopping fights between inmates awaiting pretrial hearings at a jail there. And in February, the city settled a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of an inmate who died after a scuffle with guards. Strauss-Kahn was ordered jailed at least until a court proceeding Friday. He cannot claim diplomatic immunity because he was in New York on personal business and was paying his own way, the IMF said. He could seek that protection only if he were conducting official business, spokesman William Murray said. The agency's executive board met informally Monday for a report on the charges against Strauss-Kahn, the managing director at the international lending agency since 2007. The French newspaper Le Monde, citing people close to Strauss-Kahn, said he had reserved the suite at the Sofitel hotel for one night for a quick trip to have lunch with his daughter, who is studying in New York. Strauss-Kahn is accused of attacking the maid, who had gone in to clean his penthouse suite Saturday afternoon at the luxury hotel near Times Square. He is charged with attempted rape, sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. The most serious charge carries five to 25 years in prison. The maid told authorities that she thought the suite was empty but that Strauss-Kahn emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway, pulled her into a bedroom and later dragged her into a bathroom, police said. He grabbed her breasts, tried to pull down her pantyhose, grabbed at her crotch and forced her to perform oral sex on him during the encounter at about noon, according to a court complaint. She ultimately broke free, escaped the room and told hotel staffers what had happened, authorities said. She was treated at a hospital for minor injuries. \\"The victim provided a very powerful and detailed account of the violent sexual assault,\\" Assistant District Attorney John \\"Ardie\\" McConnell said. He added that forensic evidence may support her account. Strauss-Kahn voluntarily submitted to a forensic examination Sunday night. The alleged victim's brother, whom the U.K. Daily Mail did not name, said he's confident Strauss-Kahn will be brought to justice. \\"I trust the American justice system and will let it do what it has to do,\\" the brother told the newspaper. \\"I want him to see justice. Justice will be served/\\" Brafman said defense lawyers believe the forensic evidence \\"will not be consistent with a forcible encounter.\\" Defense lawyers wouldn't elaborate, but Brafman said \\"there are significant issues that were already found\\" that make it \\"quite likely that he will be ultimately be exonerated.\\" Prosecutors asked the judge to hold Strauss-Kahn without bail, noting that he lives in France, is wealthy, has an international job and was arrested on a Paris-bound plane at Kennedy Airport. He had left the Sofitel hotel before police arrived, leaving his cell phone behind, and appeared hurried on surveillance recordings, authorities said. At one point, Strauss-Kahn called the hotel \\"in a panic\\" about the phone, a law enforcement official said Monday. Hotel security officers hadn't found a phone. But they were instructed by NYPD investigators to set a trap by informing him they had it and asking where they could get it to him, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation had not been completed. Strauss-Kahn told them he was about to board a flight — unknowingly tipping off authorities to his whereabouts, the official said. Prosecutors said they couldn't force Strauss-Kahn's return from France if he went there. \\"He would be living openly and notoriously in France, just like Roman Polanski,\\" said Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel Alonso, referring to the film director long sought by California authorities for sentencing in a 1977 child sex case. Defense lawyers suggested bail be set at 1 million and promised that the IMF managing director would remain in New York City. His lawyers said Strauss-Kahn wasn't trying to elude police Saturday: The IMF head rushed out of the hotel at about 12:30 p.m. to get to a lunch date with a family member, then caught a flight for which he had long had a ticket, they said. Allegations of other, similar attacks by Strauss-Kahn began to emerge Monday. In France, a lawyer for a novelist said the writer is likely to file a criminal complaint accusing him of sexually assaulting her nine years ago. A French lawmaker accused him of attacking other maids in previous stays at the same luxury hotel. And in New York, prosecutors said they are working to verify reports of at least one other case, which they suggested was overseas. A lawyer for 31-year-old French novelist Tristane Banon said she will probably file a complaint alleging Strauss-Kahn sexually attacked her in 2002. Lawyer David Koubbi told French radio RTL that Banon hadn't pressed her claim earlier because of \\"pressures\\" but would do so now because \\"she knows she'll be taken seriously.\\" The Associated Press is identifying Banon as an alleged victim of sexual assault because she has gone public with her account. McConnell, the assistant district attorney, said in court Monday that New York authorities are working to verify at least one other case of \\"conduct similar to the conduct alleged.\\" When the judge asked whether the potential other incident occurred in the United States, McConnell said he \\"believed that was abroad.\\" In France, defenders of Strauss-Kahn, a former finance minister who had topped the polls as a possible candidate in presidential elections next year, said they suspected he was the victim of a smear campaign. The 187-nation IMF provides emergency loans to countries in severe distress and tries to maintain global financial stability.

But, just to let you know, Amazon was terrific with the return and even printed out a return shipping label. Great service! Answer:","output":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. There are a few reasons for this: 1. Leakage issue: The reviewer mentions that they had read several reviews stating that the battery compartment leaked. This recurring issue indicates a potential design flaw or manufacturing defect in the product. 2. Short-lived performance: The reviewer shares their experience of the product's performance, highlighting that it only functioned for a short duration (about half an hour) before failing. This raises concerns about the product's durability and reliability. 3. Negative overall experience: The review title itself, \\"You Can Take A Chance,\\" implies an element of uncertainty or risk in purchasing the product. Although the reviewer decided to take a chance, their experience turned out to be less than satisfactory. 4. Returns process: It is worth noting that the reviewer had to return the product due to its failure. While they commend Amazon for being efficient and helpful with the return process, this does not alleviate the concerns about the product itself. In conclusion, taking into account the leakage issues, short lifespan, and the reviewer's overall negative experience with the product, my chances of buying this product would be significantly decreased.

During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic asthma, which also plagued her at a later age. Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, the owner of a carriage company, decided that it would be good for her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz. Context: The first major female tennis star to turn professional, Lenglen was paid US50,000 by American entrepreneur Charles C. Pyle to tour the United States in a series of matches against Mary K. Browne. Browne, winner of the US Championships from 1912 to 1914, was 35 and considered to be past her prime, although she had reached the French final earlier that year (losing to Lenglen 6-1, 6-0).  For the first time in tennis history, the women's match was the headline event of the tour (which also featured male players). In their first match in New York City, Lenglen put on a performance that New York Times writer Allison Danzig lauded as \\"one of the most masterly exhibitions of court generalship that has been seen in this country.\\" When the tour ended in February 1927, Lenglen had defeated Browne, 38 matches to 0. She was exhausted from the lengthy tour, and a physician advised Lenglen that she needed a lengthy period away from the game to recover.  Instead, Lenglen chose to retire from competitive tennis to run a Paris tennis school, which she set up with the help and money of her lover Jean Tillier. The school, located next to the courts of Roland Garros, slowly expanded and was recognised as a federal training centre by the French tennis federation in 1936. During this period, Lenglen also wrote several books on tennis.  Lenglen was criticised widely for her decision to turn professional, and the All England Club at Wimbledon even revoked her honorary membership. Lenglen, however, described her decision as \\"an escape from bondage and slavery\\" and said in the tour programme, \\"In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis and have paid thousands of francs in entrance fees to be allowed to do so.... I have worked as hard at my career as any man or woman has worked at any career. And in my whole lifetime I have not earned 5,000 - not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study - tennis.... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy - should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? Or should I smile at the prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune - for whom?\\" As for the amateur tennis system, Lenglen said, \\"Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, and the fact of the matter is that only wealthy people do compete. Is that fair? Does it advance the sport? Does it make tennis more popular - or does it tend to suppress and hinder an enormous amount of tennis talent lying dormant in the bodies of young men and women whose names are not in the social register?\\" Question: How did Suzanne Lenglen commence her professional career?. Whats the answer?","output":"Suzanne Lenglen began her professional career when a man named Charles C. Pyle paid her US50,000 to play tennis in the United States. She played many matches against another lady named Mary K. Browne. Imagine if you played a lot of games against your friend and you won all of them. That's what Suzanne did, winning all 38 matches! But she was very tired after playing so many games and got sick, so she had to stop playing for a while. Then she decided to stop playing in competitions and instead started a school where she taught others how to play tennis. Does that make sense?"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This is an email I received a call from Jack Foley from the PG&E Credit Risk area regarding concerns to their exposure from TW. He cited that due to the' CC' S & P rating they had concerns regarding their monthly prepayment to TW of approximately  1.8 M, our marketing of their excess capacity, and the Operating Agreement at the interconnect regarding indemnification of the PCB cleanup. He stated that PG&E has exposure as a result of TW marketing their excess capacity which at present TW has paid PG & E it's portion. However, we are due to remarket in January for their Spring/Summer capacity where we bill, collect and remit to PG &E. Also, he advised that per the Operating Agreement at the interconnect, dated June 27, 1995, there is an indemnification for PCB cleanup and that we pay PG & E  300,000 to  400,000 per year and the agreement runs to 2007. He added that there is a reaffirmation of the 1995 agreement dated May 28,1999, with Steve and Lou as the signers. In order to alleviate their concerns, Foley proposed, 1) TW drop the prepayment requirement and 2) provide security/collateral to secure the remarketing and PCB cleanup.

Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.  Guess a valid title for it!

Write highlights for this article: A planning lawyer and self-styled 'mosque buster' claims he is fighting to stop the 'tide of Islam' by successfully blocking plans for the building of mosques across the UK. Gavin Boby, once linked to the far-right English Defence League, boasts he has already blocked plans for 16 out of 17 mosques being built. Under the banner of the Law and Freedom Foundation, he calls for people to come to him for free professional legal help in opposing mosque proposals and claims that Islam encourages paedophilia, sexual abuse and pimping. Scroll down for video. Gavin Boby, a self-styled 'mosque buster' who boasts that he has blocked plans for mosques being built and should be contacted for free legal advice. He claims to help followers resist planing applications for mosque developments by raising opposition with councils. The 48-year-old says in a video posted online: 'If anyone out there knows of an application for a new mosque, a cultural centre for some phoney community centre or some multi-faith inter-faith harmony institute then let me know.' Mr Boby, from Bristol, runs a planning consultancy but also provides legal assistant for those who oppose mosque developments, according to the Sunday Times. On the foundation website he claims to have stopped the construction of 16 out of 17 mosques in total. These include mosques in York, Blackpool, Bolton, Ealing and one in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, which was to replace 'the beautiful old Jolly Sailor Pub', according to the site. Mr Boby reportedly launched the service with a mock-up of the Ghostbusters logo - swapped for Mosquebusters - in which the ghost was replaced by hate preacher Abu Hamza. Vacancies for volunteers were posted on the EDL website. EDL has since endorsed the Law and Freedom Foundation, saying it is a 'great organisation' on Twitter and referring its followers who have a proposed mosque in their area to Mr Boby. In the website's 'about section' it explains the three threats to the survival of state authority in Britain and Europe. The Law and Freedom website which boasts 16 out of 17 plans to build mosques have been blocked. The third, it reads, is : 'Ethnic division, particularly between Islamic and non-Islamic. society, and the violence at the heart of Islamic doctrine. This is the. most visible problem, and the one that people will blame. 'Political and intellectual elites are undermining law or freedom. So we. need to take what action we can to preserve them ourselves.' Mr Boby has written an online guide that show how local citizens can make a legal case against mosques. In the guide it reads: 'Let councils know that they're on the hook for their decisions. Be relentless. Push.' He also suggests opposing an Islamic centre on the grounds of 'parking congestion', 'disturbance' and 'community relations'. The Jolly Sailor pub in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, which Mr Boby described as 'beautiful' and 'old'. There were proposals to turn the pub in to a mosque but Mr Boby helped block the plans. His advice is rooted in legal arguments, as he continues to suggest emphasising the proposed project will 'cause unacceptable pollution' from traffic and is a hazard to schoolchildren as it will 'bring outsiders with no connection to the area'. He appears to be driven by an apparent ideological hatred of Islam, referring in a video posted on YouTube to recent sex abuse cases, and claims mosques are 'not like churches' and are instead used to instruct followers to commit acts of paedophilia, sexual abuse and pimping. He says: 'Islamic doctrine permits, encourages and to a certain extent mandates Muslim men to take non-Muslim women as slaves to be used for sex. 'In order to stop the Islamic doctrine, which is the root of this problem, you have to prevent further mosques from being built.' Councils contacted by the Sunday Times said Mr Boby had not been instrumental in blocking the development of local mosques. Mr Boby told MailOnline: 'I are (sic) extremely proud that, when these concerned neighbourhoods approach us for help, we enable them to use the laws and consultation procedures that exist for their protection.' A spokesman for the EDL said: 'We support his organisation wholeheartedly and send many people from different communities with different issues concerning mosques in their area.'

Answer the following question: Article: From bankers to factory staff, employees in the West face a cold  _ of losing their jobs as a global recession  starts to bite. For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \\"In the Confucian mindset, the right thing to do is to share the burden, which is the sense of collective  responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,\\" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU). In contrast, local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousand, but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups, job cuts will probably be less severe. Japan's jobless rate was 4 percent in September, up from 3.8 percent in January, while Hong Kong's was flat at 3.4 percent. But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6.3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January. Experts say that while there are noticeable differences in labor practices in East and West, the gap will narrow as more firms become more multinational and competition forces firms to adopt the best practices of rivals from abroad.

Jim Henson originated the character in 1955 on his local television series, Sam and Friends. Brian Henson described his father's performance as Kermit as \\"coming out of his own personality--was a wry intelligence, a little bit of a naughtiness, but Kermit always loved everyone around and also loved a good prank.\\" He continued to perform the character until his death in 1990. Henson's last known performance as Kermit was for an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show to promote The Muppets at Walt Disney World. Henson died twelve days after that appearance.  Following Henson's death, veteran Muppet performer Steve Whitmire was named Kermit's new performer. In 2017, Whitmire seemed to imply in a blog post that Jim Henson had asked him to assume the role before he died, though Jim's daughter Cheryl Henson claimed Brian had selected him after Jim's death. Whitmire's first public performance as Kermit was at the end of the television special The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson in 1990. He remained Kermit's principal performer until 2016. Disney announced that Matt Vogel would be taking over as the performer and voice for Kermit on July 10, 2017. Whitmire later revealed that he had not chosen to voluntarily leave the role, but rather, had been recast by Muppet Studios in October 2016. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter later in July 2017, Whitmire elaborated he was fired for two reasons: long-term creative disagreements over Kermit's characterization and prolonged labor union negotiations that delayed his involvement in Muppet-related productions.  For a brief demonstration at MuppetFest (a 2001 Muppet fan convention), Muppet performer John Kennedy performed Kermit opposite Whitmire's performance of young Kermit (from Kermit's Swamp Years). Kennedy also performed Kermit for Muppets Ahoy!, a 2006 Disney Cruise Line stage show (though Whitmire performed Kermit for the first few shows). Muppet performer Artie Esposito briefly performed Kermit in 2009 for a few personal appearances (an appearance on America's Got Talent, an appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards, and at the 2009 D23 Expo with Rowlf the Dog as part of a tribute to Jim Henson).  Voice actor Frank Welker provided the voice of Baby Kermit on the animated Saturday morning cartoon, Muppet Babies. He also provided the voice of an adult Kermit for a short-lived spin-off, Little Muppet Monsters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How many years had he been the performer?","output":"Steve Whitmire had been the performer of Kermit the Frog from 1990 until his dismissal from the role in 2016, which is a total of 26 years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires.  I am facing a new situation today: Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A. But the other house didn't have short circuit. He labeled that as case B.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, case A or case B? Answer:","output":"In the situation you described with Greg, an electrical engineer, inspecting two houses, we can analyze each case based on the information provided and determine in which case the incoming and outgoing current wires touch each other. Case A: The house with a short circuit. In this scenario, as mentioned, there is a short circuit present. A short circuit occurs when the wire carrying current into the circuit comes into direct contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire. This connection bypasses the designed resistors and/or appliances present in the circuit, eliminating any resistance and allowing a larger current to flow through the wiring. Such a situation can be dangerous, causing electrical fires or damaging electronics connected to the affected circuit. In this case, the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other because it is the root cause of a short circuit. Case B: The house without a short circuit. In this scenario, the electrical wiring is as expected, and the house is not experiencing any short circuits. Therefore, the proper resistances exist throughout the circuits, ensuring that the incoming and outgoing current wires never touch directly. Appliances connected to the circuit receive the appropriate amount of current to operate safely, and the wiring remains safe from overheating or other potential dangers. In this case, the incoming and outgoing current wires would not touch each other as the circuit is working accurately and safely. In conclusion, the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other in Case A, the house with a short circuit, while they would not touch each other in Case B, the house with proper electrical wiring and no short circuits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: Who was the majority group in Sao Paulo province? is inside the article: White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians., can you guess it ?

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries  are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray  their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel  against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Top Eight Energy Risks For 2013 What’s hot and what’s not for the energy world in 2013? With so many confusing headlines hitting your inboxes on a daily basis and the dreaded Christmas shopping to come, here’s an early tonic to focus into 2013. A top eight ‘risks, ruses and rumblers’ for energy in 2013. Here goes: 1) Risk: MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles Hardly new I know, but no matter what any investment house tells you on benchmark prices, we’re stuck in a 50-150/b world, that’s defined by whichever part of the supply-demand balance proves to be most dysfunctional at any one time. The key supply side risk remains the Middle East. The political debris from 2011-12 will continue into 2013 and beyond, with popular pressures continually growing. That’s not just in the Arab Nationalist Republics such as Egypt, where vocal demonstrators on Tahrir Square have made clear President Morsi needs to deliver the goods or else. Or indeed Syria, whose internal implosion will have increasingly regional effects: But in Gulf Monarchy’s as well. The trigger point to watch is all about political secession. The exact timings are by definition uncertain, but Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and most importantly Saudi Arabia, are in the same boat. If the old secession model passing power from one aging leader to another is seen to be broken, then prices will rapidly lift when the Arab Street erupts. The fact that Saudi Arabia has a very ‘awkward neighbourhood’, with deep seated problems in Bahrain, Yemen and Iraq hardly helps its own Eastern Province either. Forget ‘Arab Spring’; think ‘Salafist Séance’. 2) Risk: Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices Holding things together in the Middle East will in large part depend on maintaining high oil prices in the first place. Given likely Eurozone failures, a realisation that the U.S. debt position is unsustainable, and daunting domestic challenges in India, Brazil and China to head off hard landings, then demand side fundamentals all point towards two digit oil prices. Having made over 1.115trillion in 2012, you could be excused for thinking OPEC would have ample wiggle room to buy themselves more political time; not so. 100/b is no longer deemed expensive across OPEC ranks, but a necessary price for regime survival. Besides notoriously overstretched patronage states like Algeria, Nigeria, Venezuela or Iran, even Gulf States are starting to feel the pinch. There are no true price moderates left in the oil cartel, merely gradations of hawks. The geopolitical cost of survival is what matters, and it’s seriously out of sync with the geological cost of production. Bottom line: It’s 100/b or bust for petro-states. While it’s true that most recessions since the 1970s have been preceded by oil price spikes, OPEC has never been very good at heading the lessons of demand destruction, and with emerging markets dominating the headlines, it is unlikely to do better now. Most producer states will be caught seriously short if this happens. Russia will be first out of the money, Central Asian budgets will be squeezed and MENA producers will have to make uncomfortable trade-offs. Latin America is in no better shape, no matter whether you look at Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador or indeed Brazil. In a back to (conventional) basics scenario, the bulk of producer states will go for volume over price, in the hope that the Saudis will do the heavy lifting to set a viable floor. Riyadh might play ball for a while, but it’s unlikely to stop producer states reverting to what they know best as a short term coping mechanism: ‘blunt repression’. Whether that works or not remains to be seen, but if nothing else, we could see a ‘2013 paradox’ of heightened instability across producer states underpinning prices as panic sets in. Pleasant OPEC meetings in Vienna will be irrelevant to the political unrest sweeping producer states. ‘Cyclical’ will take on a whole new meaning as far price and political instability is concerned – the lower the price, the more likely we will see supply disruptions as more vulnerable producers opt for a Libyan or Syrian course. Watch out for Iraq on that score; Kurdish plays look good right now, but Baghdad is unlikely to give up the Northern ghost without a fight – Sunni factions could easily get caught in the crossfire. 3) Ruse: Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head Amid all this, Iran will be the nuclear dog that doesn’t bark. Sanctions will remain in place, with the U.S. turning the screw a little harder around June presidential elections in Tehran. The Iranian’s will increase their bluster around the Strait of Hormuz in response, not to mention continuing to vie for regional influence across the Gulf, and especially in Syria, Bahrain and Iraq. But for all the huffing and puffing in Washington and Tehran, the nuclear question will remain a stalemate. As long as Iran can find Eastern outlets for its crude, the only way the nuclear clock is stopped is by impatience, miscalculation or misreading of intent that prompts somebody (aka Tel Aviv), to hazard a high risk first move. That’s an unlikely prospect given the political factors in play, Iran will be deferred to 2014 or 2015. Traders who don’t ‘get that’; expect to get burnt. 4) Rumbler: Russia Goes To Internal Energy War Classically Russian, but in the midst of extreme market uncertainty, the main wars they’ll be fighting are internal between Rosneft and Gazprom. It’s quite clear after the TNK-BP deal that Rosneft has become the new national champion of choice, producing up to 4.6mb/d (taking overall state control of hydrocarbon output to over 50%). How well Rosneft performs remains to be seen, as does the amount of international capital Russia can attract into Arctic plays, but it’s Gazprom that’s the canary in the Moscow mineshaft here. After pursuing endless political goals such as Nord Stream (and nascent South Stream pipelines), Gazprom failed to respond to the most fundamental ‘fundamental’ of all; the unconventional gas world developing around them. To remain a ‘market maker’ rather than price taker, Gazprom had to get out of petty pipeline politics and into serious quantities of LNG. That never happened, and with most Russian fields now looking horribly expensive to develop, Gazprom will need to fork out over 45bn per anum over the next five years. That doesn’t bode particularly well for the Kremlin to fall back on gas revenues, especially if shale plays and LNG continue to cut international market share. Gazprom only contributes 7% of total state revenues, a figure that will be squeezed into 2013. But the competition isn’t just coming from overseas, but directly from Rosneft. Igor Sechin’s outfit has already secured a 25 year gas supply agreement with Inter RAO (the state electricity provider), next stop will be going after Gazprom’s gas export monopoly. That spells trouble for Gazprom, and indeed private players such as Novatak. Gazprom gets left holding the European baby, playing regional pipeline politics, while Rosneft performs a global energy role. As the battle unfolds, expect Russian production to suffer in the interim and for Moscow to fall back on its free-rider role wherever possible. Hostilities will be brutal, but Rosneft is likely to be the long term winner. Civil war is an ugly thing, and especially so in Russia. 5) Rumbling Risk: American Schizophrenia Sets In Then we have America. It’s been the trail blazer for shale gas gains over the past decade, and’s increasingly replicating the ‘revolution’ for liquids. As everyone knows, U.S. shale gas gains have turned gas into a perennial buyers’ market, so much so that henry hub prices have become a victim of their own success. The key question in 2013 is not whether America will maintain its number one (650bcm) gas slot, but how much it intends to export as LNG? Those expecting the floodgates to open next year could be disappointed; any volumes signed off in Washington will keep a very keen eye on domestic prices. Of the 125bcm/y of LNG trains awaiting FERC approval, 40-50bcm would be remarkably good going. But even if America gets cold LNG feet, price convergence will slowly continue to play out across the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. The mere prospect of U.S. liquidity hitting the market has been seized upon by Asian buyers, with the upshot that Washington’s virtual impact on the gas world will be far larger than its physical presence in 2013. That’s not particularly great news for global energy companies trying to develop expensive LNG projects in West Africa, East Africa and Australia, but as the old adage from abundant energy goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’. Qatar and Russia serve as the perfect case in point, rueing the slow, but painful death of oil indexed prices for gas. In terms of liquids, America will probably push towards 11.5mb/d production next year. That means very different things to different people. It’s ‘energy independence nirvana’ for some, especially those willing to lump the Americas all under a single Washington production figure. When President Obama signs off the Keystone XI pipeline in 2013 the narrative will gain far greater traction, even though it’s actually the first step towards fixing WTI prices back towards international benchmarks. That’s chilling news for OPEC of course, not because America can play any kind of swing producer role, but because of the collateral damage it will do to oil prices. Where things get considerably worse for the cartel, is not only that the Americas will use Washington as a production hedge to send tankers East, (Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico all know that relying on a single source of supply and single source of demand is a no brainer), but that Beijing will continue to go ‘long’ in the Americas to make sure they remain firmly tied into global energy markets. Just as China is strategically investing in any cost overruns on LNG plays right now, it’s going to do exactly the same for liquids. Why? Because China wins most from a cheap and abundant energy world. 2013 will mark a transitional step towards that outcome; the vexed Nexen deal will be the watershed moment underpinning Chimerica’s physical and virtual stake in the game. But a word of caution for Beijing, political risk is just as lethal, if not more so in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Just ask BP. 6) Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind The perceived U.S. upside from its energy gains is that it no longer has to do all the heavy lifting for global energy supplies. True enough; but the blunt fact to consider is that two-thirds of global oil supplies are still sitting on politically shaky ground, and doing so in an increasingly large external power vacuum in the Middle East. The vacuum will get significantly bigger as US power (and interest) ebbs and Chinese oil flows, albeit without overarching political or security guarantees in place. It also had the distinct potential for conflict should Washington and Beijing end up misreading each other’s actions. Both of whom remain OPEC price takers at this stage. Summary:","output":"The top energy risks for 2013 include the following: 1) The Middle East and North Africa unrest and secession struggles, which revolve around political secession and may lead to a rise in oil prices. 2) Producer states might overreact to falling oil prices, with many countries such as Russia, Central Asian nations, and Latin America facing increased pressure on budgets. 3) The Iranian nuclear situation could come to a head, though it is expected to remain a stalemate with sanctions in place. 4) Russia's internal energy war between Rosneft and Gazprom, with Rosneft becoming the new national champion of choice. 5) The United States shale gas gains and potential LNG exports, though limited amounts are expected to be signed off next year. 6) The perceived shift in U.S. and Chinese roles in global energy supplies, with 2/3 of global oil supplies sitting on politically shaky ground. These risks underpin the uncertainties in the energy world going into 2013."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The prosecution of Edwards was never so much about Edwards as it was about George Holding. Wait -- who is George Holding? And why should we care?

Yet, Holding's decision to focus on such a high-profile target has allowed him to ride the wave of publicity all the way to a likely seat in Congress. This situation raises questions about the motivations behind certain legal actions by ambitious politicians seeking to make a name for themselves. Moreover, the Edwards trial serves as a cautionary example of the potential dangers of allowing political ambitions to influence legal processes. When prosecutors focus on cases that will generate attention, rather than on those that are truly deserving of their time and resources, it can lead to the unjust treatment of individuals involved. Additionally, it diverts attention from other more serious matters that require the time and expertise of skilled prosecutors with the best interests of the public in mind. In the end, the question of whether or not John Edwards deserves to go to prison remains a matter of personal opinion and debate. What is clear, however, is that the prosecution of Edwards served the interests of George Holding far more than it did the interests of justice. As Holding moves on to his new role in Congress, one can only hope that he will strive to bring about change in a way that truly serves the needs of his constituents, rather than focusing on furthering his own career through the manipulation of public opinion and political maneuvering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a 2). yelp review (Select from: 1). negative; 2). positive;).","output":"2) Positive Yelp Review Title: Extraordinary Culinary Journey at Cocina De Luna Last Saturday night, I had the glorious opportunity to dine at Cocina De Luna, and I must say it was an extraordinary culinary journey that is etched in my memory forever. From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was warmly welcomed by the staff, and the ambience immediately enveloped me in an aura of sheer sophistication and elegance. Right from the start, our server, Ricky, was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. He recommended the chef's special five-course tasting menu, and after hearing the mouthwatering descriptions of each dish, we couldn't resist. Ricky also suggested a perfect wine pairing for our meal, showing an impressive understanding of not only the cuisine but also the accompanying beverages. The first course, Seared Scallops with Cauliflower Puree, set the tone for the evening. The scallops were cooked to perfection, and the puree was velvety and rich. The dish was artfully plated, featuring an impressive balance of colors, textures, and flavors. Next came the second course, an exquisite Heirloom Tomato Salad with fresh burrata and a basil-lemon vinaigrette. The tomatoes were plump, juicy, and full of flavor, complemented by the creaminess of the burrata and the zesty vinaigrette. Needless to say, I savored every bite. The third course showcased a perfectly cooked Chilean Sea Bass with asparagus and sun-dried tomatoes. The sea bass was succulent and melted in my mouth, while the asparagus was crunchy and fresh, accompanied by the robustly flavored sun-dried tomatoes. It was visually stunning and absolutely delicious. Our fourth course, which happened to be my favorite, was the Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb with rosemary-garlic potatoes and mint chimichurri. The lamb was exceptionally tender, and the herbs and mint chimichurri added layers of complexity that tantalized my taste buds. The potatoes were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, making it a match made in heaven. Finally, we concluded our meal with a delightful Chocolate Lava Cake with raspberry coulis and fresh berries. The lava cake was oozing with warm, gooey chocolate that tantalized my senses, while the tartness of the raspberry coulis and berries perfectly cut through the richness of the chocolate. Throughout the evening, Ricky checked up on us frequently, ensuring that our glasses were always full and our questions about each dish were answered in detail. His attentiveness and charm added a personal touch to the already exceptional dining experience. Cocina De Luna has redefined fine dining for me. The exquisite flavors, impeccable presentation, and top-notch service were all part of an unforgettable experience that has me anticipating my next visit. If you are craving a memorable culinary adventure, I can't recommend Cocina De Luna enough."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Sacha Baron Cohen is a British comedian, actor, writer, and producer who is known for his unique style which includes creating fictional characters and personas. Born on October 13, 1971, in London, United Kingdom, Sacha Baron Cohen gained fame with his television series \\"Da Ali G Show\\" in which he portrayed various characters, including the titular Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, and Brüno Gehard. He later brought some of these characters to the big screen in movies such as \\"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\\" (2006), \\"Brüno\\" (2009), and \\"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\\" (2020). Cohen lent his distinctive voice to the character of King Julien XIII, a hilarious and self-absorbed ring-tailed lemur, in the Madagascar animated film series. The franchise includes several installments, such as \\"Madagascar\\" (2005), \\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\\" (2008), and \\"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\\" (2012). In addition to the movies, King Julien's character also appeared in various spin-offs, like \\"The Penguins of Madagascar\\" series, and had a standalone series titled \\"All Hail King Julien.\\" However, it's worth noting that Sacha Baron Cohen did not provide the voice for King Julien in the spin-offs or \\"All Hail King Julien\\" series. In those productions, actor Danny Jacobs took over the role and continued to provide the voice for the character. Jacobs did such an excellent job of capturing Cohen's portrayal that many audience members might not have noticed the switch. In summary, Sacha Baron Cohen is the acclaimed actor who provided the voice for King Julien in the Madagascar film series, bringing his comedic talents and unique vocal stylings to the beloved character."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people.

Please answer this question: Which island, a former Dutch colony with its capital at Orangestad, continues to move slowly towards complete independence?","output":"The island you're referring to is Aruba, which is a small island located in the southern Caribbean Sea, just north of the coast of Venezuela. It covers an area of about 179 square kilometers (69 square miles) and has a population of around 106,000 people. The capital of Aruba is Oranjestad, a vibrant city that serves as the island's hub for commerce, tourism, and culture. Aruba has a rich history that includes colonization by the Dutch in the early 17th century. The Dutch established their presence on the island in 1636 when they claimed possession of it from the indigenous Caquetio Indians. They ruled Aruba for over two centuries under the jurisdiction of the Dutch West India Company until it became a colony of the Netherlands in 1815. During the 20th century, Aruba began to seek greater autonomy from the Netherlands. In 1954, it achieved a certain degree of self-government as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which also included the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands. In 1986, Aruba decided to separate from the Netherlands Antilles, becoming a separate and autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. There were initial plans for Aruba to gain complete independence by 1996, but the process was halted in 1990 due to concerns about the island's economic stability and sustainability. Since then, Aruba has maintained its status as a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands but continues to steadily move towards greater autonomy and potentially full independence. In recent years, there has been an increased push for self-determination, with various political parties and movements advocating for more control over the island's natural resources, environment, and economic policies. The issue of independence remains a topic of debate among the Aruban population, balancing the potential benefits of complete self-governance against the costs and uncertainties of disconnecting from the Dutch support system. While Aruba has not yet achieved complete independence, it continues to cultivate its unique identity, culture, and political system, which could shape the island's future relationship with the Netherlands. In conclusion, the island of Aruba is a former Dutch colony with its capital at Oranjestad that continues to move slowly towards independence. As a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba has been gradually asserting more of its autonomy and self-governance over the past decades. With an evolving political landscape and an ongoing debate on the benefits and challenges of full independence, Aruba's future remains a subject of discussion and interest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Two signatures. That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November.

Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Hometown of Mayor Dan Reed looks forward to each year with enthusiasm to all the events, friends and family that fill this special season. Together with his brother Greg, they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright, a mean-spirited and embittered militant atheist returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: It's hard to say which comes out on top, James Cagney's charm and energy or the mouth- opening excesses of Busby Berkeley's three grand showstoppers at the close. I give it a tie, with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early Thirties musicals. Although the movie clearly belongs to Cagney, Joan Blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line.  And what's the story line? It's about Chester Kent (Cagney) who produces musicals, and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over. He starts doing Prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts. He gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them, moving them around the country. He's a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things. But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), his wise-cracking secretary, loves him but he's too busy too notice; an office girl in black-rimmed, round glasses (Ruby Keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all; a blonde gold-digger is setting her hooks in him; his partners are cheating him...my gosh, what's next? This may all sound like a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, with Cagney bouncing, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it's done.  Instead of \\"Let's put on a show, gang\\" we have \\"We need to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing.\\" These three super Prologues are going to feature 40 chorines, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty Kent units in deluxe movie houses...the whole Apollo movie house circuit! Exhaustion threatens, feet ache, but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour; you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic) stay the course, dancing their hearts out, giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty.  And then the curtains go up as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses, one after the other on the same night, with the owner of the Apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save Chester's skin or not.  First up is \\"Honeymoon Hotel\\" with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some might even be married), bedrooms and beds, and doors with \\"Do not disturb\\" signs.  Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of \\"By a Waterfall\\" that probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy. This number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with waterslides, a giant pool -- you'd never think there was a Depression on. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks -- synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things -- and he does it in the water, with a lot of underwater photography looking up. The girls are sure game. They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler, who has a couple of quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks a bit cautious.  And finally, the smash finale...11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to \\"Shanghai Lil,\\" with all sorts of bar girls and their customers, unusual in that the races are mixed up. There's Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar, dancing on a table, Cagney fighting. There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines, hupping back and forth, rifles tossed and caught. Then...this is true...a human picture forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has ever featured Roosevelt, a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy Chinese prostitutes.  That's entertainment, folks. It's great!  Of course, Chester's Prologues get the big contract and Nan gets Chester. The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along. Joan Blondell makes us forget about a lot of Hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality. The movie, however, belongs to Cagney, who grabs and shakes it, and to Berkeley, a man for whom too much was never too much.","output":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down into key aspects and evaluate the tone and emotions conveyed. 1. Praise for James Cagney, Joan Blondell, and Busby Berkeley's work: The review speaks highly of their performances and contributions, showing admiration. 2.

Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What is the problem in Sandy and Susan's marriage? Title: Carnal Knowledge Movie plot: The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure as he sees it is to deny pleasure to men. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged. In the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes. Sandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unknown to Sandy, she meets Jonathan, feeling a physical attraction for him. They have sex. Jonathan convinces Susan not to have sex with Sandy. Susan therefore has a purely intellectual relationship with Sandy, while at the same having a purely physical relationship with Jonathan. Part II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his \\"perfect woman.\\" Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of Jonathan's requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Sandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied with the physical part of their relationship. He relates how they are \\"patient with...

Answer:","output":"Remy moved to the city after being tired of all the work on the farm due to various reasons, which can be broadly categorized into personal, social, and economic factors. These factors collectively played a significant role in shaping Remy's decision, making them leave their rural life behind to embrace the urban lifestyle. 1. Personal Factors: a. Exhaustion: One of the primary reasons Remy was tired of farm work could be the physical strain involved in it. The effort required to tend to crops, look after the livestock, and maintain the property can be taxing on an individual's physical and mental health. Bidding farewell to the farm life was an attempt by Remy to seek respite from the constant hard work and seek a more comfortable and relaxed lifestyle in the city. b. Adventure: Possibly, Remy wanted to experience more in life, explore new ventures, and step out of their comfort zone. Moving to the city might have been a way to venture into the unknown, meet new people, learn new skills, and enjoy new experiences that farm life couldn't offer. 2. Social Factors: a. Limited social circle: The rural lifestyle often comes with limited opportunities to meet and interact with new people. Remy might have desired to expand their social circle, network with diverse individuals, and create new relationships, both personal and professional. The city offers a more vibrant social scene, and its diverse population is appealing to those seeking a more dynamic network. b. Education and exposure: Remy might have been keen to gain more knowledge and exposure by pursuing higher education or attending workshops, seminars, and other events. The city often offers better opportunities for personal and professional development than a rural setting. The availability of resources such as experienced professionals, technological advancements, and varied cultural experiences could have been significant factors that attracted Remy to the city. 3. Economic Factors: a. Job opportunities: Farm work, while providing a livelihood, might not be financially rewarding or provide job security. Remy might have been motivated to move to the city in search of stable and well-paying employment with potential advancement opportunities. Urban settings typically offer a broader range of job prospects that cater to different skill sets and expertise. b. Infrastructure and facilities: The city provides better infrastructure and facilities such as healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. Remy might have decided to move to the city to benefit from a more organized and faster-paced life that provides easier access to necessary amenities. c. Diversified income sources: Relying solely on agriculture-related income can be a risky proposition, mainly due to unpredictability caused by weather conditions and market factors. Remy may have moved to the city to secure and diversify their income sources, ensuring a more stable financial future. In conclusion, Remy's decision to move to the city after being tired of farm work was shaped by personal factors such as exhaustion and the drive for adventure, social factors such as the need for an expanded social network and personal development, and economic factors like job opportunities, better infrastructure, and diversified income sources. The city promised an opportunity for Remy to enjoy new experiences, connect with a broader range of people, and secure a more stable financial future while benefiting from the resources and facilities that urban life offers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The appointment of crisis management agency Milltown Partners to help keep Richard Scudamore in a job demonstrates how seriously the Premier League are taking the chief executive’s sexist emails scandal. Milltown Partners, who specialise in discreet reputational work for high-end clients, was founded by Paddy Harverson, former Royal spin doctor, and ex-Google executive DJ Collins. And BBC sports editor David Bond is set to join. The choice of Milltown also highlights the cosy governance set-up at the Premier League, which has to be reformed even if Scudamore stays in office. All-powerful Scudamore’s effective line managers are the PL’s audit and remuneration committee, who decide his bonus and salary. Serious: The Premier League have hired a crisis management agency to try and help Richard Scuadamore. Doubt: There are growing concerns whether Scuadamore's friend Bruce Buck should be A and R chairman. And that group is chaired by Scudamore’s close friend and shooting partner Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea. And Chelsea happen to be another client of Milltown. As a result, there are growing concerns as to whether Buck should remain chairman of the A and R group. The PL strongly defend their ridiculous two-strong board of Scudamore and interim  chairman Peter McCormick, whose Harrogate firm receive a considerable proportion of their business from the PL. The PL claim the 20 clubs, who meet at least six times a year, are the directors of the company. But their one-eyed focus is purely on their own fortunes. Sofa time: Steven Gerrard will pause his World Cup preparations to work with ITV for the Champions League final. England captain Steven Gerrard will be a guest pundit with ITV for the Champions League final. Gerrard will now be spending a fortnight in Portugal. He is on holiday this week, followed by training with England at Vale do Lobo before the final in Lisbon. PREMIER LEAGUE sponsors Barclays, who have reportedly voiced upset over Scudamore’s sexist emails, are to change PR agencies. It is widely expected that Barclays will not renew their current three-year deal with the top flight, but they will hire Havas and instruct them to do a root-and-branch look into how much value the £40m-a-year PL backing brings to a bank involved in a major cost-cutting exercise. THE highly prestigious Footballer of the Year function was relegated to a cramped basement room at London’s Royal Lancaster Hotel because of a switch of dates. The main reception suite, instead of being adorned with evocative pictures of every winner of the Football Writers Association award, was booked by the British Sandwich Industry. And rather than Luis Suarez being honoured in the big room, it was a BBQ chicken and bacon slaw wrap and a prosciutto and asparagus melt. Ian’s priorities wrong. It will not please followers of rugby league giants Wigan Warriors that their chairman Ian Lenagan has chosen to go to the FA Cup final rather than his club’s Super League Magic Weekend clash with Leeds at the Etihad Stadium. Lenagan is also chairman of League Two  football team Oxford United and an FA councillor. He was one of four councillors who spoke out in favour of Hull City owner Assem Allam being allowed to change the name of the club to Hull Tigers which the FA voted to reject. Meanwhile, it’s understood the astonishing decision for the Hull KR v Hull Super League fixture to be staged in Manchester at the same time as Hull City take on Arsenal in the FA Cup final at Wembley wasn’t opposed by Hull rugby league club owner Adam Pearson. He used to be head of operations at the football club, but had an acrimonious exit following Allam’s takeover. Shock: Rugby League owner Adam Pearson didn't oppose the Hull sports clashes this Saturday. Matthew Syed might have been discarded by Joey Barton as ghost writer for his upcoming autobiography but the Times sports columnist has emerged as front runner to be the next BBC Sports Editor. However, there appears to be a split of opinion on the selection panel as to whether the Beeb want a talking head like Syed or a big story getter to replace the departing David Bond. The England Cricket Board are to lose their highly successful commercial chief John Perera, who has remarkably brought in more than £750m worth of sponsorship and TV rights during nearly a decade dominated by a financial recession. Perera will be leaving in 2016, giving the ECB two years notice to find a successor.","output":"This article is about a man named Richard Scudamore who is in trouble because of some emails he sent.

What is the literal meaning of the Jewish word 'Kosher'????","output":"To find the literal meaning of the Jewish word 'Kosher,' I will follow these steps: 1. Verify the language: First, I will recognize that 'Kosher' is a term from the Hebrew language, which is commonly used in the context of Jewish culture and religion. 2. Research its origins: I will look into the origins of the term 'Kosher' within the Hebrew language to identify its literal translation. 3. Identify its religious significance: In addition to the language context, I will consider any religious associations or interpretations related to the term 'Kosher' within Jewish culture and tradition. After completing these steps, I found that the literal meaning of the word 'Kosher' in Hebrew is 'fit' or 'proper'. In the context of Jewish dietary laws, Kosher refers to food that is prepared and consumed according to the requirements of Jewish law, which are outlined in the Torah. These guidelines, known as Kashrut, dictate the types of foods that can be eaten, as well as how they should be prepared and served.

Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A Muhammad cartoon a day When Salman Rushdie mocked Islamic sanctities in his magical 1989 realist novel “The Satanic Verses,” Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini did something shockingly original: He issued a death edict on Rushdie and all those connected to the production of his book. By doing this, Khomeini sought to impose Islamic mores and laws on the West. We don’t insult the prophet, he effectively said, and neither can you. That started a trend of condemning those in the West deemed anti-Islamic that persists to this day. Again and again, when Westerners are perceived as denigrating Muhammad, the Koran, or Islam, Islamists demonstrate, riot or kill. Khomeini’s edict also had the unexpected side effect of empowering individuals – Western and Islamist alike – to drive their countries’ policies. Fleming Rose, a newspaper editor, created the greatest crisis for Denmark since World War II by publishing 12 cartoons depicting Muhammad. Florida pastor Terry Jones sowed panic among American commanders in Afghanistan by threatening to burn a Koran. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula and friends prompted a crisis in U.S.-Egyptian relations with his amateurish \\"Innocence of Muslims\\" video. And the satirical French weekly Charlie Hebdo caused the French government to temporarily shut down diplomatic missions in 20 countries. Plans by the German satirical magazine Titanic to publish attacks on Muhammad likewise led German missions to be closed. On the Islamist side, an individual or group took one of these perceived offenses and turned it into a reason to riot. Khomeini did this with “The Satanic Verses.” Ahmad Abu Laban did likewise with the Danish cartoons. Afghan President Hamid Karzai goaded his people to riot over burned Korans by American soldiers, and Egyptian preacher Khaled Abdullah turned “Innocence of Muslims” into an international event. Any Westerner can now buy a Koran for a dollar and burn it, while any Muslim with a platform can transform that act into a fighting offense. As passions rise on both sides of the divide, Western provocateurs and Islamist hotheads have found each other, as confrontations occur with increasing frequency. Which prompts this question: What would happen if publishers and managers of major media outlets reached a consensus -- “Enough of this intimidation, we will publish the most famous Danish Muhammad cartoon every day, until the Islamists tire out and no longer riot”? What would happen if Korans were recurrently burned? Would repetition inspire institutionalization, generate ever-more outraged responses, and offer a vehicle for Islamists to ride to greater power? Or would it lead to routinization, to a wearing out of Islamists, and a realization that violence is counter-productive to their cause? I predict the latter. A Muhammad cartoon published each day, or Koranic desecrations on a quasi-regular basis, would make it harder for Islamists to mobilize Muslim mobs. Westerners could then once again treat Islam as they do other religions – freely, to criticize without fear. That would demonstrate to Islamists that Westerners will not capitulate, that they reject Islamic law, that they are ready to stand up for their values. So, this is my plea to all Western editors and producers: Display the Muhammad cartoon daily, until the Islamists become accustomed to the fact that we turn sacred cows into hamburger. Daniel Pipes is president of the Middle East Forum. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how publishing cartoons of Muhammad and other actions that might be considered offensive to Islam have caused tensions and protests in the past. The author, Daniel Pipes, suggests that if these types of actions were done more frequently, it might actually help to reduce the intensity of the reactions and make people realize that violence is not a solution. Pipes encourages Western editors and producers to publish cartoons of Muhammad daily so that people can become more accustomed to them and learn to accept them as a normal part of freedom of expression."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H+ and one mole of the conjugate base, A−, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.  I am facing a new situation today: David is a chemical engineer. Yesterday, he was working on two samples, sample A and sample B. Sample A was a strong acid, and sample B was a weak acid. David needed to find the differences between them.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which would partially ionize in water, sample A or sample B? A:","output":"Sample B would partially ionize in water, as it is a weak acid.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

With nearly 400 people being identified, along with their email addresses, Facebook pages, and additional information, it has garnered much attention. Although this list from Anonymous doesn't include the previously promised 1,000 names or those of politicians, it does reveal a few retired law enforcement officers. The following article aims to delve deeper into this shadowy world and explore the context, implications, and potential fallout of this event. Anonymous and Operation KKK: Operation KKK is an initiative by Anonymous to combat and expose the KKK in response to a local Klan chapter threatening violence during protests in Ferguson. The list released on Thursday is the result of 11 months of intensive research and \\"digital espionage\\" using various tactics to unearth the alleged members of the hate group. According to Engadget, Anonymous managed to trick some people into admitting their KKK affiliation while chatting online. In the words of Operation KKK, \\"You never know who you are talking to on the internet.\\" This highlights the strategy and tactics used by Anonymous in revealing these individuals. The List: The list, although shorter than expected, is primarily composed of various alleged KKK members' personal information, minus any politicians mentioned in an earlier, widely discredited list. However, some retired law enforcement officers find themselves among those featured on Anonymous's exposé. These aspects of the list prompt further questions and investigations. One significant aspect of the list is the inclusion of popular online hangouts for KKK members, where they likely coordinate efforts and discuss their objectives. This serves as an additional insight into the world of the KKK, offering opportunities for further research and counteraction. Consequences and Reactions: Anonymous stands firm in its belief that releasing this list is a critical form of resistance against the hate group. The statement from Operation KKK reads, \\"We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history.\\" While some names initially mentioned in the non-Anonymous list were found to be misleading, Operation KKK tweeted that several other names had been removed \\"for further investigation,\\" according to Raw Story. As a result, there might be potential updates to the list in the future. Initial reactions to the list have been mixed – some appreciate the efforts of Anonymous in unmasking the KKK members, while others criticize the public exposure of individuals, especially given the still unconfirmed status of some of the identities. The potential backlash against the named individuals, if found incorrect, could also have legal and social implications for Anonymous. Conclusion: Overall, the release of the alleged KKK members' list by Anonymous highlights the ongoing power struggle between hate groups and online activists. As Anonymous continues their efforts in combating the KKK through digital means, the evolving nature of online activism becomes all the more significant, with potentially far-reaching consequences in this digital age. It remains to be seen if this action will bring about positive change or further entrench the divisions and animosity between groups."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment.  Which village was more thoughtful about the environment?  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"Davin village"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. POMPANO BEACH (CBSMiami) — A 19-year old is behind bars accused of stealing from the elderly including a World War II veteran.      The Broward Sheriff’s Office says Eric Vanyo not only stole from his victims — like 93 year old Dan Thomas — but he is accused of committing the crimes while his victims were sleeping.      Dan Thomas is still incredulous that Vanyo allegedly stole the 70-year old wedding ring right off his hand while he slept one night last month.      “While I was asleep in bed,” Thomas said, incredulously.      CLICK HERE to watch Carey Codd’s report      Detectives say Vanyo lived in Thomas’ neighborhood and broke in through Thomas’ laundry room door. Thomas said he knew something was wrong when he woke up and looked around his home.      “The two medicine cabinets in the bathroom were open,” Thomas said. “I never leave them open. That door to the washroom was open. I never leave that open.”      BSO says Vanyo burglarized Thomas a few weeks before the August incident and also burglarized another sleeping neighbor.      Thomas’ son, James, is glad his father, a decorated World War II veteran, was not hurt. He wants Vanyo to face a serious punishment.      “I’m just happy they caught the guy,” James Thomas said. “I’d rather have him buried than in jail but as long as he’s in jail permanently, I’ll be happy. As long as he quits bothering other people.”      Thomas got his ring back. He said it’s an ongoing reminder of his late wife. BSO says the pawn shop where Vanyo sold it made Thomas pay to recover it.      For now, Thomas feels safe in his longtime home with a security system in place but he says he doesn’t have the freedom he once did.      “Now I’m home in my house and I’m not free,” Thomas said. “I’m locked in. I’m just like being in jail. It’s a different life now than it was a month ago.”      Jail records show the suspect Vanyo is in the Broward County Jail without bond. The Broward Sheriff’s Office says they are actively investigating whether Vanyo has done this to anyone else.      RELATED CONTENT:       ||||| POMPANO BEACH — After serving four years in the Army during World War II, Dan Thomas had only 500 to his name. The then-23-year-old used that money to give his high school sweetheart a wedding they could cherish forever, including a ring for her and a ring for him.      Years later, Thomas would replace his wife's ring; however, the same gold band from their 1944 wedding remained on his finger, untouched, for 70 years. That is, until a robber crept into the 93-year-old's bedroom last month and stole the ring, which acts as a reminder of his wife, who died seven years ago.      \\"I got robbed,\\" Thomas said. \\"How do you put it? A band given to you by your wife – it means a lot to me. Somehow [the robber] got this ring off my finger while I was asleep. My hands are very arthritic. I still can't understand how [the robber] got it off there without waking me up. I guess I'll never know that.\\"      According to the Broward Sheriff's Office, Eric Vanyo, of Pompano Beach, pried open the door to Thomas' laundry room and stole a television, power tools and the ring. The 19-year-old convicted felon was arrested Thursday in connection with the Aug. 6 burglary, as well as two other similar crimes.      It was the second time Vanyo had burglarized Thomas' house in the 600 block of Northeast 23rd Court, detectives said. He is also accused of prying open the window of the master bedroom on July 22, cutting himself as the window shattered, while Thomas slept. Once inside, Vanyo took a gold ring with the letter \\"D,\\" a watch and two rolls of quarters from the victim's dining room, as well as other items with sentimental value.      That same night, Vanyo also broke into the nearby residence of Finas Geller through a laundry room window, detectives said. Geller, 93, was asleep when Vanyo walked into her bedroom. She woke up to see him at the foot of her bed, rummaging through dresser drawers.

Sent 2: On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. Sent 3: It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection.

No Based on the context given in the scenario, Jesse and Jordan share a love for Harry Potter, and thus they decided to watch every showing of the \\"Half Blood Prince\\" when it was released. Their interest seems to be centred around Harry Potter and the endeavors associated with it, some of which could include discussing theories about the story, reading Harry Potter books, purchasing Harry Potter merchandise, visiting Harry Potter themed parks or exhibits, or even watching other movies from the Harry Potter franchise. Given this, it would be reasonable to presume that Jesse and Jordan's next activity would, in some way, include their mutual passion for Harry Potter. The question \\"What will Jesse want to do next?\\" naturally brings to mind something related to this common interest. On the other hand, \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" doesn’t appear to be a valid response to the question since there is no context suggesting that Jesse or Jordan have an interest in the musical Hamilton or, more broadly, in musical theater. Hamilton is a famous Broadway musical based on the life of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, and while it is immensely popular, it has no direct tie-in with Harry Potter. In short, provided no additional context or information about Jesse's interest in musicals or Hamilton specifically, the response \\"Get tickets to Hamilton\\" is less plausible.

You can use a white headband, but you can also try to find one in a color that matches your dress or your school colors. A petite lace headband is the sort of headband worn by babies and toddlers. To take the headband in, clip apart and remove the ribbon holding it together. Turn the headband inside-out and fold one end of the lace down until the entire length matches the length the garter needs to be. Line up the fold with the other end and stitch them together using a triple stitch or narrow zigzag stitch. Turn the garter right-side-out again. Cut 10 inches (25 cm) of narrow tulle. Fold it together and attach your embellishment with glue.  You should have about eight layers of folded tulle. Even at this thickness, the tulle will be light enough to prevent it from being seen at a distance. Put a small amount of hot glue in the middle of the tulle before firmly fixing your embellishment on the dot. Let dry. You could use fake pearls or gems for an embellishment, but for something more themed to homecoming, use a charm of your school mascot or school emblem. You could also attach a football jewelry charm or a small bow made with ribbon in your school colors. Hand stitch the tulle onto the center seam of the lace headband to complete your garter. Trim your tulle down before attaching it. Cut it near the embellishment, leaving just enough to sew into.","output":"The article provides instructions for adjusting a lace headband to create a homecoming garter. To do this, first select the appropriate headband color and size, potentially needing to shorten a standard-size one. Turn the headband inside-out and fold the lace to the desired length, stitching the ends together. Cut and fold a 10-inch piece of tulle, gluing on an embellishment, such as school-themed charms or fake pearls. Once the glue dries, hand-stitch the tulle onto the lace headband's center seam, trimming excess tulle near the embellishment. This creates a custom, school-themed homecoming garter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: Who was the ruler of South African mandate when it took over the South West Africa German colony? Passage 1:German Namibians () are a community of people descended from ethnic German colonists who settled in present-day Namibia. In 1883, the German trader Adolf Lüderitz bought what would become the southern coast of Namibia from Josef Frederiks II, a chief of the local Oorlam people, and founded the city of Lüderitz. The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, proclaiming it German South West Africa (). Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials. In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost its colonial possessions, including South West Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former German colony was administered as a South African mandate. The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory alongside Afrikaans and English.  Passage 2:Earle L. Reynolds (October 18, 1910 – January 11, 1998) was an anthropologist, educator, author, Quaker, and peace activist. He was sent to Hiroshima by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to study the effects of the first atomic bomb on the growth and development of exposed children. His professional discoveries concerning the dangers of radiation later moved Reynolds into a life of anti-nuclear activism. In 1958 he sailed with his wife Barbara, two of his three children and a Japanese yachtsman in the Phoenix of Hiroshima, a ketch he had designed himself, into the American nuclear testing zone in the Pacific. In 1961 the family sailed to the USSR to protest Soviet nuclear testing. During the Vietnam War Reynolds and his second wife Akie sailed the Phoenix to Haiphong to deliver humanitarian and medical aid to victims of American bombing.  Passage 3:The Anita Kerr Singers or The Jordanaires sang background on just about every Nashville hit in the late 1950s and early 1960s. After she and Al Kerr divorced, she disbanded the Nashville version of her Anita Kerr Singers and relocated to Los Angeles in August 1965 with her second husband, Swiss businessman Alex Grob, and her daughters Suzie & Kelly. She no longer wanted to just be a background singer or arranger on country songs – she wanted to do pop music, jazz and \\"do more orchestral writing and music that was not just country.\\". She hired some lawyers to get her out of her contract with RCA’s Nashville division, got a contract with Warner Bros. Records, and formed a Los Angeles version of the Anita Kerr Singers. The new group, for the next five years, would include the following personnel: alto B.J. Baker or Jackie Ward, tenor Gene Merlino or Bill Cole, baritone Bill Lee, bass Bob Tebow, and Kerr herself as soprano and arranger. The half dozen albums recorded by the Singers for Warner included a cover version of the song \\"All You Need Is Love\\" by The Beatles, and one of the LPs was exclusively devoted to the songs of composer Bert Kaempfert. Disguising the group as the Mexicali Singers, Kerr also recorded a trio of mariachi-flavored albums with musical arrangements reminiscent of the Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass sound. The Anita Kerr Singers won another Grammy Award for their recording of A Man And A Woman, released as a single on Warner Bros. Records.","output":"To find the answer to the question \\"Who was the ruler of South African mandate when it took over the South West Africa German colony?\\", we can use information from Passage 1.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where was the long sea voyage?  The film tells a fictionalized version of the Pilgrims' voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to North America aboard the Mayflower. During the long sea voyage, Capt. Christopher Jones falls in love with Dorothy Bradford, the wife of William Bradford. The love triangle is resolved in a tragic way at the film's conclusion.  Ship's carpenter John Alden -- said to be the first person to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620—catches the eye of Priscilla Mullins, one of the young Pilgrims following William Bradford.  Alden ultimately wins Priscilla in another, if subtler, triangle with Miles Standish.   Lloyd Bridges provides comic relief as the first-mate Coppin, and child star Tommy Ivo gives a touching performance as young William Button, the only passenger to die on the actual voyage across the storm-swept Atlantic, who, according to this film, wanted to be the first to sight land and to become a king in the New World. \\"I'm going to be the first to see land.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who is the client Dr. Cy Kosis joins on the couch? from the following article ?  The Goofy Gophers are about to harvest the vegetables on the farm when the farmhands beat them to the punch. Worried that their food source is being \\"vandalized,\\" they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. However, they spot the guard dog and realize that if he were to awaken and spot them stealing the vegetables, he would cause them trouble. The Gophers spend most of the rest of the cartoon using psychological weardown tactics to drive Barnyard Dawg insane and remove him as a threat to their well-being. A deadpan pig watches as the dog is repeatedly the victim of the Gophers' pranks, and can only shake his head as the dog's psyche is broken down. Meanwhile, the pooch tries to convince himself that all that is going on is nothing but a bad dream (consulting Sigmund Fraud and using sleeping pills to laugh off each attempt). In the end, the Gophers get rid of their foe for good by tying a harness around the sleeping Barnyard Dawg's belly, then attaching it to a hot air balloon before launching it (getting a tear in at as it goes up), leaving them free to \\"raise their vegetables\\" into a long pipe leading from the barn to their burrow. Meanwhile, the balloon's hull leaks out completely, and the dog awakens atop a light pole. After he wakes up and realising his surroundings, Barnyard Dawg mentally snaps and begins to fly!

The acid kills and dissolves him Answer:","output":"Title: The Rise of Reiss Genre: Science Fiction/Thriller/Action Plot Summary: In a dystopian future, the city of New Haven is ruled by the iron fist of a mega-corporation called 'Genesis Corp.' Driven by greed, this conglomerate has polluted the environment through relentless industrialization, turning rivers and lakes into highly acidic pools. The citizens of New Haven, oppressed and desperate for change, are on the brink of rebellion. Reiss, a skilled mechanic and scientist in his late 20s, understands all too well the ever-present danger of life in New Haven. Orphaned at young age due to an \\"industrial accident\\" that claimed his parents, he vows to expose the truth behind Genesis Corp's atrocities and bring them down. With the help of a small group of rebels known as 'The Resistance,' Reiss uncovers a clandestine experiment being carried out by Genesis Corp: a dangerous new technology capable of transforming ordinary citizens into genetically enhanced, superhuman warriors called 'Super Soldiers.' Determined to stop Genesis Corp's sinister plan, Reiss infiltrates one of their research facilities to gather evidence. However, he is discovered and apprehended by Dr. Mirenzia, the mastermind behind the Super Soldier project. Intent on using Reiss as her next test subject, she subjects him to her latest experimental serum, hoping to create an even more powerful Super Soldier under her control. But something goes wrong during the procedure. Reiss' body rejects the serum, causing him to convulse and momentarily break free from his restraints. Amidst the chaos and confusion, Reiss lunges at Dr. Mirenzia, but she knocks him back into a large vat of the same acid responsible for his parents' demise. Witnessing his fall, the Resistance members fear the worst and are forced to retreat. Genesis Corp. remains in power, and hope seemingly dies with Reiss. However, Reiss' fate isn't quite sealed. During the time his body was marinating in the acidic pool, a new compound forms as a result of the harmonized reaction between the serum injected in him and the highly acidic environment, transforming him into something beyond human. He becomes an indestructible being, unaffected by the acid's harm and endowed with superhuman strength, agility, and a healing factor that resembles immortality. Emboldened by his newfound abilities and driven by rage, Reiss escapes the facility and joins the Resistance once again. However, this turn of events comes at a great cost: his once-human appearance is now replaced with a scarred, disfigured visage, a constant reminder of the sacrifices he has made. Together with the Resistance, he leads a full-scale revolt against Genesis Corp, determined to avenge his parents and protect the innocent citizens of New Haven. As the storyline unfolds, Reiss uncovers a shocking truth behind Genesis Corp., revealing connections to his own past that shakes him to the core. Conflicted and filled with doubt, he must now learn to accept and control his newfound abilities. Will his thirst for vengeance consume him, or will he evolve into the savior New Haven needs? With jaw-dropping action sequences, unexpected twists, and a story of one man's journey for redemption and justice, \\"The Rise of Reiss\\" is a thrilling rollercoaster ride that reminds us all that even in the darkest of times, hope endures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hong Kong Phooey is the secret alter ego of mild-mannered police station janitor Penrod Pooch and fights crime using his martial arts skills. The series does feature a cat character named Spot, but he is not the main character's sidekick or pet. Instead, Spot is a sarcastic and cunning cat that resides at the police station with Penrod. Spot often assists Hong Kong Phooey in solving cases and fighting criminals but prefers to let Hong Kong Phooey take all the credit. Throughout the show, the viewers can see that Hong Kong Phooey is quite clumsy and often gets into accidents and misadventures. In many instances, it is Spot's quick thinking and actions that save the day.  To sum it up, the name of the cat in Hong Kong Phooey is Spot, and he plays a significant role in the adventures of the titular character.

What is the title of this article: The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen were not. The nearest town, Fort McMurray, Alberta was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the bitumen to pave 600 feet of road in Edmonton, Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s Dr. Karl A. Clark of the Alberta Research Council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons built the Bitumount oil separation plant, which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 barrels (50 m3) per day of bitumen using Dr. Clark's method. Most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs, but other uses included fuels, lubrication oils, printers ink, medicines, rust and acid-proof paints, fireproof roofing, street paving, patent leather, and fence post preservatives. Eventually Fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the Alberta government.

It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo.  - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion.  - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring .  - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987.  - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle.  - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource.  - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers.  - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971.  - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981.  - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction.

Before bringing your new pet home you need to decide if you intend the bunny to be a house rabbit or live outdoors in a run in the yard. House rabbits are popular pets but there are a few factors to consider. While you will have to do more cleaning and training for a rabbit that lives indoors with you, you will not have as much social contact with a rabbit that lives outside.  If you decide to keep your rabbit inside, you will need to rabbit-proof your house. Rabbits chew anything and everything, including electrical cables and the legs of your antique furniture. Make sure you are able to 'rabbit proof' your home so that cables are all tidied away out of reach of the rabbit, and there is no item that you would be upset if it got damaged by gnawing. If you decide to keep your rabbit inside you will also need to litter box train it. It is not hygienic to have the rabbit ranging around the house, pooping and peeing wherever they please. The solution is to litter train the rabbit to use a litter box. However, most rabbits poop mostly in one particular spot, so you can use this to your advantage by placing a litter tray in whichever spot they usually poop. If you have a male rabbit who is spraying urine everywhere, you may need to get him desexed. If you decide to keep your rabbit outside you will need to commit to spending time socializing it every day. Make it a part of your schedule, otherwise the rabbit may become anxious and fearful in your company. The hutch (or rabbit house) should be at least 2 feet (0.61 m) wide and 4 feet long, and tall enough to let the rabbit stand up to its full height. The bottom of the cage should not be made of wire, but the sides can be.  Outdoor hutches are most commonly made of wood with a door fitted at the front made of chicken wire. This allows for good ventilation and for the rabbit to see out. The wood offers a degree of thermal protection to insulate the rabbit from the elements, and is sturdy, protecting the rabbit from predators. An outdoor hutch will need to have a run attached to it, so that your rabbit can exercise. The run should be a minimum of  4 feet (1.2 m) by 8 ft by 2ft tall, for a rabbit under 2kg.  Many indoor hutches are made of plastic with a wire roof. This has the advantage of being lightweight, so you can move it around the house easily. If you can't find a hutch you like, make your own! It isn't as simple as buying one, but it can be much better for your rabbit. You must provide bedding that is soft, warm and absorbent. Cover the entire base to a minimum depth of 3–4 inches (7.6–10 cm). This cushions the backs of the rabbit's hind legs, which are prone to pressure sores if not enough padding is provided. Commonly used substrates for bedding include wood chips, hay, or straw. Of these, straw is the warmest and softest and makes the best bedding material, hay is second best (and is more expensive than straw), and sawdust it third best. You will need to litter train your rabbit if you are keeping it inside. The litter tray will need to fit inside the hutch and not take up more than a third of the floor space. Summary:","output":"Consider factors like cleaning, rabbit-proofing, and socialization when deciding whether to keep your pet rabbit indoors or outdoors, and ensure a suitable hutch, bedding, and litter training for their well-being and comfort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles   of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Wave energy comes from the water.\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the answer \\"Wave energy comes from the water\\" is not true according to the passage. As mentioned in the article, wave energy actually comes from the wind. The wind is responsible for creating the wave energy that moves particles of water up and down, and ultimately causes waves to break onto the shore."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"These two questions are not the same, but they examine the actions and impacts of two different U.S. Presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, with a focus on the African American community. I will address each question separately for a comprehensive understanding. 1. What has Barack Obama done that gets so many people angry? It is important to bear in mind that Presidents often draw both admiration and criticism for their policies and actions. While Barack Obama achieved numerous accomplishments while in office, there were several areas where people have expressed discontent or anger: a) Healthcare - The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \\"Obamacare,\\" was one of Obama's most significant and controversial legislative achievements. While it aimed to expand health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, critics argue that it led to increased premiums, limited choices, and infringed on individual liberties due to the individual mandate. b) Economic Policies - The Obama administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis included a 787 billion stimulus package that sparked criticism from those who believed it was wasteful, ineffective, or excessive government intervention. Additionally, some people argue that his administration’s regulation-heavy approach stifled economic growth and job creation. c) Immigration - Some critics took issue with Obama's executive orders on immigration, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA). These policies were seen by some as either too lenient or an overreach of executive authority. d) Foreign Policy - Critics of Obama’s foreign policy argue that his approach to global issues, including the Iran Nuclear Deal, the handling of the Syrian Civil War, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, left the United States and its allies more vulnerable. The administration's use of drone strikes in the Middle East, which caused civilian casualties, also generated anger. e) Partisanship - Obama's presidency exacerbated political polarization in the country, exacerbated by factors such as increasing racial tensions and the rise of the Tea Party movement. This polarization contributed to an atmosphere of anger and frustration for many Americans during his tenure. 2. Did Bill Clinton do more for black people than Barack Obama? This question is subjective and depends on the specific policies and actions one chooses to examine when comparing the two presidents. Here are some key points for consideration: a) Bill Clinton: - Introduced empowerment zones and enterprise communities, which aimed to improve economic opportunities in distressed urban and rural areas, including many African-American communities. - Increased funding for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) during his tenure. - Welfare reform, which some argue reduced the dependency on government assistance, but has also faced criticism for disproportionately impacting disadvantaged black Americans by tightening eligibility rules and reducing benefits. - Enacted the 1994 Crime Bill, which has been criticized for contributing to mass incarceration and disproportionately affecting African Americans. Later in his life, Clinton acknowledged some of the negative consequences of the bill. b) Barack Obama: - Implemented the Affordable Care Act, which increased healthcare coverage for many African Americans. - Launched My Brother's Keeper, an initiative dedicated to addressing the opportunity gaps faced by young men of color, including African Americans. - Supported criminal justice reforms, including reducing sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine offenses, a policy that had disproportionate consequences for the black community. - Strengthened anti-discrimination laws in areas such as housing, employment, and voting rights, which often disproportionately affected African Americans. Ultimately, the assessment of who did more for the African American community depends on one's perspective on these policy actions and their impact. However, both Clinton and Obama spearheaded numerous initiatives that attempted to improve opportunities for black Americans in different ways."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same?  I. no; II. yes;","output":"I. no First, let's discuss each question and topic separately. 1. Is Swathi's murder taking a casteist turn? Swathi's murder is a tragic and unfortunate event that gained significant attention in the media and among the public. Speculation over whether or not the motives behind her murder were casteist, mainly fueled by the aggressive nature of the crime, the suspects involved, and the subsequent investigations. However, it would be important to base any conclusion regarding caste-based involvement on credible evidence and not hearsay or unverified claims. Discussing a sensitive issue like caste requires objectivity and an understanding of the socio-cultural factors influencing discrimination in society. Taking any stand without substantial evidence may not only create a bias but may also trivialize the victim's plight. 2. Why would J.K. Rowling allow fanfiction (Cursed Child) as canon? J.K. Rowling's decision to consider the Cursed Child as canon can be attributed to multiple reasons. Firstly, the Cursed Child was written in collaboration with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, both well-respected playwrights and writers. Rowling's endorsement and involvement in the project lend credibility and, to a certain extent, the acceptance of the story as part of the Harry Potter series. Secondly, accepting fanfiction as canon helps keep the story universe alive and growing. A dystopian tale like Harry Potter has generated a massive following, with numerous fans wanting to explore new storylines, characters, and situations, which amplifies their interest in the series. By allowing fanfiction as canon, Rowling embraces the creativity and engagement of the fan community. Lastly, the Cursed Child provides a sense of closure to many fans eager to know what happens in the life of the beloved characters after the conclusion of the original book series. It allows fans to continue their journey in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. Now to address the multi-choice problem: These two questions are distinctly different in subject matter and context. Swathi's murder and the investigation into its possible casteist aspects is a real-life crime issue that raises concerns about social and cultural prejudices that persist within society. On the other hand, the discussion about J.K. Rowling allowing fanfiction to be considered canon pertains to literary works and the Harry Potter series, delving into the author's rationale and the impact on the fan base. Therefore, I would choose option I. (No) as these two questions tackle separate issues and concepts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades (Michael Bailey Smith) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in the New Mexico desert are attacked by Letch. A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the United States Department of Defense on installing a surveillance system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter (Eric Edelstein), picks up a faint distress call, the sergeant (Flex Alexander) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon (Michael McMillian) and Amber (Jessica Stroup). The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group Amber is attacked by Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey (Reshad Strik) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and the sergeant is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his rappelling gear as the others attempt to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen they are forced to try to find another way down. The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves.

The hearing will likely take place in July, according to David Smith, spokesman for the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners. Depending on the outcome, the “Juice” could be loose as soon as Oct. 1. Previous ratings of Simpson have scored him in the low-risk category for release.      Simpson — who was famously acquitted in 1995 in the slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman — has been serving out a nine-to-33-year sentence for his role in a 2007 incident that unfolded in a Las Vegas hotel room.      He and armed associates allegedly confronted memorabilia dealers Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley and took pieces of Simpson’s memorabilia from them. Simpson was convicted on charges including kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.      The former college and pro football star said at his sentencing that he was trying to reclaim family heirlooms and other personal items that had been stolen from him, and claimed that he was unaware his associates were carrying guns.      Simpson’s lawyers in the Nevada case argued that the crime did not justify the time. They said that Simpson, 69, was getting a dose of payback from the Nevada justice system after his acquittal in the Brown and Goldman murders.      Simpson has always denied that he was their killer, though the Brown and Goldman families won a wrongful death civil judgment against him in 1997.      Since 2008, Simpson has been at Lovelock Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison in a remote desert town of the same name. This summer, Nevada prison inmate #1027820 will have his first chance at freedom. It comes at a time when Simpson has vaulted back into the limelight with the documentary “O.J.: Made in America,” which captured the Academy Award for best documentary.      Ron Goldman’s father, Fred, told CNN he is not surprised Simpson may be released from prison in October.      “Simpson has proven over and over again, throughout his life, he has absolutely no concern for the law or authority,” Goldman said.      Simpson’s attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.      At least four of seven commissioners will have to vote in Simpson’s favor in order for him to be released. Here’s how they will make their decision.      How Simpson could get parole      With a minimum sentence of nine years, this is the first year Simpson could be released. But he was granted parole on some of the counts against him at a 2013 hearing. This summer, he will only have to make parole on seven of the original 12 counts. Prosecutors declined to comment on the likelihood of Simpson being paroled.      Simpson’s prosecution in the deaths and civil suit loss will have no impact on his bid for parole, said Smith, the parole board spokesman.      The parole board scores an inmate on several factors — the higher the total score, the greater the risk involved in releasing them. A person with a score of zero to five points is deemed low risk; six to 11 points, medium risk; and 12 or more, high risk.      In 2013, Simpson scored three points overall. Little has changed for him since then, and he is likely to score similarly when he goes before the board again this summer.      In his favor: He will turn 70 years old in July, and people above the age of 41 are considered less likely to commit a crime (-1 point). Simpson was above the age of 24 at the time of his first arrest; he has never had parole or probation revoked; he is retired and is believed to have no gang ties; he is a medium custody inmate (all 0 points).      In 2013, he had no record of disciplinary action over the year before the hearing, earning him -1 point. Simpson has maintained a pattern of good behavior and is likely to have the same score again this summer.      Completing an educational, vocational or treatment program would also help him. Simpson scored zero in this category in 2013, but testified then that he was on the waiting list to get into a “commitment to change” program. If he got in, he will likely score -1 point this year.      Another factor in Simpson’s favor — one that no doubt enrages the Brown and Goldman families — is the fact that his risk assessment states “no prior conviction history.”      Working against him: He has a property crime conviction in the 2007 incident (2 points). In the “drug/alcohol use/abuse” category, Simpson’s 2013 parole documents cite a history of “frequent abuse, serious disruption of functioning.” (2 points) As men are statistically more likely than women to commit crimes, he also scores one point for his gender.      The severity of the crime is another factor for the commissioners to consider, outside of the risk assessment score sheet. Simpson received the highest level of offense severity for his kidnapping conviction in the hotel raid, during which the memorabilia dealers said they feared leaving the hotel room under threat from Simpson’s gun-wielding associates.      The “substantial financial loss” one of the memorabilia dealers incurred was also cited in 2013 as a factor that made Simpson’s crime more serious.      ‘A model prisoner’      If Simpson does score as low risk in 2017, the board still has the latitude to deny him parole. Should that happen, Simpson would go before the parole board again before 2020, Smith said.      But Simpson fits the profile of a state prison inmate who receives parole at the first opportunity, Nevada defense attorney Dan Hill said.      “Simpson’s age, the fact that he was given parole on the first sentencing batch, weigh in his favor,” Hill said. “So does the fact that he was by all accounts a model prisoner, as does any acceptance of responsibility for his actions.”      In a video of the 2013 hearing, Simpson pleads with the parole commissioners. “My crime was trying to retrieve for my family my own property that was stolen from me,” Simpson tells the panel. “I just wish I had never gone to that room. I wish I had just said keep it and not worry about it.”      Simpson tells the board that he helps supervise in the prison gym, disinfects equipment, mops floors, coaches and umpires games.      “Because of I guess my age, guys come to me,” Simpson says. “I’m sure the powers here know that I advise a lot of guys. I’d like to feel I kept a lot of trouble from happening. Since I’ve been here by getting involved in some of the conflicts that some of the individuals here have had.”      The old-fashioned principle of remorse      Members of the parole board “work with the old-fashioned principal of wanting to hear the inmate is remorseful for their crime,” said Gabe Grasso, a veteran Nevada defense attorney who was part of the team representing Simpson in the Las Vegas kidnapping case.      Grasso, who stopped representing the former star running back eight years ago, has seen dozens of former clients go before the parole board.      “What O.J. has going for him is I don’t think Fromong will want to show up screaming and testifying against him,” the lawyer added. “He was upset, insulted, but I don’t think that he thought the price should be what it was.”      Fromong told CNN that he would testify in favor of Simpson’s release. “I told the district attorney at the time (of his conviction) that I only thought that O.J. Simpson deserved one to three years in state prison,” Fromong said.      “O.J.’s done his time, he’s been a model inmate,” he said.      The other victim, Alfred Beardsley, died in 2015.      “Something else that could help O.J., he did not set up the meeting in the hotel room,” Grasso added.      Tom Riccio, a Los Angeles man who had been convicted on stolen property charges before the 2007 incident, arranged the meeting between Simpson and the memorabilia dealers.      “I hope he does get his life together,” Riccio told CNN. “I hope he doesn’t take matters into his own hands anymore. I hope he has learned his lesson.”      “He was just trying to get his stuff back,” Riccio said. “A lot of memorabilia but also a lot of personal items, mementos. I don’t think a regular person would get nine to 33 years for these crimes. They were getting him for other things.” ||||| (CNN) O.J.

The \\"substantial financial loss\\" one of the memorabilia dealers incurred was also cited in 2013 as a factor that made Simpson's crime more serious.      'A model prisoner'      If Simpson does score as low risk in 2017, the board still has the latitude to deny him parole. Should that happen, Simpson would go before the parole board again before 2020, Smith said.      But Simpson fits the profile of a state prison inmate who receives parole at the first opportunity, Nevada defense attorney Dan Hill said.      \\"Simpson's age, the fact that he was given parole on the first sentencing batch, weigh in his favor,\\" Hill said. \\"So does the fact that he was by all accounts a model prisoner, as does any acceptance of responsibility for his actions.\\"      In a video of the 2013 hearing, Simpson pleads with the parole commissioners. \\"My crime was trying to retrieve for my family my own property that was stolen from me,\\" Simpson tells the panel. \\"I just wish I had never gone to that room. I wish I had just said keep it and not worry about it.\\"      Simpson tells the board that he helps supervise in the prison gym, disinfects equipment, mops floors, coaches and umpires games.      \\"Because of I guess my age, guys come to me,\\" Simpson says. \\"I'm sure the powers here know that I advise a lot of guys. I'd like to feel I kept a lot of trouble from happening. Since I've been here by getting involved in some of the conflicts that some of the individuals here have had.\\"      JUST WATCHED O.J.

Grasso, who stopped representing the former star running back eight years ago, has seen dozens of former clients go before the parole board.      \\"What O.J. has going for him is I don't think Fromong will want to show up screaming and testifying against him,\\" the lawyer added. \\"He was upset, insulted, but I don't think that he thought the price should be what it was.\\"      Fromong told CNN that he would testify in favor of Simpson's release. \\"I told the district attorney at the time (of his conviction) that I only thought that O.J.

The other victim, Alfred Beardsley, died in 2015.      \\"Something else that could help O.J., he did not set up the meeting in the hotel room,\\" Grasso added.      Tom Riccio, a Los Angeles man who had been convicted on stolen property charges before the 2007 incident, arranged the meeting between Simpson and the memorabilia dealers.      \\"I hope he does get his life together,\\" Riccio told CNN. \\"I hope he doesn't take matters into his own hands anymore. I hope he has learned his lesson.\\"      \\"He was just trying to get his stuff back,\\" Riccio said. \\"A lot of memorabilia but also a lot of personal items, mementos.

Simpson, the former football star who was famously acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1995, could be released from prison later this year if a pivotal parole hearing goes in his favor. The hearing is likely to take place in July, and if successful, Simpson could be released as soon as October 1. He is currently serving a nine-to-33-year sentence for his role in a 2007 incident where he and armed associates allegedly confronted memorabilia dealers Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley in a Las Vegas hotel room, taking pieces of Simpson's memorabilia from them.

Plot title: The North Avenue Irregulars Movie plot: Reverend Michael Hill (Edward Herrmann) and his two children arrive in a fictional California town. He is there to serve as the new minister at the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly, in her final movie role) to handle the church's sinking fund. On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed. That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \\"jazz up\\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director. Then, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken). They want Hill to help them close down the gambling racket by recruiting some men from the church to place bets that the agents will watch. Hill cannot find any men to help, but hits upon the idea of using women. Five women from his congregation (and Delany, whose wife does not drive) attempt to place bets in the company of the Treasury agents, but with disastrous clumsiness.

Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things. His heart was not in school, but in the woods. One day, Miss White's impatient voice broke into his daydreams. \\"Steve! Pay attention!\\" Steve turned to look at her, fixing his eyes on Miss White, as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade. \\"You all did pretty well,\\" she told the class, \\"except for one boy, and it breaks my heart to tell you this, but...\\" She hesitated, her eyes searching his face. \\"...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!\\" She just stared at Steve. Steve dropped his eyes. After that, it was war! Steve still wouldn't do his homework. Even as the punishments became more severe, he remained _  \\"Just try it! ONE WEEK!\\" He was unmoved. \\"You're smart enough! You'll see a change!\\" Nothing touched him. \\"Give yourself a chance! Don't give up on your life!\\" Nothing. \\"Steve! Please! I care about you!\\" Wow! Suddenly, Steve got it! Someone cared about him? Steve went home from school, thoughtful, that afternoon. Walking into the house, both parents were out. He, quickly, gathered up a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of bread, a bottle of water, and this time...his schoolbooks. The following Monday he arrived at school on time, and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom. She walked in, all smiles! God, she was beautiful! Miss White, immediately, gave a quiz on the weekend homework. Steve hurried through the test and was the first to hand in his paper. With a look of surprise, Miss White took his paper. Obviously puzzled, she began to look it over. Miss White's face was in total shock! The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test! From that moment nothing was the same for Steve. Life at home remained the same, but life still changed. He discovered that not only could he learn, but he was good at it! He discovered that he could understand knowledge and translate the things... Steve used to be bad at his lessons because   _  . A) the teacher blamed him from time to time B) he was not a smart boy in his class C) the test for the seventh grade challenged his confidence D) he hadn't put his heart into his studies Answer:","output":"D) he hadn't put his heart into his studies In the given context, it becomes clear that Steve's struggle with his lessons wasn't due to a lack of intelligence or his teacher's blame. In fact, Miss White declares Steve as the smartest boy in the seventh grade despite his poor performance. The real issue lies in Steve's lack of interest and dedication to his studies. Instead of focusing on school, he daydreams about the woods and doesn't engage with his coursework. This disinterest is demonstrated by his refusal to do homework, even as the punishments become more severe. Steve's turning point comes when Miss White shows genuine concern and care for his future. This unexpected expression of compassion makes him realize that he is not alone, and that there is value in putting effort into his schoolwork. After this, Steve makes a conscious decision to dedicate time and effort to his studies by taking his schoolbooks with him when he spends time in the woods. Upon his return to school, he arrives on time and eagerly completes a quiz on the weekend homework. Miss White is both shocked and proud to see that Steve has passed his first test, indicating that he has finally put his heart into his studies. As a result, Steve's academic performance rapidly improves, and he discovers that he enjoys learning and excelling at school. In conclusion, the primary reason Steve used to be bad at his lessons was that he hadn't put his heart into his studies. It wasn't until he received genuine support and encouragement from Miss White that he became motivated to dedicate himself to school, which clearly demonstrated his true potential as the smartest boy in the seventh grade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that released Off the Wall?

Write an article based on this summary: Gut-load your crickets. Feed your frog insects every two or three days. Provide a water dish. Spray the terrarium to increase humidity.","output":"Title: Effective Techniques for Maintaining Frog Health through Optimal Terrarium Conditions and Feeding  Step One: Understanding the Topic The summary provided indicates that the article will gravitate around how to maintain a frog's health through appropriate insect-feeding schedules, water provision, and terrarium humidity conditions. To begin with, I will provide some background information on the importance of each element before delving into the specifics of practical application. Final Introduction:  Frogs are intriguing animals boasting of unique features and behavior; understanding and catering to their needs results in a thriving and healthy pet. Proper caring involves various factors spanning their diet, hydration, and habitat. This article provides pointers on how to gut-load crickets for feeding, how often to feed your frog insects, the significance of a water dish, and the importance of optimum terrarium humidity. Step Two: Writing About the Importance of Gut-loading Crickets As a first step in the discussion, I will explain what gut-loading is and the benefits it brings to a frog's health. Gut-loading refers to the process of feeding nutritious food to crickets before offering them to frogs. It is important because frogs gain their nutrients mainly from what the insects have consumed.   Final Paragraph:  Gut-Loading Your Crickets: Enhancing Frog Nutrition Gut-loading is a strategic method of ensuring your frog gets the necessary vitamins and minerals. This process involves feeding crickets with nutrient-rich food before serving them as meals to frogs. Since frogs mainly acquire nutrients from what their prey consumes, gut-loading essentially enhances the nutritional value of their diet. Step Three: Discussing the Frequency of Insect Feeding to Frogs  The summary provides a frequency of every two or three days, but it's important to give more context. The feeding frequency varies depending on the frog's size, age, and species.  Final Paragraph:  The Regularity of Feeding Insects to Frogs: Striking a Healthy Balance Feeding your pet frog insects every two or three days is a general guideline but might change depending on the frog's characteristics. The size, age, and species of a frog can dictate the frequency. For example, younger frogs usually require daily feeding, while some larger species may only need feeding every few days. However, a balance of nutrients is crucial to enhancing a frog's longevity and health. Step Four: Discussing the Importance of Providing a Water Dish  Frogs require water both for drinking and maintaining their skin moisture. I will elaborate on the kind of water dish and water type suitable for frogs. Final Paragraph:  Considerations in Providing a Water Dish: Essential Hydration for Frogs Having a water dish in the terrarium is essential. Frogs depend on water not only for drinking but also for keeping their skin moist. It is important to choose a shallow dish that is easily accessible, and remember to fill it with dechlorinated water, as frogs are particularly sensitive to chlorine and other chemicals. Step Five: Writing About the Need for Spraying the Terrarium Frogs need a certain level of moisture in the air to stay healthy, and this varies by species. Spraying replicates this humidity. Final Paragraph:  Spraying the Terrarium: Ensuring Optimum Humidity Humidity plays a crucial role in a frog's wellbeing. Frogs require a specific humidity level in their atmosphere depending on their species. Spraying the terrarium with water regularly can mimic their natural habitat's wet conditions and help maintain a lush, humid environment that frogs enjoy.  In conclusion, caring for frogs is a meticulous process that involves attention to their diet, hydration, and habitat conditions. By adhering to these guidelines, frog owners can take great strides in enhancing their pet's health and happiness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The answer to the question: Who did Santa Anna demand the executions of? is inside the article: The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Santa Anna demanded the executions of Texian soldiers who surrendered during the Runaway Scrape events. These soldiers believed they would become prisoners of war, but Santa Anna ordered their executions instead. Notable examples of these executions include the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre. These events instilled fear in the Texian population and led to a mass exodus of civilians, accompanied by the newly forming provisional army under Sam Houston's command."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The band consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Matt Skiba, bassist and co-vocalist Dan Andriano, and drummer Derek Grant. Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, \\"Sundials\\", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Andriano. Context: In 2001, the band released From Here To Infirmary on Vagrant Records. This album inspired music videos for the singles \\"Stupid Kid\\" and \\"Private Eye.\\" The album was the band's first album to reach above Billboard top 200 mark and the first to gross six figures in sales.  Their next full-length album was Good Mourning, released in 2003, with the album's launch single \\"We've Had Enough\\" seeing much the same success as the previous single \\"Stupid Kid\\". The album was something of a departure from earlier works, featuring greater production values.  The band appeared on various compilation albums, notably Plea for Peace Vol. 1, Vagrant Records: Another Year on the Streets Vol. 1, 2, and 3, and Rock Against Bush Vol. 1. Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano have both independently recorded split records, Skiba with Kevin Seconds on Asian Man Records and Andriano with Mike Felumlee on Double Zero Records, as well as jointly performing backing vocal duties on the album This is Unity Music by Common Rider. They recorded two split EPs: one with Hot Water Music in 2002 and the other with One Man Army in 2004.  In 2004, Andriano became a member of The Falcon, a group consisting of The Lawrence Arms' bassist Brendan Kelly, previously of Slapstick (alongside Andriano) and The Broadways, and drummer Neil Hennessy. The Falcon also saw contributions from Todd Mohney of The Killing Tree and formerly Rise Against. The band released an EP, God Don't Make No Trash / Up Your Ass With Broken Glass in 2005 and its first full length, Unicornography in September 2006. Question: Did any more singles make it to the chart from that album? Answer:","output":"From the album Good Mourning released in 2003, in addition to the launch single \\"We've Had Enough\\" which garnered significant success, the other single that gained some traction was \\"All on Black.\\" However, it did not achieve the same level of chart success as \\"We've Had Enough\\" or \\"Stupid Kid\\" from their previous album, From Here To Infirmary. Nonetheless, Good Mourning as an album contributed to further establishing Alkaline Trio's presence in the punk rock scene and helped expand their fan base."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about this article.","output":"The 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army has had a long and storied history dating back to its formation in 1866. One notable period in the unit's history occurred during the Cold War, specifically as a part of the 4th Infantry Division. During this time, the 1st Squadron participated in several iterations of Exercise Reforger from 1977 to 1991 (Reforger stands for REturn of FORces to GERmany). Exercise Reforger was an annually held military exercise conducted by NATO to ensure its ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact, which was the main rival of NATO during the Cold War period. Throughout the various Exercise Reforger events, the 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry acted in numerous capacities as dictated by the objectives of each exercise. These tasks could range from engaging in reconnaissance and security operations to practicing defensive tactics in hypothetical conflict scenarios. By participating in these exercises, the squadron demonstrated its readiness and ability to rapidly deploy to West Germany and collaborate with other NATO forces. The 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, which belonged to the 7th Infantry Division, also held various participation in Exercise Reforger. They took part in the exercises in 1984, 1986, and 1993, which further attests to the importance of maintaining strong and agile forces during the Cold War. Similarly, the 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry was activated within the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, in 1977. The 3rd Battalion contributed to this preparedness as well, although it did not participate in the Reforger exercises mentioned. Exercise Reforger ultimately served to showcase the strong and cohesive nature of NATO forces as they rehearsed various operational scenarios in the European theatre. The 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, as well as other army units such as the 2nd Squadron, 10th Cavalry, and the 3rd Battalion, 10th Cavalry, all played a significant role in exemplifying the dedication and readiness of U.S. military forces during the Cold War era, ultimately working to maintain peace and stability throughout the NATO alliance.

Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club. This resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, \\"Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies.\\" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a \\"healthy, scientific, friendly mind game.\\" Mr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century.

Movie title: The Final Destination Context: Ten years after the explosion of Flight 180, Nick O'Bannon has a horrific premonition in which a bizarre sequence of events causes multiple race cars to crash at the McKinley Speedway race track, sending flaming debris into the stands, brutally killing his friends and causing the upper deck of the stands to collapse on him. When he comes out of this grisly nightmare Nick panics, persuading his girlfriend, Lori, and their friends, Janet and Hunt, to leave... escaping seconds before Nick's frightening vision becomes a terrible reality.

(CNN) -- The outrage came hard and fast after a 3-year-old girl badly scarred and wearing an eye patch because of a pit bull attack was apparently asked to leave a KFC restaurant because her appearance upset other customers. After social media users opened fire on the restaurant, calling for a boycott, the apology from the chain came quickly too. The company said it will donate 30,000 to assist with the girl's medical bills. \\"The entire KFC family is behind Victoria,\\" company spokesman Rick Maynard said. 'Her face is disrupting our customers' Victoria Wilcher was mauled by three pit bulls a few months ago, causing her to need regular medical treatment.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".  Question: \\"What are the two incarnations of Madame White Snake?\\" Answer: \\"Lover of Hsu and motherof Toyoo\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Imagine you're listening to a story about a pretty snake lady named Madame White Snake. This snake lady can change her looks and she appears in two different stories. In one story, she is Toyoo's lover and her beauty makes him think about her all the time. In the second story, she is Hsü's lover, and he can't focus on anything because she is so pretty. Madame White Snake is like a magical lady who is really, really pretty, and her beauty can sometimes cause problems for the people who fall in love with her. Now, someone asks: \\"What are the two incarnations of Madame White Snake?\\" We can say that she appears as the pretty lover of Toyoo in one story and the enchanting lover of Hsü in another story. So, yes, the answer \\"Lover of Hsu and mother of Toyoo\\" is correct, but it might be better to say \\"Lover of Hsü and lover of Toyoo\\" because that's how she appears in the two stories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some feel proud when they receive the news, while others worry, wondering whether they will be good fathers. Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experience with them, others do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them. Many fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time. For other couples, pregnancy  was an accident that both husband and wife have accepted willingly or unwillingly. Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child, it is obvious that the change from the role of husband to that of father is a difficult task. Yet, unfortunately, few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this re-socialization process. Although many good books have been written about American mothers, only recently have some books discussed the role of a father. It is argued by some writers that the transition to the father's role, although difficult, is not nearly as great as the transition the wife must make to the mother's role. The mother's role seems to require a complete transformation of daily routine and adaptation to a new life, on the other hand, the father's role is less demanding and immediate. However, even though we have mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home, the father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household.

There’s a lot of upside for Republicans in this election cycle, and very little downside, as eight Democrats are defending winning margins from the last election of 10 points or less. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is the only Republican in this perilous position. In addition, midterm elections typically spell bad news for the party in control of the White House. Ever since World War II, the president’s party has, on average, lost a net four Senate seats in midterm races. Incumbency also matters, and careful studies suggest that senators running for re-election effectively begin with a head start of 8 to 10 percentage points. As a result, around 90 percent of incumbent senators are re-elected. Turnover is much more likely in open seats, and the Democrats find themselves defending five seats previously occupied by retiring Democrats, three of which are in states that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. And while three Republican senators are retiring, they are all in Republican-leaning states. These fundamentals add up to a powerful structural advantage for Senate Republicans. They also yield the sort of predictive power that economists often only dream about. But to a pundit, they may present a quandary: The broad contours of the election were largely set in stone nearly two years ago, yet column inches still need to be filled for a narrative-hungry readership. No surprise, then, that the supply of dramatic political narrative rises to meet the demand, and the commentariat largely ignores the underlying predictability of most elections. The one fundamental force that has changed over the past two years — sharply — is the state of the economy. This should be a major positive for Democrats, as improving economic conditions generally lead to better results for the president’s party. Even as the unemployment rate remains somewhat elevated, it has fallen by more during this two-year congressional term than in any previous midterm election cycle in the postwar era. Indeed, the unemployment rate has fallen exactly 4.1 percentage points since its double-digit recessionary peak, which exactly matches the peak-to-trough decline that Ronald Reagan presided over at a similar point in his presidency. In many respects, the economy remains in bad shape. Yet this is beside the point, as voters tend to respond to changes in economic conditions — the extent to which the economy has improved — rather than its current level. This distinction helps explain how President Obama won re-election in 2012, in the face of a very weak (though rapidly improving) economy. To be sure, there’s debate about how much the economy has improved. Even as unemployment has fallen, the proportion of the population with a job has barely risen, gross domestic product is merely puttering along, and wages are barely rising for most workers. Of course, these economic fundamentals matter only to the extent that they affect voters, which raises the question of how best to make sense of polls. The basic rules for interpreting economic statistics also apply to polling data: Big samples beat small samples, and a dashboard of indicators is more convincing than any single survey, which is why it’s important to aggregate information from many pollsters. Importantly, campaign events often drive sharp shifts in sentiment, although these effects are typically short-lived. A result is that polls often fluctuate wildly even as electoral fortunes evolve slowly. But as Election Day approaches, polls tend to shift toward the fundamentals, as economic and political realities come into sharper focus. There’s no point being steered in the wrong direction by polls that will later reverse themselves, which is why careful poll analysis — like that used by The Upshot’s model, which we’ve nicknamed Leo — filters polling data through a lens that takes account of the underlying fundamentals. By now, Leo suggests that the Republicans have a 66 percent chance of taking control of the Senate. While Leo and other poll-aggregation models are built to reflect the results of surveys asking people whom they intend to vote for, my research with David Rothschild of Microsoft Research suggests that asking people who they think will win typically yields even more accurate forecasts. A recent survey by Gallup (where, full disclosure, I do consulting as a senior scientist) found that 52 percent of people expect Republicans to win control of the Senate, compared with 42 percent who expect the Democrats to win. While a majority expect a Republican victory, the differential is smaller than that seen in the Obama-versus-Romney race, suggesting only a modest Republican edge. How should you combine insights from the basic political factors — the state of the economy, opinion polls and voter expectations? Economics doesn’t provide a formula, but rather a suggestion: Turn to political prediction markets where people trade securities linked to election outcomes. When many people make trades based on their individual perspectives, the price comes to reflect each of the most relevant factors, effectively weighting each by the confidence that traders have in them. While the Intrade market, once popular, is no longer with us, the idea lives on at Betfair, a prediction market run in Britain. As I’m writing, you can buy a security, which pays 100 if the Republicans take control of the Senate, at a discount: The security is going for around 69, which suggests a 69 percent chance that this will happen. Offshore bookmakers are offering similar odds. Even though markets are prone to their own failures, they have amassed a better record of accuracy than even the most sophisticated models that are based on fundamentals and polling. The point is that while markets aren’t perfect, in practice they’re less imperfect than the other election forecasters. This economist’s bottom line, then, is that there’s a 69 percent chance that Republicans will win the Senate. This forecast is clear, it’s precise, it’s quantitative (in that it acknowledges and specifies uncertainty), and it’s easily evaluated. In other words, it’s terrible punditry, but good economics. And, if you think it’s wrong, you can bet against it.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose death would allow for a unanimous board decision?  Sam Roffe, President of Roffe & Sons Pharmaceuticals, dies in what appears to be a climbing accident, leaving his daughter Elizabeth a billion-dollar empire. Roffe's board members see an opportunity to settle old scores, jockey for higher position, and reap lucrative profits. However, an investigation into Sam's death discloses that it was a murder and that a power struggle is going on within the company. Lead investigator Max Hornung informs Elizabeth of his list of suspects, which includes her closest advisers and financially strapped family members. During this time, she marries CEO Rhys Williams, but he, too, is identified by Hornung as a suspect. As president, Elizabeth follows her father's wishes and refuses to let shares of Roffe & Sons sell on the world market. Her choice prevents the board members from selling their shares as the company's by-laws prohibit it until all board members agree; on the other hand, her death would allow for a unanimous decision. After several attempts on her life, an international chase across Europe ensues. Hornung is able to connect these murder attempts to a series of homicides of prostitutes, which have been recorded on snuff films using Roffe film stock with a witness in a black Gucci leather coat (several suspects are linked to this coat). Elizabeth returns to her father's villa in Sardinia during a scirocco for protection from the unseen murderer, who sets her house on fire after she begins destroying objects and shouting, \\"Now try to make it look like an accident!\\" Williams and one of the shareholders, Sir Alec Nichols, both show up to save her, but Hornung figures out that Nichols is the killer and shoots him before he can murder Elizabeth in a symbolic snuff film.","output":"The first name of the person whose death would allow for a unanimous board decision is Elizabeth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two tubes are inserted into his nose, and truck battery acid is pumped in through one pipe, causing blood to pour out through the other. The man's captor then kills him with a large hammer. Jennifer Tree (Elisha Cuthbert), a young fashion model and cover girl, had captured the attention of photographers and for better or worse, the public at large. On an evening out alone, Jennifer is stalked and drugged. She wakes in a stupor to find herself captive and confined to a cell. A series of metal bins and numbered lockers abruptly swing open in front of her. They contain personal items taken from her apartment. She is forced to view videotapes containing images of the victims who were tortured previous to her captivity, as well as videotaped interviews she had given to the media in the past. Realizing there is no way out, Jennifer pleads and screams to anyone who might hear her. During her confinement, she is subjected to various forms of psychological torture. Jennifer eventually finds she is not alone. A young man, Gary (Daniel Gillies), is being held captive in an adjoining cell. The two make contact and try to find out why they are being held. After watching the horrific scene, they find their way out. They both make it to a garage where they find a car. As soon as they are about to start it, a gas erupts in the car making them both unconscious. They find themselves back in their cells where Jennifer sees a tape of Gary being taken and tied to a chair with a gun held under his chin. After a while of Jennifer worrying, she sees Gary being thrown into his cell. She rushes to him and helps him.

With so many confusing headlines hitting your inboxes on a daily basis and the dreaded Christmas shopping to come, here’s an early tonic to focus into 2013. A top eight ‘risks, ruses and rumblers’ for energy in 2013. Here goes: 1) Risk: MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles Hardly new I know, but no matter what any investment house tells you on benchmark prices, we’re stuck in a 50-150/b world, that’s defined by whichever part of the supply-demand balance proves to be most dysfunctional at any one time. The key supply side risk remains the Middle East. The political debris from 2011-12 will continue into 2013 and beyond, with popular pressures continually growing. That’s not just in the Arab Nationalist Republics such as Egypt, where vocal demonstrators on Tahrir Square have made clear President Morsi needs to deliver the goods or else. Or indeed Syria, whose internal implosion will have increasingly regional effects: But in Gulf Monarchy’s as well. The trigger point to watch is all about political secession. The exact timings are by definition uncertain, but Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and most importantly Saudi Arabia, are in the same boat. If the old secession model passing power from one aging leader to another is seen to be broken, then prices will rapidly lift when the Arab Street erupts. The fact that Saudi Arabia has a very ‘awkward neighbourhood’, with deep seated problems in Bahrain, Yemen and Iraq hardly helps its own Eastern Province either. Forget ‘Arab Spring’; think ‘Salafist Séance’. 2) Risk: Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices Holding things together in the Middle East will in large part depend on maintaining high oil prices in the first place. Given likely Eurozone failures, a realisation that the U.S. debt position is unsustainable, and daunting domestic challenges in India, Brazil and China to head off hard landings, then demand side fundamentals all point towards two digit oil prices. Having made over 1.115trillion in 2012, you could be excused for thinking OPEC would have ample wiggle room to buy themselves more political time; not so. 100/b is no longer deemed expensive across OPEC ranks, but a necessary price for regime survival. Besides notoriously overstretched patronage states like Algeria, Nigeria, Venezuela or Iran, even Gulf States are starting to feel the pinch. There are no true price moderates left in the oil cartel, merely gradations of hawks. The geopolitical cost of survival is what matters, and it’s seriously out of sync with the geological cost of production. Bottom line: It’s 100/b or bust for petro-states. While it’s true that most recessions since the 1970s have been preceded by oil price spikes, OPEC has never been very good at heading the lessons of demand destruction, and with emerging markets dominating the headlines, it is unlikely to do better now. Most producer states will be caught seriously short if this happens. Russia will be first out of the money, Central Asian budgets will be squeezed and MENA producers will have to make uncomfortable trade-offs. Latin America is in no better shape, no matter whether you look at Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador or indeed Brazil. In a back to (conventional) basics scenario, the bulk of producer states will go for volume over price, in the hope that the Saudis will do the heavy lifting to set a viable floor. Riyadh might play ball for a while, but it’s unlikely to stop producer states reverting to what they know best as a short term coping mechanism: ‘blunt repression’. Whether that works or not remains to be seen, but if nothing else, we could see a ‘2013 paradox’ of heightened instability across producer states underpinning prices as panic sets in. Pleasant OPEC meetings in Vienna will be irrelevant to the political unrest sweeping producer states. ‘Cyclical’ will take on a whole new meaning as far price and political instability is concerned – the lower the price, the more likely we will see supply disruptions as more vulnerable producers opt for a Libyan or Syrian course. Watch out for Iraq on that score; Kurdish plays look good right now, but Baghdad is unlikely to give up the Northern ghost without a fight – Sunni factions could easily get caught in the crossfire. 3) Ruse: Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head Amid all this, Iran will be the nuclear dog that doesn’t bark. Sanctions will remain in place, with the U.S. turning the screw a little harder around June presidential elections in Tehran. The Iranian’s will increase their bluster around the Strait of Hormuz in response, not to mention continuing to vie for regional influence across the Gulf, and especially in Syria, Bahrain and Iraq. But for all the huffing and puffing in Washington and Tehran, the nuclear question will remain a stalemate. As long as Iran can find Eastern outlets for its crude, the only way the nuclear clock is stopped is by impatience, miscalculation or misreading of intent that prompts somebody (aka Tel Aviv), to hazard a high risk first move. That’s an unlikely prospect given the political factors in play, Iran will be deferred to 2014 or 2015. Traders who don’t ‘get that’; expect to get burnt. 4) Rumbler: Russia Goes To Internal Energy War Classically Russian, but in the midst of extreme market uncertainty, the main wars they’ll be fighting are internal between Rosneft and Gazprom. It’s quite clear after the TNK-BP deal that Rosneft has become the new national champion of choice, producing up to 4.6mb/d (taking overall state control of hydrocarbon output to over 50%). How well Rosneft performs remains to be seen, as does the amount of international capital Russia can attract into Arctic plays, but it’s Gazprom that’s the canary in the Moscow mineshaft here. After pursuing endless political goals such as Nord Stream (and nascent South Stream pipelines), Gazprom failed to respond to the most fundamental ‘fundamental’ of all; the unconventional gas world developing around them. To remain a ‘market maker’ rather than price taker, Gazprom had to get out of petty pipeline politics and into serious quantities of LNG. That never happened, and with most Russian fields now looking horribly expensive to develop, Gazprom will need to fork out over 45bn per anum over the next five years. That doesn’t bode particularly well for the Kremlin to fall back on gas revenues, especially if shale plays and LNG continue to cut international market share. Gazprom only contributes 7% of total state revenues, a figure that will be squeezed into 2013. But the competition isn’t just coming from overseas, but directly from Rosneft. Igor Sechin’s outfit has already secured a 25 year gas supply agreement with Inter RAO (the state electricity provider), next stop will be going after Gazprom’s gas export monopoly. That spells trouble for Gazprom, and indeed private players such as Novatak. Gazprom gets left holding the European baby, playing regional pipeline politics, while Rosneft performs a global energy role. As the battle unfolds, expect Russian production to suffer in the interim and for Moscow to fall back on its free-rider role wherever possible. Hostilities will be brutal, but Rosneft is likely to be the long term winner. Civil war is an ugly thing, and especially so in Russia. 5) Rumbling Risk: American Schizophrenia Sets In Then we have America. It’s been the trail blazer for shale gas gains over the past decade, and’s increasingly replicating the ‘revolution’ for liquids. As everyone knows, U.S. shale gas gains have turned gas into a perennial buyers’ market, so much so that henry hub prices have become a victim of their own success. The key question in 2013 is not whether America will maintain its number one (650bcm) gas slot, but how much it intends to export as LNG? Those expecting the floodgates to open next year could be disappointed; any volumes signed off in Washington will keep a very keen eye on domestic prices. Of the 125bcm/y of LNG trains awaiting FERC approval, 40-50bcm would be remarkably good going. But even if America gets cold LNG feet, price convergence will slowly continue to play out across the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. The mere prospect of U.S. liquidity hitting the market has been seized upon by Asian buyers, with the upshot that Washington’s virtual impact on the gas world will be far larger than its physical presence in 2013. That’s not particularly great news for global energy companies trying to develop expensive LNG projects in West Africa, East Africa and Australia, but as the old adage from abundant energy goes, ‘be careful what you wish for’. Qatar and Russia serve as the perfect case in point, rueing the slow, but painful death of oil indexed prices for gas. In terms of liquids, America will probably push towards 11.5mb/d production next year. That means very different things to different people. It’s ‘energy independence nirvana’ for some, especially those willing to lump the Americas all under a single Washington production figure. When President Obama signs off the Keystone XI pipeline in 2013 the narrative will gain far greater traction, even though it’s actually the first step towards fixing WTI prices back towards international benchmarks. That’s chilling news for OPEC of course, not because America can play any kind of swing producer role, but because of the collateral damage it will do to oil prices. Where things get considerably worse for the cartel, is not only that the Americas will use Washington as a production hedge to send tankers East, (Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico all know that relying on a single source of supply and single source of demand is a no brainer), but that Beijing will continue to go ‘long’ in the Americas to make sure they remain firmly tied into global energy markets. Just as China is strategically investing in any cost overruns on LNG plays right now, it’s going to do exactly the same for liquids. Why? Because China wins most from a cheap and abundant energy world. 2013 will mark a transitional step towards that outcome; the vexed Nexen deal will be the watershed moment underpinning Chimerica’s physical and virtual stake in the game. But a word of caution for Beijing, political risk is just as lethal, if not more so in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world. Just ask BP. 6) Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind The perceived U.S. upside from its energy gains is that it no longer has to do all the heavy lifting for global energy supplies. True enough; but the blunt fact to consider is that two-thirds of global oil supplies are still sitting on politically shaky ground, and doing so in an increasingly large external power vacuum in the Middle East. The vacuum will get significantly bigger as US power (and interest) ebbs and Chinese oil flows, albeit without overarching political or security guarantees in place. It also had the distinct potential for conflict should Washington and Beijing end up misreading each other’s actions. Both of whom remain OPEC price takers at this stage.","output":"The article entitled \\"The Top Eight Energy Risks For 2013\\" outlines eight major challenges, risks and uncertainties that the global energy sector faced in 2013.  1. MENA Unrest & Secession Struggles: The article stated that political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) posed a substantial risk to energy prices and supplies. The instability due to secession struggles in the Arab Nationalist Republics and Gulf Monarchies could lead to supply disruptions and sharp price increases. 2. Producer States Overreact To Falling Prices: This pointed to the potential for oil producer states to react poorly to falling oil prices, possibly employing repression to maintain control. Unstable global economic factors were likely to push oil prices down, shaking the economic stability of these states and potentially causing them to make difficult trade-offs. 3. Iranian Nuclear Position Comes To A Head: The article discussed how Iran's unresolved nuclear issue could affect energy markets, facing significant sanctions and pressure during its presidential elections. However, any drastic change regarding this matter was unlikely to happen in 2013. 4. Russia Goes To Internal Energy War: There was a risk in 2013 that internal battles between Russian energy companies Rosneft and Gazprom could affect energy production.  5. American Schizophrenia Sets In: The article discussed the potential for mixed consequences due to America's success with shale gas. While it created a buyer's market for gas and held potential for higher export numbers, the risk of an oversaturated market and falling prices lingered. Additionally, the quest for energy independence could affect international oil prices and dynamics. 6. Risky Rumble: G2 Failure, EU Bind: The sixth risk referred to geopolitical power vacuums, especially in the Middle East, that could pose substantial challenges to the global energy market. It pointed out a potential for conflict between the US and China, both of which were dependent on OPEC's oil.  The article did not explicitly enumerate the 7th and 8th risks, but it can be inferred that these risks involved intricacies of international politics, market fluctuations, price indexes and the challenging dynamics between supplier states, consumer states and geopolitical power-blocs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Local theatres, cinemas, schools and function rooms are open to be rented.  However, once you find it talk to the manager to make sure it's within their rules to hold a live event. Your best bet is to use a theatre, as many theatres have the option of holding a seated or standing gig and already have a PA system and stage installed; this cuts costs. There are also an increasing number of pubs dedicated to live music, these are generally around 100-300 capacity and should also have sound engineers on their books and an in-house PA. This last point is vital, if this is your first time putting on a gig, having an in-house PA not only cuts costs but means that A) this is a venue where people come often enough to warrant an in-house PA, B) the system should be set up to work with the room making your sound engineers job easier, and C) this will greatly reduce the amount of time and hassle before/after the gig as there is one less thing for you to sort out and there will only be a minimal amount of gear going in/ coming out of the venue.  (sometimes venues want a cut of the ticket sales instead, don't let them have more than 40% as that's already far too much if you have extra costs) When it's a standing gig, you can usually have a larger capacity and the public often prefer standing gigs as you can dance and mosh if it's a metal gig. People usually prefer general admission because everyone has a shot at front row for the same price. However, a seated, assigned seat gig requires less security and less hassle for you. Theatres and venues often have door staff employed, but you may need to pay extra for their services. If this is a very localized gig with few people you may be able to get some of your larger, more confident friends to do security at it. However, laws often require that you get professional security staff. Add this cost to your budget If the venue has a bar, decide whether it will be distributing alcohol or not. If it is, it must be an over-age event. Alcohol being sold may increase your insurance costs. Public Liability Insurance (PLI) may be included with the venue, but always check. 200 bucks for insurance for the night is better than a million-dollar lawsuit. All insurance companies have an option for PLI, but shop around for the best price. Also, with each gig you organize, as long as there are no accidents, the cost of your insurance will go down because you have proved you're responsible and there is less risk. Add the cost of insurance to your budget.

Problem: a sum of money at simple interest amounts to rs . 815 in 3 years and to rs . 878 in 4 years . the sum is :  Options: a ) 500 , b ) 698 , c ) 626 , d ) 910 , e ) none A:","output":"To answer the given multiple-choice question, let's first understand the relationship between the sum, interest, and the amount. We are given that a sum of money at simple interest amounts to Rs. 815 in 3 years and Rs. 878 in 4 years. Let's denote the principal amount (the sum) as P, the interest rate as R, and the time period t in years. The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * t) / 100 We can modify this formula to calculate the amount (A) at the end of the time period: A = P + SI = P + (P * R * t) / 100 We have two cases here: when t = 3 and t = 4. Case 1: t = 3, Amount (A) is Rs. 815 815 = P + (P * R * 3) / 100 Case 2: t = 4, Amount (A) is Rs. 878 878 = P + (P * R * 4) / 100 Let's subtract Case 1 from Case 2: 878 - 815 = [P + (P * R * 4) / 100] - [P + (P * R * 3) / 100] Which simplifies to: 63 = (P * R) / 100 Now, we know that the difference in years between the two cases is 1 year. This means that Rs. 63 is the simple interest earned for one year, which also specifies that the annual interest earning from the principal amount (P * R) / 100 remains constant. Therefore, we can calculate the simple interest for 3 years (the first case) by multiplying the annual interest (Rs. 63) by 3: Simple Interest for 3 years = Rs. 63 * 3 = Rs. 189 Now, we can calculate the principal amount (P) using the first case equation, where the Amount after 3 years (A) is Rs. 815: Amount (A) = P + Simple Interest P = Amount (A) - Simple Interest = Rs. (815 - 189) = Rs. 626 So, the sum of money (principal amount) is Rs. 626, which corresponds to option 'c'. The correct answer is: A: c ) 626"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

However, Saudi Arabia then accused Qatar of distorting facts about the call, and said it was ending talks. The four countries say Qatar supports terrorism - something Doha denies. The row led to all four Arab nations cutting ties with Qatar on 5 June - Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, while all four countries cut air and sea links with the country. Friday's phone call, which came after US President Donald Trump spoke separately with both sides, had initially been seen as a possible breakthrough in the crisis. The call was the first formal contact between Riyadh and Doha since the crisis began. State media on both sides reported that Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had discussed the need for dialogue to resolve the crisis. Who said what? The Saudi Press Agency said Qatar's leader had \\"expressed his desire to sit at the dialogue table and discuss the demands of the four countries\\", and that further details would be announced after Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. Meanwhile, the Qatar News Agency said the Saudi crown prince had proposed assigning \\"two envoys to resolve controversial issues in a way that does not affect the sovereignty of states\\". Shortly afterwards, Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of not being \\"serious\\" about dialogue, and said communications between the two sides would be suspended. The row appears to be over protocol - observers say Saudi Arabia is angered that Qatari state media did not make clear that the call was initiated by Doha. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE, who are blockading Qatar, have presented a list of conditions for the lifting of sanctions. They include the closure of news broadcaster Al-Jazeera and reducing ties with Iran. The group accuses the Qatari-funded channel of fostering extremism, a charge the network denies. Diplomatic efforts led by Kuwait and backed by Western powers have so far failed to end the dispute. On Friday, Mr Trump spoke with both sides, and the UAE, in an attempt to broker talks. \\"The president underscored that unity among the United States' Arab partners is essential to promoting regional stability and countering the threat of Iran,\\" the White House said in a statement. It added that \\"all countries must follow through on commitments... to defeat terrorism, cut off funding for terrorist groups and combat extremist ideology\\".","output":"Title: Qatar Crisis Talks Stalled After Accusations and Diplomatic Tensions"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nojaim, noted for her documentary \\"Control Room\\" showcasing Al-Jazeera News, was documenting the violent Tahrir Square clashes when detained by police, with her camera subsequently confiscated. Her producer, Karim Amer, revealed that he was separated from her during a barrage of tear gas. In another disturbing incident, activist Eltahawy, upon her release, reported extreme sexual assault and violence inflicted upon her while in police custody. She was detained while capturing the episodes of the protest on her camera phone when taken by the riot police who, she alleges, behaved abhorrently and subjected her to explicit groping and slanderous verbal abuse. Eltahawy stated that while detained, she suffered significant injury, with a broken right hand and left arm.  The stories of the two women could not be immediately corroborated, however, it did stoke international attention. Post the incidents, The U.S. Department of State tweeted that it was well-apprised of the reports and mentioned that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo had been in touch with authoritative personnel. These events come amidst escalating violence in Egypt, with the clashes having already claimed 37 lives according to Egypt's Health Ministry, while Elnadeem, an Egyptian human rights group has reported at least 38 dead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Joe was born in Quincy , Massachusetts on March 27 , 1929 and grew up in Somerville , Massachusetts . Joe was born on March 27 , 1929 in Quincy , Massachusetts , where he grew up in Somerville , Massachusetts . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"To determine if these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, we first need to understand the definition of a paraphrase. A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words, often aiming to simplify or clarify the original text. Now, let's analyze the two sentences: 1. \\"Joe was born in Quincy , Massachusetts on March 27 , 1929 and grew up in Somerville , Massachusetts.\\" 2. \\"Joe was born on March 27 , 1929 in Quincy , Massachusetts , where he grew up in Somerville , Massachusetts.\\" Both sentences clearly give the same information about the person named Joe: - He was born on March 27, 1929. - He was born in Quincy, Massachusetts. - He grew up in Somerville, Massachusetts. However, there is a minor ambiguity in the second sentence. It states, \\"where he grew up in Somerville, Massachusetts.\\" The term \\"where\\" often refers to the location mentioned just before it in the sentence, which would be Quincy, not Somerville. This discrepancy might cause some confusion. Despite this ambiguity, it's evident the sentences are trying to convey the same information. So, in essence, we could consider them as paraphrases with the exception of the minor ambiguity present in the second sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: Where was Manny driving?

Directed by Terence Young, the film is based on the 1957 novel of the same name by British author Ian Fleming. In the movie, Sean Connery reprises his role as the iconic British Secret Service agent, James Bond, following his debut in the series with \\"Dr. No\\" released in 1962.  In this adaptation, the story revolves around Bond's assignment to assist in the defection of Soviet consulate clerk Tatiana Romanova, played by Italian actress Daniela Bianchi. Romanova claims to have fallen in love with Bond solely based on a photograph of him, and offers to bring a highly sought-after Lektor cryptographic device to the British side if Bond personally helps her escape to the West. However, unbeknownst to M16 and Bond, this is all a trap conceived by the criminal organization SPECTRE, led by Ernst Stavro Blofeld as part of a plan to avenge the death of their operative, Dr. No.  Throughout the film, Bond comes face to face with several key SPECTRE villains, such as Rosa Klebb (played by Lotte Lenya), a former Russian agent who defected to SPECTRE and serves as Blofeld's enforcer, and the sadistic assassin Red Grant (played by Robert Shaw). The movie showcases Bond's journey through Istanbul, Turkey, and the subsequent train ride aboard the Orient Express, as he evades traps and assassination attempts in a desperate attempt to bring Romanova and the Lektor device safely to the United Kingdom.  \\"From Russia with Love\\" is often considered to be one of the best films in the entire Bond franchise due to its well-crafted script, standout performances, and memorable action scenes. The movie also incorporates key elements of the spy genre like intrigue, deception, and high-stakes situations, effectively capturing the Cold War atmosphere of the 1960s. The film's success bolstered the James Bond franchise, helping to solidify its status in popular culture and pave the way for the creation of numerous sequels and adaptations in the following years."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

To provide a more detailed analysis, it is essential first to understand the situation and the context provided. You have mentioned that you have provided an affidavit confirming the authenticity of specific written articles. An affidavit, by definition, is a sworn statement of facts that you attest to being true. It is utilized in legal proceedings as a written testimony. In this scenario, we can ascertain that these written articles are relevant to a dispute or a disagreement between two parties going through legal proceedings – the plaintiffs and the defendants. The plaintiffs are the ones who bring forth a lawsuit against another party in a legal dispute, while the defendants are the party accused or sued in a lawsuit. Moving on, you mentioned that the affidavit was provided to both parties – plaintiffs and defendants – to avoid the necessity of testifying in person. Acceptance of the affidavit by the plaintiffs and refusal by the defendants is an indication that the two parties aren't in agreement. The defendants reserve their right to cross-examination, which is a common practice in legal proceedings where the opportunity is given to one party to ask questions and scrutinize the presented evidence or testimonial by the opposing side.

Article:","output":"Title: Mysterious Disappearance of Dana Bonanno: A Concerning Delay in Police Investigation Introduction: The case of Dana Bonanno's disappearance has captured the attention of many in the Brooklyn community as well as beyond. As the details continue to unravel, the case remains shrouded in uncertainty and confusion. One of the most concerning aspects of the case is the substantial delay in police declaration for Dana as a missing person, despite the repeated calls and concern from her worried mother. Disappearance of Dana Bonanno: On July 22, Dana Bonanno, a 22-year-old woman, was last seen in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. In the days that followed, her mother grew increasingly concerned about her daughter's whereabouts and wellbeing, as she was unable to reach her directly. Despite her repeated calls and requests to the authorities, Dana Bonanno was not officially declared missing by the police until July 27, five days after her last known sighting. Dana Bonanno's mother became suspicious and concerned about the delay in the actions taken by the authorities. She voiced her worries to the media, citing that despite her numerous calls since the disappearance, no real investigation effort was made by the law enforcement officials. This has led many to question the response time and the willingness of the police to earnestly investigate missing person cases as soon as possible. Life and Involvement in Brooklyn Music Scene: Dana Bonanno was well-known and actively involved in the vibrant Brooklyn music scene. Her passion for music and the arts made her a widely recognized figure in the local community, and this brought an extensive group of friends and colleagues who were equally invested and concerned about her disappearance. The news of her missing status rapidly spread through the Brooklyn music scene and beyond, with many expressing concern and sympathy towards Dana and her family, eventually turning into a city-wide search to find her. Despite her love for music and active social life, Dana's friends and family expressed that she was a responsible and cautious person by nature—making her sudden disappearance all the more perplexing. They emphasized that it was highly out of character for her to be out of contact for such an extended period, further fueling their concerns and suspicions about what may have transpired leading to her sudden absence. Community Response and Continued Search: As the press picked up on the mysterious disappearance and the subsequent lack of timely investigation by the police, there was a widespread outpour of concern for Dana Bonanno's safety within the Brooklyn community. Community groups, friends, and family began organizing search groups and leaflet campaigns to raise awareness and gather any information about her disappearance. Social media platforms were ablaze with the hashtag #FindDana, aiming to spread the news of her missing status and support search efforts with every share and retweet. The delay in the police investigation and in declaring Dana a missing person has raised questions regarding the efficiency and attitude of the authorities towards such cases. Concerned residents and community leaders demand answers as to why there was such a significant delay in the official investigation. They emphasize the critical importance of time and rapid action in these situations, as any delay could lead to dire consequences for the missing person. Conclusion: The disappearance of Dana Bonanno has not only shed light on the inefficiencies of the police and their responsiveness but has also demonstrated the immense power of community mobilization and support. The authorities' delay in declaring Dana a missing person is both concerning and unacceptable. As the search for Dana continues, the case should serve as a wakeup call for both law enforcement and the wider community to prioritize the investigation of missing persons cases with speed, diligence, and care."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This involves gathering and examining any available documentation related to the claims, including staff complaints, incident reports, and internal communications. 2. Step two: Speaking to the whistleblower and affected staff members It is essential to have direct communication with the individual who brought forward the allegations and any staff members that have been affected by the bullying. This will help provide a more accurate understanding of the situation and gather insights into the internal dynamics and work culture at the hospital trust. Addressing the Fear of Speaking Out: 3. Step three: Ensuring a safe and supportive environment It is important to create an environment in which staff feels safe and comfortable coming forward with concerns. This can be achieved by establishing an anonymous reporting system and offering reassurance that all complaints will be treated confidentially. 4. Step four: Implementing proactive measures to prevent future incidents To prevent any future instances of bullying or harassment, hospital trust executives should closely monitor the work environment and implement training programs to teach staff members about identifying, reporting, and responding to incidents of this nature. Taking Action: 5. Step five: Holding those responsible accountable If the investigation proves that bullying exists within the hospital trust, it will be crucial to hold the responsible individuals accountable for their actions. This may include disciplinary action, reassignment or termination, depending on the severity of the incident. 6. Step six: Offering support and resources to affected staff Hospital trust executives should offer support and resources to those affected by the bullying, including counselling services and opportunities to discuss the situation with independent parties for advice. Conclusion: Melanie Onn's call for a thorough investigation into the alleged bullying incidents at the hospital trust highlights the importance of creating and maintaining a safe and supportive work environment for all employees. If hospital trust executives follow her recommendations, they can foster a workplace where staff members feel comfortable sharing concerns and confident that those responsible for inappropriate behavior will be held accountable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After last year's fabulous 'Belly Of The Beast'(directed by Ching Siu Tung), I figured there was no way I could be disappointed. I was wrong. Lord Steven is just looking sick in this movie. He's bloated and his hair is extra nappy. The action is pretty weak and the script pathetic. But the worst part is that at least fifty percent of Lord Steven's dialogue has been dubbed over by someone(I'm pretty sure its the main bad guy in the film)else's voice, who sounds nothing like Seagal.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What can large amounts of water do to wood?\\" is in \\"The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"Large amounts of water can have a significant impact on wood, affecting both its physical properties and overall integrity. When wood is exposed to high levels of water content, it becomes softer and more pliable. This can be compared to the softening effects of water on materials such as rawhide, paper, or cloth. As the water content increases, so does the extent of its softening impact on wood. Water exposure can lead to numerous changes in wood's structure and properties. Some of these effects include: 1. Swelling: When wood absorbs water, it swells and expands. This swelling can cause distortions in the wood's shape, leading to warping, bowing, or cupping. As wood dries, it may also shrink unevenly and lead to further deformations. 2. Rot and Decay: Prolonged exposure to moisture creates an environment conducive to the growth of fungi and bacteria, which can cause wood to rot and decay. This process weakens the wood's structural integrity, leading to damage or even collapse of the wooden structure. 3. Discoloration: Water exposure can cause discoloration and staining of wood. Tannins, natural compounds present in wood, can leach out when in contact with water, resulting in dark, unsightly stains. Watermarks can also form on the wood's surface due to water absorption and evaporation. 4. Mold and Mildew growth: High levels of moisture promote the growth of mold and mildew on the surface of wood. Mold can cause discoloration and an unpleasant odor, and it may also pose potential health risks. 5. Weakening of joints and fasteners: When wood absorbs water, it can lead to the weakening and loosening of joints and fasteners holding wooden structures together. This can compromise the structural strength and stability of wooden structures, such as furniture and buildings. 6. Delamination: Water exposure can also cause wood veneers and laminates to separate from their substrate, resulting in delamination or peeling. 7. Finish degradation: Prolonged exposure to water can also cause damage to wood finishes, like paint, varnish, or stain. This may result in peeling, cracking, or fading of the finish, which not only affects the wood's appearance but also diminishes its protection against further water damage. To mitigate these potential problems, it's essential to prevent excessive moisture exposure to wood and maintain proper water content levels within acceptable ranges. One can achieve this through protective treatments, adequate ventilation, and moisture management in the surrounding environment. Regular maintenance and inspection of wooden structures can also help to detect water-related issues at an early stage, allowing for timely intervention and repairs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: In sponges, how do blastula develop into a new sponge? Is \\"In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Step 1: Understand the task The user is asking for the process by which blastula develop into a new sponge in sponges and whether the provided answer is correct or not. We need to verify and provide a comprehensive explanation. Step 2: Research the development process in sponges Sponges have a unique development process for their larvae. Specifically, they undergo metamorphosis from blastula stage to mature sponge. Step 3: Verify the provided answer The provided answer states that \\"In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge.\\" This statement is partially correct but lacks a detailed explanation of the developmental process. Step 4: Provide a complete answer In sponges, the development process starts with fertilization which leads to the formation of a zygote. The zygote undergoes multiple rounds of cell division to form a blastula. The blastula is a hollow, spherical structure containing flagellated cells called choanocytes on the surface, which help the blastula to swim in the water in search of a suitable location to settle down. Once a suitable location is found, the blastula larva undergoes a process called gastrulation, during which the hollow structure inverts and the cells rearrange to form three distinct layers: the outermost layer called the ectoderm, the middle layer called the mesohyl, and the innermost layer called the endoderm. Throughout the process, cells continue to differentiate and specialize. As the developing larva further matures, it starts developing structures like canal systems for filtering water, osculum for expelling water, and choanocytes for capturing food particles. These processes eventually lead to the formation of a new, fully-functional sponge. Step 5: Finalize the response In sponges, the blastula develop into a new sponge through a series of developmental stages. Starting as a zygote, the embryo transforms into a blastula which swims to a new location using its flagellated choanocytes. Upon finding a suitable location, the blastula undergoes gastrulation to form three distinct layers and then continues to develop specialized structures and tissue layers. Ultimately, this process results in the formation of a fully-functional, mature sponge. The provided statement is partially correct, but the above explanation covers the complete developmental process in sponges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why is that? - strong odor - age well - salad dressing - flavor - age to get better  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is: age well and flavor.  Leaving the cheese in the cellar for a few years allows it to age well, which enhances its flavor and texture. The cellar provides the perfect environment for the cheese to mature, as it typically has a consistent temperature, high humidity, and minimal light exposure. As the cheese ages, its flavor profile develops and becomes deeper, richer, and more complex. This process also tends to create a firmer and more crumbly texture in many types of cheese. Therefore, John was told to leave the cheese in the cellar to achieve a better and more flavorful cheese through the aging process. Note that the strong odor is not the primary reason, but may be a byproduct of the aging process in certain cheese varieties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Background: Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma (Zulu: [gelZhejile'kisa 'zhuma]; born 12 April 1942) is a South African politician who served as the fourth President of South Africa from the 2009 general election until his resignation on 14 February 2018. Zuma is also referred to by his initials JZ and his clan name Msholozi. Zuma served as Deputy President of South Africa from 1999 to 2005, but was dismissed by President Thabo Mbeki in 2005 after Zuma's financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, was convicted of soliciting a bribe for Zuma. Zuma was nonetheless elected President of the African National Congress (ANC) on 18 December 2007 after defeating Mbeki at the ANC conference in Polokwane. Context: Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit and applied to the Constitutional Court to appeal Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson's ruling:  It was improper for the court to make such far-reaching \\"vexatious, scandalous and prejudicial\\" findings concerning me, to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter. The interests of justice, in my respectful submission would demand that the matter be rectified. These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC - a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years. I fear that if not rectified, I might suffer further prejudice.  Tlali Tlali, National Prosecuting Authority spokesman, stated by phone from Pretoria, on 23 September, \\"We have received the papers. It's under consideration.\\"  The judgement for the appeal was handed down on 12 January 2009 at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to rule on two aspects of the appeal. The first aspect was whether or not Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before they decided to reinstate charges of bribery and corruption against him. The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in implying political meddling by the then President Thabo Mbeki with regards to the NPA's decision to charge Zuma.  On the question of the NPA's obligation to invite representations when reviewing decisions, Harms DP found that Nicholson's interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution was incorrect in that the NPA did not have such an obligation and thus was free to have charged Zuma as it did. On the question of Nicholson's inferences of political meddling by Mbeki, Harms DP found that the lower court \\"overstepped the limits of its authority\\". Question: Did these findings cause any further problems? Answer:","output":"Yes, the findings of the Supreme Court of Appeal did lead to further problems and consequences for both Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki, as well as for the political landscape of South Africa. Following the ruling, a series of events unfolded that impacted various aspects of South African politics, primarily the African National Congress (ANC) party, and created tensions within the administration. 1. Impact on Jacob Zuma:  Although Deputy Judge President Louis Harms ruled that the NPA did not have the obligation to invite representations when reviewing decisions, this did not stop the charges of bribery and corruption against Zuma from continuing. In addition to his legal struggles, Zuma's reputation was further tarnished, affecting public confidence in his ability to lead the country. 2. Impact on Thabo Mbeki: The Supreme Court of Appeal's ruling, which stated that Judge Nicholson had \\"overstepped the limits of his authority\\" in implying political meddling by Mbeki, did not help in repairing Mbeki's image. The damage had been done, and the negative perception of political interference by Mbeki persisted. As a result, his political career was severely impacted when he was recalled by the ANC, leading to his resignation as President of South Africa before the end of his term. 3. Impact on the ANC: The legal proceedings and political infighting between Zuma and Mbeki supporters within the ANC caused a significant split in the party, affecting its unity and stability. Many members were forced to choose sides in this political battle, which weakened the party as a whole and impacted its ability to effectively govern the country. 4. Impact on South African politics: The rivalry between Zuma and Mbeki, as well as the legal troubles involving the highest office of the land, led to increased political uncertainty in South Africa. This not only impacted investor confidence in the country but also diverted attention away from crucial issues such as economic development, poverty, and inequality. In summary, the findings of the Supreme Court of Appeal further complicated the already tense political situation in South Africa. The ruling had a domino effect on Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki's political careers and reputations, disrupted the unity and stability of the ANC, and contributed to the deterioration of South Africa's political climate. This, in turn, had far-reaching consequences on the overall governance and development of the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Former general easing back into public life with charity work. Petraeus will also become a visiting professor at NY school. Just six months after resigning as director of the CIA, David Petraeus is returning to the public eye. Once a national hero for saving the United States from humiliation during his 2007-2008 stint as the commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Petraeus resigned as CIA director in disgrace in November after revealing an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell. The affair that doomed his career in government began when Broadwell was researching and writing a book titled 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,' which Rolling Stone referred to as 'slobberific' and 'so one-sided that it is almost supernaturally dull.' Scroll down for video... Out in public: Petraeus worked out on Venice Beach with veterans last month. Laying low: David Petraeus resigned from the Central Intelligence Agency in November. Petraeus resigned as CIA director after the FBI learned of his affair with Broadwell. In what is being seen as a return to public life, Petraeus will serve as a visiting. professor of public policy at CUNY's Macaulay Honors College. His. employment begins on the 1st August.

Petraeus will likely have the easiest time of the three. He was a widely respected general whose affair may have hurt his family and his career, but he did not lie about it and resigned immediately when it came to light. According to Buzzfeed people around Petraeus say he's been thinking hard about how to manage his comeback, his image, and his new role outside national security. Petraeus has always been famous both for his intelligence and for his ability to manage the press, and he has signaled that he has thought hard about his predicament. Petraeus met Broadwell when she was a graduate student at Harvard University and working on a dissertation about him.

Although Petraeus is better known for his accomplishments the battlefield, he graduated in the top five percent of his class at military academy. Last month he made a speech at the University of Southern California where he apologized to those he'd hurt with his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 'I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago,' he said. 'I know that I can never fully assuage the pain that I inflicted on those closest to me and on a number of others,' Petraeus said, according to news reports. 'I can, however, try to move forward in a manner that is consistent with the values to which I subscribed before slipping my moorings and, as best as possible, to make amends to those I have hurt and let down' He has signaled he’s ready to move on: 'One learns after all that life doesn't stop with such a mistake. It can and must go on.' He is also dealing with a lingering investigation as to whether he inappropriately shared secret documents with Broadwell. FBI agents reportedly visited his home earlier this month. The former Iraq and Afghanistan commander is showing savviness on mounting a return to public life. He has chosen to work with a charity that helps American veterans reintegrate into daily life. All for charity: CIA director David Petraeus¿ new gig.

While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan. Cucuy, however, is promptly killed by Chambers while El Mariachi escapes from captivity and calls his friends Lorenzo and Fideo to assist him in his mission., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person that the CIA agent assigns the AFN operative to follow is Barillo. In the article, it is mentioned that AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands (the CIA agent) to tail Barillo. Armando Barillo is a Mexican drug lord who has hired General Emiliano Marquez to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Context: Participation rates in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are rather low. We evaluated the interest of first degree relatives (FDR) of CRC patients to participate in a colonoscopy screening and compared the findings to controls with a negative family history.', 'There were 235 CRC patients diagnosed in our centre in 1984-2001. These were mailed an invitation letter for a preventive examination for their FDR older than 40 years and a questionnaire about occurrence of malignancies in their family. Colonoscopy was performed in 52 FDR and sex/age matched controls.', 'The questionnaire was delivered to 196 patients. Thirty four (17.3%) patients responded. Positive family history for CRC was reported in 12/34 (35.3%) patients, compared to expected 3.4 patients (p = 0.04; OR 4.2; 95% CI = 1.05-17.89). Fifty two of 94 (55.3%) FDR participated in a screening and CRC was diagnosed in 2 and CRA in 18 patients compared to 1 CRC and 9 CRA in control group (p = 0.04; Kaplan-Meier p = 0.04). Answer: Positive family history seems to be a motivation factor for a participation in a CRC screening program. Consistent with previous studies the prevalence of CRA and CRC was significantly higher in the group of FDR compared to controls (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 20).

Are there any supplements out there that actually burn belly fat and lower body fat? Are there any herbal supplements that burn fat? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"To complete this task, I will first research and find information about supplements that may help burn belly fat and lower body fat. Then, I will look into herbal supplements that may help burn fat. Finally, I will analyze the questions and determine if they are paraphrases of each other. Step 1: Research supplements that burn belly fat and lower body fat After doing some research, there are a few supplements that have been suggested to potentially help with burning belly fat and lowering body fat. They include: 1. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA): Studies show mixed results, but CLA may help to reduce body fat in some individuals. 2. Green Tea Extract: Contains EGCG, which has been shown to increase the metabolic rate and support fat oxidation. 3. Caffeine: Can boost metabolism and help the body break down fat, but its effectiveness may decrease over time as the body builds a tolerance. 4. Garcinia Cambogia: Studies have suggested it may help with fat loss, but more research is needed. 5. Glucomannan: A natural fiber supplement that can help promote feelings of fullness, which may lead to reduced calorie intake and weight loss. However, it's important to note that the efficacy of these supplements is not universally agreed upon, and the best way to lose belly fat and lower body fat is through regular exercise and a healthy diet. Step 2: Research herbal supplements that burn fat Certain herbal supplements may help with fat burning. Some of these include: 1. Green Tea Extract 2. Cayenne Pepper 3. Taraxacum (Dandelion) 4. Yohimbine (from Yohimbe tree bark) 5. Ginger 6. Forskolin (from Coleus forskohlii) 7. Fucoxanthin (from brown seaweed) Again, it's important to note that the effectiveness of these herbal supplements may vary between individuals, and a healthy diet and exercise routine are crucial components of any fat loss program. Step 3: Analyze the questions and determine if they are paraphrases of each other The first question asks about supplements that help burn belly fat and lower body fat, while the second question asks about herbal supplements that burn fat. Although both questions are related to fat-burning supplements, they are not direct paraphrases of each other.  The first question is specifically asking about supplements to address belly fat and lower body fat, while the second question is focused on herbal supplements and does not mention belly fat or lower body fat specifically."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: MOSCOW — Russia has taken another major step toward restricting its once freewheeling Internet, as President Vladimir V. Putin quietly signed a new law requiring popular online voices to register with the government, a measure that lawyers, Internet pioneers and political activists said Tuesday would give the government a much wider ability to track who said what online.      Mr. Putin’s action on Monday, just weeks after he disparaged the Internet as “a special C.I.A. project,” borrowed a page from the restrictive Internet playbooks of many governments around the world that have been steadily smothering online freedoms they once tolerated.      The idea that the Internet was at best controlled anarchy and beyond any one nation’s control is fading globally amid determined attempts by more and more governments to tame the web. If innovations like Twitter were hailed as recently as the Arab uprisings as the new public square, governments like those in China, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran and now Russia are making it clear that they can deploy their tanks on virtual squares, too.      China, long a pioneer in using sophisticated technology to filter the Internet, has continually tightened censorship. It has banned all major Western online social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google, though it seems not to be bothered by Alibaba, its homegrown e-commerce site, which has filed the paperwork for what could be the biggest public stock offering ever. ||||| Story highlights Putin signs off on new law banning swearing in music, film and books      Under the law, individuals and businesses can be fined for using foul language      It covers live arts and entertainment performances, including plays and concerts      New films containing swear words won't get a distribution certificate      Thinking about making a film? Better leave out the foul language if you want it to be seen in Russia. The same goes for plays. Even rock stars will need to leave their potty mouths at home.      Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on a new law Monday that bans swearing at arts, cultural and entertainment events in the country.      Any new film containing obscene language won't be granted a distribution certificate, so there's no chance of seeing it at the movie theater.      And copies of books, CDs or films containing swearing can only be distributed in a sealed package labeled \\"Contains obscene language,\\" a Kremlin statement said.      According to state news agency ITAR-Tass, individuals caught using foul language face a fine of up to 70, while officials can be fined up to 40 and businesses nearly 1,400. They face a higher fine and a three-month suspension of business for repeated offenses.      JUST WATCHED Russia's president annexes ... words Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH New Russian law bans U.S. adoptions 03:07      Determination of what counts as profane language will be done through \\"an independent examination,\\" the news agency said.      According to the Kremlin, the legislation \\"bans the use of obscene language when ensuring the rights of Russian citizens to the use of the state language, and protecting and developing language culture.\\"      The law could come into effect as soon as July 1, ITAR-Tass said, but it doesn't apply to cultural and artistic works that have already been issued.      While some may hail attempts to clean up the nation's language, it will likely be seen by critics as the latest step under Putin's leadership to limit freedom of expression and promote a conservative, nationalist viewpoint.      A report by rights group Amnesty International in January highlighted a denial of \\"basic freedoms\\" in Russia, which last year introduced a law barring anyone from talking positively about homosexuality in earshot of minors. ||||| Putin's Internet Plan Requires 'Sharing' With Security Services      i itoggle caption Alexey Nikolsky/RIO Novosti/Kremlin pool/EPA/Landov Alexey Nikolsky/RIO Novosti/Kremlin pool/EPA/Landov      Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new measure that will give the government much greater control over the Internet.      Critics say the law is aimed at silencing opposition bloggers and restricting what people can say on social media. It would also force international email providers and social networks to make their users' information available to the Russian security services.      Putin sent a chill through many Internet users late last month with this comment at a media forum: \\"You do know that it all began initially, when the Internet first appeared, as a special CIA project. And this is the way it is developing.\\"      I think anything that's published in a blog, that's not to the authorities' liking, can be used against the person who writes the blog.      Putin said Americans set the system up so that everything would go through servers in the United States, where intelligence agencies could monitor it.      The president's statement came as Russia's parliament was working on a package of bills that would place restrictions on bloggers and websites.      Bloggers Must Register      \\"The objective of those laws is to block the Russian Internet from the rest of the world,\\" says Anton Nosik, a popular blogger, \\"and to shut down the biggest foreign social networks, to block access to foreign social networks for Russian users, and to establish control over networks that are physically based in Russia.\\"      One key provision of the law, which is scheduled to take effect in August, would require bloggers to register with the government if their blogs receive more than 3,000 hits a day.      Registered bloggers would then be treated like mass media and required to certify the factual accuracy of the information in their blogs, but they wouldn't have the same protections and privileges as other journalists.      One of the leading sponsors of the law, Irina Yarovaya, made it clear what lawmakers are aiming for — an end to anonymity on the Internet in Russia.      \\"In principle, anonymity is always deception,\\" she said in an interview earlier this year. \\"It's a wish to mislead someone. I can't see any reason to raise lying to [the status of] a human virtue or an understanding of what freedom is.\\"      The law also gives the government new grounds to press charges against bloggers, including \\"defamation\\" and \\"inciting hatred.\\"      New Restrictions For Social Networks      Journalist Kirill Martynov says these rather vaguely defined offenses could make it impossible to express meaningful opinions.      \\"I can't incite hatred toward fascists, for example, or I can't criticize police officers,\\" Martynov says. \\"I think anything that's published in a blog, that's not to the authorities' liking, can be used against the person who writes the blog.\\"      Another provision of the law prohibits revealing information about citizens' homes and their personal or family lives. Critics say that provision could be used against anti-corruption bloggers who have revealed embarrassing details about undeclared bank accounts and luxurious homes owned by public officials.      Finally, Nosik notes that the law says that all email providers and social networks must store information about users, their posts and their email on servers in Russia.      \\"This is what Russian authorities traditionally request from local platforms, and they are always given that information,\\" he says. \\"I doubt it strongly that Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, or other Google services will ever comply. And if they don't comply, they have to be blocked. That's what the law says.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new law that requires popular online voices to register with the government. This will help the government track who says what online. They are trying to control what people say on the internet, especially on social media.

This indicates that they dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to the task, showing their commitment to working hard. 2. The premise also mentions they cross-checked autobiographies, which is a diligent method of verifying the information being documented. Cross-checking implies rigor and accuracy, as they were not just pulling information from one source but comparing multiple sources to confirm that the data aligned. 3. The statement \\"we'd taken great care compiling a history\\" further supports their dedication to creating an accurate document. Taking great care implies that they were attentive and thorough in their approach. 4.

Summarize: If you want to make your fabric a particular size, place the vinyl over an object that’s as large as you want it to be. If you’re stretching vinyl out for a specific reason, such as to reupholster a piece of furniture, place the fabric on top of the object in question. If you’d like, you can place your vinyl over the object in question before heating it up. To stretch out your vinyl, grab 1 end of the fabric with your fingers and slowly pull it toward yourself. If you’re working with firm 2-way vinyl, feel free to use a lot of force while pulling. If you’re stretching thin 4-way vinyl, pull carefully to avoid tearing the fabric. If necessary, hold the other side of the vinyl down with a bar clamp or ask a friend to keep it in place. As your vinyl stretches, it may develop small, unappealing wrinkles. To remove these, simply press down on the fabric with your fingers and smooth them out. If you’re stretching the vinyl over a specific object, make sure to press out any creases or air bubbles that form. Over time, your vinyl will cool down and become harder to manipulate. If this happens while you’re stretching it out, grab your heat gun and run it over the material again. Do not press your heat gun to the vinyl fabric. If you do, you may damage the vinyl itself as well as the material underneath. If your vinyl starts to overstretch, make small incisions along the edges of the fabric with a pair of scissors or a precision knife. This will give you the ability to pull on 1 portion of the fabric without affecting the other parts.  Only use this technique on pieces of fabric where the edges won’t be visible, such as vinyl upholstery. If you’re pulling the vinyl around an object with curves, you may need to cut the fabric to help it better fit the object’s shape. If you’re using your vinyl to reupholster an object, you’ll need to secure the material to keep it from peeling off. To do so, pull the fabric as tight as you can and hold it down to the object. Then, use a staple gun to shoot staples into the vinyl fabric.  Place staples between 1 and 2 in (2.5 and 5.1 cm) apart around the entire perimeter of the object. When finished, you should have a long line of evenly spaced staples. If necessary, ask a friend to hold the fabric down or use a bar clamp to keep it in place while you staple it.","output":"To resize and stretch vinyl fabric for a specific item or purpose, like reupholstering furniture, follow these steps: 1. Place the vinyl over the object that you want to cover, ensuring it's the desired size. You can heat the vinyl before placing it over the object if preferred. 2. Gently pull the vinyl towards yourself, using more force for firm 2-way vinyl and careful pulling for thin 4-way vinyl. This helps prevent tearing. 3. Use a bar clamp or a friend's assistance to hold the other side of the vinyl in place while stretching. This ensures even stretching. 4. Smooth out any wrinkles, creases, or air bubbles with your fingers to give the fabric a polished appearance. 5. If the vinyl cools down and becomes harder to manipulate, use a heat gun to warm up the material, being careful not to press the heat gun against the vinyl to avoid damage. 6. In case of overstretching, make small incisions along the edges of the fabric with scissors or a precision knife, allowing you to stretch one part without affecting the others. This technique should be used only when the edges won't be visible, such as in upholstery. 7. For objects with curves, you may need to cut the fabric to help it fit the shape better. 8. To secure the vinyl fabric to the object, pull it tight and hold it down. Use a staple gun to attach the fabric by placing staples 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart around the object's entire perimeter, achieving an even line of staples. 9. Enlist the help of a friend or use a bar clamp to hold the fabric in place while stapling, ensuring a secure and tight fit. By following these steps, you can effectively stretch and resize vinyl fabric for different purposes, ensuring a smooth and polished finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It features a fictional narrative with science fiction elements, revolving around an alien-human hybrid and the efforts to stop her from continuing her species. The cast includes Robin Dunne, Robert Knepper, Sunny Mabrey, Amelia Cooke, and John Paul Pitoc. Natasha Henstridge, who starred in the earlier films as the character Eve, also makes a brief appearance.  A science documentary, on the other hand, is a non-fiction film that aims to educate and inform the audience about scientific phenomena, discoveries, and advancements. These films usually feature interviews with experts, real-life footage, and explanations of various scientific concepts and principles.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Critical thinking is an important skill that can increase students' ability to learn in any situation. This can be applied to traditional education, or directly in a career related role. Many teachers find it such a valuable skill that they give their students a critical thinking question every day. Developing this ability can mean the difference between \\"just passing a course\\" and \\"understanding the material well enough\\" so that what students learn from _ will follow them throughout their life. Some characteristics of a critical thinker that teachers should encourage are; -asking questions as a reaction to something read or discussed; -determining the \\"deeper meaning\\" of a particular passage or topic; -providing input and opinions to topics as a direct result of analysis and research; -reasoning in an effort to develop an argument of your own opinion. It is important for a student to understand more than definition . One way to truly understand an idea is to have hands-on practice, and to apply concepts learned in a textbook. Such \\"mini-examples\\" will interest a student and improve their understanding of a topic. This is how life-long skills can be developed. Teachers that use critical thinking practices in the classroom can \\"go above and beyond\\" by asking questions that promote a greater comprehension of the material. Instructors should be able to challenge students and create an environment where they are analyzing material and gaining a better understanding. This will make the classroom move in a direction for learning. It can also help students to stay interested in the course material, as they always have a new concept to consider. At the same time, students benefit greatly from developing critical thinking skills. When learned early on, these skills can be used throughout their college education. Students can understand how to consider a topic, analyze it, and discuss it from different points of view. These are skills that will benefit them when they are part of the workforce as well. Options: A Teachers. B Parents. C Examines. D Headmasters. Answer: A Teachers.

To know the total coverage of the city with roads in miles, we need some more information like how big the city is, how many roads it has, and how long the roads are. The example I gave you earlier was just about two roads crossing at a place called Xinjiekou in a city. Imagine the roads are like the lines we draw on a paper. To find out how many roads cover the whole city, we need to know more about those lines and the size of the paper, which is like the city. Once we have that information, we can add up the lengths of all those lines (roads) to find the total coverage. So, if you can provide me with more details about the city and its roads, I can surely help you find the answer!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices:  - pollinating seeds  - fertilizing them  - protecting them  - spreading seeds  A: Answer:","output":"Fruit-eating bats receive food from plants and, in return, help these plants primarily by spreading seeds. They do so by consuming the fruits and later dispersing the seeds through their droppings (guano). This process of seed dispersal is essential for maintaining the reproductive cycle and overall health of various plant species, especially those found in tropical and subtropical regions. In addition to seed dispersal, fruit-eating bats can also contribute to the pollination of plants. While they are not as effective as nectar-feeding bats in this process, their fur and bodies can become covered in pollen as they forage from plant to plant, facilitating some degree of pollination. However, their primary role in helping plants remains focused on seed dispersal. To provide a more comprehensive answer, let's explore each of the choices in detail: 1. Pollinating seeds: Although fruit-eating bats are not primarily responsible for pollinating plants, they can still contribute indirectly to the process. As already mentioned, when they feed on fruits, some pollen may get stuck to their fur or bodies, and as they move between plants, pollen can get transferred, resulting in cross-pollination. 2. Fertilizing them: Fertilization is not a direct result of fruit-eating bats' interaction with plants. However, their droppings can serve as a natural fertilizer by adding essential nutrients to the soil, which benefits plant growth indirectly. After consuming fruits, the bats expel seeds through their guano, which then decomposes and releases nutrients back into the soil. 3. Protecting them: Fruit-eating bats do not specifically protect plants from any external threats like predators or diseases. Their primary interaction with plants is through consuming fruits and facilitating seed dispersal. 4. Spreading seeds (Primary role): As mentioned earlier, fruit-eating bats play a crucial role in seed dispersal. They eat fruits from a variety of plant species, digest the soft pulp, and later excrete the undigested seeds away from the parent plant. This process enables the seeds to germinate in a new location, preventing overcrowding and competition for resources and promoting genetic diversity among plant populations. Due to their ability to travel long distances, fruit-eating bats are highly efficient at spreading seeds across vast areas. In conclusion, fruit-eating bats mainly help plants by spreading seeds, although they can contribute to pollination and fertilization indirectly through their foraging habits and guano. These bats play a critical ecological role by assisting in the maintenance and propagation of plant species within their habitat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes. Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina.

This article: The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism.

An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity  \\".  www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase  . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount   of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home.

Write a title for this article: WILLIAMSTOWN — In the 1970s and 1980s, there may have been no more important playwright in America than Sam Shepard, who somehow also found time during those years to cut a pretty fair swath as a movie star. But in recent years he has seemed to dip below the theatrical horizon. Now comes Williamstown Theatre Festival’s new production of Shepard’s “Fool for Love,’’ directed by Daniel Aukin, and it’s doubly welcome: as a reminder of the playwright’s groundbreaking voice and unsparing vision, and as a showcase for Sam Rockwell and Nina Arianda, who seem utterly at home in Shepard country as they face off in the play’s volatile dance of memory and desire. About that broken ground, though: In the three decades since “Fool for Love’’ premiered, the culture has made such a reflexive habit of traveling to dark Shepardian places — hello there, HBO — that the revelation at the heart of the play no longer seems as shocking as it once did. Shepard has always been preoccupied with the American West — as a place, an idea, a corroded myth — and this is a case where settlers have muscled in on the pioneer’s territory. But emulation is not the same as replication. It’s hard to match Shepard’s singular effects of language and tone, his ability to create characters who are specific yet elusive, and his knack for blending gritty realism and the ongoing sense that we’re inside a kind of hallucination. Absorbing though the Williamstown production consistently is, though, “Fool for Love’’ registers today as a surprisingly fragmentary work; at 75 minutes, it’s over too soon. Strangely, or perhaps not, we want to spend more time in the company of Eddie and May, two ex-lovers who have the stormiest imaginable reunion. Not that the prefix “ex’’ fits comfortably in the context of a relationship as long-running and mysterious as that between Rockwell’s Eddie, a laconic and enigmatic rodeo stuntman, and Arianda’s May, who’s working as a cook while staying in a dingy motel room on the outskirts of the Mojave Desert. From the opening moments of “Fool for Love,’’ when May wordlessly wraps her arms around Eddie’s legs and won’t let go, it’s clear that theirs is a mutually obsessive, all-devouring passion. But it’s not long before other kinds of passion — jealousy, recriminations — begin to flare. Much of the heat is generated by May, who is furious at Eddie’s apparent dalliance with a wealthy woman she witheringly refers to as “the Countess.’’ Eddie wants May back. “You know we’re connected, May,’’ he says, adding cryptically: “We’ll always be connected. That was decided a long time ago.’’ May wants to rewrite that script (“You’re like a disease to me,’’ she tells him), and besides, she’s got a date with a nice local fellow named Martin (Christopher Abbott, excellent). To May’s deep annoyance, Eddie draws Martin into their psychodrama. Yep, it’s clearly time for May to move on. If only she could. There is one other character: the Old Man, portrayed by Gordon Joseph Weiss, who sits in a corner of the motel room, observing the action and periodically addressing Eddie and May. He lives only in their minds, but he’s a crucial figure when it comes to understanding the exact nature of their relationship. Director Aukin conjures a bleakly claustrophobic atmosphere and adds small touches that escalate the tension and keep the audience on edge (we know that the potential for violence is always ticking away just below the surface in a Shepard play). Whenever Eddie slams the motel room door shut, it resounds like a nerve-rattling thunderclap. The performances by Arianda and Rockwell are all the more impressive when you consider they only stepped into the roles a little over a month ago, after Lauren Ambrose (“Six Feet Under’’) and Chris Pine (“Star Trek’’) dropped out, citing scheduling conflicts. Anyone who saw Arianda’s blazing, Tony Award-winning performance in David Ives’s “Venus in Fur’’ knows that the wilder the material, the more she ups her game. In “Fool for Love,’’ the actress delivers an intensely compelling portrait of a woman tearing at the boundaries of her own life. She offers us piercing glimpses, too, of May’s vulnerability and confusion, defeat and resiliency. Rockwell’s portrayal of Eddie is so natural and self-assured that at one point the actor effortlessly executes a forward split at center stage, apparently just for the hell of it, then bounds back to his feet. Eddie carries himself like the Marlboro Man, but this cowboy’s West is a shrunken one: When he tosses his lasso, all he’s roping is a bedpost. When it comes to the tangled intersections of their personal histories, May, Eddie, and the Old Man all get to have their say. Indeed, they all aggressively insist on it. In the fierce contest of wills waged on the blasted landscape of “Fool for Love,’’ control of the story may be the only prize left.","output":"Title: \\"Fool for Love: A Fiery Reunion of Love and Desire at Williamstown Theatre Festival\\""},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow, the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur \\"Joyful Noise\\" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at the same time as the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever. Vi Rose has a son, Walter, who has Asperger syndrome, and a talented, pretty and ready-to-date daughter, Olivia. But Olivia is not ready to date under her mother's household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy. A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny. At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who kept private the nature of her illness until after her death? ?  Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United... Answer:","output":"Ferrier"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. There, an addictive new drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\" has been introduced, which slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. By breaching a damaged outer wall, the Judges become able to call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb (Warrick Grier) to confirm the Judges' deaths, but when they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson intervenes and uses her psychic abilities to read Kay's mind and learn that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo... My question: What is Madeline Madrigal also known as?

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the same mistake as the music industry","output":"The phrase \\"the same mistake as the music industry\\" is generally considered to have a negative connotation. To fully understand and interpret this phrase, let's dissect its components and historical context. 1. Context and meaning: On its own, the phrase is somewhat ambiguous, and the meaning depends on the context in which it is used. When it refers to \\"the same mistake,\\" it implies there is an error in judgment or an oversight that had previously occurred in the music industry. When this comparison is made in any scenario, it typically represents a negative repercussion that could occur again, this time to the subject it is being compared to. 2. Music industry background: The music industry has faced several challenges and controversies over time. Among these challenges are piracy, loss of revenue, changing listening habits, and an ongoing battle to adapt to the digital age. Many of these issues emerged with the advent of online file-sharing platforms like the now-defunct Napster, which facilitated illegal music downloads, causing significant financial losses for artists and record labels. 3. Lesson learned: The music industry's slow response to adapt to the changing landscape led to lost opportunities and considerable damage to its business models. It serves as an example of what can happen to industries and organizations that fail to adapt and change promptly in the face of new challenges and technologies. 4. Applying this phrase: When someone says \\"the same mistake as the music industry,\\" they are likely referring to a situation where a person or organization is failing to recognize or adapt to changes in the environment or is at risk of facing similar negative consequences. It serves as a warning that being unprepared for change or unable to pivot in the dynamic market can lead to undesirable results and potentially significant losses. In conclusion, the phrase \\"the same mistake as the music industry\\" holds a negative connotation, primarily due to the music industry's historical struggles and mistakes. The phrase is often used as a warning or as a reference to the potential consequences of not learning from past mistakes or adjusting to new changes quickly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Poland's foreign minister has allegedly been caught on tape comparing his country's relationship with the U.S. as like giving oral sex for nothing in return. Radek Sikorski is said to have made the controversial remarks during a private conversation with Jacek Rostowski, an MP and former finance minister, after they were published by influential news magazine Wprost. In a short transcript of the conversation, a person identified as Sikorski also says Poland's strong alliance with the U.S. was worthless and 'even harmful because it creates a false sense of security.' Controversy: Radek Sikorski (pictured) is said to have made the controversial remarks during a private conversation with Jacek Rostowski, former finance minister, which was published by news magazine Wprost. 'The Polish-American alliance is not. worth anything. It’s even damaging, because it creates a false sense of. security in Poland,' Sikorski allegedly said in a translation by Russia Today. 'Complete. bulls***,' the tape purportedly records Sikorski as saying. 'We will. get a conflict with both Russians and Germans, and we’re going to think. that everything is great, because we gave the Americans a blow***. Suckers. Total suckers.' He. allegedly goes on to criticise Poles as naive, in the latest recorded. revelation from magazine Wprost to rattle Prime Minister Donald Tusk's. government. 'The problem in. Poland is that we have a very shallow pride and low self-esteem,' he. allegedly said, decrying such a mindset as 'Murzyńskość', a. racially-charged pejorative term that could be translated as 'thinking. like a negro.' Sikorski suggested on Twitter the translation should be. 'negritude,' linking it to the anti-colonialism movement in Europe,. according to Russia Today. Kerry on as normal: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, speaks during a press conference last year after talks with Sikorski, right, in Warsaw, Poland. The. Foreign Ministry declined to comment, but did not deny that Sikorski made. the remarks. Government spokesman Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska said. officials would only comment after the recording is published in full. Wprost has only provided a transcript of excerpts of the conversation, which it said was recorded in the spring. The magazine has said the sound files will be published today or tomorrow. While the alleged Sikorski comments do not reveal any illegal actions, if confirmed, they would likely put Poland's top diplomat on the defensive. The prime minister's office said Tusk was likely to address the issue Monday. Diplomatic storm: It is the latest recorded revelation from magazine Wprost to rattle Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government. Wprost already last week set off a. political storm with the release of a recording of a conversation. between central bank head Marek Belka and Interior Minister Bartlomiej. Sienkiewicz. In the recording, the two discussed how the bank could help. the governing party win re-election in 2015, an apparent violation of. the bank's independence. Critics responded by calling on Tusk's. government to resign. Sikorski has been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and has strongly criticized Russian actions in neighboring Ukraine this year. In the past he was a strong supporter of the United States. But he has become more critical of Washington in recent years, especially after President Barack Obama's attempted 'reset' of ties with Russia in 2009 and the subsequent scaling-down of the U.S. missile defense plan for Poland and other parts of eastern Europe. Amid recent violence in Ukraine, Sikorski has been calling for a substantial U.S. troop presence on Polish soil. He has also been widely mentioned as a possible successor to Catherine Ashton as the EU's foreign policy chief. Poland officially put him forward as a candidate last month. 'The publishing of the tapes poses a threat to the social and political order of the state,\\" sociologist Henryk Domanski said on TVN24 news channel. \\"This will have repercussions for Sikorski and for his international career, but on the other hand, Sikorski is known in the world for his strong, extreme statements.' Wprost has not revealed the source of the recordings, other than to say that they were obtained from a businessman who did not make them. In Poland, secretly recording a conversation is a crime. Some Poles wonder whether Russia might have a hand in the revelations, on the argument that the Kremlin benefits from a destabilized Poland. While the source of the recording remains unclear, political analyst Rafal Chwedoruk said he believed that the case was about political fighting and 'internal games' — with international implications. 'But if indeed foreign intelligence was involved, that involvement would be so deeply hidden that we would not be able to track it down for years,' he told The Associated Press.

Students are tested at least twice a year. In 1956, US President Eisenhower created the test, and it has been a tradition in schools since 1966. There are five activities in the test: sit-ups , push-ups , sit and reach, endurance run or walk and shuttle run . Students who get scores at or above 85 percent on all the activities can get a Presidential Physical Fitness Award. The test encourages students to live a healthy and active life. Students taking the test are really testing their limits, according to the US National Association for Sport and Physical Education. China has a similar test: the physical education(PE) test. Beginning at the age of 7, students in China are tested twice a year to check if they are healthy and strong. They also finish activities like the endurance run, sit-ups and the shuttle run. However, unlike students in the US who get awards, Chinese students get points in PE tests. The highest score is 100. For junior school students, the PE test is more important because it is worth 30 to 40 points in the entrance exam for senior high school.

There are several sources of energy on Earth, such as geothermal, solar, and wind energy. Step 3: Determine the most relevant energy source for evaporation Out of the various energy sources, solar energy (radiation from the Sun) is the most relevant to the evaporation process.

Capitalize this past sentence correctly.","output":"Does the Garcinia Supplement for Men Work Effectively as in Women? Read This Article to Know the Answer and Get the Right Place to Buy. Garcinia supplements have gained quite a name in recent years for their potential weight loss benefits. Derived from the rind of the fruit Garcinia Cambogia, native to Southeast Asia, these supplements have been credited with assisting in weight loss efforts by curbing appetite and inhibiting fat production. A primary compound found in Garcinia Cambogia, Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA), has been the focal point of scientific studies to ascertain its effectiveness in contributing to weight loss.  While the popularity of Garcinia supplements among women is well-known, a frequently asked question is whether it works equally effectively in men. Although studies and research on the effectiveness of Garcinia supplements are limited, it is valuable to understand that men and women fundamentally possess the same biological mechanisms that can benefit from Garcinia supplements. By analyzing existing research, it is evident that Garcinia supplements can be effective for both men and women in the following ways: 1. Appetite suppression: HCA present in Garcinia supplements has been found to increase serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that affects mood and appetite regulation. Increased serotonin levels lead to a feeling of satiety, helping individuals control hunger and food cravings, which in turn aids weight loss. 2. Fat production inhibition: Garcinia Cambogia is thought to prevent the conversion of excess carbohydrates into fat by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for this conversion, citrate lyase. This can be beneficial for both men and women in their weight loss journey. 3. Enhanced energy levels: Garcinia supplements are said to improve metabolism, leading to increased energy production by breaking down stored body fats. This helps both men and women engage in regular physical activity, further promoting weight loss. However, it is essential to bear in mind that these supplements are not a magic pill for weight loss. Garcinia supplements should be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and regular exercise to facilitate weight loss goals. A vital aspect to keep in mind for men is that they might require a slightly higher dosage of the supplement compared to women, due to their higher muscle mass and basal metabolic rate. To find the right place to buy Garcinia supplements, it is highly recommended to consider the following factors: 1. Reputable brand: Opt for a well-established and reputable brand of Garcinia supplements to ensure product quality and safety. 2. Purity and potency: A potent Garcinia supplement should have at least 50% HCA. Look for a supplement that contains pure Garcinia Cambogia extract without any artificial fillers, binders, or additives. 3. Third-party testing: It is safer to buy supplements that have been independently tested by third-party labs to confirm their purity and potency. 4. Label directions: Always read and follow the label directions for usage, dosage, and potential side effects to enhance the supplement's safety and effectiveness. In conclusion, existing evidence suggests that Garcinia supplements can work effectively for both men and women, provided an appropriate dosage is used, and they are consumed alongside a healthy lifestyle. To purchase a quality Garcinia supplement, focus on reputable brands, third-party tested products, and pay close attention to labels for proper dosage and usage guidelines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read industry publications or online articles for help, and write up a list of words. These words can help you come up with a brand name. For example, the following buzzwords might describe the tech industry: agile, explosive, change, connect. Come up with a list of adjectives you want consumers to associate with your brand name. These adjectives can be your company’s values or the emotions and experiences you want consumers to have.  For example, an auto body shop might want consumers to feel relief, transparency, speed, and dependability. A new tech startup might want consumers to experience connection, curiosity, and excitement. Who are you trying to appeal to? Identify your ideal consumer’s style, income, interests, and level of sophistication. Young millennials and members of Generation Z will be drawn to different brands than their parents and grandparents. Furthermore, high-income people probably have different tastes than lower-income people. Avoid generalities. Not all millennials are hip and edgy. For example, you might be trying to appeal to young mothers. In that situation, your audience might be fresh, optimistic, stylish, and seeking stability. Look at your list of adjectives. Do they share something in common? Find a common thread and use that as your brand name. Your name can’t be a string of adjectives. For example, the adjectives for a children’s clothing shop might be “optimistic,” “growing,” and “new,” all of which suggest new beginnings and a bright future. “Sunrise” or “Sunshine” might capture this essence. Your name needs to stand out in the marketplace, particularly on the web. No one can find you if you name yourself “Hammer” or “Elastic.” True, Apple is the name of a famous company, but it would be hard for them to break out today without major money spent on marketing.  Instead of “Hammer,” chose something slightly different: “Crushers.” You might combine words to create a name. For example, Groupon combined “group” and “coupon.” This is an easy way to pick a unique name that always conveys key information about your brand. Names must be easy to remember, so try to make them as short as possible! Ideally, your name should be one word, though that might not be possible. Instead of “We’re Open from Seven to Eleven,” one business named itself “7-11.” Which would you remember? 7-11 is a great name because it also communicates the company's defining characteristic: they are open from 7 in the morning until 11 at night. Your brand is much more than your business name. It also includes your logo and the color schemes you use on your products, website, and packaging. All of these elements must create a unified impression. For example, you might love the dark blue colors your web designer has used on your website. If so, then “Sunshine” probably isn’t a good brand name. Something will need to change—either the website or your brand name. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides guidance on creating a brand name that resonates with the target audience and stands out in the market.

The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses.

As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease. The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be? It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man.

Three men sought the Democratic nomination for governor at the 1899 party convention in Louisville - Goebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin appeared to be the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters would back whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone-Goebel alliance.  Goebel took a calculated risk by breaking the agreement once his choice was installed as presiding officer. Hardin, seeing that Stone had been betrayed and hoping he might now be able to secure the nomination, re-entered the contest. Several chaotic ballots resulted in no clear majority for anyone, and Goebel's hand-picked chairman announced the man with the lowest vote total in the next canvass would be dropped. It turned out to be Stone. This put Stone's backers in a difficult position. They were forced to choose between Hardin, who was seen as a pawn of the railroads, or Goebel, who had turned against their man. Enough of them sided with Goebel to give him the nomination. Goebel's tactics, while not illegal, were unpopular and divided the party. A disgruntled faction calling themselves the \\"Honest Election Democrats\\" held a separate convention in Lexington and nominated John Y. Brown for governor.  Republican William S. Taylor defeated both Democratic candidates in the general election, but his margin over Goebel was only 2,383 votes. Democrats in the General Assembly began making accusations of voting irregularities in some counties, but in a surprise decision, the Board of Elections created by the Goebel Election Law and manned by three hand-picked Goebel Democrats, ruled 2-1 that the disputed ballots should count, saying the law gave them no legal power to reverse the official county results and that under the Kentucky Constitution the power to review the election lay in the General Assembly. The Assembly then invalidated enough Republican ballots to give the election to Goebel. The Assembly's Republican minority was incensed, as were voters in traditionally Republican districts. For several days, the state hovered on the brink of a possible civil war. Answer this question \\"What else is significant about this election?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"The 1899 Democratic nomination for governor represents a tumultuous period in party politics and electoral practices, marked by significant inter-party conflicts, backstabbing, and controversy. The election was signaled by an intricate alliance and subsequent betrayal between Goebel and Stone, which led to Goebel's nomination instead of the expected candidate, Stone. Further, the fact that a disgruntled faction within the party, the \\"Honest Election Democrats\\", chose to hold a separate convention to nominate their candidate, revealed a significant divide within the party, thus indicating the weaknessesof the party's unity. However, above all these, the most significant aspect of the election was the controversy surrounding the final result. The General Assembly's decision to invalidate a sufficient number of Republican ballots to secure the victory for Goebel significantly undermined the integrity of the election. This action was particularly contentious considering that the Board of Elections, which was predominantly composed of Goebel's supporters, had originally ruled that the disputed votes should be counted, arguing that they lacked the legal authority to reverse the results. The controversy led to heightened tensions throughout the state, with the situation escalating to the point of a possible civil war. This election also exhibits precedents for the intersection of politics and legalities. Despite the widespread accusations surrounding the results of this election, the decision of the Board of Elections, composed of Goebel's supporters, held under the argument of legal rigidity and constitutional constraints. This, in return, indicates a significant role of legal systems within electoral processes. In general, this election reveals a multiplicity of factors including party politics dynamics, strategic alliances, inter-party division, the legality and integrity of electoral processes, and the potential implications of electoral discord, that altogether significantly shaped the political landscape during this period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Anaheim A:","output":"Title: \\"Venom Strike: Anaheim Showdown\\" In the beaten-down city of Anaheim, California, a corrupted tech tycoon, Cuervo, harnesses a powerful bio-tech AI that he plans to use to take control of the city's infrastructure, paving his way to untold power and regional dominance. Unknown to Cuervo, a solitary figure emerges from the city's shadowy corners, a vigilante with a mysterious past, known only as Snake. Snake, known for his skills in martial arts, hacking, and unmatched stealth abilities, is determined to stop Cuervo and his nefarious plans. As the plot unfolds, it is revealed that Snake was a former operative for an elite governmental agency but was abandoned and declared dead after a failed mission. He managed to survive and made Anaheim his sanctum. Meanwhile, Cuervo, with a phobia of snakes, uses the city as an experimental ground for his dystopian idea of a future led by an all-powerful AI, causing chaos in the city's day-to-day life. Additionally, Anaheim has a personal significance for Snake as he was born and raised here, and even the death of his sister occurred under Cuervo’s black-market medical testing in this very city. So, his fight is not merely to safeguard the city but to avenge his sister’s death and extinguish his personal hatred for Cuervo. Cuervo's AI network gives him control over all digital devices in the city including traffic systems, public utilities, and personal devices, enabling him to create havoc as a distraction while further developing the AI technology into becoming self-aware and self-sustaining. The AI, slowly taking over the city, also begins to understand human emotion and forms an internal conflict of its course of actions. Snake, proficient in hacking, along with his former colleague and tech expert, Ruby, begin to wage silent warfare against Cuervo. They strategically attack various AI nodes across the city, slowly weakening its hold over the city. Their journey leads to thrilling chases across the cityscape, promising intense action-packed scenes filled with cutting-edge tech weapons and hand-to-hand combat. In the climactic scene, Snake, armed with a virus coded by Ruby, infiltrates Cuervo's high-tech, heavily guarded skyscraper to defeat him and his army of AI controlled androids. They engage in an epic showdown which includes a mental and physical cat and mouse chase. Snake, with his superior stealth and combat skills, manages to outmaneuver Cuervo's forces. In a final confrontation, Cuervo, surrounded by a protective network of advanced AI robots, confronts Snake. Here, Cuervo’s deep fear of snakes is exploited. Using his namesake to advantage, Snake unleashes a box full of venomous anacondas that Cuervo had created in his bio-lab for bio-weapon purposes. The sight of real snakes disrupts Cuervo's concentration, which allows Snake to insert the virus into the central AI system, shutting it down, freeing Anaheim from Cuervo's control and, ultimately, helping the AI realize its flaws and connecting it with human emotions. In the end, as law enforcement agencies swoop in to apprehend the weakened Cuervo, Snake disappears once again into the city's underbelly, ready to resurface when his city needs him again, leaving a symbolic graffiti of a snake in his wake, forming his legend in the city. \\"Venom Strike: Anaheim Showdown\\" blends elements of action, suspense, and science fiction to create an engrossing narrative that highlights one man's fight against a power-hungry tyrant to save the city he calls home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, about 18 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed in the occupied Palestinian territories. Although President Barack Obama rightly condemned the tragic killing of three Israeli teenagers, the majority of Palestinian victims have been largely reduced to faceless, nameless statistics who do not elicit comparable reaction. Exceptions are the case of Tariq Abu Khdeir, an American high school sophomore and that of his cousin 16-year-old Mohammad Abu Khdair, who was abducted by Israelis and then burned to death. Tariq was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem and was captured on video being beaten unconscious by Israeli police. But his beating might only have become public because he is an American. While Tariq was released from detention after three days under a growing media spotlight, hundreds of Palestinians who have been rounded up remain detained with uncertain futures. While some of the brothers left","output":"the scene to avoid further violence, many in the community still found themselves ensnared in the ongoing conflict. The situation has been a painful reminder of how easily their lives can be disrupted and how the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict affects the daily lives of ordinary people living in the area. The uneven reactions to the violence showcase the stark imbalance in political power and the way media coverage tends to prioritize the stories of Israelis over Palestinians, even when the latter represent the majority of casualties. The plight of the Palestinian people has been largely overshadowed by the reactions of the international community to other conflicts around the world. Despite repeated calls for peace and negotiations from both sides, the continuous violence and often biased media coverage make it difficult for the general public to truly grasp the magnitude of suffering and loss experienced by Palestinians on a daily basis. The partisan reaction and media coverage after these incidents highlight the need for a neutral platform where unbiased narratives can be shared, fostering greater empathy and understanding among the global audience. The recent upsurge in violence and subsequent response should call attention to the long-standing tensions in the region. Moreover, it provides an opportunity for international mediators and diplomatic efforts to focus on a comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which remains an urgent issue demanding attention and resolution. In order to achieve a lasting and meaningful peace, the international community must advocate for a fair and balanced resolution that addresses the rights and needs of both Israelis and Palestinians. This includes implementing a two-state solution, which has been considered by many as the most viable long-term solution to restore peace and stability in the region. Furthermore, the international community must take concrete steps to establish an environment conducive to peace talks and negotiations, such as condemning violence on both sides and working towards a comprehensive ceasefire agreement. It is through the collective efforts of grassroots organizations, non-governmental organizations, as well as international bodies, that change can be promoted and tangible steps can be made towards ending the cycle of violence and oppression. By encouraging dialogue and promoting education around the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, barriers can be broken down between the two communities that will ultimately result in a better understanding of the different perspectives and experiences that both sides face. The right ending to this passage is a call to action that emphasizes the need for genuine empathy and a just resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The suffering of the Palestinian people must no longer be overshadowed, and similarly, the safety and security of Israelis must be acknowledged to foster peace. The international community must come together in the pursuit of an honest and equitable solution that respects the humanity and dignity of all individuals in the region, allowing for a lasting peace in which the children of both Israelis and Palestinians can grow up without fear, hatred, or violence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He belonged to a Protestant merchant family . He took up the study of jurisprudence , and became at an early age professor of criminal law at Bonn and later in Berlin . His scholarly attachments were especially revealed in his Handbuch des gemeinen deutschen Strafrechts ( 3 vols. , 1827 -- 30 ) . Longing for faith and overcome by the conclusively and immensity of Catholic dogma , as he found it disclosed in the decrees of the Council of Trent , he converted to Catholicism in Cologne in 1824 . After the outbreak of the July Revolution in Paris , he wrote an anonymous political brochure , Die franzosische Revolution von 1830 . It met the emphatic approval of the circle of friends of the then Crown Prince ( later King Frederick William IV of Prussia ) , which was composed of men of anti-revolutionary views , influenced by Romanticism and by Karl Ludwig von Haller . Jarcke assumed the editorship of the periodical Politische Wochenblatt , founded by these men in 1831 to promote their ideas . In 1832 Metternich called him to the State Chancery in Vienna to succeed the late Friedrich von Gentz . He accepted the call , but continued an active collaborator of the weekly journal .

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.  - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  - The Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918 and included parts of present-day Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, where its capital was Berlin.  - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic).  - Slovakia, officially the Slovak Republic, is a landlocked country in Central Europe. It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Austria to the west, Poland to the north, Ukraine to the east and Hungary to the south. Slovakia's territory spans about and is mostly mountainous. The population is over 5 million and comprises mostly ethnic Slovaks. The capital and largest city is Bratislava. The official language is Slovak, a member of the Slavic language family.  - The Margraviate of Brandenburg was a major principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1157 to 1806. Also known as the March of Brandenburg (\\"), it played a pivotal role in the history of Germany and Central Europe.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - The Duchy of Prussia or Ducal Prussia was a duchy in eastern Prussia established during the Protestant Reformation in 1525. It was the first Lutheran duchy with a dominant German-speaking population, as well as Polish and Lithuanian minorities. In old texts and in Latin, the term \\"Prut(h)enia\\" refers alike to \\"Ducal Prussia\\", its western neighbor Royal Prussia, and their common predecessor, Teutonic Prussia. The adjectival form of the name was \\"Prut(h)enic\\".  - The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central Europe can be traced to Roman commander Julius Caesar, who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as \\"Germania\\", thus distinguishing it from Gaul (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the Germanic tribes in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman Empire, although the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established along the Rhine. Following the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other West Germanic tribes. When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charlemagne's heirs in 843, the eastern part became East Francia. In 962, Otto I became the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the medieval German state.  - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - A unitary state is a state governed as a single power in which the central government is ultimately supreme and any administrative divisions (sub-national units) exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. The majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government. Of the 193 UN member states, 165 of them are governed as unitary states.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Hungary is a unitary parliamentary republic in Central Europe. It covers an area of , situated in the Carpathian Basin and bordered by Slovakia to the north, Romania to the east, Serbia to the south, Croatia to the southwest, Slovenia to the west, Austria to the northwest, and Ukraine to the northeast. With about 10 million inhabitants, Hungary is a medium-sized member state of the European Union. The official language is Hungarian, which is the most widely spoken Uralic language in the world. Hungary's capital and largest metropolis is Budapest, a significant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- global city. Major urban areas include Debrecen, Szeged, Miskolc, Pécs and Gyr.  - The German Revolution or November Revolution was a civil conflict in the German Empire at the end of the First World War that resulted in the replacement of Germany's Imperial government with a republic. The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the establishment in August 1919 of a republic that later became known as the Weimar Republic.  - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs. It was established in 1947 and is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International Organization Foundation. The editor-in-chief is Jon Pevehouse (University of WisconsinMadison).  - Centrope is an Interreg IIIA project to establish a multinational region in the Central Europe encompassing four European countries: Slovakia, Austria, Hungary and Czech Republic.  - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, , or OPEP in several other languages) is an intergovernmental organization of 13 nations, founded in 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela), and headquartered since 1965 in Vienna. As of 2015, the 13 countries accounted for an estimated 42 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world's \\"proven\\" oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American-dominated multinational oil companies.  - Brandenburg (Lower Sorbian: \\"Bramborska\\") is one of the sixteen federated states of Germany. It lies in the northeast of the country covering an area of 29,478 square kilometers and has 2.48 million inhabitants. The capital and largest city is Potsdam. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include the national capital and city-state Berlin forming a metropolitan area.

In those patients who before transplantation were serological negative for CMV but had received organs from CMV - IgG positive donors , the incidence of the disease was highest . A:","output":"This task is asking you to identify the name of a gene or protein from a given sentence. The guiding principle for this task is determined by your knowledge of scientific terms, particularly those related to genes or proteins, which are typically used in biological and health science-related contexts. Here's how to use those guidelines to find the answer: Step 1: Carefully read the sentence. Step 2: Make note of the scientific terms used in the sentence. These are often complex words that might not be commonly used outside a scientific context. Step 3: Identify if any of these terms mention or describe a gene or protein.  Step 4: If there are multiple genes or proteins mentioned, choose one of them as your answer. Writing more than one can create confusion in this task as the instruction requires only one answer. From the given sentence, \\"In those patients who before transplantation were serological negative for CMV but had received organs from CMV - IgG positive donors, the incidence of the disease was highest.\\", there are no explicit gene or protein mentioned. But, you can infer that CMV - IgG might be the protein your answer is looking for.

Then suddenly, the trees disappeared, and they were in an open area called bogland, which is a wet, squishy place with no trees. The friend saw this as a great opportunity to catch the girl because she wouldn't be able to hide among the trees anymore.  The friend also thought it would be much easier to catch the girl because they were wearing sneakers and jeans, which made it easier to run, while the girl was wearing a dress, which might make it harder for her to run fast.

The year’s first Grand Slam sees Andy Murray with a new kit, a new personal logo, a slimmed-down support team, pain-free and engaged to be married. And, as he insisted during a break in preparation for the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, he also feels unencumbered by a surrounding atmosphere he felt may have held him back in 2014. It was an unusual sight to see him practising without Dani Vallverdu, who — along with trainer Jez Green — departed in the off-season, the former to work with Tomas Berdych. Andy Murray (left) recently parted ways with trainer Jez Green (right) He is also clearly of a mind to prove wrong those who question whether","output":"he can still compete at the highest level and add to his Grand Slam titles after a difficult year marred by injuries and inconsistent performance. The Scot fears no one and is determined to show that he still has what it takes to be successful in the world of tennis. Feeling renewed and refocused, Murray began his bid at the Australian Open, determined to silence his doubters and make a strong statement in Melbourne. With the support of his coach, Amelie Mauresmo, he was confident that he could make significant progress in his game and be a serious contender for the title. During the early rounds, Murray showcased his improved fitness and form, dispatching his opponents with ease. His relentless determination, combined with his versatile gameplay, allowed him to progress through to the quarterfinals, where he faced a tough challenge in Tomas Berdych, the man now being coached by his former assistant, Dani Vallverdu. In a thrilling match, Murray showed the best of his game, defeating Berdych in four sets to book his place in the semifinals. The victory not only sent a message to his rivals but also brought a sense of vindication for his decision to part ways with Vallverdu and Green, proving that change was necessary to propel him forward. In the semifinals, Murray faced a familiar and formidable opponent in Novak Djokovic, the world number one. The blockbuster match showcased some spectacular tennis, with both players displaying their skills in long, grueling rallies. Ultimately, it was Djokovic who came out on top, defeating Murray in a closely fought contest. Despite his loss, Murray's performance in the Australian Open demonstrated a marked improvement in his form, underlining his ability to contend for major titles. Encouraged by his progress, the Scot vowed to continue his hard work, utilizing the synergy with his coach Amelie Mauresmo and taking the lessons learned in Melbourne to the remaining Grand Slam events of the year. As the tennis season progressed, Murray's newfound confidence and enthusiasm translated into further success on the court. His determination to compete at the highest level saw the Scot claiming titles and steadily climbing the ATP rankings. The faith shown in his coaching team and support network appeared to be paying off, with improvements visible in every aspect of his game. At Wimbledon, Murray once again made a deep run, reaching the semifinals where he ultimately fell to a resurgent Roger Federer. Though the Swiss maestro proved too strong on the day, Murray's trademark resilience and ability to contend with the very best in the sport was again apparent. The US Open provided another opportunity for Murray to stake his claim as a Grand Slam contender, and with his loyal support team and a renewed belief in his abilities, he was ready to give it his all. Another strong showing in New York saw him defeating various top-ranked opponents, eventually reaching the semifinals, where he would face Djokovic once more. In a match for the ages, Murray and Djokovic pushed each other to their limits. However, it was the Scot who emerged victorious, dethroning the world number one in a five-set thriller. Jubilant and exhausted, Murray returned to the Grand Slam final stage, ready to once again battle for glory. Although Murray would ultimately fall short in the final against a strong performance from Rafael Nadal, the tennis world undoubtedly took notice of the fire he carried throughout the tournament. Andy Murray's journey in the 2015 season demonstrated his remarkable resilience and determination after navigating through a tumultuous period in his career. The most logical completion to this news story is one of hope, belief, and perseverance. After an intense season full of challenges, personal growth, and reinvention, Murray's efforts prove that he has the grit and dedication to continue fighting at the top levels of the game.

His mounting debts and overdue taxes had become a source of stress, weighing heavily on his mind and affecting his daily life. Brett, being a good friend and a concerned financial advisor, knew that helping Jason would be an uphill battle. Nevertheless, Brett decided to take matters into his own hands and tackle the issue head-on, knowing that if Jason didn't receive the help he needed, the situation would only worsen. He reached out to Jason through email, detailing the severity of the problem and offering solutions that would make the process more manageable and less daunting. In his email, Brett highlighted the importance of facing the truth and working towards resolving the problem, both for personal reasons and legal obligations. The longer Jason avoided his back taxes, the more penalties and interest would accumulate, increasing the burden that he already struggled with. He advised Jason to first gather and organize all necessary financial documents, such as previous tax returns, receipts, invoices, and bank statements. Brett recommended using an accounting software or app to simplify this process, which will also help Jason keep track of his finances henceforth. With the necessary documents in place, they could better assess the situation, determine the exact amount owed in back taxes, and develop a plan. Brett then informed Jason about different options available to him to repay the debt, such as payment plans, negotiating a reduced settlement with the IRS, or seeking professional tax help. Brett emphasized that each situation is unique, so finding the right solution is crucial, and the key is to take immediate action. Upon reading the email, Jason felt a combination of relief and trepidation. While he understood that Brett was offering valuable guidance and assistance, the thought of facing his financial problems was still overwhelming. Yet, he also knew that he could no longer run from the difficult conversations and decisions. Brett's persistence and unwavering support provided Jason the nudge he needed to take responsibility. After several days of contemplation, Jason finally replied to Brett's email, expressing his gratitude and admitting that he couldn't tackle the problem alone. He agreed to meet with Brett and work together on a plan to resolve his outstanding debt. Over the next several weeks, they met frequently to review and organize Jason's financial records. With Brett's expertise, they contacted the IRS and began negotiations on a payment plan that would allow Jason to repay his debts without crippling his finances. In that process, Jason also learned valuable skills in managing his finances, ensuring that he avoided such a predicament in the future. Though it was a challenging and uncomfortable experience, with the support of a good friend and diligent work, Jason finally confronted his fears and took the necessary steps to regain control of his life. He knew that solving his financial woes wouldn't happen overnight, but with determination, discipline, and accountability, Jason began forging a path towards a stable and debt-free future."},{"instruction":"Title: Good book....Great ending!

It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: When did the author appreciate having to shovel snow? Options:  A. not enough information  B.

You can't even afford it.\\" \\"I'd pay you back.\\" How could he explain his fascination with the Vehicular Age to her? The seductive sheen, the rumble, the combustive power of automobiles called to him like a siren at sea. He coveted the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. And the MG-TD held a place high in his list of hope. British Racing Green, wood dashboard and a four-stroke engine. He had only seen one MG-TD, when he'd gone on holiday with his folks to the U.K. They had been walking down the street in downtown London. Most of the traffic had been pedestrian or cyclist. The occasional fuel-cell car glided by like a ghostly leftover from the Vehicular Age. Double-decker biodiesel buses roared past regularly, trailing the odor of fish and chips after them. And then it came down the street toward them. A car that purred as its rounded lines soaked up the sun with a green so deep it was almost black. It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again. Does Aage's mom own a car? - not enough information - No, she drives Aage's fathers car - No, she is unable to drive - Yes, a MG-TD Answer:","output":"The text does not provide explicit information regarding whether Aage's mother owns a car. She is engaged in a conversation with her son, Aage, who is expressing his deep love and fascination for a particular kind of car - a 1952 MG-TD. The mother understands Aage's fascination given that she can describe the car to be \\"British Racing green.\\"  However, she expresses concern over Aage's desire to acquire such a car, particularly with regards to the perceptions of their co-op members and the issue of affordability. She is clearly skeptical of the idea but she does not express any personal experience or attraction to cars and particularly, there is no indication that she herself owns a car. She is quite firm in arguing that Aage cannot afford to have a car. Furthermore, there is no mention of Aage's mother utilizing a vehicle in any capacity. She does not mention driving or owning a car, nor does the text indicate she uses Aage's father's car. Additionally, there is no clear evidence to suggest that she is unable or able to drive. Her argument against Aage's wish to buy the car is based on financial concerns and social perceptions, not because of any personal experience or requirement of a car. Therefore, in the light of information presented in the context, the most accurate answer would be 'not enough information.' The text does not explicitly state whether Aage's mother owns a car, nor it provides any sufficient clues to conclude logically that she does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Communications Decency Act (CDA), also called Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996 primarily in response to concerns about minors’ access to pornography via the Internet. In 1997 federal judges found that the indecency provisions abridged the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; this decision was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court without comment.      The CDA created a criminal cause of action against those who knowingly transmit “obscene” or “indecent” messages, as determined by local community standards, to a recipient under the age of 18 years. It also prohibited knowingly sending or displaying a “patently offensive” message containing sexual or excretory activities or organs to a minor. The CDA did, however, provide a defense to senders or displayers of online “indecent” materials if they took reasonable good-faith efforts to exclude children.      This legislation had numerous problems that affected both Internet service providers (ISPs) and businesses. First, there was no way for senders or displayers to know if they were within the exception. At that time, it was difficult and cumbersome for a sender to screen out minors. The displayers could ask for a credit card number as validation, but this would not allow them to conduct business with those who did not have a credit card and were over the age of 18 years. In addition, the terms indecent and patently offensive were ambiguous, and the CDA as a whole placed an undue burden on free speech.      Portions of the CDA, especially those regarding the phraseology, were quickly challenged in court by civil rights groups and free-speech advocates. The case was ultimately taken to the Supreme Court in 1997 in Reno v. ACLU. The provisions regarding indecent and patently offensive materials were found to violate the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment and were removed from the CDA.      In 2003 the portions of the CDA regarding obscene content were challenged in Nitke v. Ashcroft (later Nitke v. Gonzales). The plaintiff Barbara Nitke argued that the use of local community standards to determine whether content was obscene was an infringement on her First Amendment rights, as online content is shared with a global community with varying standards. However, she was unable to meet the burden of proof necessary to support her claim, as she could not demonstrate that she would actually be harmed by the CDA.      In Section 230 the CDA created a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make ISPs liable for information originating with a third-party user of the service. That section, originally introduced as the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act in 1995, was added to the CDA during a conference to reconcile differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives versions of the bill. Although it protects online forums and ISPs from most federal causes of action, it does not exempt providers from applicable state laws or criminal, communications-privacy, or intellectual-property claims. Though ISPs are protected by the “Good Samaritan” portions of this section, there have been individuals and groups who have sued Internet users and ISPs over libelous Web pages. Some parties maintain that users should be able to sue ISPs in cases where it is appropriate, including situations where an anonymous poster of questionable content in an online forum cannot be identified. Additionally, the courts have not clearly defined the line at which a blogger, who may be viewed as an information publisher and a user, becomes an information content provider. Editing a Web page or posting a comment so as to create a new, defamatory meaning for the existing content may cause that user to lose protection under Section 230. ||||| Amendments      2018—Pub.

The short-term rental company filed suit today over a new law that requires Airbnb to verify that its hosts have registered with the city before showing ads for their homes online. The suit aims to block the law from going into effect as scheduled on August 1.      San Francisco legislators passed the law earlier this month in an effort to combat the housing crisis in the city, but Airbnb and technology advocacy groups argue that the new rules violate the Communications Decency Act.      “This legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb. It also violates federal law,” Airbnb said in a blog post announcing the suit. “This is an unprecedented step for Airbnb, and one we do not take lightly, but we believe it’s the best way to protect our community of hosts and guests.”      This is an unprecedented step for Airbnb, and one we do not take lightly. Airbnb      San Francisco already requires Airbnb hosts to go through a rigorous registration process that involves acquiring a business license, in-person registration, quarterly reports on when guests are sleeping in the home (as opposed to when the owners are), and a list of all the furnishings in the home that a guest might use, down to the sheets and towels.      The process is intended to help the city weed out commercial renters who are taking their properties off the housing market and listing them exclusively on Airbnb. Doing so might earn a homeowner more money, but it also takes housing stock away from a city that desperately needs all the housing it can get.      Understandably, many hosts opt not to go through the cumbersome registration process — and the new law puts Airbnb on the hook to make sure its hosts comply. The law requires Airbnb to make sure hosts register, and the company faces 1000 per day fines if it does not.      Airbnb launched a campaign asking its hometown to streamline the registration process, but the company is taking its fight to federal court, too.      In documents filed this afternoon, Airbnb argues that the new law violates Section 230 of the CDA, which protects websites from being held liable for content provided by their users. Airbnb argues that the city should hold hosts accountable for registering instead. “Instead of punishing Airbnb for publishing unlawful listings, the City could enforce its short-term rental law directly against hosts who violate it,” Airbnb’s filing suggests. “Removing these listings would cause a substantial disruption to Airbnb’s business and have a significant detrimental effect on Airbnb’s goodwill and reputation among both hosts and guests, thus threatening irreparable injury to Airbnb’s business.”      It’s the same principle for online vendors of alcohol and cigarettes. City Attorney spokesperson      Advocacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and The Center for Democracy and Technology have agreed with Airbnb’s legal analysis. The legislation “clearly goes against what Section 230 states,” CDT policy counsel Gautam Hans wrote in a blog post.      However, the San Francisco City Attorney’s office argues that Airbnb is misinterpreting the CDA. “Nothing in San Francisco’s pending ordinance punishes hosting platforms for their users’ content. In fact, it’s not regulating user content at all — it’s regulating the business activity of the hosting platform itself,” City Attorney spokesperson Matt Dorsey said. “It’s simply a duty to verify information that’s already required of a regulated business activity.”      The CDA protects YouTube from liability when users upload violent content and eBay when sellers use the platform to trade illegal goods, but the City Attorney argues that Airbnb is less of an online business and more of a physical one. “It’s the same principle for online vendors of alcohol and cigarettes. Businesses that sell those products have a legal duty to verify the age of their customers, whether it’s online or at the corner store, so they don’t sell alcohol and cigarettes to children. They, too, are required to verify information that’s already required for their regulated business activity,” Dorsey added.      In addition to the alleged CDA Section 230 violation, Airbnb also claims that San Francisco shouldn’t require the company to turn over information about its users without a subpoena. Airbnb argues that the city’s requirement to disclose users’ registration data also violates the Stored Communications Act. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO — Airbnb has charmed and strong-armed lawmakers around the world to allow it to operate in their communities. But two cities, Airbnb’s hometown, San Francisco, and New York, the service’s largest United States market, have not been so compliant.      On Monday, Airbnb sued San Francisco over a unanimous decision on June 7 by the city’s Board of Supervisors to fine the company 1,000 a day for every unregistered host on its service. If Airbnb does not comply, it could face misdemeanor charges.      The suit follows a bipartisan move by New York lawmakers who voted this month to heavily fine anyone who uses Airbnb to rent a whole apartment for fewer than 30 days, a practice that has been illegal in the state since 2010.      The actions show how Airbnb, despite aggressive lobbying efforts, has not been able to persuade some local legislators to play ball. And in the case of New York, the company has demonstrated a surprisingly tin ear for local politics. ||||| \\"If a clerk at 7-Eleven can be fined for selling alcohol to someone who does not have a proper ID, certainly a multibillion-dollar corporation can be fined for facilitating and profiting from an illegal advertisement,\\" Bonin said in a statement Tuesday. \\"Instead of fighting tooth and nail to avoid responsibility, Airbnb should help make sure their site is not being abused in ways that threaten the character and quality of our neighborhoods.\\" ||||| From the moment our founders launched Airbnb in 2008 during the middle of the Great Recession to help pay their rent, Airbnb has helped San Franciscans afford to stay in the City they love. Since then, thousands of City residents have avoided eviction or foreclosure and been able to stay in San Francisco because they share their space. Thousands more use Airbnb a few times a year to make extra money while on vacation or when big events come to town.      While we are not always perfect, we have constantly sought to learn, get better, and work with the City. There is a need for policies that protect San Francisco’s housing stock and ensure the collection of hotel taxes but also enable residents who depend on Airbnb to make ends meet. For over five years, we have worked with City government to create fair rules for home sharing.      Unfortunately, the rules do not work. There is broad agreement that the current registration process in the City is broken.      Despite these challenges, we had ongoing conversations with policymakers in City Hall and sought to encourage hosts to register in order to make the process work. Over the last year, we have held eleven town hall meetings to explain the registration process, repeatedly emailed hosts to encourage them to register, and convened scores of meetings with individual hosts to help walk them through the required registration steps.      But instead of fixing the process, the Board of Supervisors recently passed a hastily-crafted proposal requiring Airbnb to remove all unregistered hosts. This legislation ignores the reality that the system is not working and this new approach will harm thousands of everyday San Francisco residents who depend on Airbnb. It also violates federal law.      In particular, the proposal:      1. Puts many San Franciscans at risk of eviction or foreclosure while doing nothing to fix the broken registration process.      An estimated 1,200 San Franciscans avoided foreclosure or eviction by hosting on Airbnb. These hosts have been asked to register with the City, but the ever-changing and confusing process simply doesn’t work for many residents, particularly senior citizens, people who occasionally share their space, work several jobs, and have limited time for repeated in-person application meetings.      We have proposed a wide range of improvements, both large and small, that would help fix the process, including:      Creating a one-stop, online permit application process.      Creating a grace period for new hosts to get registered.      Creating flexibility for hosts who rent out their space fewer than 14 nights a year - particularly important for hosts offering space when the City plays hosts to big events.      Do not require hosts who share their space via a Qualified Website Company like Airbnb to obtain a business license. Home sharers are already required to receive one license. A second license is duplicative and unnecessary.      End the requirement that hosts inventory and pay taxes on items like their sheets, blankets, pots and pans.      Despite the Board of Supervisors’ acknowledgement that the current process is broken, the proposal does nothing to address the problem. Instead, the new law doubles down on a broken system by threatening websites that don’t remove home sharers who can’t navigate a confusing, inefficient, and bureaucratic process that often takes months to complete.            2. Violates important federal laws that protect privacy and innovation on the internet.      The new law does nothing to fix the registration process and it violates federal law. Since 1996, the Communications Decency Act -- an important federal law referred to as the “linchpin of the vibrant and successful Internet we know today” -- has prevented local governments from holding websites responsible for content published by their users as the city is attempting to do here.      The new law also violates the federal Stored Communications Act, which creates uniform privacy protections for internet users and prevents cities from simply demanding that platforms turn over user information without a subpoena or other legal process.      A range of experts like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have repeatedly noted that these types of misguided and unlawful rules “would create a chilling atmosphere for online commerce and speech.” The Center for Democracy and Technology agreed, describing the city’s new approach as “unlawful” and noting that “the internet wouldn’t work if it were subject to piecemeal regulations by every state and City within the US.”      3. Ignores better alternatives that could protect San Francisco’s housing stock while respecting federal law      There are better ways to regulate home sharing and address the City’s concerns, ways that don’t violate important federal laws. While the CDA plainly prohibits local governments from following the approach taken by the City, it still allows platforms and municipalities to work together to craft rules that work for everyone. We are ready and willing to work with City government to find common ground on a legal, sensible approach to regulation that protects housing and simplifies the process, and we are hopeful this dialogue can continue as quickly as possible.      We share the City's concern about unwelcome commercial operators converting affordable rental housing to illegal hotels. Within the last year, over 200 listings have been removed in San Francisco. In addition, the typical Airbnb listing in San Francisco is rented 48 nights per year, and in 2015 nearly a third of “entire home” listings rented on our site in San Francisco were rented out fewer than 14 nights total.      San Francisco is our hometown. Airbnb employs over 1,000 people here, and we’ve spent years working with City officials and other advocates to develop sensible rules. Airbnb was the first hosting platform to begin collecting and remitting hotel taxes on behalf of our hosts, and we have collected over 25 million for the City since 2014.      We recognize the need for platforms like Airbnb to play a bigger role in helping the City prevent the loss of affordable rental stock. While we have attempted to work with the City on sensible, lawful alternatives to this flawed new ordinance, we regret that we are forced to now ask a federal court to intervene in this matter. This is an unprecedented step for Airbnb, and one we do not take lightly, but we believe it’s the best way to protect our community of hosts and guests.      We believe that creative approaches are still possible and hope that the City will reconsider its current path and work with us towards building a new system that is legal, workable, and fair to everyone involved. |||||Summary:","output":"The Communications Decency Act (CDA), also known as Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, was enacted by the U.S. Congress to address concerns related to minors' access to internet pornography. The CDA established a criminal cause of action against persons knowingly transmitting indecent materials to individuals under 18, but also created complications for internet service providers and businesses, largely due to the ambiguity of the terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' and the difficulties in determining the age of online recipients. Sections of the CDA were challenged for infringing upon First Amendment rights, and were ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court. In particular, the CDA’s provisions regarding the use of local community standards to judge obscenity were challenged and deemed to violate freedom of speech. Another key aspect of the CDA, Section 230, provides immunity to social media platforms and other internet service providers from being held responsible for information from third-party users. However, it does not protect them from state laws or from claims related to criminal activity, communications privacy, or intellectual property. Controversies involving the CDA continue to arise. For example, Airbnb challenged San Francisco regulations demanding it verify the registration of its hosts with the city, which it sees as being in conflict with Section 230 of the CDA. Airbnb argues that the city should hold hosts accountable instead of the platform. This despite facing fines for non-compliance, evident in a lawsuit filed by Airbnb. There are differing perspectives on how this aspect of the CDA should be interpreted and its limitations defined."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: Teenage life is interesting, adventurous  and difficult.

Article: The plastic identification ( ID, ) cards carded by all Chinese citizens over 16 are to be replaced with electronic cards from 2005.  The new cards, which most people will have by 2005, contain a microchip   on which personal information is stored. This can be checked against databases   kept by the government. \\"The information will be locked into the card so that people won' t be able to use false identities,\\" said Ren Tianbu, a security   official in Shenyang. China's present plastic identity cards were introduced 17 years ago, and a similar system is used by many other countries. However, the information shown on a card differs from nation to nation. Most ID cards show the holder' s name, sex, date of birth and photograph, as well as the card' s expiry   date and number. Germany,  France and Spain all use ID cards, but there are some developed nations who dislike the idea. The US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Britain are among those with no national ID card. However, some of the countries have ID cards for particular uses. For example, Australia and the United States use a driving licence   to identify people. Identity cards are introduced for a variety of reasons. Race, politics and religion were often at the heart of older ID systems. In recent years, though, ID cards have been linked to national information databases, which form the basis of how a government manages a country.

Casting directors may see your headshot and call you in for auditions. Look online for photographers that specialize in headshots in your area and give them a call to schedule an appointment. Headshots exist to inform the casting director of your look, age, and who you are.  Make sure to get makeup and hair done before the headshot so you look your best. Consider including a shot that shows your natural apprentice too. Professional level headshots can be expensive and range anywhere from 400 - 1,200 (US Dollars)  Be as natural as you can in your headshot, and avoid over-editing or makeup so the casting director knows what to expect when you audition. A good agent will have existing network connections in the industry and be able to get you auditions for roles that you wouldn't be able to get yourself. Set up meetings with management agencies and talk to different people in the industry to get referrals. Agents also negotiate pay in some circumstances as well.  Many agents charge you 10% of your earnings.  Agents also help you prepare for auditions and can impart useful knowledge about a career in acting to you. Make sure to thoroughly look through any contract with an attorney or similar qualified professional before signing any agreements or contracts. Networking in the acting industry is critically important and it can help you land roles if you know the right people. Make sure to keep in touch with directors and other actors and actresses and you may be the first in mind for a specific role.  Remember to be pleasant and be easy to work with and talk with. If you get a bad reputation, it may make it harder for your to get auditions. Many actors will continue to work with the same people through their career.  Never turn down the opportunity to attend a meeting to talk about a potential role or a new project someone is working on. You won’t get all of the roles you audition for, but it doesn’t mean you should throw in the towel. Continue to hone your craft and network in the industry, and you’ll eventually you’ll be able to become a famous actress.  Matt Le Blanc struggled to land a role for years before he ended up on the hit show “Friends” in 1994.  If you keep getting rejected for the same roles, try to switch up the types of roles you’re auditioning for. Agent workshops or showcases are opportunities for actors to showcase their skills in front of casting directors or producers. Actors attend these workshops and do read scripts to potentially land roles in the future. Make sure that when you attend one of these workshops you’re dressed well and you’ve prepared a monologue. There are sometimes open opportunities for actors to land a role in a movie or play depending on where you live. Most open casting calls require the actor have a head shot, and a resume of past performance.  Starting as an extra will give you insight into film production and performance. Don’t turn these opportunities down. Don’t turn down opportunities to do commercials. Dakota Fanning, Farrah Fawcett, and Jodie Foster all starred in commercials before hitting the big screen.

Scans suggested the brain worked harder to regulate emotional and behavioural responses to fear when it was not conscious of it. The women in the small study were shown pictures of flowers interspersed very briefly with images of spiders. The researchers said the technique could be used to treat children. Current treatments are often based on persuading patients to directly face their fear, which could cause serious emotional distress, they said. A phobia is an irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal. Phobias are more pronounced than fears, and can become overwhelming and affect day-to-day life. They are particularly common in women. For the research, 21 young women with a phobia of spiders were shown images of spiders for a split second in between image of flowers. They were then shown spider images for a longer time, so that they were clearly visible. At the same time, their brain activity was monitored and compared with that of women with no phobias. In the group with phobias, seeing the spider images very briefly resulted in strong activity in areas of the brain that regulate emotional and behavioural responses to fear. This was unexpected and resulted in the level of fear actually experienced being reduced, the researchers said. In contrast, when women with phobias were exposed to clear images of spiders for a longer time, the brain was unable to control its response to fear, causing them to experience the full force of their phobia. Paul Siegel, lead author of the study and associate professor of psychology at Purchase College of the State University of New York, said: \\"Counter-intuitively, our study showed that the brain is better able to process feared stimuli when they are presented without conscious awareness. \\"Our findings suggest that phobic people may be better prepared to face their fears if at first they are not consciously aware that they've faced them.\\" Dr Bradley Peterson, director of the Institute for the Developing Mind at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said the technique could be a useful approach for treating children who could suffer significant distress if confronted head on by what was causing their phobia. The study is published in Human Brain Mapping. The 10 most common phobias in the UK are: NHS Choices says some simple phobias can be treated through gradual exposure to the object, animal, place or situation that causes fear and anxiety. But treating complex phobias, such as agoraphobia, can take longer and require counselling, talking therapies or psychotherapy. Nicky Lidbetter, from charity Anxiety UK, said the current treatment approach for this type of specific phobia was cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \\"This approach aims to replace the fear response of a phobia with a relaxation response, through gradual exposure to the phobia inducing stimulus.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"A new study suggests that exposing individuals with phobias to their fears subconsciously may help control their emotional and behavioral responses.

Movie title: Assault on Precinct 13 Movie plot: Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), veteran officer Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) are the only people remaining in a soon to be shut down Detroit police precinct on New Year's Eve. Roenick is deskbound and abusing alcohol and prescription drugs. He is haunted by a botched undercover operation eight months prior that resulted in the deaths of two members of his team. Psychiatrist Alex Sabian (Maria Bello) is treating Roenick at the station. Meanwhile, crime lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is in custody and accused of killing a police officer. He is being transported to another location by bus with three other criminals: addict Beck (John Leguizamo), petty crook Anna (Aisha Hinds), and counterfeiter Smiley (Ja Rule), but a raging snowstorm forces the two guards to hunker down at Precinct 13 until the storm is over. Bishop and Police Captain Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne) were formerly partners in crime. Duvall and his men must kill Bishop before he can testify about their involvement. Heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the corrupt street cops and SWAT officers, Roenick sets free and arms the prisoners to bolster the defense of the station. Roenick and Bishop forge an uneasy truce between cops and criminals and their combined efforts repel several more attacks by the corrupt police officers. Roenick and Bishop decide to take action instead of waiting for another attack. With so few defenders left alive, the precinct stands vulnerable to attack. O'Shea suddenly remembers a sewage tunnel running beneath the building and the survivors set fire to the station to cover their escape and flee down the passageway. When they emerge from the tunnel, the survivors find themselves surrounded by the corrupt policemen. The real traitor is revealed to be O'Shea and Duvall prepares to execute the rest. Roenick and Bishop work together to survive the final confrontation with Duvall and his men, eventually leading to Roenick killing Duvall and letting Bishop go, giving him a head start.

It was clear that their preferences were different: while Brian found comfort and relaxation in dimly lit environments, Jason felt uneasy and preferred brighter settings. This was particularly noticeable when they went out to dinner or spent time at each other's homes. In restaurants, Brian would always choose a table near the corners, away from the main source of light. At home, he would frequently use candles or soft lamps to create a cozy atmosphere. On the other hand, Jason's preference for brighter lighting was evident in his choice of restaurants and the way he lit his own home. He would often try to persuade Brian to sit in well-lit areas while dining out, arguing that it made the food look more appetizing and allowed them to see each other better. At his own house, Jason used ceiling lamps and various light fixtures to ensure that every corner of the room was illuminated. He believed that bright lighting boosted his mood and productivity, a sentiment that Brian couldn't quite understand. They tried to accommodate each other's preferences when spending time together, but it wasn't always easy. Whenever they visited each other's homes, one of them would inevitably feel uncomfortable. For instance, if Brian invited Jason over for dinner, he would end up lighting a few extra lamps or candles in an effort to meet Jason's needs. Conversely, when they were at Jason's house, the brightness would often cause Brian to squint or even develop headaches. Despite their differing opinions on lighting, Brian and Jason valued their friendship too much to let something as trivial as light preferences come between them.

Here's a question: The mom told her son to stay in bed instead of going to school, what did she likely say afterwards?  Here are possible answers to this question: - more rest - rest more - were sick - drink water - you're sick  I believe the correct choice is \\"you're sick\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"You're sick,\\" and here's why: When a mother tells her child to stay in bed instead of going to school, it is highly probable that the child might be unwell or sick. Considering the possible answers provided, \\"you're sick\\" aligns most closely with the context of the given situation. The other options do not provide a definite reason for the child to stay home and miss school. Here's a more in-depth analysis of each response: 1. \\"More rest\\": While this option suggests that the child requires additional rest, it does not explicitly address the reason behind this need for rest. A child might need more rest for various reasons, such as recovering from a late-night event or catching up on lost sleep due to a busy schedule. Therefore, this option does not necessarily indicate the reason the mother specifically instructed her child to stay home from school. 2. \\"Rest more\\": Similar to the previous answer, \\"rest more\\" only tells the child to get additional rest without emphasizing the underlying reason behind the parent's decision. Rest alone is not a sufficient explanation for missing school. 3. \\"Were sick\\": Grammatically, this option is incorrect, as it should be \\"you're sick\\" or \\"you were sick.\\" If interpreted correctly, it implies that the child was sick in the past, not that they are currently sick. This explanation would not justify keeping the child at home rather than sending them to school. 4. \\"Drink water\\": Although drinking water is important for maintaining general health and well-being, it is not a specific reason for the child to stay home from school. There might be other scenarios where a mother would remind her child to drink water, such as during hot weather, after physical activities, or as a reminder to stay hydrated throughout the day. This answer choice does not explain why staying in bed is necessary. 5. \\"You're sick\\": This answer choice provides a clear, specific reason for the child to remain in bed and not attend school. When a child is sick, it is crucial for them to rest and recover, as attending school might exacerbate their illness and put other students' health at risk. By telling their child, \\"you're sick,\\" the mother is stressing the importance of recovery and justifying their decision to let the child stay home from school. Based on the contextual understanding of the situation and the analysis of each potential response, it is evident that \\"you're sick\\" is the most logical and relevant answer. This option establishes a direct correlation between the child's health and the mother's directive to stay home and rest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how often do elk have sex Suggested answer: Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The suggested answer is insufficient and does not provide enough information to validate the answer. The question is about how often elk have sex, and the answer provided mainly discusses the shedding of male elk antlers. While that information may be interesting, it does not address the frequency of mating in elk. Let me provide a more detailed and relevant answer to the original question. Elk (Cervus canadensis), also known as wapiti, have a defined mating season called the rut. The rut usually occurs between September and October for elk in North America. During this time, male elk become more aggressive and actively seek out females for mating. Female elk, or cows, show signs of estrus (being in heat) and are receptive to mating during the rut.  The frequency of mating depends on several factors, such as population density, the presence of dominant males, and the number of receptive females. A dominant male, called a bull, may mate multiple times during the mating season if he can successfully defend his harem, the group of cows he has attracted. However, this does not mean that elk mate continuously; they typically mate only when cows are in estrus, which can last for several days. Furthermore, a cow's reproductive cycle will generally permit her to mate once with a bull. To summarize, the frequency of elk mating is primarily limited to the rutting season, during which bulls may mate with multiple receptive cows. However, the answer you provided regarding antler shedding does not directly address the question of how often elk have sex. A more suitable answer would emphasize the importance of the rut and the factors that influence mating frequency in elk populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What weapon is Jack's attacker using in the last scene? Movie plot title: The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon Movie plot: The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were. Overall the experience was also, I have a lot of friends who are artists so I hope to do more artist portraits in the future.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell!

Hamsters reach sexual maturity as young as 6 weeks old, though it is not advisable to let them mate at this age. A female should be at least 8-10 weeks old before mating, and males 10-12 weeks old.","output":"It is important to be aware of the age, health, and compatibility of potential hamster parents in order to provide the best chance for the newborn pups to thrive and develop successfully. Proper knowledge and understanding of the parents' risk factors can be crucial in preventing complications, both during the pregnancy and after the arrival of the hamster pups. Firstly, it is important to ensure that both the male and female hamsters are in good health and come from reputable breeders with no history of genetic issues. This can minimize the risk of birth defects and health problems in the newborn pups. It is also essential to ascertain that the hamster parents come from different bloodlines to avoid any potential risks of inbreeding. Additionally, the hamster parents should be closely observed for any signs of aggression or incompatibility that could pose harm to the pups. It is not uncommon for male hamsters, especially Syrian hamsters, to display aggressive behaviors toward the female or the pups. In such cases, it is necessary to separate the male from the female and the pups to ensure their safety. Once the hamster parents have been deemed compatible and in good health, their living environment must be carefully prepared and maintained to guarantee a safe and nurturing space for the pups. Before the female hamster gives birth, clean and sanitize the enclosure to prevent any infections and provide ample nesting materials such as shredded paper or tissues for her to build a comfortable nest. As the expected delivery date approaches, monitor the pregnant hamster closely for any signs of stress, labor, or complications. It is normal for a pregnant hamster to become more irritable and protective of her nest; however, extreme aggression or reluctance to eat or drink can indicate potential issues that warrant close attention. After the birth of the hamster pups, provide the mother with a rich diet to support her lactation needs, including high-quality hamster pellets, fresh fruits and vegetables, and protein sources like boiled eggs or mealworms. It is crucial to minimize disturbances in the enclosure during the first few weeks to prevent the mother from becoming stressed or feeling threatened. Under such stress, there is a risk that she may harm or even cannibalize her pups. Therefore, avoid handling the pups or the mother during this period. As the hamster pups grow, keep a close eye on their development and make sure they are reaching age-appropriate milestones. Hamster pups are born blind, hairless, and deaf, and it will take about two weeks for their eyes to open and their fur to grow in. By the age of 3 to 4 weeks, they will begin eating solid food and will start exploring their surroundings. At this stage, it is safe to begin socializing and handling the pups gently to familiarize them with human contact. In conclusion, successfully caring for newborn hamsters involves carefully assessing the parents' risk factors, ensuring an optimal environment for the pups, and providing dedicated care and attention during their early development. By following these guidelines, you can create the best possible conditions for newborn hamsters to mature into healthy, happy pets."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article with the title: \\"Wall Street Sluggish On Auto Angst\\" Article:","output":"Title: Wall Street Sluggish On Auto Angst Introduction: As the world continues to accelerate towards more environmentally friendly transportation solutions, Wall Street faces an undeniable dilemma. Auto companies and their stocks have taken center stage, becoming a prominent source of anxiety among investors. The shifting sands of technological advancements, electric vehicles (EVs), governmental regulations, and changing consumer preferences have made some auto stocks appear lackluster. This article will delve into the factors contributing to Wall Street's sluggishness in this sector, highlighting the auto angst permeating the investing landscape. Market Volatility: In recent months, the automotive industry has experienced exceptional volatility. Constant fluctuations in the stock prices of major players like Tesla, Ford, and General Motors have left investors feeling uneasy about the sector as a whole. The primary causes behind this volatility can be attributed to three main factors: competition from emerging EV companies, challenges in the production of new EV models, and geopolitical tensions affecting global supply chains. Rising Competition: The automobile industry is under great pressure to transition from traditional gasoline-powered vehicles to greener alternatives. A surge of new market entrants, specializing primarily in electric vehicles, has intensified the competition. From established companies like Tesla to startups such as Rivian, Lucid Motors, and NIO, the market is becoming increasingly saturated with new electric-powered options. Automakers with a strong legacy in traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, like Ford and General Motors, have also started moving toward electrification, further increasing the competition. This competitive landscape has raised concerns among investors about the profitability and future growth of auto stocks. Production Challenges: Manufacturing electric vehicles is no easy task, with frequent challenges plaguing the production process. Issues ranging from global chip shortages to the limited availability of essential battery components hinder the progress of electric vehicle production. These challenges have resulted in production delays and frustrated consumers, which in turn contribute to the uneasiness felt by the investment community. Regulatory Environment: Governments around the world have begun to advocate more vehemently for the adoption of electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change. This has led to a tightening of regulations and emission standards for traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, fostering further uncertainty in the industry. The Biden administration's massive infrastructure plan includes significant funding for EV charging infrastructure and tax credits, which could propel the industry forward. However, unforeseen regulatory shifts or delays in implementing such policies could adversely impact the sector. Changing Consumer Preferences: The pace of consumer adoption of electric vehicles is a critical factor affecting investor sentiment towards the automotive industry. While there has been a steady increase in demand for electric vehicles, questions still abound about whether the shift toward sustainable transportation is happening fast enough. Consumers continue to express concerns about the affordability and efficiency of EVs, and any setbacks in consumer adoption could translate into lower revenue and profitability for the auto industry. Conclusion: Wall Street's auto angst is primarily due to the highly uncertain and rapidly evolving landscape of the automotive industry. Factors such as market volatility, mounting competition, production challenges, regulatory shifts, and changing consumer preferences contribute to the lingering sense of trepidation among investors. To regain confidence in this sector, auto companies must continue to adapt to market changes, invest in research and development, and consistently improve the efficiency and affordability of their electric vehicle offerings."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Bill, Frank and Dave were three brothers.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Tree of Life Context: Tree of Life is a period piece centered around three boys in the 1950s. The eldest son (Hunter McCracken none SAG) of two characters (Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain) witnesses the loss of innocence.The movie, which exists as a metaphysical meditation and a lyrical poem, focuses at a microcosmic level on the story of Jack, a jaded, middle aged man (played by Sean Penn) scarred by the memories of an oppressive upbringing by his father (Brad Pitt), as well as the untimely death of his younger brother.We trace the evolution of an eleven-year-old boy in the Midwest, Jack, one of three brothers. At first all seems marvelous to the child. He sees as his mother does, with the eyes of his soul. She represents the way of love and mercy, where the father tries to teach his son the world's way, of putting oneself first. Each parent contends for his allegiance, and Jack must reconcile their claims. The picture darkens as he has his first glimpses of sickness, suffering and death. The world, once a thing of glory, becomes a labyrinth.Framing this story is that of adult Jack, a lost soul in a modern world, seeking to discover amid the changing scenes of time that which does not change: the eternal scheme of which we are a part. When he sees all that has gone into our world's preparation, each thing appears a miracle precious, incomparable. Jack, with his new understanding, is able to forgive his father and take his first steps on the path of life.The story ends in hope, acknowledging the beauty and joy in all things, in the everyday and above all in the family -- our first school -- the only place that most of us learn the truth about the world and ourselves, or discover life's single most important lesson, of unselfish love. The answer is:","output":"Brad Pitt"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The sure-to-be politically fraught nomination process for Eric Holder's replacement as attorney general will come after next month's midterm elections, the White House said on Tuesday. An official, speaking anonymously about the nomination process, said Senate Democrats urged the White House to wait until after November's contests to put a nominee forward to head the Justice Department. Democrats are urgently working to maintain control of the Senate, and are expected to lose seats in the Republican-controlled House. Holder, the last of President Barack Obama's original cabinet members, was a politically divisive attorney general, and the fight to replace him is expected to be rancorous on Capitol Hill. A nominee could be pushed through a lame duck session after the midterm elections, though other issues on the congressional docket -- like authorizing Obama's use of force in against ISIS -- are expected to dominate proceedings in November and December. \\"I do anticipate that Democrats will hold the Senate,\\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after Holder resigned. \\"That said, I also anticipate that whoever the nominee is will earn and ultimately receive bipartisan support.\\" Democrats close to the nominating process have floated several names as potential Holder replacements: the current Labor Secretary Tom Perez, the former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, and former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler are all considered in the mix. Others include U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and former Justice Department official Tony West. CNN White House Producer Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.

Last updated at 12:16 PM on 5th August 2011. Brainchild: PM's aide Steve Hilton. The death penalty, pulling out of Europe and withdrawing from the European Human Rights Act topped the agenda as the public yesterday got the chance to decide what Parliament debates. The Government launched its  ‘e-petition’ website with the promise to consider discussing any subject which attracts 100,000 signatures. Passions ran so high that the site  continually crashed as thousands sought to raise issues that politicians usually shy away from. Other popular subjects included calls for the legalisation of cannabis and Formula One to be kept on BBC. But last night the subject attracting the most interest, with 6,000 names, was the death penalty – with calls for and against. Forty of the 200 most subscribed petitions called for the return of capital punishment. Seven of the top 200, including the top one with 3,000 signatures, called for it not to be reinstated. The issue now looks certain to attract enough signatures for it to be debated in Parliament for the first time since 1998, and a vote could follow. Among the most prominent  pro-death penalty e-petitions is one calling for child killers and those who murder on-duty police officers to be executed. More than 1,000 people a minute visited the website yesterday. Writing in the Daily Mail yesterday, the Leader of the House of Commons, Sir George Young, warned that MPs cannot ignore the popular groundswell. But critics warned that the e-petitions would allow the Commons to be hijacked by special interest campaigns and mean MPs spending precious Parliamentary time on proposals that have little or no chance of becoming law. Popular petitions included calls for Britain to withdraw from the EU and the European Human Rights Act, an absolute right to self defence in your own home and the decriminalisation of drugs. Others called for prisoners’ diets be restricted to bread and water as in the ‘good old days’. Fail: The highly-anticipated e-petition website crashed within hours of going live. And there were several bizarre petitions including demands that bodybuilding be encouraged to improve the nation’s health, and calls to make it a criminal offence to cruise along in the middle lane of motorways. No 10’s previous e-petition site was suspended ahead of the general election then shelved by the Coalition. But it has been resurrected by David Cameron’s director of strategy, Steve Hilton, with the promise that those that attract more than 100,000 signatures will be considered for debate in Parliament. Several Tory MPs have said they will back calls to reintroduce the death sentence. The last hangings in Britain were in 1964. Tory MP Philip Davies said the public was sick of seeing criminals freed from prison committing  further crimes. Sir George Young wrote in the Daily Mail yesterday that the death penalty is likely to be discussed by Parliament. He said: ‘We should recognise that with advances in technology and DNA the chances of getting somebody wrong for a crime like murder is much more remote than it was in the past. ‘If at the very least this debate ends up with us going back to what we were promised at the time the death penalty was repealed – which was that murderers will spend the rest of their days in prison – then the debate will have served the country well.’ Another Tory MP, Andrew Turner, said: ‘It is about time we had a national debate in Parliament. The number of murders was about half in the 1950s. ‘The state makes the decision about drugs, it makes the decision about young men and women being sent to war and it talks about  abortion. Why are those so different that this particular issue can’t be talked about?’ But fellow Tory MP Dr Kwasi Kwarteng said he would fight attempts to restore the death penalty. He said: ‘The real clincher for me is that you can always get the wrong people and that is a terrible, terrible tragedy.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘Too many politicians come from safe seats which means they only answer to other politicians. They have refused to discuss a lot of issues that matter to a lot of people.’ Any petition signed by more than 100,000 UK citizens goes to the cross-party Commons backbench business committee, which will decide whether it is worthy of debate. This does not mean any parliamentary bills will be tabled as a result, simply that the matter will be discussed. A spokesman for DirectGov, which runs the e-petitions website, acknowledged that many users had experienced difficulties. ‘We apologise for any inconvenience. This is a result of greater-than-expected demand,’ he said. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Question 1: Why during the ice age or in different ages size of animals was huge but during the evolution size reduced? Question 2: Why in your opinion were certain cities able to profit during the industrial era, but not during the digital age? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Before answering the questions, I will analyze each of them separately, determining the key aspects to address.  For Question 1: - Investigate the reasons for large-sized animals during ice ages or different time periods. - Discuss the reduction in size over the course of evolution. For Question 2: - Explore the factors that allowed certain cities to profit during the industrial era. - Discuss why these factors might not have translated into success during the digital age. Now, I will attempt to answer each question, considering their key aspects. Question 1: The size of animals during the ice age or other periods in history was likely due to several factors, including available nutrients, environmental conditions, and evolutionary adaptations. Larger size may have provided advantages in terms of heat retention in cold environments, predation and competition for resources, or other selection pressures. Over time, however, as environments and ecosystems changed, animals evolved to optimize their size and adapt to the new conditions. Smaller size can offer benefits like reduced energy requirements, increased agility, or faster reproduction rates. This shift in size could have been influenced by factors like climate change, competition, and reduction in available resources necessary for maintaining large body size. Question 2: During the industrial era, cities that profited were often those with advantageous access to resources, such as proximity to raw materials like coal and iron, or efficient transport networks like rivers and ports. Additionally, these cities could attract a large labor force and capital through favorable government policies or industrial concentrations. However, in the digital age, success has shifted to depend more on innovation, technological infrastructure, and highly educated talent. Cities that have struggled to adapt may not have the necessary resources or infrastructure to support the digital economy, or they may be unable to effectively attract the skilled workforce required for knowledge-based industries. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. While both questions involve change over time, Question 1 focuses on the evolution of animal size, while Question 2 deals with the economic success of cities in two different eras. The underlying themes and subjects of the two questions are distinct."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, I will address the first question: \\"What are some famous stories about Swami Vivekananda?\\" Step 1: Research famous stories about Swami Vivekananda I found several famous stories about Swami Vivekananda that showcase his wisdom, spiritual leadership, and compassionate nature. Story 1: The Chicago Speech In 1893, Swami Vivekananda attended the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, where he delivered a groundbreaking speech that captured the attention of the world. He started his address by saying, \\"Sisters and Brothers of America,\\" which was met with a two-minute standing ovation, and his message of universal tolerance and acceptance resonated with the audience. Story 2: The Monkey and the Umbrella While traveling through South India, Swami Vivekananda was once harassed by a group of monkeys. A passerby advised him to throw an umbrella he was carrying at the monkeys to scare them away. Swami threw the umbrella, and the monkeys stopped chasing him. This experience taught him the importance of facing challenges head-on, rather than avoiding them. Story 3: The Cobras in a Snake Charmer's Basket During his travels, Swami Vivekananda watched as a snake charmer manipulated an unsuspecting crowd by replacing the cobras in his basket with harmless snakes, while preaching about compassion and non-violence. Swami exposed the snake charmer's trickery and taught the crowd that truth alone triumphs. Now, I will address the second question: \\"Did Swami Vivekananda write any book?\\" Step 1: Research books authored by Swami Vivekananda Swami Vivekananda did not write any books in the traditional sense, as most of his teachings and discourses were compiled by his disciples and followers into various volumes. Some of these compilations include: 1. Raja Yoga 2. Karma Yoga 3. Jnana Yoga 4. Bhakti Yoga 5. Inspired Talks Finally, I will address the third question: \\"Are these two questions asking the same thing?\\" No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question seeks information about famous stories involving Swami Vivekananda, while the second question asks whether he wrote any books. The first question is about anecdotes and life events, and the second question is about his literary contributions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Question: how did mohammed gandhi die I found the following answer on Google: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948), commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the information you found does not provide the correct answer to your question about how Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, died. Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948. He was shot and killed by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu extremist who opposed Gandhi's vision of a secular, united India that included both Hindus and Muslims. The assassination took place in New Delhi, just a few months after India had gained its independence from British rule in August 1947. On the evening of January 30, 1948, Gandhi was walking to a prayer meeting at the Birla House, a location where he held his nightly multi-faith prayer services. As he was walking with his grandnieces among a small crowd of people, Nathuram Godse approached him and bowed in a sign of respect. When Gandhi returned the gesture, Godse pulled out a Beretta semi-automatic pistol and fired three shots into Gandhi's chest at point-blank range. Gandhi's assassination led to his immediate martyrdom, and his legacy as a symbol of peace and non-violent resistance to oppression has lived on ever since. His approaches to civil disobedience and non-violent protest inspired leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, who adopted Gandhi's methods as part of their own struggles for freedom and equality. Although the information you found states that Mahatma Gandhi was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India, it does not directly answer your question about how he died. To conclude, Mahatma Gandhi died as a result of an assassination carried out by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Shionogi & Co has applied to health regulators in the United States, Canada, and Europe for approval of its HIV drug Dolutegravir, we cannot be certain that the drug will be approved. The approval process for a new drug involves rigorous testing, evaluation of the drug's safety, and assessment of its effectiveness in treating the targeted disease or condition. This process can take a substantial amount of time and effort from both the pharmaceutical company and the regulatory agencies. It is important to note that just because a company applies for regulatory approval does not guarantee that the drug will be approved. Regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have strict requirements and procedures in place to ensure that only safe and effective drugs reach the market. In this specific case, Shionogi & Co has developed Dolutegravir in partnership with Viiv Healthcare, an AIDS drug joint venture between pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. Although the expertise and resources of these companies may be seen as a positive indicator for the drug's approval, it is still impossible to say for certain whether the drug will be approved by the United States, Canada, and European health regulators."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As we were talking, she said, \\"I just wish I had meaningful work. I don't feel like I am making a difference. I am just wasting my life.\\" This is the theme I hear most often from clients who have been in the workforce awhile.All of us want to feel like we are making a difference. We want to believe our work means something. The problem comes in defining \\"meaningful work\\". What is it? That answer is different for everyone. For some meaningful work might be helping others organize their office. For others it may mean making a million dollars.  What really matters is how you see it. What is meaningful work to you? Take out a piece of paper and answer these questions. How do you define meaningful work? When do you feel like you are really making a difference? What work have you done so far that feels the most meaningful? Write down whatever comes to mind.  What you want to do is meaningful. It is very easy to start judging yourself as being selfish. Stop! Allow yourself to be honest. The fact is when Picasso painted; he was doing it because he liked to paint. He was not thinking, \\"Oh, I hope this brings joy to others' lives.\\" He painted because he wanted to. When Beethoven composed, he did it because he loved music. Even scientists searching for a cure for cancer are immersed in their work because it fascinates them.  Don't look down on your work. It is easy to _ the importance of work that feels meaningful. I remember Tony Robbins told a story of talking with the owner of a major company. The man said to Tony, \\"I wish I could do what you do because it makes such adifference in people's lives\\". Tony said, \\"You have got to be kidding! Look at what adifference you make. You provide work, health insurance and security for thousands ofpeople!\\" Don't underestimate the value you provide.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was restored by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989?, using the article: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured. The vase was next restored by J. W. R. Axtell in 1948–1949, and then by Nigel Williams in 1988–1989., what would be the answer ?

Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica.  and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Definition: In this task you will be given a list of dictionaries. A dictionary is a set of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and has a value associated with that key. You should sort the list of dictionaries from smallest to largest by their 'first' key. If there is two dictionaries with the same 'first' value then sort them by their 'second' key. Negative numbers should come before positive numbers. Input: [{'first': 37, 'second': -22}, {'first': -37, 'second': 32}, {'first': 100, 'second': 98}, {'first': -13, 'second': -76}, {'first': 15, 'second': 67}] Output:","output":"The task you're describing involves sorting. This can be achieved in Python, for example, using its built-in sorting function. The simplest way to sort a list of dictionaries in Python is using the built-in \`sorted()\` function with a custom sorting key. You want to sort your data first by the 'first' key and then by the 'second' key if the 'first' fields are equal. For your specific example, here’s how you can do the sorting: \`\`\`python data = [{'first': 37, 'second': -22}, {'first': -37, 'second': 32}, {'first': 100, 'second': 98}, {'first': -13, 'second': -76}, {'first': 15, 'second': 67}] sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: (x['first'], x['second'])) \`\`\` This Python code will output: \`\`\`python [{'first': -37, 'second': 32}, {'first': -13, 'second': -76}, {'first': 15, 'second': 67}, {'first': 37, 'second': -22}, {'first': 100, 'second': 98}] \`\`\` In this sorted result, dictionaries are ordered from those with smallest to largest 'first' key. When there are two dictionaries with the same 'first' value, they have been sorted by their 'second' key as specified. As evident, the dictionary with negative 'first' value comes before those with positive values. However, the output above does not explicitly sort negative numbers before positive ones if the 'first' fields are equal, only coincidentally in this case due to the nature of number line. To ensure negative numbers comes before positive numbers, we can separate sorting into two steps: \`\`\`python # First sort by 'second', then by 'first' sorted_data = sorted(data, key = lambda x: x['second']) sorted_data = sorted(sorted_data, key = lambda x: x['first']) \`\`\` This will keep relative order in terms of 'second' keys when 'first' keys are equal, so negative numbers will precede positive ones.  Remember, sorting in Python is stable, i.e., it maintains the relative order of items with equal sort keys."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He starts the music again and opens the door. The woman who was on the phone before (Natalie Portman) offers an informal greeting and gives Jack flowers. She is intrigued by the items Jack has around the apartment, such as a music box and a painting. We see that she places a small item into Jack's suitcase without him noticing (this is important in The Darjeeling Limited). She goes into the bathroom and brushes her teeth with Jack's toothbrush, asking why Jack drew a bath. He tells her that it's for her but she doesn't respond. They are sitting apart from each other and she asks Jack how long he has been staying in the hotel. He responds that he's been there more than a month. She asks him how long he plans on staying and he replies by asking her the same, to which she says that she is leaving in the morning. There is a knock at the door and the bellhop brings in the food that Jack ordered. Once the bellhop leaves, the woman kisses Jack. They move to the bed and Jack begins to remove her clothes. She asks if he has slept with anyone and after a minute he says no, in turn asking her. She also says no after a minute but Jack points out that she paused. He notices that she has bruises on her body but she doesn't say where she got them. She tells Jack that she never intetionally hurt him, but he seems indifferent. Jack asks if she wants to see his view of Paris....","output":"In the movie scene, what does the woman secretly place into Jack's suitcase that later becomes important in The Darjeeling Limited?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The first MP4 player was born years ago. Soon many music fans were wondering how fantastic it is! If you have been into technology enough, perhaps you may have a knowledge of the MP4. If not, you do need to know something before buying one, even if you are familiar with MP3. MP3 is the CD-like disc with greater capacity. How about MP4? This small digital product will really enrich the joy from listening to music. You can even feel the \\"touch\\" of music to your soul! Now, some similar digital products advertised as \\"MP4 players\\" are simply MP3 players, which do not play video and MPEG format   and also lack other particular functions. These products confuse some buyers, as they may think the \\"MP4\\" players simply mean they can do more than MP3. What is MP4?!  It is a multimedia container. It is not only used to store digital audio   and digital video streams, especially those of MPEG, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles   and pictures. As a most modern container format, it allows streaming over the Internet.  With the help of a piece of MP4 video equipment, you can change various programs such as MPEG to MP4, ASX to MP4, AVI to MP4 and so on, which can be done very quickly and easily without any effect on the sound quality. By installing   DVD-MP4 software, you can transfer particular music from a DVD to an MP4 video file. It really excites your listening music experience.   Then, there is MP4 advanced and you can set your own collection of all the programs -- TV shows, games, and music. You can even see movies which are still running in cinemas.  _ ?

Answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... When did President Trump announce his plans to suspend military exercises? - Before he met with Kim Jong Un in August - After he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th - not enough information - After the Foreign Minister announce its denuclearization commitment Answer:","output":"President Trump announced his plans to suspend military exercises after he met with Kim Jong Un on June 12th during their summit in Singapore."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have: -40 = -14 * v + 6 * v You can think of this as having -14 apples and gaining 6 apples. How many apples will you have after that?

If you shared the -8 candies among -40 friends, how many candies would each friend get? To find that, you'll need to divide the candies by the number of friends.

Problem: a company that ships boxes to a total of 12 distribution centers uses color coding to identify each center . if either a single color or a pair of two different colors is chosen to represent each center and if each center is uniquely represented by that choice of one or two colors , what is the minimum number of colors needed for the coding ? ( assume that the order of the colors in a pair does not matter )  Options: a ) 4 , b ) 5 , c ) 6 , d ) 12 , e ) 24","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to find a mathematical expression that represents the total number of color combinations available with a given number of colors. Since the color pairs do not depend on the order, we can use the combination formula (nCr) where n is the total number of colors and r is the number of colors taken at a time (in this case, 2). The expression is as follows: Total combinations = nC1 + nC2, where nC1 represents the single colors and nC2 represents the color pairs. We are given that there are 12 distribution centers, so our expression should be equal to or greater than 12 to represent each center uniquely: nC1 + nC2 >= 12 Substituting the combination formula, we get: (n! / (1!(n-1)!)) + (n! / (2!(n-2)!)) >= 12 Now, we need to find the minimum number of colors (n) that will satisfy this inequality. We can start with the options provided and test them one by one. Option (a): n = 4: (4! / (1!(4-1)!)) + (4! / (2!(4-2)!)) = 4 + 6 = 10 Since 10 is not equal to or greater than 12, this option is not suitable. Option (b): n = 5: (5! / (1!(5-1)!)) + (5! / (2!(5-2)!)) = 5 + 10 = 15 15 is greater than 12, which means that with 5 colors, we can uniquely represent each of the 12 distribution centers. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed for the coding is 5. Answer: b) 5"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Two young American couples — Jeff and Amy, and Eric and Stacy — enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy accidentally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins.

The wolf head crest also appears in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is decorated with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.William Moreton III used what is today known as the Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the adjoining Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.The Corn Store adjacent to the Chapel may originally have been used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward.

Write the answer: Which union was in dispute with British Airways and called strike action in March 2010","output":"The union that was in dispute with British Airways and called strike action in March 2010 was Unite the Union, specifically the British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (BASSA), which is a section of the Unite union representing cabin crew members. Unite is a British and Irish trade union established in 2007 as a result of a merger between two major unions, Amicus and the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU). Today, it is one of the largest labor unions in the United Kingdom, representing a wide array of workers in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction, manufacturing, and, of course, aviation. The union seeks to protect the rights and interests of its members by engaging in collective bargaining, offering legal support, and representing their concerns in negotiations with employers. The dispute between Unite and British Airways began in 2009 when the airline announced its plans to cut costs in response to the global financial crisis. To achieve this, British Airways proposed several changes, including reducing the number of cabin crew members on long-haul flights, freezing pay for two years, and implementing new contractual terms for new employees. These changes were met with great resistance from the union, as they believed the measures would compromise the job security, pay, and working conditions of their members. Unite the Union and British Airways attempted to resolve the conflict through negotiations but were unable to reach an agreement, which ultimately led to a series of strikes. In March 2010, cabin crew members represented by Unite the Union voted overwhelmingly in favor of strike action, with 80.7% of those who returned their ballot papers voting in support. The strike action proceeded in two phases: firstly, a three-day walkout that began on March 20th, followed by a four-day strike commencing on March 27th. The strikes caused significant disruption to the airline's services, with hundreds of flights being canceled, leading to travel chaos for thousands of passengers and financial losses for the airline. British Airways, on the other hand, accused Unite of holding the company and its customers 'to ransom' and urged the union to reconsider its tactics. Despite the impact of the strikes, the dispute remained unresolved for an extended period, with further strikes and legal battles continuing well into 2010 and 2011. Eventually, in May 2011, both parties came to a provisional agreement in which British Airways agreed to reinstate staff travel perks that had been withdrawn due to the strike action, and Unite agreed to end the industrial action. The deal also included terms on job security, pay scales, and working conditions. This marked the end of a long and costly conflict, showcasing the complexities that can arise when labor unions and employers disagree on the appropriate course of action during times of economic hardship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: China has released a second giant panda bred in captivity into the wild after giving it special survival training, state-run media say.","output":"Title: China's Successful Release of a Second Captive-Bred Giant Panda into the Wild Introduction China has achieved another milestone in its efforts to conserve and protect the endangered giant panda species. The country has successfully released a second giant panda bred in captivity into the wild, having provided it with specialized survival training. The initiative, as reported by state-run media, demonstrates the nation's commitment to wildlife conservation and its focus on enhancing the population of this cherished and iconic species. Specialized Survival Training Before the release, the captive-bred giant panda underwent an intensive and unique training program designed to equip it with essential survival skills. This training included teaching the panda to forage for food, identify and avoid predators, and protect itself from potential threats in the wild. The survival training also involved acclimatizing the panda to the environment it would face after its release. This was achieved by gradually introducing it to the natural conditions, flora, and fauna of its new habitat and providing a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem it would become a part of. Achievements and Implications The successful release of the second captive-bred giant panda into the wild serves as a major accomplishment for China's wildlife conservation efforts. It highlights the effectiveness of the specialized survival training program in preparing captive-bred animals for life in the wild. Moreover, it exemplifies the potential of such programs to contribute to the long-term conservation of endangered species. This achievement also has global implications, as it showcases a viable method to rehabilitate and reintroduce captive-bred animals into their natural habitats. By sharing their knowledge, expertise, and best practices, China's wildlife conservationists can inspire and guide other countries working towards the preservation and recovery of endangered species. The Future of Giant Panda Conservation The successful release of the second captive-bred giant panda serves as a testament to China's dedication to protecting and conserving this beloved species. The nation aims to continue on this trajectory, investing in research, monitoring the progress of released pandas, and refining their survival training programs. However, conservation efforts do not stop at reintroduction. The long-term protection of the giant panda also depends on the conservation and restoration of their habitats, as well as ongoing research and collaboration with international partners. Conclusion China's recent accomplishment of releasing a second captive-bred giant panda into the wild signifies a significant step forward in the conservation of this iconic species. The specialized survival training provided to the panda reflects the potential of such initiatives in preparing captive-bred animals for life in the wild, contributing to their long-term survival and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting Battle of Eckmühl, forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the Danube and into Bohemia.

Article: We have two daughters: Kristen is seven years old and Kelly is four. Last Sunday evening, we invited some people home for dinner. I dressed them nicely for the party, and told them that their job was to join Mommy in answering the door when the bell rang. Mommy would introduce them to the guests, and then they would take the guests' coats upstairs and put them on the bed in the second bedroom. The guests arrived. I introduced my two daughters to each of them. The adults were nice and kind and said how lucky we were to have such good kids. Each of the guests made a particular fuss over Kelly, the younger one, admiring her dress, her hair and her smile. They said she was a remarkable girl to be carrying coats upstairs at her age. I thought to myself that we adults usually _ the younger one because she's the one who seems more easily hurt. We do it with the best of intentions. But we seldom think of how it might affect the other child. I was a little worried that Kristen would feel she was being outshined. I was about to serve dinner when I realized that she had been missing for twenty minutes. I ran upstairs and found her in the bedroom, crying.

South Sister, also known as \\"Charity\\", is the tallest volcano of the trio, standing at 10,363 feet (3,159 m). The eruptive products range from basaltic andesite to rhyolite and rhyodacite. It is a predominantly rhyolitic stratovolcano overlying an older shield structure. Its modern structure is no more than 50,000 years old, and it last erupted about 2,000 years ago. Although its first eruptive events from 50,000 to 30,000 years ago were predominantly rhyolitic, between 38,000 and 32,000 years ago the volcano began to alternate between dacitic/rhyodacitic and rhyolitic eruptions. The volcano built a broad andesitic cone, forming a steep summit cone of andesite about 27,000 years ago. South Sister remained dormant for 15,000 years, after which its composition shifted from dacitic to more rhyolitic lava. An eruptive episode about 2,200 years ago, termed the Rock Mesa eruptive cycle, first spread volcanic ash from flank vents from the south and southwest flanks, followed by a thick rhyolite lava flow. Next, the Devils Hill eruptive cycle consisted of explosive ash eruptions followed by viscous rhyolitic lava flows. Unlike the previous eruptive period, it was caused by the intrusion of a dike of new silicic magma that erupted from 20 vents on the southeast side and from a smaller line on the north side. These eruptions generated pyroclastic flows and lava domes from vents on the northern, southern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the volcano. These relatively recent, postglacial eruptions suggest the presence of a silicic magma reservoir under South Sister, one that could perhaps lead to future eruptions. Unlike its sister peaks, South Sister has an uneroded summit crater about 0.25 mi (0.40 km) in diameter that holds a small crater lake known as Teardrop Pool, the highest lake in Oregon. Its cone consists of basaltic andesite along with red scoria and tephra, with exposed black and red inner walls made of scoria. Hodge Crest, a false peak, formed between 28,000 and 24,000 years ago, roughly around the same...","output":"time as the main summit cone. It remains visible on the southwest side of the mountain. South Sister's red scoria and tephra cone have made it a visually distinct and notable peak in the Cascade Range, attracting climbers and geologists alike.

I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview. Dennis Quaid was one reason, but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me. People talk about this as a movie for kids, but I think it's a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging, infirm parents, our own mortality, our kids growing up and leaving us, and all the other things we never thought would happen to us.  The movie doesn't fall into the trap of tragedy; it's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life.  Quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good, and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful, layered performance. The camera-work is slow and sweet.

The reviewer describes the film as a \\"humanist\\" and \\"gently political\\" meditation, which indicates that the movie showcases a profound understanding of human values and touches upon political themes in a subtle and thoughtful manner. The choice of words here (humanist and gently) highlights that the film resonates with the audience on an emotional and intellectual level, possibly provoking meaningful discussions and contemplation.

This implies that the film delves into the complexities of human nature, enhancing empathy within the viewers and allowing for a unique learning experience, which is usually seen as a positive aspect of a movie. Furthermore, the reviewer mentions that the movie is \\"gently political,\\" suggesting that the political themes are not explicitly overbearing or dogmatic, but rather subtly integrated into the narrative of the film. This could imply that the movie skillfully weaves together a story that addresses societal or political issues without alienating or polarizing the audience.

Article: In 1975 the US DOT conservatively identified a 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS review of the DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase by as much as 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities.

Military Rank: Khatami held a high rank in the Iranian military, specifically as the Commander of the Iranian Air Force. This position suggests he had considerable experience and skills in military aviation and leadership.    b. Recognitions and Awards: Khatami held the title CVO, which stands for Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, a British knighthood order conferred upon individuals who have served the British monarchy in a personal capacity. This implies that Khatami had strong connections and made significant contributions to the British Crown, possibly through diplomatic or military cooperation between Iran and the United Kingdom. 3. Connections to the Iranian Royal Family:    a. Advisory Role: Mohammad Amir Khatami was an advisor to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last king of Iran who ruled from 1941 until 1979. As an advisor, Khatami likely had influence and provided counsel on military, political, or other matters requiring his expertise in the Air Force or international relations.    b.

Answer this question: who captained the indian cricket team to its first odi world cup victory in 1983??","output":"The Indian cricket team was captained by Kapil Dev to its first ODI (One Day International) World Cup victory in 1983. Born as Kapil Dev Ramlal Nikhanj on January 6, 1959, in Chandigarh, India, he was an all-rounder who became one of the most prominent and influential cricketers in Indian cricket history. Kapil Dev's career spanned a period from 1978-1994, during which he represented India in 131 Test matches and 225 ODIs. Being an excellent batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, he played an instrumental role in bringing success to the Indian cricket team in the 1983 World Cup. The 1983 World Cup, officially known as the Prudential Cup '83, was the third edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup and took place in England from June 9 to June 25, 1983. It consisted of a total of 27 matches, and eight teams participated in the tournament. These teams were England, India, West Indies, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe. Kapil Dev, as the captain of the Indian team, led from the front to inspire his team in the tournament. He scored 303 runs and took 12 wickets, contributing both with the bat and the ball. His unbeaten 175 against Zimbabwe in a group-stage match at Tunbridge Wells ranks as one of the most memorable innings in the history of the World Cup. This innings is significant as it came at a time when India was struggling at 17/5, and it eventually led to a victory, which was crucial in ensuring India's place in the semi-finals. The Indian team reached the finals of the 1983 World Cup where they faced the strong West Indies side, led by Clive Lloyd. The West Indies team was a powerhouse in world cricket at the time, having won both earlier editions of the World Cup in 1975 and 1979. Few expected India to pull off an upset in the finals, but Kapil Dev's leadership steered the team to victory. India batted first in the final and managed to score only 183 runs. West Indies, in response, was cruising towards victory at 50/1. However, the Indian bowlers, led by Mohinder Amarnath and Madan Lal, struck back and bundled out the mighty West Indies side for 140 runs. Mohinder Amarnath was declared the 'Man of the Match' for his match-winning all-round performance of 26 runs with the bat and 3 wickets for 12 runs with the ball in the final. The 1983 World Cup victory by the Indian cricket team, captained by Kapil Dev, remains a momentous event in Indian sports history. It not only boosted the morale of the team but also ignited a passion for cricket in the country, effectively changing the course of Indian cricket for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.Island Records urged Drake to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as \\"unbelievable amounts\\" of cannabis and exhibiting \\"the first signs of psychosis\\", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: \\"This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.\\".

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: \\"Colour\\" and \\"color\\",\\"favourite\\" and \\"favorite\\"... Have you ever wondered why Americans spell those words without a \\"u\\"? Is it because they are lazy? Of course not. In fact,the difference in spelling was created by Noah Webster (1758-1843). He is a teacher who reformed English to make American identity stronger. Linguists   celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16. After the Revolutionary War (1775~ 1783),Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary,rather than rely on British versions  . He dropped the British \\"u\\" in some words. And he changed \\"centre\\" into \\"center\\" for children to learn English by spelling words more like they sounded. Webster wasn't shy about expressing his opinions. In defining   preposterous (unreasonable),he wrote: \\"A republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\\" Webster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom. \\"He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,\\"said Joshua Kendall,who is working on a biography   about Webster. \\"He at last bonded  us through our language.\\" Question: Why did Noah Webster create these differences in his dictionary?

D: Because he wanted American English to have its own characteristics. A:","output":"D: Because he wanted American English to have its own characteristics. Noah Webster created these differences in spelling to establish a distinct American identity and to differentiate American English from British English. By making these changes, Webster aimed to give the United States a sense of linguistic unity and cultural independence. His efforts were focused on helping a newly formed nation come together and reinforcing their unique identity through their language, rather than solely relying on British versions of the language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: when do niles and daphne finally get together?","output":"The characters of Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce) and Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves) from the popular American sitcom \\"Frasier\\" have one of the most beloved love stories in television history. Throughout its 11 seasons (1993-2004), viewers witnessed Niles' unrequited love for Daphne, his brother's live-in housekeeper and therapist, and awaited eagerly for the beloved characters to finally get together. Niles was love-struck by Daphne the first moment he saw her in the pilot episode, but his admiration from afar continued for seven seasons while he was trapped in an unhappy marriage with Maris Crane (who is often referred to but never appears on screen). The relationship between Niles and Daphne finally begins to evolve in the seventh season. The precise turning point comes during the three-part finale of Season 7, \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue\\". In \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue – Part 1,\\" Niles helps Daphne try on her wedding dress for her upcoming marriage to Donny Douglas (Saul Rubinek). Overcome by emotion, Niles confesses his feelings to Daphne, leading them to share a passionate kiss. Despite this revelation, Daphne goes ahead with her wedding plans to Donny in \\"Something Borrowed, Someone Blue – Part 2,\\" and Niles tries to suppress his feelings and support her decision. However, just before she is about to get married, Daphne confesses to Niles that she might have feelings for him, too. Inspired by her admission, Niles cancels his own wedding to Mel (Jane Adams), a woman he had begun dating after his divorce from Maris, to be with Daphne. The subsequent eighth season is then dedicated to the evolving relationship between Niles and Daphne as they navigate the repercussions of their actions – both dealing with failed engagements to their respective partners. Thus, Niles and Daphne officially become a couple during the end of Season 7 and the beginning of Season 8, culminating towards their eventual marriage in Season 10's \\"The Ring Cycle\\".

To demonstrate otherwise, Douvier's aide Guy Algo (Tony Beckley) suggests a show of force with the murder of the famous Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers). Unfortunately for Douvier, his first attempt at bombing Clouseau fails, and the subsequent attempt by Chinese martial artist 'Mr. Chong' (an uncredited appearance by the founder of American Kenpo, Ed Parker) is thwarted when Clouseau successfully fights him off (believing him to be Clouseau's valet Cato (Burt Kwouk), who has orders to keep his employer alert with random attacks). Douvier tries again by posing as an informant to lure Clouseau into a trap, but the Chief Inspector's car and clothes are stolen by transvestite criminal Claude Russo (Sue Lloyd), who is unknowingly killed by Douvier's men instead. Subsequently, Douvier and the French public believe Clouseau is dead; as a result of this assumption, Clouseau's ex-boss, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), is restored to sanity and is released from the lunatic asylum to perform the investigation (though he was seemingly disintegrated in the previous film).
