Please answer the following question: Title: Great introductory wine book Product review: Kevin's book is great in that it is short and concise, yet at the same time covers practically every wine making region and wine type and also offers recommendations for wine/food combinations and good vintage years. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the fact it was published in the early 80's...it's a little outdated on recommending good vintage years (at least for my pocketbook). It also has a chapter for selecting wines for a restaurant...great if you're a restauranteur, but not very useful if you buy wine for personal consumption. Other than that, highly recommended. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light with some minor reservations. The reviewer finds many positive aspects about Kevin's book, such as its concise yet comprehensive presentation of wine-making regions, wine types, and recommended wine/food pairings. They appreciate that it offers guidance on good vintage years, even if the information might be a bit outdated due to the book's publication in the early 80s. The reviewer also highlights the usefulness of the chapter focused on selecting wines for restaurants, but they note that this information might not be as relevant for those purchasing wine for personal consumption. This minor critique does not detract significantly from the overall favorable tone of the review. In general, the reviewer appears to highly recommend the book, despite not awarding it a full 5 stars. The minor drawbacks they mention do not seem to tarnish the overall value of the book as an introductory guide to wine, and the positive aspects they describe create a mostly flattering portrayal of the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: In the early 2000s, Flash was widely installed on desktop computers, and was commonly used to display interactive web pages, online games, and to playback video and audio content. In 2005, YouTube was founded by former PayPal employees, and it used Flash Player as a means to display compressed video content on the web. Between 2000 and 2010, numerous businesses used Flash-based websites to launch new products, or to create interactive company portals. Notable users include Nike, Hewlett-Packard, Nokia, General Electric, World Wildlife Fund, HBO, Cartoon Network, Disney and Motorola. After Adobe introduced hardware-accelerated 3D for Flash , Flash websites saw a growth of 3D content for product demonstrations and virtual tours. In 2007, YouTube offered videos in HTML5 format to support the iPhone and iPad, which did not support Flash Player. After a controversy with Apple, Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile, focussing its efforts on Adobe AIR applications and HTML5 animation. In 2015, Google introduced Google Swiffy to convert Flash animation to HTML5, a tool Google would use to automatically convert Flash web ads for mobile devices. In 2015, YouTube switched to HTML5 technology on all devices, however it will preserve the Flash-based video player for older web browsers. Question: Why did Adobe stop developing Flash Player for Mobile? Answer:","output":"Adobe stopped developing Flash Player for Mobile because there was a disagreement with Apple. Apple's iPhone and iPad did not support Flash Player. So, Adobe decided to focus on a different thing called Adobe AIR applications and making animations using something called HTML5, which worked nicely on phones and tablets. This was because HTML5 was a more flexible and modern way to show animations and videos on mobile devices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As part of providing a detailed answer, we will break this analysis into three specific components. 1. Clarity: The language used in this review is quite vague and unclear, as it does not provide any specific details about the issue or product in question. The question \\"Why many functions could not run\\" seems to inquire about the reasons for a possible malfunction or limitation. However, the lack of context makes it difficult for the reader to understand what functions or product this refers to. Clarity is an essential component of a helpful review, and in this case, it is significantly lacking. Clarity rating: 1 (least favorable). 2. Informativeness: An effective review generally provides valuable and insightful information to the reader, whether it's positive or negative feedback. However, this review doesn't offer any useful information about the product, nor on the specific issue the reviewer may be experiencing. As a reader, it is impossible to gauge the reviewer's concerns or recommendations without further details. Informativeness rating: 1 (least favorable). 3. Relevance: A high-quality and reliable review should be relevant to the product or service being reviewed to provide beneficial insights to the readers. In this case, due to the absence of specific context, it is almost impossible to determine the relevance of this review to a particular product or service. As a result, the potential relevance of the review cannot be assessed or considered. Relevance rating: 1 (least favorable). Overall rating: After evaluating the review in terms of clarity, informativeness, and relevance, an average rating can be derived. Since all three factors scored the least favorable rating of 1, the overall rating for this review can also be concluded as 1 (least favorable). The review is neither clear nor informative, and its relevance cannot be determined – leading the review to be unhelpful for a reader seeking useful information or insight for a product or service."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

Kurt Friedrich Godel (UK: , US: ; German: ['kUat 'go:dl] ( listen); April 28, 1906 - January 14, 1978) was an Austrian, and later American, logician, mathematician, and philosopher. Godel was born April 28, 1906, in Brunn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) into the ethnic German family of Rudolf Godel (1874-1929), the manager of a textile factory, and Marianne Godel (nee Handschuh, 1879-1966). Throughout his life, Godel would remain close to his mother; their correspondence was frequent and wide-ranging. At the time of his birth the city had a German-speaking majority which included his parents. His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised Protestant. The ancestors of Kurt Godel were often active in Brunn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Godel was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the \\"Brunner Mannergesangverein\\".  Godel automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of World War I. According to his classmate Klepetar, like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenlander, \\"Godel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia\\". He chose to become an Austrian citizen at age 23. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Godel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After World War II, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.  In his family, young Kurt was known as Herr Warum (\\"Mr. Why\\") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Godel suffered from \\"frequent episodes of poor health,\\" which would continue for his entire life.  Godel attended the Evangelische Volksschule, a Lutheran school in Brunn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna to go to medical school at the University of Vienna. During his teens, Kurt studied Gabelsberger shorthand, Goethe's Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.

Yes Based on the provided context, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that Medesano is in Parma province which is in Emilia-Romagna which is in Italy. This conclusion can be arrived at by analyzing the given information in detail. Firstly, the context states that Medesano is a \\"comune\\" (municipality) in the Province of Parma. This confirms that Medesano is located within the Parma province, establishing the first part of the hypothesis as true. Secondly, the context informs us that Parma is in the Italian region Emilia-Romagna. This piece of information links Medesano not only to Parma but also to the larger region of Emilia-Romagna, making the second part of the hypothesis accurate. Lastly, the context specifies that both Bologna, which is 100 km southeast of Medesano, and Parma, which is 15 km northeast of Medesano, are situated in the country of Italy. This geographic description of Medesano's location relative to other known Italian cities further confirms its placement within the national boundaries of Italy.

We have this equation: -5222*m - 670537 = -179669. Our goal is to find what number 'm' is equal to. Just like finding the missing piece in a puzzle. Step 1: First, we need to get the \\"m\\" all by itself. There's a -670537 that we need to move away from the left side of the equation.

There are several factors that contributed to this negative experience, which I will discuss in detail. **Atmosphere and Ambiance:** Upon entering The Mellow Meadow, I was left unimpressed by the ambiance. The place appeared cluttered and disorganized, and the noise level was quite distracting. The lighting was harsh and not suitable for a cozy atmosphere, making it impossible to feel at ease. The seating arrangements were cramped, leaving virtually no room for privacy or comfortable movement. Overall, the atmosphere failed to meet the standards set by an establishment that boasts a relaxing and enjoyable experience. **Food and Beverage:** Food is the heart of a great dining experience, and unfortunately, The Mellow Meadow fell short in various aspects. The menu lacked variety outside of a few mainstream selections. Many signature dishes were unavailable, claiming they were \\"out of stock\\" even though we dined during their peak hours. My order arrived cold and appeared overcooked, indicating an extended wait time from the kitchen to the table. Additionally, portions were meager in comparison to the relatively steep prices. The beverages and cocktails were mediocre at best. The drink choices were limited, and although the presentation was satisfactory, there was little else to be impressed about. My cocktail was predominantly filled with ice, diluting the already bland flavors, and by the time I received my drink, half of it had already melted away. **Service:** Regrettably, the subpar service significantly tainted my dining experience at The Mellow Meadow. The staff appeared to be untrained and, at times, overwhelmed. When taking orders, my server seemed uncertain about menu items and was unable to offer suitable recommendations. The wait time between placing the order and receiving the food was unreasonable, and empty glasses were never refilled. Furthermore, our requests for condiments, napkins, or additional utensils were either forgotten or took an incredible amount of time to be fulfilled. In addition, the bill was incorrect, and when we sought assistance in rectifying the error, the response was unapologetic and almost dismissive. It felt as if the employees were more eager to clear the tables and bring in new customers than to ensure that their current patrons were satisfied. **Cleanliness:** The overall cleanliness of The Mellow Meadow was lacking. As I mentioned earlier, the space felt cluttered and disorganized, but beyond that, there were visible smudges on the cutlery, fingerprints on the glassware, and crumbs scattered across the floor. The restrooms also left much to be desired in terms of hygiene and tidiness. In conclusion, my visit to The Mellow Meadow was a largely disappointing experience. The uninviting atmosphere, uninspiring food and beverages, poor service, and lack of cleanliness significantly marred my visit, leading me to conclude that this establishment is not worth the high price tag it carries.

Context: Emperor Zhang's (r. 75–88 AD) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him.

The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff., can you guess it ?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last names of the two people hired to join Opeth after De Farfalla and Nordin left? ?  Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

Paying it forward is all about selflessly performing good deeds for others without the expectation of receiving anything in return.

Please answer the following question: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village harmed fewer corals?  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Hammond is the village that harmed fewer corals. This is because they decided to stop all sand mining operations a few months after starting to protect the environment. Soundville, on the other hand, continued with their sand mining operations which cause erosion, negatively impact local wildlife, increase water turbidity, and are harmful to organisms like corals that need sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1]  and the situation: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.  Answer the following question: Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas? Answer:","output":"As a consequence of their agendas, Niger is likely to be more developed than Nigeria. Niger's focus on developing infrastructure and communications technology will have several positive effects on its development. Improved infrastructure facilitates better transportation, which in turn supports trade, economic growth, and accessibility to essential services and resources. Enhanced communications technology, on the other hand, connects people more efficiently and promotes the sharing of information, ideas, and opportunities, further boosting economic growth and development. In contrast, Nigeria's decision not to prioritize these areas may result in slower progress, decreased accessibility, and limited opportunities for its citizens to connect with the wider world or for businesses to readily trade internationally. As distance decay has less of an impact in areas with upgraded infrastructure and communication technologies, Niger would benefit more from the globalized world and maintain stronger economic and political relations with its neighbors and other international actors, putting it on a better development trajectory than Nigeria."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Morrison to say that 'coalition policies effectively stopped the boats' Speech comes just days after asylum seeker held on Manus Island died. Critics claim filthy conditions to blame for Iranian developing septiceamia.","output":"Title: Immigration Minister Claims Coalition Policies Stopped the Boats Amidst Controversy Over Asylum Seeker's Death on Manus Island In a major speech to the National Press Club today, Immigration Minister Morrison is set to argue that the coalition government's policies have effectively halted the influx of illegal migrants arriving by boat. The timing of this statement is notable, as it comes just days after the death of a detained asylum seeker on Manus Island. Critics point to this tragedy as evidence that the government's policies are failing to protect the rights and well-being of those seeking asylum, with some claiming that the filthy conditions at the detention center are to blame for the Iranian man's death from septiceamia. Morrison intends to defend the coalition's policies during his speech today, stating that under their watch, the number of \\"boat arrivals\\" has decreased significantly. This is mainly due to the government's strict border control measures and the introduction of offshore processing centers - like the one on Manus Island - in which individuals who arrive illegally by boat are detained. Morrison is expected to argue that these measures demonstrate the government's commitment to protecting Australia's borders and ensuring the country's security.  However, critics argue that such policies have come at the cost of the welfare and dignity of asylum seekers. The recent death of an Iranian man held on Manus Island highlights some of these concerns. Opponents of the government's policies claim that the man developed septiceamia - a life-threatening infection - due to the unsanitary conditions at the detention center. They maintain that this tragic incident could have been prevented if the government prioritized the well-being and humane treatment of asylum seekers over the enforcement of strict border policies. Furthermore, advocacy groups argue that the offshore processing centers themselves are inherently problematic as they often subject detainees to unacceptable living conditions, mental health issues, and limited access to legal resources. They contend that these centers also undermine Australia's international human rights obligations in relation to the treatment of asylum seekers.  In light of these criticisms, Morrison's speech at the National Press Club today is poised to be the epicenter of a larger debate on Australia's immigration policy and the balance between border security and the humane treatment of those seeking asylum. While the immigration minister may argue that the coalition's policies have stopped the boats, opponents will continue to call for a more compassionate and just approach that prioritizes the welfare of the asylum seekers who remain in the country's care. In conclusion, the death of an asylum seeker on Manus Island has sparked renewed debate over the government's immigration policies and their impact on the well-being of those seeking refuge in Australia. As Immigration Minister Morrison defends the coalition's border control measures today, it's important to remember that the conversation surrounding immigration is multifaceted and requires a careful balancing of national security and the protection of human rights. Whether or not Australia can adopt a more compassionate approach in its immigration policy while maintaining its security remains to be seen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His father, Thomas Francis O'Brien, is a physician, epidemiologist, and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. His mother, Ruth O'Brien (nee Reardon), is a retired attorney and former partner at the Boston firm Ropes & Gray. O'Brien attended Brookline High School, where he served as the managing editor of the school newspaper, The Sagamore. Context: On Thursday, January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to get Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night, where O'Brien's ratings had collapsed before Leno's prime time series began. A proposal was made that would see O'Brien remain as host of The Tonight Show, which would be moved to 12:05 am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35 pm On January 10, NBC Universal Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would indeed end at the start of the Winter Olympics on February 12, 2010, and be moved to 11:35 pm following the Olympics coverage. Sources familiar with the situation told the New York Post that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan.  On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \\"I sincerely believe that delaying The Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn't The Tonight Show.\\" On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit The Tonight Show the next day. The deal also granted him 45 million, of which 12 million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left Late Night.  The final Tonight Show with Conan aired January 22, 2010, and featured guests Tom Hanks, Steve Carell (who did an exit interview and shredded Conan's ID badge), Neil Young (singing \\"Long May You Run\\"), and Will Ferrell. For Ferrell's appearance, Conan played guitar with the band and Ferrell sang \\"Free Bird\\" while reprising his SNL cowbell. Ferrell's wife, Viveca Paulin, together with Ben Harper, Beck, and ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, also joined the band for this final performance.  Jay Leno returned to The Tonight Show following NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Under the 45 million deal with NBC, Conan was allowed to start working for another network as soon as September 2010. Conan's rumored next networks ranged anywhere from Fox to Comedy Central. Question: Did they try to keep him or was he forced to leave? Answer:","output":"They tried to make some changes to keep both Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno, by moving their shows around in the schedule. But Conan was not happy with the new plan because it would change the tradition of The Tonight Show. So, he decided to leave and made a deal with NBC to go.

The lower mantle, which is a denser solid layer above the core, is directly in contact with the outer core. By considering the concept of heat conduction, we understand that heat from the hotter region (the core) will transfer to the cooler region (the lower mantle) through direct contact.

This surge can be attributed to several factors, including promising economic data, global market trends, and investment behavior. Market experts and analysts weigh in on the possible implications of this upturn, as well as the future outlook for the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 1. Assessing economic data Recent economic figures released by the government highlight a steady recovery in the Japanese economy, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing and exports. The growth in these key areas has positively impacted investor confidence leading to a bullish trend in Tokyo stocks. 2. Examining global influences Tokyo's stock market has historically been sensitive to global economic shifts. In this case, the upward movement in stocks can also be linked to positive developments in other major markets such as the United States and Europe. As global trade partners continue to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, Tokyo stocks are set to benefit from improved international relations and trade policies. 3. Analyzing investment behavior The increased activity in the Tokyo stock market can be traced back to investors' renewed interest in the Japanese market. Many have shifted their focus back to domestic stocks, seeking opportunities in companies that are set to benefit from the government's efforts to revive the economy and bolster infrastructure. 4. Seeking expert opinions Prominent market analysts have also been voicing their optimism about the Tokyo stock market's upward trajectory. They note that the sustained growth in key industries and the country's commitment to investing in new technologies are likely to propel the market even higher in the near future. 5. Projecting future trends While it's impossible to predict with certainty, the overall sentiment surrounding Tokyo stocks appears to be predominantly positive. It is, however, essential for investors to remain prudent and carefully monitor market conditions, global events, and government policies for any potential shifts that may impact the stock market. In conclusion, the Tokyo stock market's recent upturn can be traced back to a combination of favorable economic data, global market trends, and investor behavior.

I read this background article the other day: Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.  I am facing a new situation today: Two twin sisters were taken to the doctor's office by their parents. It turned out that Mary had hemophilia while Ann didn't have any blood disease.

Her mother tells her a story of a person who wanted to see the ocean; then she explains that sometimes one must learn to see some things (through her mind's eye) without looking. The film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married young woman, trying to perceive some emotion from her husband Jatin. Jatin appears distant and shows little interest in Sita or in being married. Sita is given a perfunctory welcome by Jatin's family. Jatin is in a typical joint family arrangement. He lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his invalid mother (Biji) and the family servant Mundu. Their apartment is on the second floor of a two story dwelling in a crowded marketplace in New Delhi. Ashok and Jatin run a small store (on the first floor) that sells food (for takeout) and rents videotapes. Sita is gradually exposed to various difficulties. She is also in a typical arranged marriage, but she learns that Jatin married her only to put an end to Ashok's incessant nagging. Jatin continues to date his Chinese girlfriend. Sita does not rebuke him for fear that it may bring dishonour to her parents. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is paralysed and without speech after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to Biji (even her hygiene). Sita spends her days slaving in the hot and greasy kitchen, and she finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out dallying with his girlfriend. On the financial front, the store provides a modest income but their expenses are very high and they are unable to expand their business or buy a bigger home. Sita resignedly accepts these difficulties, but yearns to break out of this stifling and hopeless situation. It is later revealed that Radha faces a somewhat similar problem.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Despite Anthony Field's expressed dislike of the term, preferring to refer to it as \\"preserving the good name of The Wiggles\\", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it.  They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business.  As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was \\"not your regular 'corporate culture'\\".  They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education.  They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products, and avoided over-extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image.  They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group.The Wiggles became formally consolidated in 2005. The group's board of directors consisted of the original three members, Paul Field, who has been general manager of operations since the group was formed and their manager since the mid-1990s, and Mike Conway, who had worked for Ernst & Young in England and become their general manager in 2001.  In 2009, the Australian rock band AC/DC knocked The Wiggles, who earned A45 million, from the top of Business Review Weekly's  (BRW) list of top entertainment earners for the first time in four years.

Translate to German","output":"Das ist der Grund, warum ich den Bericht begeistert unterstützt habe, insbesondere den Punkt über Wucher. Die Unterstützung des Berichts, insbesondere des Punktes über den Wucher, kommt aus einer tief verwurzelten Leidenschaft, der Problematik des Wuchers entgegenzuwirken. Der Wucher bezieht sich auf die Praxis, exzessive oder unangemessen hohe Zinsen für Geldverleih zu erheben, was negative Auswirkungen sowohl auf Kreditnehmer als auch auf die Gesamtwirtschaft haben kann. In vielen Fällen kann Wucher dazu führen, dass Kreditnehmer in einen Teufelskreis geraten, bei dem sie immer höher verschuldet sind, weil sie Schwierigkeiten haben, die hohen Zinsen und Gebühren zu begleichen, die mit ihrem Kredit verbunden sind. Das kann häufig dazu führen, dass die finanzielle Situation des Kreditnehmers weiter verschlechtert wird, da sie gezwungen sind, weitere Schulden zu machen, um ihre bestehenden Verbindlichkeiten zu begleichen. In extremen Fällen können Kreditnehmer sogar ihren Arbeitsplatz, ihre Wohnung oder andere lebensnotwendige Ressourcen verlieren, weil sie nicht in der Lage sind, ihre Schulden zurückzuzahlen. Auf einer makroökonomischen Ebene kann Wucher auch negative Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Wirtschaft haben, da er oft eine Verlangsamung des Wirtschaftswachstums, eine Verzerrung von Marktmechanismen und die Ausbeutung von Verbrauchern fördert. All dies kann letztendlich zu einer Verschlechterung der Lebensbedingungen führen und Armut und Ungleichheit erhöhen. Aus diesen Gründen ist es wichtig, Maßnahmen gegen Wucher zu ergreifen und Ressourcen für die Bekämpfung dieser Praktiken bereitzustellen. Der Bericht, den ich unterstütze, enthält eine Reihe von Empfehlungen, die darauf abzielen, sowohl die Kreditnehmer als auch die Kreditgeber zu schützen und die Transparenz im Finanzmarkt zu erhöhen. Einige der empfohlenen Maßnahmen sind beispielsweise die Einführung von Obergrenzen für Zinsen und Gebühren, um die Kreditnehmer vor exzessiven Kosten zu schützen; die Schaffung von klareren und einfacheren Bedingungen für Kredite und Finanzprodukte; die Förderung von finanzieller Bildung, um die Verbraucher besser über ihre Rechte und Verantwortlichkeiten im Finanzmarkt zu informieren; sowie die Unterstützung von alternativen Kreditmodellen, wie beispielsweise Mikrokrediten und Gemeinschaftsbanken, die benachteiligten Bevölkerungsgruppen den Zugang zu Kapital ermöglichen. Die Enthusiastische Unterstützung des Berichts und insbesondere des Punktes über den Wucher zeigt ein tiefes Verständnis und eine feste Überzeugung, dass Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung von Wucher essenziell sind, um das finanzielle Wohlergehen von Einzelpersonen, Familien und der Gesellschaft als Ganzes zu fördern und eine gerechtere und nachhaltigere Wirtschaft zu schaffen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family. Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon.

New York Giants' cornerback Prince Amukamara is enjoying his best season yet - and defensive back Antrel Rolle thinks he knows why. Rolle told NJ.com that it's no coincidence that Amukamara, a devout Catholic who previously said he would abstain from sex until marriage, is playing so well just months after getting hitched. 'He's married, so he's (enjoying some things that he wasn't experiencing before he's married),' he said. 'For a man, that could definitely help him out... He walks around with a little more swagger, which is something that we need, which is something that we love.' Scroll down for video. Wedded bliss: Prince Amukamara, a devout Christian who said he wanted to abstain from sex until marriage, wed wife Pilar earlier this year and since, he has been playing better than ever. Whatever the cause, it's paying off. In  four games, Amukamara, who was picked in the first round of the 2011 draft, has already set a career high with two interceptions, as well as 25 tackles. 'When he goes out there playing, you definitely see him being more aggressive, capitalizing on his opportunities and he's accepting challenges. He's winning those challenges,' Rolle said. His coaches said that the 25-year-old has shown steady improvement in his four-year career. 'Prince is a young man who's improved year in and year out,' coach Tom Coughlin said last week. 'And he's improved this past year to this point.' He would not say outright that having sex was responsible for his latest boost. Success: Amukamara breaks up a pass against Andre Johnson of the Houston Texans on September 21. New man: The couple, who met three years ago, married in Phoenix, Arizona a week after the Super Bowl. Together: They met    at a Manhattan nightclub and he initially did not tell Pilar that he was a footballer player. 'He's just developing more as a man and accepting challenges and being the dominant player that we need him to be that we know he's capable of,' Coughlin said. Amukamara, who hails from Nigeria, has always been open about waiting for marriage before having sex. He also does not drink alcohol. In an interview with Muscle & Fitness last year, he revealed that his clean lifestyle led some of his teammates to call him 'the black Tim Tebow' after his fellow Christian NFL player. He met his now-wife Pilar in a Manhattan nightclub three years ago. In the interview, he said that even though his friends were encouraging him to talk to her, he wasn't sure what to say. Later on, she walked past and he stated talking with her. 'I asked her for her e-mail address because when someone asks for your number, it might be too personal and you might not want to give it,' he said. 'But if you ask for their e-mail address, they'll give it. I was right.' Beautiful: Amukamara, who hails from Nigeria, said he was immediately drawn to Pilar when he saw her. Happy: The couple, seen at the Spider Man premiere, married in Phoenix, Arizona a week after the Super Bowl. But he admitted that he initially hid his job from her. He told the magazine that he has pretended to be a construction worker or a manager at Gap when meeting people in the past - and one teammate has even claimed to be an astronaut. He added that he realized he had to tell Davis the truth when the Giants went to San Francisco for the conference championship. He knew he would have to come clean if he wanted her to visit him. 'So two days later, I said \\"Hey, I play for the Giants\\",' he recalled. 'She thought I meant San Francisco Giants. That's when I thought she might be a keeper.' He proposed to her on stage at a Jabbawockeez show at Luxor Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 19 last year and they married in Phoenix, Arizona in February. See below for video.

Andrew Gary Johns (born 19 May 1974) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer of the 1990s and 2000s. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest players of all time. Hailed as the best halfback in the world for many years, he captained the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League and participated in the team's only two premiership victories in 1997 and 2001, playing a club record 249 games for the Knights. Johns also represented his country at two World Cups, and on one Kangaroo tour, playing in total 21 Test matches for the national side. On 26 August 2007 Johns was arrested for fare evasion on the London Underground, and subsequently found to be in possession of one ecstasy tablet. He was cautioned and released with no further charges. Johns initially claimed that an unknown person had pushed the tablet into his pocket which he later forgot to remove before leaving the crowded venue. This initial statement was met with a great deal of cynicism from both the press and the public. On 30 August, Johns revealed, live on the Footy Show, that he had regularly taken ecstasy throughout his playing career, mainly during the off-season. He claimed he had suffered from depression and bipolar disorder and the drugs helped him in dealing with the high level of psychological 'pressure' associated with his career as an elite sportsman. Not long after the incident he released his 'tell-all' autobiography that went into further details regarding his depression and drug use while playing in the NRL.  The ARU released a press statement shortly after the controversy arose, stating that Johns' drug use was known to the ARU and was a key factor in its decision to not proceed with contractual negotiations in 2004. Brett Robinson, then high-performance unit manager, said that, as well as Johns' age and injury history, the knowledge of his drug taking had been influential in the ARU making its final decision.  When Johns was named the Best Player of the Last 30 Years in early 2008, the accolade allayed concern that Johns' shock drug admission the year before had tarnished his remarkable efforts on the field for Newcastle, NSW and Australia. On receiving the award he was quoted as saying his health was now in great shape. \\"I'm at the best place I have been in a long time,\\" he said. \\"It's not until you step away that I realise all the pressure I was under, I'm not going to miss playing at all.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did this have an impact on his career?","output":"Yes, the incident had an impact on his career.

When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father re-entered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments. Durant has one sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne. Context: Prior to the start of the 2010-11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately 86 million. For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game. Behind his leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.  On February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets. At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. He finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title. Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed. In Game 1 of the first round against the Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining. Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the Finals. For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.  With a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012-13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50-40-90 club. Finishing the year with a 60-22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason. Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility, averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs, but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, indeed the article is full of a plethora of interesting aspects. 1. Durant's Early Life: Born in Washington, D.C., Durant lived through challenging family circumstances. His father left when he was an infant, and consequently, he was primarily raised by his mother and grandmother. Despite this, by age 13, Durant's father re-entered his life and supported his passion for basketball by travelling with him to different tournaments. This shows Durant's resilience and early exposure to basketball that might have played an instrumental role in shaping his future career.  2. Durant’s Contract Extension: A vital aspect discussed in the article is Durant’s extension of the contract with the Thunder for approx 86 million for five years in the 2010-11 season. This presents Durant's commitment to his team and his rising market value as a supremely skilled player. 3. His Brilliant Performances: Durant's exceptional skill as a player is underscored by his consistent performances. His prolific scoring record made him lead the NBA in scoring for two consecutive years. He scored his career-first 50-point game in the 2011-12 season, and remarkably, he maintained an average of 28 points per game in three straight seasons. 4. His Leadership: Durant led his team, the Thunder, to win 55 games, earning the fourth seed in the Western Conference. Despite the defeat in the Conference Finals, his leadership noteworthy. 5. Durant's Recognition: Durant's significant contributions were recognized when he was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award. In the NBA Finals, he led all players scoring an average of 30.6 points per game, a testament to his striking abilities as a scorer. 6.

At a young age, he achieved this remarkable feat, showcasing his excellent scoring proficiency. 7. Challenges Faced: The article highlights Durant's career's challenging phase when his key teammate, Russell Westbrook, suffered an injury during the 2012-13 playoffs. This incident resulted in Durant assuming more responsibilities. Even though they were eventually eliminated, Durant's phenomenal performance with a career-high average of 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs was impressive, once again showing his ability to rise to the occasion and lead the team.

The first sentence describes a South Africa meridionalis, which is a small jumping spider that inhabits Tanzania. Jumping spiders are part of the Salticidae family and are characterized by their ability to jump relatively long distances in comparison to their body size.

Given the below context:  Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

The Rebellion of Arbanon in 1257-1259 was a revolt of the Principality of Arbanon  against the Empire of Nicaea and in favour of the rival Despotate of Epirus. Arbanon had long been an autonomous principality within Epirus, and the Nicaean conquest around 1255 was resented. The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor Constantine Chabaron. The rebels were active in Durrë, Ohrid, Debar and Mat. The Nicaean forces were under the command of George Akropolites, who described the events himself in his history. In the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left Thessaloniki and by way of Kastoria entered Kounavia, Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, Michael II, and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in Kanina. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to Prilep and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos. The most decisive battle was fought in the city of Devol. After suffering heavy losses, the Byzantines were finally able to control the situation, but in the years 1260-1270 the Albanian rulers revolted again in the region of Durrës.

Jesse Ventura is adorned with his signature feather boa and glitter sunglasses by professional wrestler Chyna, during a World Wrestling Federation... (Associated Press)      REDONDO BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Chyna, the WWE star who in the 1990s became one of the best-known and most-popular female professional wrestlers in history, has died, authorities said.      Police in Southern California said they were responding to a 911 call from a friend of former WWE wrestler Chyna when they found her dead in her Redondo Beach apartment.      A friend had gone Wednesday to check on Chyna, whose real name is Joan Marie Laurer, after she had failed to answer her phone for a few days, Redondo Beach police said in a statement. The friend told the 911 operator that Laurer wasn't breathing.      The 46-year-old Laurer was dead when officers arrived, police said. Several media outlets report that she was 45.      Neither police nor coroner's officials have released any cause of death.      A coroner's investigator was still at the location with the body late Wednesday night, according to Los Angeles County coroner's Lt. Larry Dietz. He said he had no further information on the death.      The tall, muscle-bound, raven-haired Laurer billed herself as the \\"9th Wonder of the World\\" because her wrestling predecessor Andre the Giant had already called himself the eighth.      She was a member of the wrestling squad that dubbed itself \\"D-Generation X,\\" often wrestled against men and at one point was the WWE women's champion.      On her official website a statement posted Wednesday night reads, \\"Today we lost a true icon, a real life superhero. Joanie Laurer aka Chyna, the 9th Wonder of the World has passed away. She will live forever in the memories of her millions of fans and all of us that loved her.\\"      Laurer was a native of Rochester, New York and graduated from the University of Tampa in Florida before taking up wrestling.

Though she did not again win the Sulman, she was successful in having works hung in that competition on many occasions, including the 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950 shows. Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart. The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Girl With Still Life.Although Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions, others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the Herald. Describing her 1950 exhibition at the Macquarie Galleries, one critic considered it \\"one of the most stimulating and refreshing that has been seen here for a long time\\" and that \\"She paints with a strong, sombre palette and her forms are sculptured with great decision.

Myself and Riah travelled, I would say all the way out too Wheelers Hill, but it’s really not that far away, unless you live on the North side, which we both do. Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire’s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it’s a pretty beautiful place, it’s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that’s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I’d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah’s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it’s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I’d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people’s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot. Our setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire’s front right and one on Claire’s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR’s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire’s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire’s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne’s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler.  Now, I have a new situation: Sarah just finished reheating two leftover chicken sandwiches in the microwave that she had made the previous night. She takes them out and leaves them on the kitchen counter while she pours herself a glass of wine. Her roommate, Carla, comes out and decides to take a more scientific approach toward the chicken sandwiches. Carla sees that the average kinetic energy in sandwich A is higher than the average kinetic energy in sandwich B. Carla then takes a big bite out of both sandwiches and returns to her room as if nothing happened.  Answer this question please: Which sandwich was in the microwave for a longer period of time? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Sandwich A has a higher average kinetic energy than Sandwich B. Since temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the matter, it means that Sandwich A has a higher temperature than Sandwich B.

Suddenly, he heard a train coming towards him from point A with constant sound of its horn. Eventually, it reached very close to him at point B.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which point would have lower frequency, point D or point E?  Hint: Look at the police car in Figure below . The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect .

Context: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Those who focus mainly on their career are probably: Options:  A. As stressed as most people  B. Less stressed than most people  C. More stressed than most people  D. not enough information A:","output":"C. More stressed than most people The context provided indicates that individuals who have an all-consuming focus on their career often experience a chaotic lifestyle that does not produce the happiness they hoped to achieve and that professional burnout from chronic stress can have debilitating effects. On the other hand, living a balanced life filled with varied experiences has been found to potentially provide incredible benefits. The overall message of the passage suggests that those who focus mainly on their career are more likely to experience higher levels of stress than those who pursue a more balanced lifestyle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Or should they be expansive, and invite a wide circle to share one's status reports? (Too broad a channel would mean a depersonalized cohort.) The breakthrough that enabled Twitter to become the wildly successful service it is now came from a twist that was much more significant than even its founders knew: They made it possible to \\"follow\\" someone's messages without requiring permission. Essentially you would take out a subscription to someone's Twitter stream. You would follow your best friend or your brother in the same way you would follow Barack Obama, DeSean Jackson or the New York Times. This was a break from the traditional two-way agreement that ruled communications in previous social systems. This changed Twitter from an asynchronous instant messaging system into a hybrid of a social network and broadcast medium. \\"The relationship model was something that we debated a lot,\\" says Evan Williams, who headed the company (Odeo) that created Twitter. \\"In the first version, by default you were private.\\" (This quote is from a conversation I had with Williams in 2009, when I was working on a story for Wired.) But then Dorsey's team came up with the idea that you could follow someone without them following you. \\"That was really important,\\" says Williams. \\"From my perspective, I wanted something like a blog relationship model. What I thought was beautiful about blogs as opposed to e-mail or anything else is it's completely up to the recipient of the information whether or not they consume it.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. Twitter's early decision-making focused on balancing privacy and intimacy with utility and a broad user base. 2. A key breakthrough for Twitter was allowing users to \\"follow\\" others without requiring permission, turning it into a hybrid of a social network and broadcast medium. 3. Evan Williams, the head of the company that created Twitter, emphasized the importance of the \\"follow\\" feature and wanted a similar relationship model to blogs, where users can choose whether or not to consume the content. 4. This shift transformed Twitter into the wildly successful platform it is today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The movie, based on Stephen King's novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\\" serves as a vivid and enlightening portrayal of the possibility of hope and unwavering courage in the face of overwhelming despair and adversity. The movie, set in the late 1940s and spanning over two decades, tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a successful banker wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to two consecutive life terms in the notorious Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy encounters characters such as Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a seasoned prison contraband smuggler and his eventual best friend. Expertly directed by Frank Darabont, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" maintains a steady and masterful pace as it unravels the intricate relationships between the characters and presents a riveting examination of the power dynamics within the turbulent prison environment. The movie explores themes of institutionalization, friendship, corruption, and ultimately, resilience and hope. Tim Robbins delivers a powerful yet subtle performance as Andy Dufresne, a character who exudes ingenuity, resilience, and quiet determination. Standing alongside him, Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is nothing short of enchanting. Freeman imbues his character with wisdom, humor, and a dignified sense of conscience while providing a soul-stirring voiceover that serves as the narrative's backbone. The film's supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the menacing Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the ruthless Captain Hadley, each contribute to the movie's evocative atmosphere. A powerful score by Thomas Newman further enhances the emotive nature of the film, with several touching moments elevated by the sublime musical composition. The climax of \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is among the most satisfying and uplifting endings in cinematic history, offering audiences a beautiful, cathartic release after an intense journey through darkness and despair.

The technical aspects of the film, including the cinematography by Roger Deakins, are executed flawlessly and contribute to the overall brilliance of \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" The carefully crafted visuals and the concise editing by Richard Francis-Bruce work harmoniously to bring the story to life, never detracting from the captivating narratives at play. In conclusion, \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is a superbly realized and emotionally stirring film that transcends the constraints of the prison drama genre. Impeccable storytelling, unforgettable performances, and a powerful character-driven narrative make this movie an enduring classic that will continue to captivate and inspire audiences for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: Yes, and I am not proud of it, but grief makes you do some really stupid things. My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did.

He claimed his rights were violated when he was moved to a \\"prison within a prison\\" at HMP Belmarsh, amid fears he was mounting an escape bid. Mr Justice Bean ruled it was a \\"reasonable\\" decision at the time. Gunn, 47, made millions as the gangland ruler of the Bestwood estate in Nottingham until he was jailed for conspiracy to murder in 2006. The Stirlands were found shot dead at their bungalow in Trusthorpe in a revenge killing after Mrs Stirland's son killed an associate of the Gunn family. In May 2013, he was transferred from HMP Frankland in County Durham to what was described by a national newspaper as a \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"-style cell. The court heard Gunn had arranged for an inmate to pass a note to a prison officer on which was written the address of the officer's disabled brother, telling him, \\"Well, you now work for me and Colin Gunn\\". Gunn's barrister, Philip Rule, argued that the four months in top security unlawfully interfered with his ability to receive visitors and therefore his right to respect for private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. The judge said that \\"it was a reasonable decision at the time\\", and ordered Gunn to pay Â£1,000 towards the government's legal costs. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"Sure, let me tell you a simplified story based on this: Colin Gunn is a man who did some really bad things. He made a lot of money by being a leader of a group of people who behaved badly. In 2004, he planned to hurt two people named John and Joan Stirland, because Joan's son had hurt someone in Colin's group. Colin got caught for this bad plan and was put in jail in 2006. In jail, he was being naughty, so they had to move him to a more secure part of the prison because they were scared he might try to escape. They moved him to a really really strong part of the prison which was also like a prison within a big prison.  Within the jail, Colin was able to get a note to one of the people who worked in jail, trying to scare them to work for him. This added to the reasons why they had to keep him in the stronger part of the prison.  Now Colin's lawyer, a man named Philip Rule, was upset that Colin was kept in the stronger part of prison because it was really hard for Colin's friends and family to visit him there. The lawyer thought this was not fair and good for Colin's personal and family life. The judge, who is like the boss in court, said that it was okay and the right thing to move Colin to the more secure part of the prison considering his behavior.

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music.  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today.  - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.  - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk.  - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres  including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.  - The Netherlands  is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament. The name \\"Holland\\" is used to refer informally to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.  - Metal Blade Records is a heavy metal record label founded by Brian Slagel in 1982. The U.S. corporate office for Metal Blade is located in Agoura Hills, California. It also has offices in Germany, Japan, Canada, and the UK. The label is distributed in the U.S. by RED Distribution, and in Canada by Sony Music Entertainment. It was distributed by Warner Bros. Records in the United States from 1988 to 1993.  - ( Pitch.Black.Effects ) is the fifth and final studio album by the extreme metal band Callenish Circle .  - Callenish Circle was an extreme metal band from the Netherlands. They recorded three of their albums for Metal Blade Records, and broke up in February 2007. In the early 2000s things were going well for the band. In 2002 they toured with God Dethroned, played at the Dutch version of Ozzfest and the German Party San Open Air, and opened for Dimmu Borgir. Their fourth album was released by Metal Blade in 2003; to support it they played that year's Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze festivals in Germany, and in October they were part of the Bonded By Metal Over Europe-tour, headlined by Exodus, Nuclear Assault, and Agent Steel. In 2006 they toured Mexico (cited by the band as the high point of their career), before they decided to break up in 2007.  - Wacken Open Air (W:O:A) is a summer open-air heavy metal music festival. It takes place annually in the small village of Wacken in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. With 80,000 festival visitors, and including personnel a total of roughly 86,000 attendees in 2011, it attracts various kinds of metal and hard rock music fans.  - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.    What is the relationship between 'pitch.black.effects' and 'metal blade records'?

Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Django Unchained Context: In 1858, Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, is chained to a bunch of other slaves and being marched to his new owner's estate in Texas by the Speck brothers. At nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart pulls up and hails the Speck brothers. He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks. He says he is looking for a slave who can identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. Schultz offers to buy Django, but his polite and educated manner rubs the ill-mannered Specks the wrong way, and Ace Speck threatens to shoot him with his shotgun. In response, Schultz lowers his lantern, whips out a revolver, and shoots Ace, then Dicky's horse, causing Dicky to fall off his horse. The horse carcass then lands on and crushes Dicky's leg, leaving him screaming in pain. Crippled, he agrees to sell Django, and Schultz pays the man (for both Django, and the dead Speck's horse), gets an official title to Django, and prepares to ride off.Before Schultz leaves, however, he frees the remaining slaves (clearly, Schultz finds slavery abhorrent) and says that they may either carry the remaining Speck brother back to town, or shoot him and flee. As Django and Schultz ride off, we hear Speck pleading for his life. We hear a gunshot and can see blood splatter as Dicky's brains are blown out.Django and Schultz arrive in the small town of Daughtrey near El Paso. As they travel through the streets, townspeople stop to stare in disbelief at the sight of a nigger on a horse, much to Schultz's confusion. As Schultz ties his cart down at a hitching post, he checks some papers to make sure he's in the right place. The two then walk into a saloon despite the fact that Django is forbidden from doing so because he is black due to the South's segregation laws. When Schultz insists on being served, the barkeep runs out of the saloon, Schultz calling after him to specifically... Answer:","output":"In Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film \\"Django Unchained,\\" the character you are referring to is Stephen, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. Stephen is a loyal house slave to Calvin Candie, the cruel owner of the Candieland plantation, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The film follows Django, a freed slave, and Dr. King Schultz, a German bounty hunter, as they work together to rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington), from the clutches of Candie. Stephen is a complex and controversial character within the narrative, as he is a loyal servant to his master, despite being a black slave himself. He is portrayed as an elderly and cunning man, who has significant influence within the Candieland plantation and exerts control over the other slaves. This gives him a certain degree of power, though still subservient to his white master. Stephen is highly observant and often acts as the voice of reason for Calvin Candie, which further highlights his loyalty and influence within the household. He becomes suspicious of Django and Dr. Schultz's intentions and plays a pivotal role in unraveling their plan to rescue Broomhilda. This proves his unwavering loyalty to Calvin and the plantation, as he would rather protect his master's interests than help his fellow slaves in gaining their freedom. As the film develops, it becomes evident that Stephen is as much a villain as his white counterparts, deriving power and a sense of control from his position within the plantation's hierarchy. His character is a representation of the internalized racism and self-preservation that existed among some slaves during the 19th century. In conclusion, Calvin's loyal house slave in \\"Django Unchained\\" is Stephen, a character portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. Through his deceitful actions and loyalty to Calvin Candie, he represents the complexities and internalized racism that existed within some enslaved individuals during this period in American history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands.  and a hint : Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.  Please answer this question : Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil? Answer:","output":"Based on the hint provided, the farmer with grasslands would observe a greater buildup of calcium in the soil. In this case, that would be Bill. The reasoning behind this is the precipitation in grasslands being equal to or less than evapotranspiration, which creates a relatively drought-like environment. This reduced leaching and migration of weathering products leads to decreased soil development. The large amounts of evaporation in grasslands cause the buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations, which flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. The impermeable clay layer then limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. Consequently, when leaching is decreased in grasslands, calcium precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, forming a layer known as caliche.

Question: __ is a religious obligation for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth Context: Belief is a fundamental aspect of morality in the Quran, and scholars have tried to determine the semantic contents of \\"belief\\" and \\"believer\\" in the Quran. The ethico-legal concepts and exhortations dealing with righteous conduct are linked to a profound awareness of God, thereby emphasizing the importance of faith, accountability, and the belief in each human's ultimate encounter with God. People are invited to perform acts of charity, especially for the needy. Believers who \\"spend of their wealth by night and by day, in secret and in public\\" are promised that they \\"shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve\\". It also affirms family life by legislating on matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance. A number of practices, such as usury and gambling, are prohibited. The Quran is one of the fundamental sources of Islamic law (sharia). Some formal religious practices receive significant attention in the Quran including the formal prayers (salat) and fasting in the month of Ramadan. As for the manner in which the prayer is to be conducted, the Quran refers to prostration. The term for charity, zakat, literally means purification. Charity, according to the Quran, is a means of self-purification.

In the afternoon he arrives in the small rural town of Hickory and enters the high school. He notices, on a shelf in the hall, basketball trophies won in previous years. As the bell rings to end the school day, he encounters teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). She realizes that Norman must be the new basketball coach and teacher of history and civics. She directs him to the office of principal Cletus Summers (Sheb Wooley), where the two men recall how they met many years ago at Buffalo State Teachers College. They had lost touch until recently, when Cletus tracked down Norman and asked him to come coach at Hickory. When Norman thanks Cletus for the opportunity, Cletus interrupts and says, \\"Your slate's clean here.\\" They proceed to the gym, where student Jimmy Chitwood (Maris Valainis) is shooting baskets.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Eutherians are the most widespread of the mammals, occurring throughout the world. There are several groups of eutherians, including Insectivora, the insect eaters; Edentata, the toothless anteaters; Rodentia, the rodents; Chiroptera, the bats; Cetacea, the aquatic mammals including whales; Carnivora, carnivorous mammals including dogs, cats, and bears; and Primates, which includes humans. Eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals, because all species have a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, waste, and nutrient exchange. While other mammals may possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta, all eutherians have a complex placenta during gestation. Primates Order Primates of class Mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, and the apes, which include humans. Non-human primates live primarily in tropical or subtropical regions of South America, Africa, and Asia. They range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). The characteristics and evolution of primates are of particular interest to us as they allow us to understand the evolution of our own species. All primate species have adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers, although not all species are arboreal. This arboreal heritage of primates resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation, or climbing and swinging through trees. These adaptations include, but are not limited to 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs that are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, and 3) stereoscopic vision, two overlapping visual fields, which allows for the depth perception necessary to gauge distance. Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of many other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a...

Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer. The answer to this question is:","output":"Theodore Honey decides to give a warning to Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale about the potential metal fatigue failure in the Rutland Reindeer airliner they are both flying on."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Article: Agricultural experts met in Ethiopia last week to discuss ways to help sub-Saharan Africa become a major producer of wheat. The area traditionally produced little wheat, while North Africa was the grain basket. Wheat production fell sharply in sub-Saharan countries during the 1980s. In the 1960s, attempts were made to grow wheat in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe. But those countries found it was less costly to import wheat from Europe and the United States. Another problem is that Africa's wheat farms were often far from population centers. There also were transportation issues. And some lowlands were not a good place to grow wheat. Hans Joachim Braun,one of the experts, says now is a good time to increase wheat production. In the last four years we have seen three major price hikes, where the wheat price and other staple process  exploded. And that puts a big, big bill on countries which are depending on wheat imports, and Africa is the biggest wheat importer. He also says demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than for any other crop. With higher income people would like to have more diversified food. But that is possible not the most important one. The most important one is that there is a tremendous migration of in particular male labor to the cities. And wheat products are convenient food because you can easily buy it. It's easy to process and you also can store it for a few days, which is different from some of the maize and rice products. There are three possible challenges for growing more wheat in Africa: climate change, disease and pests, like insects. Mr. Braun says rising temperatures should not have a major effect on wheat. In fact, he says, it could help wheat grow in areas with high rainfall totals. As for fighting disease and pests, experts suggest growing more resistant crops. In addition, railroads and roads would have to be improved so large amounts of wheat could be moved to large markets.   Question: Wheat price exploding indicates  _  .

The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide.

The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat.

When found to be made of a material unknown on Earth, the spool is circumstantially linked to the Tunguska explosion of 1908. The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship. Professor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tchen Yu. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion.

The rest of the crew follows when Cosmostrator lands, but they find no Venusian life forms.

This movie was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the screenplay (Ulee's Gold). Nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, looking at Ruby's day to day life. What we see is a slice in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. She explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast I picked the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the Hollywood baggage. Although the stories are completely different this reminded me of Nobody's Fool, staring Paul Newman. The later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. I like that. The story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. The only thing I am not sure about is the title. I am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquitos, Florida is no paradise to me, I itch all over thinking about Florida. I turn into a complete red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Panama City, Florida. Indeed the sand is very white. I have been there.

Article: What else did this wild day need? How about a halfcourt buzzer-beater?      You got it.      Your newest N.C.A.A. tournament highlight arrives courtesy of Northern Iowa’s Paul Jesperson, whose heave as time expired gave the 11th-seeded Panthers the upset win over No. 6 Texas.      The game was tied with three seconds remaining by Texas’s Isaiah Taylor, whose jumper appeared to force overtime. But Northern Iowa scrambled to get the ball in — declining to use its last timeout — and Jesperson found the ball in his hands.      He banked the game-winning 3-pointer in from just about half-court to win it, 75-72.      Thus ended a fantastic game in Oklahoma City that featured multiple lead changes in the final minutes.      It was an uncomfortable matchup for the Longhorns. The Panthers, who do not have a starter taller than 6 feet 9 inches tall, like to spread the floor, work the shot clock down, and open up driving lanes to the hoop. Northern Iowa led by as much as 16 in the first half after going on a 23-2 run.      Texas responded by opening the second half on a 17-3 run. Taylor (22 points) got hot, and the Longhorns regained a lead as large as five. But the Panthers, no strangers to N.C.A.A. tournament success, battled back, with balanced scoring across its starting five.      In three of the Panthers’ last four wins, the score was in the 50s, but Texas’s offense was too explosive to keep quieted. Northern Iowa, however, finished with the shot of the night. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Decosey was fouled shooting a 3 by Anthony Clemmon with 2.1 seconds left in the game and Iowa up by 3.      Decosey made the first two and Iowa called timeout. He stepped up and made the last one to tie the score at 63. Iowa threw the ball away with a long pass and the Owls had one more shot with 1.3 seconds left but did not get a shot off.      — Ralph Russo reporting from Brooklyn      ___      5:15 p.m.      If Michigan State losing isn't enough to prove the wackiness of this March, digest this: Lower-seeded teams are 11-9 in the NCAA Tournament through the first 20 games.

Only Kansas was a more popular choice.      ___      4:50 p.m.      With Hawaii upsetting California, the Pac-12 fell to 1-5 in the first round with Oregon still left to play. The Ducks are a 1 seed facing Holy Cross, which made the field with a losing record as Patriot League Tournament champions.      Utah is the only Pac-12 team to advance so far. The league's seven representatives were tied for the most of any conference in the 68-team field.      ___      4:40 p.m.      Idaho is warming up before its first-round game in the women's NCAA Tournament at No. 1 seed Baylor.      No surprise that the Vandals almost immediately are taking shots from long range.      Baylor and Idaho both have the same 37.1 shooting percentage on 3-pointers. But the Vandals have made more 3-pointers than the Big 12 champion Lady Bears have even attempted this season.      \\"They've made more 3s than I'll probably ever let my team shoot in the time I'm at Baylor,\\" said coach Kim Mulkey, whose Lady Bears open NCAA play on their home court for the fourth year in a row.

Not from the public address announcer at the Scottrade Center.      He made a habit of calling the Big Ten player of the year \\"Darnell Valentine\\" in the first half of the second-seeded Spartans' game against No. 15 seed Middle Tennessee State on Friday.      Either the man behind the mike was making an honest mistake or he was showing his age: Darnell Valentine was an All-American guard for Kansas in the 1970s and '80s who went on to spend several years with the Trail Blazers, Clippers and Cavaliers before retiring from basketball.      Chances are Denzel Valentine will have an NBA future, too.      — Dave Skretta reporting from St. Louis.      ___      3:35 p.m.      California's Jabari Bird is back on the Golden Bears' bench for the second half after the school said he had back spasms during pregame warmups.      Bird was evaluated and received treatment in the locker room during the first half and rejoined his teammates after halftime.      California was already without starting point guard and leading scorer Tyrone Wallace after he broke his right hand in practice this week.      __ Tim Booth reporting from Spokane, Washington      ___      2:55 p.m.      Cal State Bakersfield's Rod Barnes has no choice but to revisit one of his worst coaching memories.      He was an assistant coach at Mississippi in 1998, when Valparaiso's Bryce Drew hit the famous 3-pointer to help the 13th-seeded Crusaders upset the 4th-seeded Rebels in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Mississippi led 69-67 with 2.5 seconds left before Drew's buzzer-beater.      That game was played at the Myriad, which is now the Cox Convention Center. Eighteen years later, Barnes' 15th-seeded Roadrunners play across the street at Chesapeake Energy Arena against No. 2 seed Oklahoma.      Drew's shot gets replayed whenever March Madness rolls around, and the location of this year's game makes the memory even clearer for Barnes.      \\"Every year, you try to live it down,\\" Barnes said. \\"It's kind of like pulling the scab off an injury __ it keeps coming right back. So hopefully, we can get here this year and have better memories, as far as the tournament goes.\\"      Barnes became head coach at Mississippi later that year and held that position until 2006. He was an assistant at Oklahoma for a year and led the Georgia State program from 2007 to 2011 before taking the job at Bakersfield.      Still, the memory of Drew's shot has remained vivid.      \\"Man, my heart still hurts,\\" he said.      — Cliff Brunt, reporting from Oklahoma City.      ___      2:30 p.m.      California standout Jabari Bird is not on the Golden Bears bench and is apparently sick.      Bird was listed as a starter for the Bears, but was replaced in the lineup against Hawaii by Jordan Mathews. The television broadcast reported that Bird was in the locker room not feeling well. Bird averaged 10.4 points per game.      It's another blow in an already tumultuous week for California that's seen the Bears dismiss an assistant coach amid sexual harassment allegations and lose top scorer Tyrone Wallace for the season to a broken hand.      —Tim Booth reporting from Spokane, Washington.      ___      1:55 p.m.      This goes beyond brunch-time basketball.      Hawaii is used to playing at odd times during the season, but Friday's NCAA Tournament opener against No. 4 seed California is early for even the most ardent hoops fan on the islands, with a scheduled tip of 8 a.m. in Honolulu. That's 11 a.m. Pacific time.      While that is an adjustment for the Warriors fans back home, the team itself had no problem getting ready for the early tip. Hawaii's been on the mainland since March 1 when it left for the final two games of the Big West regular season before winning the conference tournament in Anaheim, California, and then making the trip north to Spokane, Washington.      —Tim Booth reporting from Spokane, Washington.      ___      1:30 p.m.      Villanova found its range from 3-point range late in the first half to build a comfortable lead at the break against 15th-seeded UNC Asheville.      It was a 4-point lead for the Wildcats with 3 minutes left in the half, but they hit 3s on their last four trips. The last one by Ryan Arcidiacono was a pull-up that barely beat the buzzer and made it 40-26 for the second-seed.      Villanova had been 3 for 11 from 3 against the Asheville zone before hitting their last four.      —Ralph Russo reporting from New York.      ___      11:55 a.m.      UConn women's coach Geno Auriemma says the burden of living each year for the three weeks of the NCAA Tournament wears on him, but he's not yet ready to hang up his whistle.

Robert Morris coach Sal Buscaglia has announced that he will retire at the end of the season, ending a 38-year coaching career.      Auriemma, who is in his 31st year at UConn, said that got him thinking about how long he will continue to coach.      \\"I kind of got up this morning to come here today and I can't say it was exactly like it was 28 years ago, but it's not that much different,\\" he said. \\"So, as long as that is the case, I'm good for a while.\\"      —Pat Eaton-Robb reporting from Storrs, Connecticut.      ___      11:54 a.m.      Bettors at a chain of Las Vegas sports books seem particularly enamored with Dayton on the second day of the NCAA Tournament.      The game between Dayton and Syracuse was the most heavily bet game of the day early Friday at the William Hill sports books. The game was drawing 17 percent of all money, topping the Hawaii-California game (10 percent) as the biggest draw of the day.      Dayton was favored by 54 percent of bettors as a one-point underdog. But 77 percent of the total money bet on the game was on the Flyers, meaning the bigger bettors liked Dayton most of all.      Bettors also believed Oklahoma would open its bid for a national title with a big game. The Sooners were 15-point favorites over Cal State Bakersfield, but 83 percent of the tickets written were on Oklahoma, and 93 percent of the money favored the Sooners to cover the big spread.      —Tim Dahlberg reporting from Las Vegas      ___      11:15 a.m.      Some small-school nets are getting a chance to shine on college basketball's biggest stage.

Missouri Valley associate commissioner Jack Watkins, tournament director for the site, told The Associated Press that regulation nets were found at Fontbonne University.      The Division III school is located about 15 minutes west of the Scottrade Center.

They are noted for their high energy live concerts, movie soundtrack contributions, and their mixture of genre, which can be described as including ska, pop, rock, and world music. The band was founded in 1972 as The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, a performance art group. The band was led by songwriter/vocalist Danny Elfman, who has since achieved success as a composer for film and television. With the move to MCA, the band made two personnel switches: Mike Bacich took over on keyboards from departing member Richard Gibbs, and John Avila replaced Kerry Hatch on bass. Oingo Boingo appeared in a number of soundtracks in the early to mid-1980s, including Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which features \\"Goodbye, Goodbye\\". Their song charting highest on Billboard Hot 100, \\"Weird Science\\", was written for the John Hughes film of the same name, and was later included on their 1985 album Dead Man's Party.  Later, the band made an appearance playing their hit \\"Dead Man's Party\\" on stage in the film Back to School. In addition, they appeared in and performed several songs in the quirky 1984 Tom Hanks movie Bachelor Party, including \\"Who Do You Want to Be?\\", \\"Bachelor Party\\" and \\"Something Isn't Right\\". Then, starting with 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Danny Elfman began scoring major films with increasing frequency, including almost all of Tim Burton's films.  Oingo Boingo's 1987 album BOI-NGO was released as a follow-up to the popular Dead Man's Party, but its chart performance was considered an underperformance. After this album, Bacich was replaced by new keyboardist Carl Graves. The band's 1988 release Boingo Alive was actually recorded live on a soundstage, with no studio audience; it consisted of a selection of songs from earlier albums, plus two new compositions. The Boingo Alive track \\"Winning Side\\" became a No. 14 hit on US Modern Rock radio stations.  In 1990 the band released their seventh studio album, titled Dark at the End of the Tunnel.

To help women, Mr. Mukherjee said the budget includes measures like the reduction of tax on sanitary napkins. In the budget announced on Monday, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said there will be additional taxes on restaurants, air travel and hotel. On the other hand, he provided some tax breaks for individuals, but those add up to less than 10,000 rupees (220) for a year. Here is a look at the main budget features that would affect individuals in the fiscal year starting April 1. Income Tax: Finance minister has raised the income tax exemption for individual taxpayers by 20,000 rupees (445) to 180,000 rupees (4,000). Individuals don't have to pay taxes on taxable income up to this amount. For women, the exemption stands at 190,000 rupees (4,220). This increase will result in a tax saving of around 2,000 rupees (45) in a year. That's a \\"very small sum, especially when you consider rising prices,\\" says Homi Mistry, partner at consulting firm Deloitte Haskins & Sells. Another tax \\"break\\" will be on infrastructure bond investments. An investment of up to 20,000 rupees in bonds issued by certain infrastructure financing companies will be exempt from tax. That translates to a saving of around 6,200 (135) rupees for an individual in the highest tax bracket. Older taxpayers have the most to cheer about. For tax calculation, individuals of 60 years of age or older will now be considered \\"senior citizens\\" down from the current 65 years. Senior citizens will not have to pay taxes on income of up to 250,000 rupees (5,555). Mr. Mukherjee also created a new class of \\"very senior citizens\\", who are 80 years or older, and who will be exempt from taxes for taxable income up to 500,000 rupees (11,111). On the face of it, these proposals sound good, but it's not clear if there are many 80-year-olds in India who earn taxable income of 500,000 rupees or more. \\"The question is: how many people will benefit?\\" asks Mr. Mistry. Those who have a salaried income, whose companies are deducting the tax at source, and who meet certain conditions, may not have to file an income tax return. This could be convenient for individuals. \\"What are the conditions, we don't know yet,\\" says Mr. Mistry. On a final note, Mr. Muherjee made it clear that the new Direct Taxes Code will be coming into place from April 1, 2012. So, when you make your tax investments this year, plan ahead for the new regime. What's Costly: There will be new taxes on food, travel and hotel stay. 1. Your restaurant bill will likely go up by 3%. A new service tax will be levied on restaurants with air conditioning and which serve alcohol. This tax will be in addition to the existing value added tax, which is typically 12.5% on food and 20% on alcohol. From what we know so far, the service tax will be applicable even if you did not order liquor as part of your meal, says Srinivas Kotni, managing associate at Delhi-based law firm Coporate Lexport. Mr. Kotni says a majority of city restaurants will be affected by this rule because most are now air-conditioned and serve alcohol. 2. Hotels which charge 1,000 rupees (22) or more per night will charge a brand new 5% service tax on their tariff. 3. Air travelers will have to pay an additional 50 rupees (1.1) in service tax on domestic flights, and 250 rupees (5.5) more on international flights. If you fly business class, the service tax will be higher. 4. All services provided by hospitals and clinics which have central air-conditioning and 25 beds or more (which is basically most major hospitals in urban areas), will now be charged a 5% service tax. Earlier, this tax was imposed only on health check-ups or treatment. All government hospitals are exempted. In the next budget, these service taxes could be increased and new services could be brought under the tax net, says Mr. Kotni. Cars: All potential car buyers can breathe a sigh of relief because, contrary to expectations, Mr. Mukherjee has not increased the excise duty on automobiles. He did that last year, and car companies responded by raising prices on some cars by as much as 25,000 rupees. There are some tax breaks for hybrid or environment-friendly cars. This means those who were planning to buy cars like Mahindra's Reva, and hybrid versions of Honda Civic and Toyata Prius can rejoice. Investors: Individuals will have more opportunities to buy stakes of state-owned companies. The government fell short of its target of raising 400 billion rupees (8.9 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 by divestment. Only six government-run companies made public offerings in this period, raising around 220 billion rupees (4.9 billion). Now the government plans to raise 400 billion rupees in year starting April 1. Potential issues will likely come from Coal India, Steel Authority of India Ltd., and National Aluminium Co. Individual investors can expect a 5% to 10% discount on the price of these stocks. Women: During the budget speech, Mr. Mukherjee pointed out that one of his measures to help women was the reduction in central excise duty on things including sanitary napkins and baby diapers from 10% to 1%. City women don't seem to find it a useful measure. Gauri Kalra, a 24-year-old resident of Delhi says that cheaper sanitary napkins and diapers wont make a difference. A tax break, on the other hand, could have helped \\"in shaping up a better life,\\" she said.

Those are savings for things we need in the future. In a similar way, our country also needs money to run properly. For that, people pay some amount from their earnings to the government. This is called tax. When our government plans how to use this money, it's called 'the budget'. Recently, the person who takes care of the country's money, Mr. Mukherjee, told us about the new budget. He said that people might have to pay a bit more money when they eat out in restaurants, when they travel by plane, or when they stay in hotels. This is because they've put some extra taxes on these things. But, he also said some people might see a small drop in the amount of tax they have to pay each year. This depends on how much money they make. And guess what? Grandmas and grandpas who are 60 years or older will have to pay less tax too! There's even a special category for very old grandpas and grandmas who are 80 or older. They'll have to pay even lesser or no tax at all. Mr. Mukherjee also said that there won't be any extra tax on buying cars this year, and those who buy eco-friendly cars can save some money. The budget also made things like sanitary napkins cheaper for women. But, some women don't think this will make a big difference to them. And you know how we sometimes invest or save money for long-term gains like buying a bicycle or a video game? Similarly, adults can now buy bits of some big companies and hopefully make more money in the long run. So, lots of little changes here and there that will come into effect soon, starting from April 1. Is there anything else you want to know about the budget?

It was probably unlikely that a TV comedy series about a Muslim community leader would pass without comment. And so it was that in the region of 200 complaints were made to the BBC yesterday after it broadcast the first episode of Citizen Khan. It was claimed that the programme ‘takes the mickey out of Islam’, was guilty of ‘stereotypes about Asians’ and was ‘disrespectful to the Koran’. Scroll down to watch the trailer Controversial: The first episode of BBC comedy series Citizen Khan attracted in the region of 200 complaints Provocative: The programme's British Muslim creator Adil Ray (second from left) stands with co-stars Bavna Limbachia (left), Maya Sondhi (second from right) and Shobu Kapoor (right) One scene that particularly provoked anger was where a heavily-made up girl, Mr Khan’s daughter, rushed to put on a hijab and pretended to be reading the","output":"Koran when her father entered the room. Despite the uproar, the show's creator, Adil Ray, a British Muslim himself, defended his creation, stating that it was designed to entertain and not to offend. He claimed that the characters, though exaggerated, were based on people he had met and that humor was a way to challenge stereotypes and foster understanding between different communities. As the series continued, it gained both supporters and detractors. Some believed that it shed light on the lives of British Muslims and encouraged dialogue, while others maintained that it was disrespectful and perpetuated harmful stereotypes. The debate surrounding the show became the topic of various talks, newspaper articles, and panels, dividing public opinion even more. Facing the controversy head-on, Adil Ray decided to incorporate a few changes in the upcoming episodes to address the concerns of viewers, without compromising the show's original intent. The tweaks included a more balanced representation of the characters, as well as storylines that focused on universal human experiences, such as family relationships, friendship, and personal growth. As the season progressed, viewers began to see the show through a different lens. The once-offensive jokes became sources of deep introspection. People began to discuss the real-life challenges and experiences of Muslim families living in the UK, beyond the caricatures portrayed on screen. In the final episode, Mr. Khan, the titular character, faced a dilemma that forced him to examine his beliefs and prejudices. His journey of personal growth culminated in a heartfelt speech about the importance of unity and understanding within the community, as well as respect for one another's beliefs and culture. Although Citizen Khan never fully escaped its controversy, it also achieved a significant positive impact. It sparked conversations, challenged preconceptions, and served as an example of how comedy, when used thoughtfully, can break down barriers and bring people together. In the end, Citizen Khan developed a loyal following and generated meaningful discussions that contributed to a more inclusive and understanding society. The show was eventually celebrated for its ability to provoke thought and its fearless approach to tackling sensitive issues, turning what was once viewed as a source of conflict into an instrument for positive change."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

And the answer is?","output":"In 1993, the first animated animal used to advertise Coca Cola was the friendly, fun-loving, and highly spirited polar bear. The Coca Cola polar bear mascot was introduced to capture the essence of the brand and create a visually appealing, ice-cold, and refreshing image for the consumer base. The inspiration for their introduction came from the \\"Always Coca-Cola\\" advertising campaign, which was launched in the same year. The creator behind the animated Coca Cola polar bears was Ken Stewart, a talented commercial animator. He drew his inspiration from his Labrador Retriever, Morgan, who displayed playful and affectionate characteristics, qualities that Stewart believed would endear the polar bears to the audience. The animation was created using state-of-the-art computer graphics and cutting-edge technology for that time, which added to the uniqueness and appeal of these adorable mascots. The first Coca Cola polar bear commercial was titled \\"Northern Lights\\" and featured a group of polar bears enjoying bottles of Coca Cola while gazing at the enchanting aurora borealis. This advertisement quickly became a global sensation, and the polar bear mascots soon became the beloved symbol of Coca Cola's advertising efforts. The campaign resonated with audiences across the globe and helped the brand connect with consumers on an emotional level. Over the years, the Coca Cola polar bears have evolved and appeared in various advertisements, each highlighting a different aspect of the brand's personality and values. They have been used to demonstrate the importance of friendship, community, sharing, and togetherness during special occasions, such as the holiday season. The iconic Coca Cola polar bears' distinctive appearance and expressive nature continue to attract audiences of all ages, making them one of the most recognizable and cherished advertising mascots in the history of marketing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Following the launch of the first production-ready version of Ethereum this month, bitcoin businesses are moving to investigate how they might apply the blockchain platform as part of their existing products or services.      So far, startups as diverse as cloud money platform Uphold, bitcoin mining firm BTCS and hardware device provider Ledger are among those that have announced Ethereum initiatives. And in what may be one of the most high-profile signs of interest, bitcoin startup Coinbase plans to hold an internal event on the platform this week.      However, exactly how these companies will seek to use Ethereum, and whether they will do so in a way that is consistent with the vision of the next-generation blockchain platform remains unclear. Announced in 2014, Ethereum is distinguished by its support for smart contracts and ability to support decentralized applications or dapps.      Despite these wide uses, interviews suggest bitcoin startups are adding support for Ethereum through services that aim to boost the liquidity of its transaction token, ether, and that while they are excited about its larger potential, they're not sure how to define this opportunity or what it may mean for their business.      Uphold EVP Jorge Pereira, for example, said that his firm is seeking to add support for ether as a first step, but that it will remain open to other applications as they emerge. Still, he spoke to overall change in perception that has brought about this shift.      Pereira told CoinDesk:      \\"Before, Ethereum was a curiosity. No one knew whether it would take off. Now it's achieved a number of goals that make it something that has sizeable potential. The first thing we can easily do is provide support for holding and converting ether, however, with Ethereum we don't see the goal being that.\\"      Elsewhere, members of the bitcoin community struck similar tones.      Ledger co-founder Thomas France noted his firm sees its support of Ethereum as a necessary step toward applying its technology to a wider variety of blockchains. Ledger recently announced support for Eris Industries, for example, which offers permissioned blockchain solutions.      \\"The core of our business is to provide ways to leverage secure hardware for developers and companies,\\" France told CoinDesk.      Other industry businesses have sought to offer services for those seeking to buy or sell ethers in a similar manner as digital currencies, even as the platform's creators indicate ether is not meant to be a payment method or store of value.      Tapping new markets      Of interest for many of those interviewed was finding new lines of business. The statements suggest Ethereum may become a way for some firms to seek to grow their market size at a time when adoption of bitcoin as a digital currency appears to be stalling.      BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp, for example, said that the bitcoin wallet and security specialist is discussing whether it would be worth developing a wallet for the blockchain platform, though he cautioned such talks remain in early stages.      \\"Our business is helping people secure crypto. It mainly comes down to how much demand there is to secure ether from institutions,\\" he said.      Not all those who are interested have a long-term focus in mind, however. Charles Allen, CEO of bitcoin mining outfit BTCS, noted that his firm recently built custom Ethereum mining rigs as part of a pilot program due to the escalating price of ether.      In recent weeks, ether has been one of the more volatile currencies, rising to highs of around 13, up about 10 from six months ago. Allen indicated that BTCS is well-positioned to roll out hardware for Ethereum mining, given its background in creating specialized hardware for bitcoin mining.      \\"You can't ignore [Ethereum] right now, at this price level, with a 1bn market cap,\\" Allen said in a recent interview.      He went on to indicate that the pilot seeks to examine whether mining Ethereum would be profitable given that it plans to transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake mining, meaning eventually, its transaction verification process would transition to the point where it would not require hardware.      Still, he said that since Ethereum runs on graphics processing units (GPUs), it's possible for the company to resell the hardware it purchases.      \\"For us, this is opportunistic. You can't mine Ethereum forever, [but] if we can jump in and make some money it makes a lot of sense,\\" he said.      'Unfortunate' attempts      In interview, representatives of the Ethereum project reported mixed feelings about the recent trend.      The platform's inventor, Vitalik Buterin, noted he has been disappointed by how bitcoin industry firms are seeking to leverage the technology, noting that, to date, most initiatives have failed to \\"capture what the platform is about\\".      He told CoinDesk:      \\"Some of that is fairly simple, there's [we accept] bitcoin, we're just going to accept ether, which is nice, but it's kind of unfortunate. The whole thing is to do all the blockchain stuff other than currency.\\"      Buterin suggested that many industry firms haven't digested the platform's value propositions, which he acknowledged may be more abstract than bitcoin's, and to an extent, a threat to some industry business models.      \\"A more traditional company might ask can we accept ether. But, that's not the point. The point is that you will be replaced by a smart contract that is fully autonomous and doesn't charge fees,\\" he remarked.      Still, there are problems in the Ethereum ecosystem that Buterin indicated he hopes innovators in the bitcoin space and beyond will solve.      For instance, he pointed to the centralization of Ethereum's mining pools and the relative newness of its wallet applications as areas where it could benefit from the knowledge of other open-source technology communities.      Wait and see      Interviews suggest that these opportunities are resonating with industry businesses, even those that may have just taken initial steps to embrace ether.      For example, Andrew Lee, CEO of bitcoin deals platform Purse, noted that his startup is accepting ether, but that it has explored how Ethereum could be used to automate certain parts of the online commerce process and as part of conversations about the future of supply chains.      Lee suggested it remains to be seen whether applications like smart contracts become a use case for Ethereum, or if other efforts are successful at replicating this functionality on the bitcoin blockchain, an idea industry startup RSK Labs has raised 1m to undertake.      \\"I think what I foresee is there will be a limit to what bitcoin can do, and if we get there, Ethereum would be a good alternative,\\" Lee said.      Others noted that this exploration process is likely to take time, and that the ecosystem can be expected to continue to look for ways to apply Ethereum as the project matures.      Pereira added:      \\"With Ethereum, we're still figuring it out as a community.\\"      Stolen idea image via Shutterstock      The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

There’s a new digital currency that’s looking to give bitcoin a run for its money: Ethereum. In a sense, it’s an offspring of bitcoin that’s capitalizing on and enriching blockchain technology. Developers and cryptomaniacs around the world are rejoicing about its potential applications. But you can so rejoice, too.      And that’s because it’s not exactly a digital currency. It takes the conceptual basis for bitcoin and makes it applicable to just about anything. Before we get into the deep water, though, you’ll probably need…      A Wee Bit of Background      Ethereum has been in the works since late 2013, when Vitalik Buterin — who’s now just 22 years old — released this Ethereum white paper. About a year later, after fellow hackers joined the venture, Ethereum launched a public crowdsale. In 42 days, Ethereum collected almost 32,000 bitcoin — equivalent to about 18.5 million USD.      Ethereum supports applications that run on its custom-built blockchain. A blockchain, for those who don’t know, is — in effect — an indestructible, public, immutable ledger. An unmodifiable record of what’s happened.      Blockchains are attractive because they decentralize. Instead of one person or institution running the system — i.e. a bank, or Apple, or Facebook — the blockchain involves and empowers all users in both its creation and supervision. By distributing the computational burden, you’re decentralizing.      “Ethereum aims to take the promise of decentralization, openness and security that is at the core of blockchain technology and brings it to almost anything that can be computed.” — Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum creator      Blockchains have thus far proven transparent and secure, and blockchain-based currencies — like bitcoin — allow for virtual, virtually immediate, cryptographically secure transactions. Users don’t even need traditional bank accounts to transact.      Applications that run on Ethereum’s decentralized, blockchain-based platform enjoy more than just those benefits, though. A blockchain precludes downtime, censorship, and third-party interference. Ethereum wants its platform to decentralize and therefore improve the trustworthiness of all possible transactions — social networks, medical information, and even, one day, governance. Anything that can be computed can become a decentralized Ethereum application. The creators have unveiled the monolith. It’s up to developers to figure out how best to put it to work.      George Hallam, Ethereum’s external relations director, tells Inverse that “Ethereum is essentially a programmable blockchain that puts the user in control. Rather than lock users to a set of pre-defined applications within the protocol, Ethereum allows them to create their own applications in the form of Smart Contracts (DApps), which can be as complex as required. This significantly increases the versatility and capability of the Ethereum blockchain as a whole.”      Ethereum's cofounders: Vitalik Buterin, right, and Gavin Wood, left.      Why You Should Care About the Ethereum Blockchain      Ethereum cuts out the middlemen involved in all transactions, whether that transaction relies on money or not. In an idealistically Ethereum-powered world, there’d be no central bank taking percentages off each card swipe, there’d be no individual person deciding what’s content and what’s not, there’d be no Uber cutting rates on its drivers. There’d be very little bureaucracy.      Since Ethereum is powered by thousands upon thousands of nodes (crudely, a node is a computer connected to the Ethereum network), it won’t ever crash, can’t be censored, and isn’t open to fraud or interference.      But can you trust Ethereum? you might ask, dubious. In a sense, “trust” doesn’t even apply: since the network — the blockchain — is maintained and surveilled by all users by virtue of their participation, there’s no individual person or organization in whom or in which you must place your trust. And, likewise, there’s no individual person or organization whose sabotage can spell catastrophe.      Don’t (Just) Call it a Cryptocurrency      Ethereum’s creators themselves don’t refer to it as a “cryptocurrency.” Ethereum is a shared computing platform, and its base unit is ether, the “cryptofuel” that powers the network: “a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency, asset, share or anything else.”      So ether pays for computation. This computation takes place within the Ethereum Virtual Machine; the EVM makes it possible for smart contracts to run on Ethereum’s blockchain. Were these computations free, Hallam says, “Ethereum solves the Halting Problem, where users could potentially write infinite loops into their smart contracts, thus using up all of the platforms available resources (similar to a traditional DDoS attack on a website). By putting a price on computation, infinite loops would require an infinite amount of Ether, making such an attack impossible.”      But these tokens — ether — are still both exchangeable and valuable, so are, in a sense, a currency. You can own ether, you can spend ether. (“Ether” is both singular and plural.) Ether can be “mined,” like bitcoin, using a network of powerful computers. 1 ETH, at time of writing, is worth around 12 USD. You can watch the “etherchain” update live, here, to get a better conceptual sense of how it works and how often “miners” strike “ether.”      How Ethereum Is Already Changing the Game      Safe to say that old-hat institutions that are accustomed to and continue to benefit from centralization will not go down without a fight? Not quite. Unlikely corporations are sneaking aboard the bandwagon.      Original The Creator of Litecoin Is A Meme King      This week in New York City, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is hosting the 2016 Blockchain Symposium. There, attendees will hear from top dogs at IBM, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.      IBM and Samsung have already teamed up to put Ethereum into practice. Together, they made a washing machine that can reorder detergent when the supply is low, call a repairman when it malfunctions, and even do laundry when the electricity is cheapest. R3, a financial consortium, is also running several experiments with Ethereum.      More and more companies may start to see the benefit of Ethereum. By eliminating the need for a middleman, costs and fees drop. Uber collects a significant percentage of every transaction, for instance — and often to the detriment of the driver. With Ethereum, these collections could be eliminated via smart contracts,” or “decentralized apps.” These so-called DApps are already impressive in number. We’ll keep up with these decentralized apps as they get more and more exciting in the days and months to come. ||||| Please agree to this before downloading      SECURITY WARNINGS      You are responsible for your own computer security.

The user acknowledges that the user has an adequate understanding of the risks, usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens and blockchain-based open source software, eth platform and ethereum      The user acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the disclaimers of liability contained herein apply to any and all damages or injury whatsoever caused by or related to risks of, use of, or inability to use, ethereum or the Ethereum platform under any cause or action whatsoever of any kind in any jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of contract or tort (including negligence) and that neither Stiftung Ethereum (i.e. Ethereum Foundation) nor Ethereum team shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill or data that occurs as a result.      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Therefore, some of the above limitations in this section may not apply to a user. In particular, nothing in these terms shall affect the statutory rights of any user or exclude injury arising from any willful misconduct or fraud of Stiftung Ethereum.      LONG VERSION      The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of the Ethereum open source software platform (“Ethereum Platform”). Prior to any use of the Ethereum Platform, the User confirms to understand and expressly agrees to all of the Terms. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be, employed by, or contracted with, Stiftung Ethereum (“Stiftung Ethereum”) is termed the “Ethereum Team.” The Platform will be developed by persons and entities who support Ethereum, including both volunteers and developers who are paid by nonprofit entities interested in supporting the Ethereum Platform.      The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use the Ethereum Platform and ETH and expressly agrees to neither hold Ethereum Stiftung nor the Ethereum Team liable should any of the following risks occur:      Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions      The Ethereum Platform and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Stiftung Ethereum to continue to develop the Ethereum Platform, or which could impede or limit the ability of a User to use Ethereum Platform or ETH.      Risk of Alternative, Unofficial Ethereum Networks      It is possible that alternative Ethereum-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform. The Ethereum network may compete with these alternative Ethereum-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Ethereum Platform and ETH.      Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Ethereum Platform or Distributed Applications      It is possible that the Ethereum Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Ethereum Platform and potential uses of ETH. It cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.      Risk that the Ethereum Platform, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of User      The User recognizes that the Ethereum Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Ethereum Platform held by the User may not be met upon release of the Ethereum Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Ethereum Platform.      Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Ethereum Platform Core Infrastructure Software      The Ethereum Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Ethereum Stiftung or the Ethereum Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Stiftung Ethereum, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Ethereum Platform causing the system to lose ETH stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the Ethereum Platform.      Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography      Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, Stiftung Ethereum intends to update the protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.      Risk of Ether Mining Attacks      As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Ethereum Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to:      Double-spend attacks      Majority mining power attacks,      “Selfish-mining” attacks      Race condition attacks.      Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Ethereum Stiftung and Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.      Risk of Rapid Adoption and Increased Demand      If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for ETH could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can create new ETH tokens. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Instability in the demand of for ETH may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters of an Ethereum based business which could result in the business being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease operation.      Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power on the Ethereum Platform      If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can bring online additional mining power. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of ETH could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This would represent revenue losses to businesses or worst case, cause businesses to cease operations because such operations have become uneconomical due to distortions in the crypto-economy.

Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be Swiss resident. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice -- in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court’s decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant’s nomination. All nominations must be Swiss resident. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman. All arbitrators shall be and remain “independent” of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be Zug, Switzerland. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of Switzerland and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositeur or decide the case ex aequo et bono. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties.

Go for a time when you are both available, but try not to make it late at night or on a weekend when the place will be packed. Let them know what you want to talk about when you schedule the meeting. If they try to insult or demean you for making such a big deal over it, simply tell them that it means a lot to you and you'd appreciate it if they would give you the benefit of the doubt and take you seriously. When you call to schedule the meeting, try to keep your conversation civil. You want to meet and discuss the issue, but there's no need to get in a fight about it over the phone. According to state law, pets are considered property. This means that with pet custody, as with determining ownership of other items of personal property, the law favors the person in possession.  You may have heard the phrase \\"possession is nine-tenths of the law.\\" This phrase is true in most cases and applies to the issue of pet custody. If your former partner already has taken your pet with them, coming to an agreement together may be the best chance you have of getting your pet back. If you end up having to take them to court and they already have possession of the animal, chances are the court will end up awarding custody to them. There are a lot of issues wrapped up in pet care, including food, activities, and veterinary care. Assuming that both of you love the pet and want what's best for the animal, you want to go over all of these aspects at your meeting with your former spouse.  Create an outline of your history with your pet, starting from the beginning. This can help you create arguments for why you should get pet custody after the breakup. For example, suppose you are the one who initially adopted the pet. Your former partner was reluctant at first and wanted nothing to do with it, but eventually came around and grew to love the animal. In that case, the fact that you originally adopted the animal works in your favor. It also helps if you are typically the one to take your pet to the vet or the groomer and buy its food. Money can be difficult if you and your former partner had a joint bank account. In that case, think about who provided most of the care and attention. You also may want to think about which of you the animal is more attached to – although typically that will be the person who most often feeds and cares for the pet. It can be difficult to hold back your emotions if you're particularly attached to your pet, but try to do your best to look at the situation objectively and determine which of you is best suited to take care of the animal.  Regardless of your feelings, if your former partner would take better care of your pet than you would be able to, you may want to let them have custody. Just make sure it's understood that you want to be able to come and visit your pet – for example, to visit once a week and take the dog for a walk in the park. On the other hand, if you have the time and money to adequately support your pet, use the reasons you wrote in your outline to explain to your former partner why you want custody of your pet. Breakups rarely happen for no reason. Tensions are bound to be high anyway, but the last thing you want to do is turn your pet custody meeting into a shouting match.  Try to keep in mind that you are there because you both love and care for your pet. If your former partner didn't care about the animal, they probably would have let you have it with no problem. If you find yourself getting angry or frustrated, turn your attention back to your pet. Keep your pet's face in your mind and remember what you're doing this for. It also can help to remind your former partner, if things start to get heated, that you're both there for your pet, not for each other. Assume that your former partner genuinely cares about your pet and its well-being. They may have serious concerns about your ability to provide adequate care for the animal.  You can only learn these concerns by keeping an open mind and listening carefully. Try to ask your former partner questions, if necessary, to draw out their reasons for not wanting to give you custody of your pet. By listening to your former partner's concerns, you may be able to find a solution that makes both of you happy and puts your pet in as good a position as it was before the breakup. For example, suppose your former partner is concerned you won't have time to take the dog for a walk during the day because you have a 30-minute commute to work and are gone all day. In that situation, you may be able to work out an arrangement in which you allow your former partner to come over during the day to walk the dog. In exchange, you could pay them a small amount (which could potentially save you from having to hire a stranger to walk your dog). . When you sit down and discuss the situation rationally, hopefully you and your former partner are able to come to an agreement regarding custody of your pet. If you do, draw up a written agreement that both of you can sign.  A signed written agreement is legally binding, but it's not necessary to stress that point. Nor do you need to hire a lawyer or draft a complex contract with lots of legalese. A simple agreement that outlines what you've decided is fine. Include everything you've discussed about your pet's care. Both of you should sign it, then make sure your former partner gets a copy of the signed agreement. To avoid any problems later, grab someone to witness the signatures, or take a photo on your phone of each of you signing the agreement. Summary:","output":"The article offers advice on navigating pet custody discussions after a breakup, emphasizing the importance of a civil approach, considering the pet's best interests, and seeking legal help in cases involving abuse or potential harm to the pet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Michael Craig Judge (born October 17, 1962) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director and musician. Judge is the creator of the television series Beavis and Butt-Head (1993-97, 2011), and co-creator of the television series King of the Hill (1997-2010), The Goode Family (2009), Silicon Valley (2014-present), and Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus (2017). He also wrote and directed the films Beavis and Butt-Head Do America (1996), Office Space (1999), Idiocracy (2006) and Extract (2009). Raised in New Mexico, Judge graduated from University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics. Despite his King of the Hill protagonist Hank Hill being identifiable as a conservative and his The Goode Family being essentially a satire of many liberal precepts, Judge avoids discussing his political leanings. The Goode Family has been described as a conservative show.  In reviewing Idiocracy, Salon stated, \\"Judge's gimlet eye is so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border on South Park libertarianism.\\" A writer for the libertarian magazine Reason seems to agree, comparing King of the Hill to the anti-authoritarian point of view of South Park and The Simpsons, though he calls the show more populist, noting the disdain King of the Hill seems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, and big-box chains.  Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in an IGN interview about King of the Hill:  I try to not let the show get too political. To me, it's more social than political I guess you'd say, because that's funnier. I don't really like political reference humor that much. Although I liked the episode \\"Hank's Bully\\" where Hank's talking to the mailman and he says, 'Why would anyone want to lick a stamp that has Bill Clinton on it?' To me that's just like more of a character thing about Hank than it is a political joke or anything. I don't want to do a bunch of stuff about the war, particularly.  In June 2016, before the presidential election in November, Rolling Stone published an article stating that Judge would produce Idiocracy themed campaign advertisements opposing Donald Trump's presidential campaign if given permission from Fox to do so. It was later reported by Business Insider that the ads would not go forward. did he have a strong stance on one particular political view?","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems that Mike Judge does not have a strong stance on one particular political view.

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly.

One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest. So he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him. Then after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones. He was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man. Everybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?\\"  The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: \\"If I could just come down, I would show you!\\" That's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully.

What is the most logical next event? How to choose an accent wall  Find the natural focal point in the room.  The focal point of a room is not always the wall you see when you first walk in. Go with the wall that you want to draw attention to because it's interesting or unique in some way.","output":"Choosing an accent wall can greatly enhance the aesthetic appeal of a room while also creating a sense of depth and dimension. It’s important, however, to pick the right wall to accent, considering various factors such as the focal point of the room, the overall color scheme, and the desired visual effect. Let’s go through a detailed step-by-step guide on how to choose an accent wall: 1. Identify the room's focal point: The focal point is the first thing that captures one's attention when entering a room. It could be a large window, a fireplace, a piece of art, or even an architectural feature like a built-in bookshelf. Choosing the wall surrounding or in closest proximity to the focal point ensures that your accent wall will seamlessly integrate into the room’s design and enhance its overall appeal. 2. Consider the room's layout: Assess the shape and dimensions of the room to help determine which wall would make the best accent wall. Typically, the ideal accent wall is one with minimal to no interruptions such as doors, windows, or switches. However, exceptions can be made if the wall has unique features that add visual interest. 3. Take note of the available lighting: The accent wall should be illuminated beautifully, whether it's through natural light or artificial sources. Consider walls that receive an ample amount of sunlight, which will help in highlighting the accents during the day. Additionally, well-placed floor lamps, table lamps, or wall sconces can accentuate the accented wall when the room’s primary source of light is unavailable. 4. Assess your color scheme: The accent wall should complement the room's color palette, not clash with it. When selecting the color or pattern for your accent wall, keep in mind the other colors in the room. The accent wall should be visually striking and create a sense of balance within the space. 5. Consider different techniques and materials: You're not limited to just paint when creating an accent wall. Wallpaper, wood, stone, and fabric are just a few examples of materials that can be incorporated to create a unique and immersive design. Also, feel free to explore different painting techniques such as color blocking, geometric patterns, or even a large-scale mural. 6. Keep the room's purpose in mind: The room's primary function should play a role in your accent wall choice. For example, a bedroom might benefit from a calming and soothing accent wall, while a home office could feature a bolder and more energizing design. 7. Test your choice before committing: Before you purchase paint or materials, try out different ideas by using paint samples, swatches, or digital tools that allow you to visualize your choices. Experiment with different colors, patterns, and materials to see which option works best for the space. 8. Seek advice and inspiration: If you're uncertain about your choice, consult with friends, family, or interior design professionals for advice. You can also seek inspiration from design websites, blogs, and magazines to see how various accent wall options have been implemented in similar spaces. 9. Reevaluate and tweak if necessary: Once you've made your decision and installed the accent wall, step back and assess the overall result. Does the accent wall enhance the room as you had envisioned? If not, make adjustments or consider alternative options to perfect the look and feel of the space. By following these steps, you’ll be able to choose an accent wall that not only highlights the room's focal point but also enhances the space's overall aesthetic appeal, creating a visually striking and harmonious environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Article: Although man has known asbestos for hundreds of years, it was not until 160 years ago that it was mined for the first time on the North American continent. H.W.Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers,was responsible for the opening of that first mine. Mr. Johns was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves,which looked much like ordinary work gloves,he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imagine that he had increased business in asbestos roofing materials. However,because it was very expensive to transport them from Italy to the United States, Mr. Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein, in the province of Quebec in Canada.

You are given a new situation: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier.  and a hint : Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.  Please answer this question : In which year Rob would not observe quarrying effect, this year or last year?","output":"To determine in which year Rob would not observe the quarrying effect, we need to consider the presence of valley glaciers, as quarrying occurs in this type of glacier. Last year, Rob visited the Alps mountains in Austria, where he saw a unique type of glacier called a valley glacier. This means that the quarrying effect could be observed there. This year, he visited the Ural mountains in Russia, where he didn't see any valley glaciers.

Context: My mom has been married three times, (nothing against her) and the first two times ended up a total mess. My dad, the first one, ended up just being a shot gun wedding. He was abusive and too young to be married with a child. They got divorced shortly after. A couple years later she met a man named Rob. He was fun, loving, kind, great with me, everything she had been looking for. They dated for.. a few months I think? Maybe a year. Then they got married and we moved to Texas. They were married for 5 years and she was just as miserable those 5 years. He was mean, he lied about everything, he was addicted to porn and stole from his job. He was controlling and wouldn’t let anyone else handle money. It was a rough house to grow up in and hard on my mom as she tried to keep me from the abuse. Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didn’t even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later. I remember her telling me that she confronted him about his change of character and he had told her “Everyone puts on an act at first.” As if it was a normal thing. He had depression and I believe he wanted everyone to be just as miserable as he was. After they got divorced he had on and off again relationships, got a girl pregnant and got married, then she divorced him. He lived with his cousin for a while. The only stability he ever had was with my mom and I. I think that’s why he wanted to leave. Stability meant he had to become an adult and he didn’t want to have to take responsibility.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? pick from the following.  * pull it off.  * chop it off.","output":"Pulling it off could lead to complications such as accidental splattering of jalapeño juice that contains capsaicin, which can be irritating. Therefore, the most sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning is chopping it off. Using a knife or a sharp instrument provides control over the process, unlike pulling, which could apply an unpredictable amount of force.  In detail, here are the steps to safely chop off the tail of a jalapeño pepper: 1. Choose the Right Jalapeño: The first step is choosing the right jalapeño. Look for a firm one with a bright green color and no signs of shriveling or soft spots.  2. Prepare Your Work Area: Ensure your work area is clean and you have a cutting board and sharp knife available. Consider wearing disposable gloves to avoid getting capsaicin (a compound in jalapeños that causes the spicy sensation) on your hands, which can lead to discomfort or a burning sensation. 3. Wash the Jalapeño: Before chopping off the tail of the jalapeño, wash it thoroughly under cold running water to remove any dirt or pesticides. Dry it completely so it doesn't slip on the cutting board. 4. Hold the Pepper: Grasp the jalapeño pepper firmly by the tail (also known as the stem or the cap), ensuring your fingers are away from the area where you intend to cut. 5. Make the Cut: Place the blade of your knife across the top of the jalapeño, positioning it just beneath the tail. Carefully apply downward pressure to chop off the tail in one swift action. The tail will separate from the rest of the jalapeño. 6. Dispose of the Tail: You can now throw away the removed tail. Be sure to wash your hands again, and clean the knife and cutting board to remove any capsaicin residue. 7. Continue Prepping: After removing the tail, you can proceed with slicing, deseeding, or stuffing the jalapeño as per your recipe. Remember that safety is paramount in the kitchen; therefore, using a knife is the preferred method for cleanly and predictably cutting off the tail, as opposed to pulling it off. It is important to note as well that you must be careful if cutting a portion of the pepper that contains the seeds and veins, where most of the spiciness is concentrated. Plus, if you don't have plenty of experience dealing with spicy peppers, it's highly recommended to use gloves to prevent skin irritation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Strong Academic Performance: Stanford seeks students who have demonstrated excellence in their studies. A high GPA, challenging coursework (AP, IB, or honors courses), and a strong class rank will demonstrate your academic aptitude. 2. Outstanding Test Scores: High standardized test scores, such as the SAT or ACT, are essential for applicants. Having scores in the top percentile will strengthen your application. 3. Extracurricular Activities: Involvement in extracurricular activities, particularly those demonstrating leadership, teamwork, or dedication to a specific area, is an important aspect of your application. Examples include sports teams, clubs, volunteer work, research, or internships. 4. Passion, Initiative and Interests: Stanford looks for students who are passionate about their interests and have demonstrated initiative in exploring those interests outside of the classroom. This could include personal projects, research, entrepreneurial endeavors, or any undertaking that showcases your dedication to a particular field. 5. Letters of Recommendation: Strong recommendations from teachers, counselors, or other mentors are essential for a compelling application. These letters should speak to your character, commitment, and achievements, providing firsthand evidence of your abilities and potential. 6. Personal Essays: Stanford requires applicants to write multiple essays as part of their application. These essays are an opportunity to express your unique personality, experiences, and aspirations. They help the admissions committee get to know you beyond numbers and achievements. Writing thoughtful, authentic, and well-crafted essays is crucial. 7. Demonstrated Interest: Exhibiting a genuine interest in attending Stanford can be beneficial to your application. This can include visits to the campus, attending information sessions, or interacting with current students or faculty. 8.

Pick from:  * no  * yes","output":"Let's analyze both sentences step by step: (1) Sentence 1 talks about a complex number being expressed in polar form. A complex number has the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit (i^2 = -1). In polar form, the same complex number is represented as r(cosθ + i sinθ), where r is the magnitude and θ is the angle in radians. (2) Sentence 2 talks about a polar number being expressed in its complex form. A polar number is typically a number in the form r ∠ θ, where r is the magnitude and θ is the angle in radians. Converting a polar number to its complex form gives us a complex number in the form a + bi, where a = r*cosθ and b = r*sinθ.

The Living End were formed in 1994 by Chris Cheney and Scott Owen, who had met years earlier in primary school through their older sisters and began performing together from 1990 while attending Wheelers Hill Secondary College in Melbourne. Cheney and Owen had their first public gig at The Rob Roy in Melbourne in 1991. Cheney was a fan of rockabilly group Stray Cats and this prompted Owen, who originally played piano, to switch to double bass. The pair formed a cover band, The Runaway Boys, which performed Stray Cats and The Clash material. That group were named after a track, of the same name, from the Stray Cats self-titled debut album (February 1981). The Runaway Boys initially played in the local rockabilly music scene but expanded their audience by performing in regional towns. Cheney later recalled \\"[w]e played to all the jivers and rock 'n' rollers ... And we slowly drifted into Melbourne's rockabilly scene\\". As Cheney and Owen persevered, the band went through several drummers, while they were still attending school.  By 1994 Cheney and Owen were writing their own material and decided to change the band's name to The Living End - a reference to the film, Rock Around the Clock (1956). According to Cheney \\"It's an old '50s term, meaning 'far out', 'the greatest' ... We were still into the whole '50s thing, but we wanted a neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music\\". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance.  During that year they recorded a track, \\"Headlines\\", which had been co-written by Cheney and Owen. The group sent a T-shirt and demo tape to Green Day guitarist and lead vocalist, Billie Joe Armstrong, and landed a support slot for the 1995 Australian tour by his band, Green Day. After that tour, The Living End recorded additional tracks for their debut extended play, Hellbound, which received moderate support from community radio stations. It was produced by the group and included \\"Headlines\\" from the previous year. Ed Nimmervoll, an Australian musicologist, described the EP's sound: \\"they turned their back on '50s rock revivalism and adapted that instrumentation to original songs steeped in UK punk\\".  In November 1995, the trio recorded their second EP, It's for Your Own Good, which appeared in the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, \\"From Here on In\\", which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey's drum style was compared with The Who's Keith Moon. \\"From Here on In\\" was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, Occasional Course Language.  The Living End toured Australia for a year, then in August 1997 they recorded new material to sell at their live shows. Their double A-sided single, \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\", was issued in January the following year. Also that month they had supported The Offspring on the Australian leg of their tour. \\"Second Solution\\" / \\"Prisoner of Society\\" peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and was certified double-platinum by ARIA for shipment of 140,000 copies. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 it won the Highest Selling Single category; and eventually became the highest selling Australian single of the 1990s. It lasted a record-breaking 47 weeks in the Top 50.  In October 1998 it peaked at No. 28 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It was later featured in the game, Guitar Hero World Tour. \\"Second Solution\\" was used in the soundtrack for the 2002 movie, Cheats, which starred Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, and Mary Tyler Moore. Early in 1998 \\"Prisoner of Society\\" was issued as a separate single in the United Kingdom and, the following year, in the US. The single appeared in the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard's Alternative Songs Chart.  The band signed with Modular Recordings for the release of their debut self-titled album, which appeared on 12 October 1998, and was co-produced by Gravina with the trio. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, became the then-second highest-selling debut rock album in Australian music history and, by 1999, was certified 4x Platinum for shipment of 280,000 units. Their next Australian single, \\"Save the Day\\", was issued in September 1998, a month ahead of the album. It made the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became their highest charting hit on the New Zealand Singles Chart, where it reached No. 10. From the album, a total of six singles were released including a live cover version of \\"Tainted Love\\", which was issued as a radio-only single on Triple J. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999, The Living End won two more awards: Best Group and Breakthrough Artist - Album. At the ceremony they were also nominated for Album of the Year and Highest Selling Album. In October 2010 their debut album was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.  The Living End's second album, Roll On, was recorded during July 2000 with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, Silverchair) producing and appeared in November that year. It peaked at No. 8 on the ARIA Albums Chart and reached the top 40 in New Zealand. Although Roll On was a more creative work, Nimmervoll mentioned that they had \\"broadened their musical scope while keeping in tact what made them unique - the instrumentation and the socially-aware lyrics\\". The album did not achieve the status of their earlier album as it was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 copies. Despite this, fans consider it to be as strong as the self-titled album; \\"[it's] an absolute scorcher! That's what years of live honing can do for a band that was already white-hot\\".  Cheney later stated that he was trying to prove to critics that The Living End were not a band simply defined by their hit, \\"Prisoner of Society\\", and the album showed this by displaying other influences, as well as their traditional fast-paced rockabilly music. Rolling Stone' Jenny Eiscu compared it to The Clash's creative breakthrough, London Calling (December 1979), as they \\"stomp all over the boundaries between punk, reggae, rockabilly and plain old rock & roll - and it still sounds like a revelation, twenty-two years after [T]he Clash did it. The pupils don't quite outpace the masters here ... But the band is obviously having such a riotously good time that you'd be a sucker not to stomp your foot and join the party\\". Much of the style was comparable to 1980s hard rock and pub rock, as well as many tracks being obscure mixes of many ideas, resulting in 'procrastinating' structures. This defined the album's creativity.  The album's first two singles, \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" and the title track, peaked into the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. \\"Pictures in the Mirror\\" also reached the top 20 in New Zealand, while \\"Roll On\\" peaked at No. 33 on the Billboard Alternative Songs Chart, and appeared in the top 150 of the UK Singles Chart. In March 2001 Billboard's review of Roll On described their sound as \\"Aussie punkabilly\\", while the group's lyrics show a \\"socially progressive attitude, discussing prejudice, racism, and political conflict\\". The trio received US-wide coverage by playing on both Conan O'Brien's and David Letterman's late-night variety shows. The album included \\"Carry me Home\\", which appeared on the Guitar Hero II soundtrack. However, touring in support of Roll On and the related singles was halted after Cheney had a car accident on the Great Ocean Road, rendering him unable to play for a significant period of time: he was \\"hospitalised for 2 months\\". He had been on travelling to the house of a member of fellow Australian band and tour mates, Bodyjar.

Authorities said the official cause of death for the parents, Benjamin and Kristi Strack, is suicide, homicide for the two youngest children and it could not be determined for the 14-year-old son. Police said the autopsies drug toxicity caused all five deaths.      According to police, officials found a letter written by the 14-year-old son, Benson.      The letter stated he knew he was going to die and left his possessions to a friend.      Officials said friends and family told them Benjamin and Kristi had said they were concerned with the \\"evil in world,\\" a \\"pending apocalypse\\" and wanted to escape the \\"impending doom.\\"      Friends said they thought thought that might mean the family could be moving somewhere to live \\"off the grid.\\"      Benjamin and Kristi Strack, along with three of their children, were found dead on Sept. 27, 2014 inside their home.      They were discovered by the couple’s 18-year-old son, who is now the only surviving member of the immediate family.      Police said they found medications and cups filled with a “red liquid” next to the bodies of five members of a Springville family.      According to documents, “Investigators at the scene determined the cause of death to be an accidental or intentional poisoning either by ingestion or environmental causes.\\"      In another warrant affidavit, officers said they found the bodies of Benjamin and Kristi Strack and their children Benson, 14; Emery, 12; and Zion, 11; inside the master bedroom.      “Kristi and Benjamin were lying in the bed and the three children were lying around the bed, covered in bedding up to their necks,” police wrote in an affidavit. “Officers reported there was a red liquid substance coming from the mouth of Kristi Strack. All the occupants of the home were non-responsive. Next to each of the victims was a cup/drink with a liquid inside.”      Police wrote in a search warrant affidavit that they recovered boxes of cold and flu medication.      “Also in the same closed bag, were two empty boxes of allergy relief medication consistent with generic Benadryl. Approximately five empty blister packs were located for this medication. Among the items located were cups with a red liquid substance in Pepsi cups. Also located withing the residence were empty bottles of liquid Methadone. The Methadone was dispensed to from a drug treatment clinic. Some of the empty bottles had future dates on them,” the search warrant affidavit stated.      An officer stated in another affidavit that it is probable the deaths were not accidental, writing: “…with the placement of the bodies, it would appear somebody had to position the bodies after they were deceased.”      MORE: Family found dead in bedroom of Springville home ||||| SPRINGVILLE, Utah (AP) — A Utah couple and their three children who were found dead in their home last fall overdosed on drugs after the parents told friends and family they were worried about the apocalypse, authorities said Tuesday.

(Associated Press)      Police also found old letters written by the mother to a Utah inmate serving time for killing family members in the name of God, slayings chronicled in the 2003 Jon Krakauer book \\"Under the Banner of Heaven.\\"      Benjamin and Kristi Strack and three of their four children — ages 11, 12 and 14 — were found dead in September in a locked bedroom of their Springville home. All five were tucked into covers in and around their parents' bed.      At a news conference Tuesday, Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said investigators have concluded their probe and determined the family members died from drug toxicity from either methadone, heroin or a combination of drugs, including those found in cold medicine.      Authorities determined the parents committed suicide. The younger two children's deaths were ruled homicides, although Finlayson said there were no signs of a struggle.      The manner of death for the 14-year-old, Benson Strack, was undetermined.      Police said Benson wrote a goodbye letter, leaving some of his belongings to his best friend. The only other recent writing the family left behind was a notebook containing handwritten to-do lists about feeding the pets and other chores.      Finlayson said interviews with people who knew the Stracks indicated the parents were worried about evil in the world and wanted to escape from \\"impending doom.\\"      \\"There seemed to be a concern about a pending apocalypse that the parents bought into,\\" Finlayson said. \\"While some friends though that suicide may have been, or could have been, included in their plans, others believed they were going to move somewhere and live off the grid.\\"      During their investigation, police found years-old letters between Kristi Strack and Dan Lafferty, who is serving a life sentence after being convicted of committing a double-murder with his brother Ron.      \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" is about members of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told through the true story of the Laffertys' crimes. The two killed their brother's wife and 15-month old daughter.      Ron Lafferty is on death row after his conviction in the July 1984 slayings of his sister-in-law, Brenda Lafferty, and her baby in American Fork. He claimed to have had a religious revelation sanctioning the slayings because of the victim's resistance to his beliefs in polygamy.      Investigators said Kristi Strack was deeply interested in the case and struck up a friendship with Dan Lafferty.      \\"It was almost like he talked to her like one of his children,\\" Lt. David Caron said. She and her husband both became close to him, and he had directed his remains to go to them after his death. They hadn't talked to him since 2008 and investigators do not believe the couple's beliefs came from Dan Lafferty, police Cpl. Greg Turnbow said.      \\"He felt really sad they had committed suicide,\\" Caron said.      Benjamin Strack's brother Jacob said the final report from investigators wasn't surprising to relatives still mourning the family's deaths.      Looking back, the connection to Dan Lafferty was a troubling sign about the couple's mental state, he said.      The Stracks' older son and the children's grandmother found the bodies Sept. 27, according to search warrants. The older son was Kristi Strack's child from a previous marriage.      Police found cups with liquid inside next to each of the bodies and a child's sand bucket behind a door with traces of the same combination of methadone and cold medication that was found in their systems.      Police believe that Benjamin Strack died last because he was the only member of the family who wasn't underneath bed covers.      In a recording of the 911 call released Tuesday, family friend Maureen Ledbetter tells the dispatcher about the deaths as grandmother Valerie Sudweeks screams in the background.      The methadone used in the deaths was prescribed to Kristi Strack, police said.      Court records show Benjamin and Kristi Strack had a history of legal and financial problems and had gone through court-ordered drug treatment several years ago. Investigators said they weren't aware of any contact with state child services workers.      Benjamin Strack's boss, bricklaying company owner Alex Short, has said it appeared those troubles were behind them.      Springville is a city of about 30,000 near Provo, about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City. ||||| SPRINGVILLE — Apparently concerned with the \\"evil in the world\\" and a pending apocalypse, Benjamin and Kristi Strack took the lives of three of their children and then killed themselves with lethal doses of drugs, Springville police believe.      The children — Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11 — all died of a lethal cocktail of diphenhydramine and methadone. Kristi Strack died of a combination of those drugs plus dextrophan and doxylamine. Benjamin Strack died from toxic levels of heroin, according to a report from the Utah State Medical Examiner's Office.      Ben and Krisiti Strack's deaths were determined to be suicides. The manners of death for Emery and Zion were labeled as homicides because police said they were too young to consent to any type of suicide pact.      The death of 14-year-old Benson, who wrote what was thought to be a goodbye letter to a friend prior to his death, was listed as \\"undetermined.\\"      \\"There are some questions we can't answer and may never be able to answer,\\" Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said Tuesday.      Investigators believe the children all drank from a small bucket, like a pail that a child would bring to a beach, that contained the lethal cocktail that first put them asleep before killing them.      \\"There is no evidence any of the family members were forced to take lethal doses of any drug combinations, nor was there any evidence they took the drugs willingly,\\" Finlayson said, adding there were no signs of a struggle either.      A red liquid that had been found in cups in the bedroom turned out to have no controlled substances in them, he said.      Whether the youngest children knew what they were drinking is a question that police don't believe they will ever be able to answer. With the exception of Benson's goodbye letter, no suicide notes were found.      The release of the final report into the Strack family deaths brings to a conclusion the Springville Police Department's investigation into the tragic incident from the night of Sept. 27, 2014, when all five bodies were found in the parents' bedroom, 954 E. 900 South, by the Stracks' oldest son.      Because the oldest son was an adult, had a job and was engaged, Finlayson said, investigators can only speculate that that was the reason he was not included in the Stracks' plan.      The crime scene      How to get help for mental illness or suicide prevention: by Devon Dolan      SALT LAKE CITY — After the Springville Police Department released its findings in the murder-suicides of the Strack family Tuesday, licensed therapist Julie Hanks called Benjamin and Kristi Strack's belief in an apocalypse delusional and a sign of mental illness. \\"A lot of parents are concerned about evil in the world, but this is taking it to a whole new level,\\" said Hanks, executive director of Wasatch Family Therapy. \\"Depending on the mental illness, the symptoms can really vary,\\" she said. \\"Some people do not believe they are mentally ill. They think the way that they are thinking and behaving is normal.\\" When a family members begins expressing extreme, rigid beliefs, Hanks said it can be a sign of mental illness. \\"I would encourage you to talk to them with love and just say, 'Hey, I'm concerned about this,'\\" she said. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, KSL encourages you to call the suicide prevention hotline at 1-800-273-TALK.

During the emotional call, she tells the dispatcher the \\"family all killed themselves.\\" Others can be heard yelling and crying in the background.      Relatives told investigators that \\"leaving\\" this world had become a fairly common theme with the Strack family leading up to their deaths. But many believed the Stracks only had plans of moving to a sparsely populated area, such as somewhere in Montana, and living \\"off the grid,\\" Finlayson said.      Detectives believe Ben Stack was the last person to succumb to the drug overdose. Zion was found on the master bed, on his back with the sheets pulled up to his neck, according to police. Kristi Strack was found on the other side of the bed, also under the sheets.      The body of Ben Strack was found on top of the covers, between Zion and Kristi, with one arm and leg partially draped over his wife.      Benson's body was found lying on his stomach on a mattress on the floor. Emery's body was found on a mattress under a blanket at the foot of the bed, according to police.      The toxic levels of drugs found in Kristi Strack's system were more than what would have been in the bucket, police said. They believe she took methadone separate from what the children were given.      Most of the drugs, except the heroin, found in the Stracks' systems were over-the-counter medications. Kristi Strack was a heroin user receiving methadone treatment at the time of her death.      There were notebooks with \\"to do lists\\" as if someone were going on vacation, the report states.      The note that was found in the house was written by Benson to a friend.      \\"The note indicated that Benson was aware that he may die, and was bequeathing his personal possessions to his friend,\\" the chief said.      \\"Essentially, yes, it was a goodbye letter to a friend. And it basically mentioned that he would no longer exist on this Earth. Just saying goodbye, and he had an inkling he would be found dead,\\" Ben Strack's brother Jake earlier told KSL News.      \\"The apocalyptic beliefs of Ben and Kristi Strack may have played heavily on Benson's writings,\\" Finlayson said.      A link to Dan Lafferty      During Tuesday's press conference, Finlayson addressed some of the many rumors that his department received following the deaths. Among them was a possible connection between Kristi Strack and one of Utah's most notorious killers, Dan Lafferty.      Kristi Strack was a friend of a daughter of Lafferty, and they often visited him in prison. Sometime later, police say both Ben and Kristi Strack visited Lafferty at the prison. While investigators believe the Stracks hadn't seen or had contact with Lafferty since 2008, they still had some type of bond with him. Lafferty had wanted the Stracks to take care of his remains when he died.      Finlayson said when his detectives went to the prison to question Lafferty, he seemed genuinely remorseful upon hearing the news of their deaths. It was determined that Lafferty had no knowledge of a mass suicide plan. Police said Lafferty and the Stracks \\"didn't generally\\" talk about apocalyptic ideologies, and Lafferty appeared to have a different view of death than the Stracks.      Another prominent rumor was Kristi Strack's cancer. Finlayson said their investigation showed she had ovarian cancer at one time, but was believed to be cancer-free at the time of her death.      \\"We express our sincerest condolences to the families of Ben and Kristi Strack. We appreciate their patience and understanding during this long and painful process,\\" the chief said.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Alright, little one, let me explain this to you. So, Japan is a country with its own leaders just like we have our president.

So, they had a big election, which is like a contest where people choose who they want in charge. In this contest, Mr. Noda and his team lost, and another team called the Liberal Democratic Party won instead. Now, a man named Shinzo Abe, who used to be in charge before, will be the leader again. Now that Mr. Abe's team is in charge, they have to work on fixing problems in Japan, like helping people get jobs and keeping everyone safe.

To isolate s, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 32: (32 * s) / 32 = 192 / 32 The 32 on the left side of the equation will cancel out, leaving us with: s = 192 / 32 Now, we need to perform the division on the right side: 192 / 32 = 6 So the equation becomes: s = 6 Therefore, the value of s is 6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: Make iced coffee. How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making iced coffee, follow these steps: 1. Choose your coffee beans: The quality of your coffee beans plays an essential role in the flavor of the iced coffee. Choose high-quality beans from a reputable supplier, and pick a taste that you prefer – be it light, medium, or dark roast.  2. Grind the coffee beans: Using a coffee grinder, grind the beans to a medium or coarse consistency. This allows for better extraction when brewing the coffee. Measure out the appropriate amount – depending on how strong you prefer your coffee, generally one ounce of coffee per four cups of water is a good starting point. 3. Brew the coffee: There are multiple brewing methods you can use for iced coffee, including the following:    a. Cold brew: Combine ground coffee with cold water in a jar (one part coffee and four parts water) and let it sit at room temperature for 12-24 hours. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve or a coffee filter to remove the coffee grounds. This will create a cold brew concentrate that can be diluted with water, milk, or a milk alternative.    b. Drip coffee maker: Brew your coffee as you normally would, but using either the double-strength method (twice the amount of coffee grounds than you'd usually use, to ensure a stronger flavor) or just the standard brewing method, depending on the intensity desired.    c. French Press: Measure the coffee grounds into the French Press and add hot water (just off boiling). Stir and let the coffee steep for four minutes, then press the plunger down to separate the coffee grounds from the liquid. 4. Cool the coffee: Once you have brewed the coffee, let it cool to room temperature. This can take 20-30 minutes depending on the brewing method. You can also put the coffee in the refrigerator to expedite the cooling process. 5. Prepare your serving glass: Grab a glass or a tumbler, and add ice cubes to it. Remember that using larger ice cubes will melt slower and dilute the coffee less. 6. Mix your preferred iced coffee: Pour the cooled coffee over the ice. Depending on whether you made a concentrate or regular-strength coffee, you may need to dilute the drink with water, milk, or a milk alternative. Stir the mixture until well combined. 7. Customize your iced coffee: You can add sweeteners such as simple syrup, honey, maple syrup, or sugar to taste. You can also enhance the flavor with a splash of vanilla extract, chocolate syrup, or caramel sauce. If you prefer a creamier texture, you can add a splash of half-and-half or a milk alternative. 8. Serve and enjoy: Give your iced coffee a final stir, then serve and enjoy! For an added touch, you can garnish your iced coffee with a sprig of mint or a sprinkle of cocoa powder. Remember that iced coffee can be further customized by experimenting with different brewing methods, coffee beans, and added flavors. Personal taste preferences will guide your choices as you work to perfect your ideal iced coffee recipe."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce.

Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose, and perform their own musical material, including lyrics and melodies.  - Sinéad Marie Bernadette OConnor (born 8 December 1966) is an Irish singer-songwriter who rose to fame in the late 1980s with her debut album \\"The Lion and the Cobra\\".

Their music occupies the territory where funk, dub, industrial music and electronica intersect. The core members are Doug Wimbish (bass), Keith Leblanc (percussion) and Skip McDonald (guitar) and producer (sometimes credited as \\"mixologist\\") Adrian Sherwood. Despite being short-lived as band proper (there are only two albums credited to the band \\"Tackhead\\"), the legacy and output of these groups of musicians has been prodigious.  - Pop Will Eat Itself (also known as PWEI or The Poppies) are an English alternative rock band formed in Stourbridge in 1986 with members from Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country. Initially known as a Grebo act, their style changed to incorporate sample-driven indie and industrial rock. Their highest charting single was the 1993 top ten hit, \\"Get The Girl! Kill The Baddies!\\". After initially disbanding in 1996, and having a brief reformation in 2005, they issued their first release in more than five years in 2010.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - Coldcut are an English electronic music duo composed of Matt Black and Jonathan More. Credited as pioneers for pop sampling in the 80s, Coldcut are also considered the first stars of UK electronic dance music due to their innovative style, which featured cut-up samples of hip-hop, breaks, jazz, spoken word and various other types of music, as well as video and multimedia. According to \\"Spin\\", \\"in 87 Coldcut pioneered the British fad for DJ records\\".  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Spoken word is an oral art that focuses on the aesthetics of word play and intonation and voice inflection. It is a 'catchall' that includes any kind of poetry recited aloud, including hip-hop, jazz poetry, poetry slams, traditional poetry readings and can include comedy routines and 'prose monologues'.  - Dub is a genre of music that grew out of reggae in the 1960s, and is commonly considered a subgenre, though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae. Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece, and emphasizing the drum and bass parts (this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a 'riddim'). Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo, reverb, panoramic delay, and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. Dub was pioneered by Osbourne \\"King Tubby\\" Ruddock, Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different.  Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock (most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk), pop, hip hop, disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub has become a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass Traditional dub has survived and some of the originators, such as Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and Mad Professor, continue to produce new material.  - Skinny Puppy is a Canadian industrial music group, formed in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1982. The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (19861995), Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie (long-time associate, producer, and \\"unofficial\\" fourth member until 1995), Mark Walk (2003present), and a number of guests, including Bill Leeb (19851986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Al Jourgensen (1989), and many others.    What is the relationship between 'the beatnigs' and 'alternative rock'? Answer:","output":"The Beatnigs were a San Francisco-based band that combined various music genres including hardcore punk, industrial, and hip-hop influences. They have been described as \\"a kind of avant-garde industrial jazz poets collective.\\" The band was the initial collaboration between Michael Franti and Rono Tse, who later formed The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, as well as Kevin Carnes, who later formed Broun Fellinis. As a precursor to Franti's projects and a fusion of punk, industrial, and hip-hop elements, The Beatnigs can be considered as part of the alternative rock movement. Alternative rock, a broad term used to describe music that diverges from mainstream rock and incorporates a variety of styles such as punk, indie, and experimental sounds, can encompass bands like The Beatnigs who were exploring different musical genres and pushing the boundaries of conventional rock music during their time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes.  (b). No. If I tell you that Grass is a producer in terrestrial biomes, and ask you the question \\"what is a producer in terrestrial biomes?\\", is the correct answer \\"food\\"? Answer:","output":"The correct answer to the question \\"what is a producer in terrestrial biomes?\\" is neither (a) Yes nor (b) No. Instead, I will provide a detailed answer to elaborate on the concept of a producer in terrestrial biomes. Producers in terrestrial biomes refer to organisms, primarily plants, that can generate their own food through the process of photosynthesis. These organisms are the foundation of food chains in terrestrial ecosystems, as they serve as a primary energy source for consumers such as herbivores. Photosynthesis is an essential process in which plants absorb sunlight and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce glucose and oxygen. Producers use glucose as an energy source for their growth and survival, while oxygen is released back into the atmosphere. Food, in this context, refers to the energy obtained by consumers from consuming producers. For example, a herbivore such as a deer consumes grass (the producer) and absorbs energy as its food source. While there is a relationship between producers and food through energy transfer, it is not accurate to define a producer as \\"food.\\" In conclusion, a producer in terrestrial biomes, such as grass, is an organism that generates its own food through photosynthesis and serves as a primary energy source in the food chain. To describe a producer simply as \\"food\\" would not provide a comprehensive understanding of its role within the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is the revised version of the sentence with the appropriate punctuation: \\"The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\\" The use of a comma here allows for proper flow and eases the reader's understanding of the two distinct, yet connected, ideas presented in the sentence. The first clause, \\"The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge,\\" conveys the notion that prudent individuals acquire knowledge and insight. The second clause, \\"the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge,\\" emphasizes that wise people actively seek out new knowledge to continue expanding their understanding of the world around them. In essence, this sentence highlights the importance of continually pursuing wisdom and knowledge, both for those who are prudent and those who consider themselves wise. By using the comma to separate the two clauses, the reader is better able to grasp the intended meaning and connection between the two concepts. Additionally, it's important to note that this sentence is written using an older style of English, which is why words such as \\"getteth\\" and \\"seeketh\\" are used instead of their modern counterparts, \\"gets\\" and \\"seeks.\\" However, since the original request focused on punctuation correction, I maintained the original style of language used for consistency. In summary, the corrected sentence with proper punctuation is as follows: \\"The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.\\" This enables the reader to better understand the connection between the two clauses and reinforces the overall message of the sentence, which encourages people to continuously seek knowledge and wisdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Whenever an entire industry is beset by scandal, look for the participants who are clean.","output":"This statement is about finding honest and reliable players in an industry that is currently experiencing widespread scandal. Step 1: Analyze the statement To better understand the task at hand, we first need to analyze the statement. We see that the main idea is to identify individuals or entities in the industry that have not been involved in any wrongdoing or scandal. This suggests that, despite the negative reputation that the industry as a whole may have gained, there are still trustworthy and diligent players worth acknowledging and supporting. Step 2: Research the industry in question Since the industry experiencing the scandal is not mentioned, let's assume there's a hypothetical industry called \\"X.\\" To fulfill the task, I will need to conduct research on all firms, organizations, and prominent figures within industry X. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the current scandal situation and those involved in it. Step 3: Identify known scandals and individuals involved Next, I will compile a list of the major scandals that have affected industry X, as well as the individuals and entities known to be involved. This will allow me to create a database of entities to avoid when searching for clean participants. Step 4: Evaluate the industry players After gathering information on industry X and its scandals, I will carefully evaluate the remaining players. This step involves conducting thorough background checks, reviewing financial statements, analyzing business practices, and seeking any evidence of ethical or legal misconduct. Criteria for this evaluation should include: - Proper licensing and accreditation - Regulatory compliance - Proven track record of integrity - Adherence to industry best practices and ethical standards Step 5: Compile a list of clean participants Once I've completed the evaluation process, I will compile a list of participants in industry X who have shown no involvement in any scandal or wrongdoing. These participants will be considered the \\"clean\\" ones, and their presence may ultimately help to restore trust and confidence in the industry. In conclusion, the statement suggests that it is essential to identify and support the honest and diligent players in an industry experiencing a scandal. By investigating the various entities in such an industry and determining which have remained clean despite the wider controversies, we can reaffirm the belief that not all participants in a scandal-ridden sector are dishonest or untrustworthy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lopes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Wanda Denise (nee Andino), a seamstress, and Ronald Lopes Sr., a US Army staff sergeant, of Portuguese background. She had a younger brother, Ronald Jr., and a younger sister, Raina Anitra (who professionally goes by Reigndrop). Lopes said her father was \\"very strict, very domineering\\" and that he treated the family like they were in \\"boot camp\\". He was a \\"talented musician\\" and played the harmonica, clarinet, piano, and saxophone. At the age of 19, having heard of an open casting call for a new girl group through her then-boyfriend, Lopes moved to Atlanta to audition. Originally starting as a female trio called 2nd Nature, the group had been renamed TLC, derived from the first initials of its members at the time: Tionne, Lisa and Crystal. Things did not work out with Crystal Jones, and TLC's manager Perri \\"Pebbles\\" Reid brought in Damian Dame backup dancer Rozonda Thomas as a third member of the group. To preserve the band's original name, Rozonda needed a name starting with C, and so became Chilli, a name chosen by Lopes. Bandmate Tionne Watkins became T-Boz, derived from the first letter of her first name and \\"Boz\\" (slang for \\"boss\\"). Lopes was renamed \\"Left Eye\\" after a compliment from a man who once told her he was attracted to her because of her left eye. Lopes emphasized her nickname by wearing a pair of glasses with the left lens covered with a condom, in keeping with the group's promotion of safe sex, wearing a black stripe under her left eye, and eventually getting her left eyebrow pierced.  The group arrived on the music scene in 1992 with the album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip. With four singles, it sold six million copies worldwide, leading to the group becoming a household name. Two years later CrazySexyCool was released, selling over 23 million copies worldwide, and cemented TLC as one of the biggest female groups of all time. TLC's third album, FanMail, was released in 1999 and sold over 14 million copies worldwide. Its title was a tribute to TLC's loyal fans and the sleeve contained the names of hundreds of them as a \\"thank you\\".  During the recording of FanMail, a public conflict began amongst the members of the group. In the May 1999 issue of Vibe magazine, Lopes said, \\"I've graduated from this era. I cannot stand 100 percent behind this TLC project and the music that is supposed to represent me.\\" In response to Lopes' comments, Watkins and Thomas stated to Entertainment Weekly that Lopes \\"doesn't respect the whole group\\" and \\"Left Eye is only concerned with Left Eye.\\" In response, Lopes sent a reply through Entertainment Weekly issuing a \\"challenge\\" to Watkins and Thomas to release solo albums and let the public decide who was the \\"greatest\\" member of TLC:  T-Boz and Chilli declined to take up the challenge, though Lopes always maintained it was a great idea. Things were heated between the ladies for some time, with Thomas speaking out against Lopes, calling her antics \\"selfish\\", \\"evil\\", and \\"heartless\\". TLC then addressed these fights by saying that they are very much like sisters that have their disagreements every now and then as Lisa stated, \\"It's deeper than a working relationship. We have feelings for each other, which is why we get so mad at each other. I usually say that you cannot hate someone unless you love them. So, we love each other. That's the problem.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"There's a lot of big words in there, kiddo, but I'll break it down for you!

Her dad could play lots of instruments like the harmonica, which is a little metal thing you blow into to make music, and the piano, which has lots of keys to press for different sounds. When Lisa was a bit older, she heard about a chance to join a girls singing group. She moved to a city called Atlanta and joined a group that was first called 2nd Nature but later changed their name to TLC. The name TLC came from the first letters of each girl's name - Tionne, Lisa, and Crystal. But Crystal left, and a new girl named Rozonda, or \\"Chilli,\\" joined instead. Lisa got her nickname, \\"Left Eye,\\" because a man once told her that he liked her left eye. She liked the name and even began to wear glasses with a covered left lens and a black stripe under her left eye as a kind of special mark. TLC became very famous and sold lots of their music. They even named one of their albums \\"FanMail\\" to say thank you to all their fans. But sometimes, like any friends, they would fight and say mean things to each other. Even though they fought, Lisa once said that they loved each other, and that's why their fights hurt so much.  So, that's the story of Lisa Lopes and her music group, TLC.

Given the two facts above, what requires energy to produce light? Answer:","output":"A light bulb requires energy to produce light, as established by Fact 1. Understanding this concept necessitates an examination of the underlying principles and processes that allow a light bulb to convert electrical energy into visible light, as indicated by Fact 2. To produce light, a light bulb typically uses one of the following technologies: incandescent, fluorescent, light-emitting diode (LED), or halogen. While these technologies differ in terms of efficiency, lifespan, and light output, they all require energy to generate light. 1. Incandescent Light Bulbs: An incandescent light bulb consists of a thin tungsten filament housed within an inert glass envelope. When electrical energy is supplied to the bulb, the filament heats up due to electrical resistance. The heated filament then emits light through a process called incandescence. This process entails that the filament, when sufficiently heated, produces both heat and visible light as a result of its increased temperature. 2. Fluorescent Light Bulbs: In contrast to incandescent bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs use electrical energy to excite mercury vapor within a phosphor-coated glass tube. When the mercury atoms become excited, they emit ultraviolet (UV) light, which is then absorbed by the phosphor coating. The absorbed UV light causes the phosphor coating to emit visible light through a process called fluorescence, which is more energy-efficient than incandescence. 3. Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Light Bulbs: LEDs utilize semiconductor materials, such as gallium arsenide or silicon carbide, to create electroluminescence. When electrical energy is applied to the semiconductor, electrons recombine with electron holes within the material, releasing energy in the process. This energy is emitted as light in the visible spectrum. Due to their superior efficiency and long lifespan, LED light bulbs are becoming increasingly popular. 4. Halogen Light Bulbs: These bulbs are similar to incandescent bulbs in that they use a tungsten filament. However, they differ in that they contain a halogen gas, such as iodine or bromine, within the glass envelope. The halogen gas forms a chemical reaction with the evaporated tungsten atoms, allowing them to be redeposited on the filament. This increases the life of the filament and allows the bulb to operate at a higher temperature, resulting in a brighter and whiter light compared to a standard incandescent. Considering these technologies, it is evident that different mechanisms are employed to convert electrical energy into visible light. Regardless of the specific technology, all light bulbs require energy input to generate the desired light output, reaffirming that energy is a fundamental prerequisite for producing light in a light bulb."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The way the light reflected off the ripples of the water seemed to breathe life into the landscape, making it look almost ethereal. Taking a step back to absorb the complete view, Sarah's eyes wandered over the fine details she had spent hours perfecting: the delicate blending of blues, purples, and grays that comprised the clouds; the expertly rendered texture of the rugged mountain peaks that loomed majestically in the background; and the intricate patterns of light and shadow that served to guide the viewer's eye to the lake's quiet shore. As her gaze lingered on the painting's representation of a small, rustically charming cabin nestled on the lakeshore, she recalled the summer she spent there with her late grandmother - recalling their walks through the dense forest, the smell of the damp earth and pine needles beneath their feet, and the laughter shared as they cast their fishing lines into the water. Feeling the familiar pang of nostalgia well up within her, Sarah knew that she had immortalized more than just a picturesque scene on canvas; she had captured a moment in time, a memory shared with her beloved grandmother who had been an avid art lover and nature enthusiast.

This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail   and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek   a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther  _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current  .

Silk Road founder convicted, faces life in prison Ross Ulbricht, founder of black market website Silk Road, has been found guilty for his role in creating a haven for drug trafficking and hackers. A jury in Manhattan federal court convicted him of seven counts including drug trafficking through the internet, narcotics-trafficking conspiracy, running a continuing criminal enterprise, computer-hacking and money-laundering, according to Bloomberg. He could face up to a lifetime in prison. Prosecutors said that Ulbricht ran the business worth an estimated 1.2 billion from 2011 to 2013 from home. Evidence from his computer was key to showing his role in creating Silk Road and that he planned to kill five individuals who said they’d divulge the names of buyers and sellers involved with the website. “The supposed anonymity of the dark web is not a protective shield from arrest and prosecution,” according to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in a statement after the verdict. The U.S. government made plans to auction off the digital currency seized after last year’s Silk Road bust. Around 144,000 bitcoins were given to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Ulbricht was arrested in October 2013. The web developer used the nickname Dread Pirate Roberts in his work on the emporium.

Everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies (the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic, ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando shouts heads down\\" all good guys do it and all bad guys don't so that they can blast away ad lib (with a good conscience), that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously.

I don't mind the criticism of the Pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled, even headed representatives of power in this movie.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What concession did Notre Dame make in order to keep their football affiliation?\\" is in \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers.

However, a more detailed and comprehensive response is provided below for better understanding. CJIS, or Criminal Justice Information Services, refers to a division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that manages a suite of criminal justice databases and services. These databases and services are essential tools for state and local law enforcement, as well as other criminal justice agencies across the United States. One critical component of CJIS is the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a computerized index of criminal justice information. The information contained in the NCIC is available to Federal, state, local, and tribal criminal justice agencies for the specific purpose of enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their law enforcement efforts. The NCIC database contains millions of records that can be accessed by the appropriate criminal justice departments, including: 1. Criminal record histories 2. Fingerprint records 3. Stolen vehicles, firearms, boats, and other property information 4. Wanted person information 5. Missing person information 6. Protection orders 7. Sex offender registry 8. Gang and terrorist group affiliations In addition to NCIC, CJIS also provides other services and tools like the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), and the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. States and local agencies can access and contribute to CJIS databases through secure and authorized connections. These connections are established through the use of Criminal Justice Information Services Security Policy, which sets the guidelines and requirements for securing and accessing the systems. To obtain access to CJIS, agencies must meet specific requirements, and they must adhere to strict security protocols to ensure the information is not compromised. In summary, state and local agencies indeed have access to CJIS, which includes various databases and services used for criminal justice purposes. These agencies can both access and contribute information to the system, adhering to stringent security protocols to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the data."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Chrisye was born Christian Rahardi in Jakarta on 16 September 1949 to Laurens Rahadi, a Chinese-Betawi entrepreneur, and Hanna Rahadi, a Chinese-Sundanese housewife. He was the second of three sons born to the couple; his brothers were Joris and Vicky. The family lived on Talang Street near Menteng, Central Jakarta, until 1954, when they moved to Pegangsaan Street (also in Menteng). While attending GIKI Elementary School, Chrisye befriended the neighbouring Nasution family; he became especially close to Bamid Gauri, with whom he played badminton and flew kites. Context: Chrisye's tenor voice and performance on Badai Pasti Berlalu led Amin Widjaja of Musica Studios to ask him to sign with Musica; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of Guruh Gipsy. Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, Sabda Alam (Nature's Order), incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies.  The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.  After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower). All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra; the album also featured the English-language \\"To My Friends on Legian Beach\\". Two of the songs, \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" (\\"Galih and Ratna\\") and \\"Gita Cinta\\" (\\"Love Song\\"), were used in the 1979 film Gita Cinta dari SMA (Love Song from High School); Chrisye played a minor part in the film's sequel, Puspa Indah Taman Hati (Beautiful Flower in the Heart's Garden), as a singer. Due in part to the popularity of the film, Puspa Indah was well received and sold well; \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" and \\"Gita Cinta\\", released as singles, were also commercially successful.  In 1980 Chrisye appeared in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (As Beautiful as the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS that it would be fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical. Question: what is the title of this album?.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion.  Now, I have a new situation: Jordan is conducting an experiment to see how Iron rusts. He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits. Gong-gil, who initially sympathized with the King, begs the tyrant to give him his freedom but his pleas fall on deaf ears.The king's main concubine, Jang Noksu, becomes enraged by the attention the king has been lavishing on Gong-gil. The Counsel Members tries to have him killed during a hunting trip, resulting in the death of one of the members of the street performing team. Days after the hunting trip, there is a kiss between the king and Gong-gil. Then, she...

In this case, we see that the right side of the equation can be simplified by combining like terms: 8 - 36 = -28 Now, our equation is: -7*p = -28 Step 2: Isolate the variable p. To isolate the variable p, we want to get rid of the coefficient -7 in front of it. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -7: (-7*p) / (-7) = -28 / (-7) Step 3: Simplify and solve for p. By dividing both sides of the equation by -7, the coefficient in front of p on the left side of the equation will cancel out, leaving us with: p = -28 / (-7) Now, perform the division on the right side of the equation: p = 4 So, the solution to the equation -7*p = 8 - 36 is: p = 4"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Caterpillars can hibernate outside in their containers all winter, or you can put it into the refrigerator. Don’t freeze your caterpillar. Your caterpillar will not eat while it’s hibernating, but it may be lightly active on warmer days. When it’s mildly active, it might eat available food. When your caterpillar wakes up in the spring, it’ll be ready to fatten up in preparation for its metamorphosis into a moth, which will take place later in the spring. Make sure that you provide your caterpillar enough food for it to get ready to turn into a pupa, which is its cocoon-phase. Your caterpillar’s fuzzy skin will slide off once it has fattened up, leaving a smooth black oval called a pupa. This is it’s cocoon phase. You can expect it to shed its exoskeleton during spring. Since you can’t pinpoint the actual date of your moth’s emergence, keep track of its progress each day. While your pupa does not need food, you may want to mist the caterpillar’s home daily to keep it humid. Simply spray a light spritz of water into the container. While their actual time in the pupa can vary, giant leopard moth caterpillars only take a few weeks to metamorphose into a moth.

Three years since it was discovered during excavations on an ancient cemetery, a rare bronze Roman cockerel has been given a permanent home. The 2nd century figurine is believed to be one of only nine ever found in the Roman Empire, and is part of a new exhibition at the Corinium Museum in the Cirencester. Other finds on display include a hoard of almost 1,500 Roman coins, and the perfectly preserved vase it was found in. This bronze and enamel cockerel was found in a child's grave in Roman Cirencester in 2011 - and has been painstakingly restored. It is now on display at the Corinium Museum. Archaeologists made the discoveries three years ago while excavating a western cemetery at the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester - or Corinium as it was known when it was the second largest town in Roman Britain. The bronze and enamel cockerel was said to have been placed in the grave of the two-year-old Roman. girl by her parents, and experts believe it was used to ask the Gods to protect her. They also. believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave to ease their daughter's transition into the 'next world'. The child was buried wearing hobnailed. shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel, and the remarkable. enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel. The cockerel is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green. There is a separately moulded tail plate, also enamelled, with ‘openwork’ decoration. The beak is shown open, in the act of crowing. It is believed that the Romans gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with Mercury. Experts. claim it was Mercury, a messenger to the gods, that was also. responsible for conducting newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. Statues of this god, including one in the Corinium Museum, commonly show a cockerel at the base. The association probably stems from Mercury’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘announcer’ of the new dawn. Mercury was also the ‘herdsman for the dead’, guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife. It is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of Mercury and expresses a parent’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world. 'It is the most significant Roman cemetery investigation in the town since the early 1970s,' said a spokesman for the town’s Corinium Museum. 'The cockerel found underneath the former Bridge’s Garage site - now St James’s Place - is one of only nine known cockerel figurines from the Roman world, and is the only example with its tail intact. 'Displayed with the cockerel are an exceptional example of a Roman flagon and a selection of jewellery which include beads and bracelets found in a richly furnished child’s grave. 'These are high status objects, which give a fascinating insight into the people of Corinium. Neil Holbrook, Chief Executive of Cotswold Archaeology added: 'The. cockerel is the most spectacular find from more than 60 Roman burials. excavated at this site. 'It was excavated from the grave of young child. and was placed close to its head. Interestingly a very similar item was. found in Cologne in Germany and it looks like they both could have come. from the same workshop based in Britain.' The Tetbury Hoard, also on display at the museum, contain 1,437 silver and copper-alloy 3rd century Roman coins. 'The hoard is the museum’s first Roman Coin Hoard and comes from a fascinating period of political upheaval across the Roman Empire,' continued the museum's spokesman. 'It was a time of rapid succession of rulers and usurpers. The coins themselves tell this story. 'Depictions and inscriptions represent 12 emperors from just a 16 year period.' The child was buried wearing hobnailed. shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel and the remarkable. enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel.

The cockerel (pictured) is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, and eyes are inlaid with enamel. The conservation work took four months to be painstakingly carried out by experts. Archaeologist Neil Holbrook, from Cotswold Archaeology, said the work had 'exceeded expectations', particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail. 'It reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been,' he said. 'This must have cost, in current money, thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make, and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three-year-old child is not something that you would do lightly. 'It really shows that this was a very wealthy, important family, and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child.' A burial site was unearthed at the. site including more than 40 burials and four cremations; something. experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the. 1970s. This. particular figurine is one of only four ever found in Britain, with a. total of eight known from the whole of the Roman Empire. Mr Holbrook added: 'Without a doubt this is the best Roman cockerel ever found in Britain. 'This is the best find that I have seen come out of Cirencester in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance.' The. object is believed to have been made in northern Britain, with evidence. pointing to a workshop in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which made enamel. artefacts. Talks are under way to find a permanent display site for the cockerel, possibly at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester. Only nine similar cockerel figurines are known from the Roman world, including four from Britain. The similarities in construction and decoration suggest that they were made at roughly the same time and could have come from the same workshop. Our example is the only one from Britain to have come from a grave and the only one from any location to have survived with a tail. The two which are closest in form are from Cologne in Germany and Buchten in the Netherlands. In these examples the enamelling survives in the original colours of yellow, blue and red and it is probable that the Cirencester example was originally just as brightly coloured. Britain produced some of the finest enamelled objects in the Roman Empire and these were traded as far afield as Germany, France, Spain and Italy. The four enamelled cockerels from the continent all come from Germany and the Low Countries. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Michael Moseley. Gates in effect fired both men for \\"systemic issues associated with declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance.\\" This followed an investigation into two embarrassing incidents involving mishandling of nuclear weapons: specifically a nuclear weapons incident aboard a B-52 flight between Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB, and an accidental shipment of nuclear weapons components to Taiwan. The resignations were also the culmination of disputes between the Air Force leadership, populated primarily by non-nuclear background fighter pilots, versus Gates. To put more emphasis on nuclear assets, the USAF established the nuclear-focused Air Force Global Strike Command on 24 October 2008. What is the answer to this question: What Secretary of the Air Force resigned in 2008?","output":"The Secretary of the Air Force who resigned in 2008 was Michael Wynne. His resignation, along with that of the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General T. Michael Moseley, was accepted by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on 5 June 2008. The resignations were a result of systemic issues associated with declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance, which were highlighted by two embarrassing incidents involving the mishandling of nuclear weapons. This included a nuclear weapons incident aboard a B-52 flight between Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB, and an accidental shipment of nuclear weapons components to Taiwan. These events, as well as disputes between the Air Force leadership and Gates, led to the establishment of the nuclear-focused Air Force Global Strike Command on 24 October 2008 in an effort to enhance the emphasis on nuclear assets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Howling success: Idaho's Dog Bark Park Inn is a bed & breakfast guesthouse inside the World's Biggest Beagle. Pet project: Husband and wife chainsaw artists Dennis Sullivan and Frances Conklin built their beagle inn in 1997. Needless to say - the Trojan-horse style abode is very dog-friendly. According to their Facebook page, the B&B proprietors 'created Dog Bark Park as a venue to make, display and sell their chainsaw sculptures.' They then decided to build the two big beagles, Sweet Willy and 12-foot-high Toby, 'to add to the dog theme of their work.' The dog lovers have said they chose the beagle for their architectural feat because it was a safe bet. 'It was the first breed of dog Dennis started carving 28 years ago and it remains a best-seller all this time,' Conklin told BBC. 'Plus, it is a politically correct breed since there are no horror stories about it.' Sweet Willy sleeps four, with a queen bed in the main section and two twin futons in. the head, all decked out with canine-inspired furnishings. Guests enter the beagle's. body from a private second story deck, and are treated to dog-shaped biscuits left on their pillows.

Question: What was the name of the snuff mill that was replaced by a bridge?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington.

A Colorado Sheriff is speaking out over the says the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, in 1995, claiming it was not an accident, despite his department reaching that conclusion 20 years ago. 'Based upon the information I've been briefed on up to this date … I do not think it's an accident,' Sheriff Tony Spurlock told CBS4  in an exclusive interview. 'I don't think it was an accident and I think it's very suspicious,' said Sheriff Spurlock, who became the Douglas County sheriff last month. Last year Harold Henthorn, 58, was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of hi second wife Dr Toni Henthorn, 50. Scroll down for video... First wife: Henthorn's first wife, Lynn,  also died in a remote location with her husband as the only witness. Accused: Harold Henthorn, left, has been accused of murdering his second wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, right, who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012. An autopsy report says she fell or was pushed over the ledge when she paused to take a photo during a hike on Sept. 29, 2012. The couple was visiting the park for their 12th wedding anniversary. Harold Henthorn told investigators his wife slipped and fell, but prosecutors didn't buy his explanation and charged him with murder last November. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May. Only after her death did Toni Henthorn's relatives realize she was covered by three life insurance policies totaling 4.5 million. A claim was sent in for one policy just days after she died, court records show. Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig L. Truman, has said that the case is complicated and that 'justice will be done' once the facts come to light. Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed in a freak accident when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire. But now attention has shifted to Henthorn's first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 30, who also died in mysterious circumstances. She was crushed to death in 1995 when a car slipped off a jack while she and Harold were changing a flat tire. Reports emerged showing that Dr Henthorn, who had one daughter, also had life insurance policies to the value of 4.5 million - and that a claim was made on one of the policies just two days after her death. The indictment says Harold Henthorn, who was the only witness to her death, 'willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with premeditation and malice aforethought did unlawfully kill his wife', CBS reported. He told authorities that his wife had been reaching under the car to help him change the front tire on their Jeep Cherokee on the rural road, when the jack slipped and the Jeep fell on his wife, crushing her. Harold Henthorn collected nearly 500,000 in life insurance proceeds from his wife's death. Detectives closed the case just one week after the investigation, ruling the death an accident, but the Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CBS4 that they have now re-opened the investigation. A source told the channel that Henthorn had taken out a 300,000 insurance policy on his wife. It added that three life insurance policies had been taken out on his second wife - each valued at 1.5 million - and that efforts had been made to collect on it on the first business day after her death. Changing his mind: Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock says the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, in 1995 was not an accident, despite his department reaching that conclusion 20 years ago. How she died: As he changed the tire,  his wife crawled under the Jeep, apparently to retrieve a lug nut or flashlight, when he said a jack gave way or slipped and the Jeep fell, crushing her. Harold Henthorn collected nearly 500,000 in life insurance proceeds from his wife's death. One of the policies named the Harold and Toni Henthorn Trust as the beneficiary and a claim was sent in for the policy on October 1, 2012, CBS reported. No payment was made, however. The Douglas County coroner wrote 'this is an accidental death' on May 9, two days after Lynn Henthorn died. It is not clear who attempted to file a claim for the policy. The claim was made before her body was cremated or a memorial service was held. Dr Henthorn, an ophthalmologist, had been married to her husband for 12 years. She left behind a daughter, then seven. Douglas County investigators reopened the Lynn Henthorn death two weeks after the death of Toni Henthorn in 2012. They say they have done 40 interviews in the past 27 months and continue to diligently work the case. That information leads my detectives to determine this is probably not an accident,' emphasized Spurlock. Some have accused the local police of botching the investigation. Items and paperwork went missing at the time, hence the need for a follow-up. Case closed: The coroner wrote 'this is an accidental death' on May 9 1995, two days after Lynn Henthorn died. Three days later, on May 12, six days after the death, the Douglas County Sheriff's Department followed suit, closing the case as an accidental death and ruling no criminal charges should be filed. Oversight: Some are now asking if the Douglas County Sheriff’s Department mishandled the investigation into Lynn Henthorn’s death the first time around. At the time Henthorn  told investigators several different and conflicting stories of what he did after r the Jeep fell on his wife. He told some that he gave her CPR and helped get her out from under the vehicle. He told others he did not give her CPR and was unsure of how she was pulled out from under the Jeep. One investigator said he looked over Henthorn's hands and noticed no unusual marks, bruises or scratches that might have indicated an attempt to pull the car off his wife. Even the flashlight was found under his car in the 'off' position yet no questions were raised about it. In an interview with a Douglas County investigator, Harold Henthorn said he had been having a lot of flat tires recently 'due to construction in the area of their home. There is one tire with a nail in it in their garage at home.' The file indicates there was no follow up done to locate the tire Henthorn talked about to verify that part of his story. On the evening of the accident Patricia Montoya was returning to  Denver  on Highway 67 with a group of friends and family members. They stopped to help Henthorn and his stricken wife. 'He didn't want us to touch her,' Montoya told CBS4. 'It was a creepy feeling that he gave all of us.' Stories: Harold Henthorn told different sheriff’s investigators shifting versions of what happened in the hours before Lynn Henthorn's death, but police did not pursue the discrepancies or attempt to pin Henthorn down. She said her group immediately began administering CPR to Lynn Henthorn, angering Harold Henthorn, who did not want anyone to touch his wife. And Montoya said when they placed their jackets over Lynn to keep her warm, 'The husband wouldn't take his coat off for her, he wouldn't take the coat off to cover her. We all felt the same oddness. It was creepy, it was like he was trying to harm her,' said Montoya. She said everyone in her group came away from that evening with the same feeling. 'We all said that he probably set it up to where that car fell on her and that was all our thoughts. We all thought the same thing. It didn't seem like that was an accident.' She shared her thoughts with the police yet nobody came to interview her about what her suspicions or what she had witnessed. 'We were all very surprised. We all felt they would come and find us. And they never did.' Only when the case was reopened in October 2012 did  investigators seek her out and interview her about that night. Now in documents that provide further damning detail of the deaths of both Toni Bertolet Henthorn and Lynn Rishell Henthorn the prosecution has highlighted the similarities between both women's passing. Both deaths, the documents state, 'involved bizarre 'accidents.' Both left Henthorn with significant insurance benefits. He is beneficiary or trustee on three policies on Toni, totaling around 4.5million and received a 500,000 pay out on the death of his first wife. Both occurred in remote locations. Both times Henthorn was the lone witness. Both deaths occurred after about 12 years of marriage. Henthorn told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Witness: Patricia Montoya was returning to the Denver metro area with a group of friends. They stopped to help Henthorn and his stricken wife. Harold Henthorn's behavior was strange but the police didn't want to know. New tact: Tony Spurlock said investigators are employing new techniques and digging up new information on Lynn Henthorn’s death. He is optimistic that the reopened investigation will have a positive result. According to the documents the man who met his second wife on a Christian dating website, even told a Sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy. In the case of his second wife, an incident which happened just two years after she almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam Harold had thrown off their deck is disclosed in the documents. After that incident, Harold joked to friends: 'I was trying to kill my wife.' In both situations, the documents continue, the women were doing atypical things when they died. Lynn Henthorn was 'fastidious in dress and a cautious women who would not ordinarily crawl under a jacked-up car to search for lug nuts while wearing a nice sweater, especially after exploratory surgery only two weeks earlier.' Sheriff Spurlock is attempting to reassure the public that things will be different this time around and that there will be a positive outcome. He says investigators are employing new techniques and digging up new information on Lynn Henthorn's death. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, died in 1995 in a supposed accident while changing a flat tire. However, the Colorado sheriff has recently claimed that her death was not an accident and considers it very suspicious. Harold Henthorn was already indicted in the first-degree murder of his second wife, Dr. Toni Henthorn, who died during a hike in 2012. Both of their deaths resulted in significant insurance benefits for Harold Henthorn. The cases also share similarities, including both deaths occurring in remote locations, Henthorn being the only witness, and the marriages lasting for about 12 years.

A school yard incident prompted the challenge for Shridhar Chillal to grow his nails on his left hand when he was a teenager.      Now 82, Mr Chillal, from Pune, India, decided to cut his nails when a New York museum promised to \\"maintain them very nicely and for a lifetime\\".      Speaking through a museum interpreter he said: \\"I don't know if the teacher is dead now or not, but I would definitely like to say the thing that you scolded me for, I took it as a challenge.      \\"I have competed the challenge and now I'm here.\\"      Mr Chillal was officially recognised in 2014 by the Guinness World Records as the person with the longest fingernails ever on a single hand.      He had not cut the fingernails on his left hand since 1952.      They measured a cumulative length of 909.6 centimetres for the record.      Adjudicators noted his thumbnail measured an unbelievable 197.8cm and curled into a tight coil at the end.      \\"When I had my nails I took special care of them because they're a very delicate part of our body, I took care of them for a lifetime,\\" he said.      The nails prevented him from sleeping properly — he had to wake up regularly to check they weren't being crushed.      \\"I spent 66 years of my life on my nails,\\" Mr Chillal said.      \\"It was a very difficult decision for me to cut my nails, but when I realised after cutting them they'd be at Ripley's Believe it or Not, and the museum is going to maintain them … then I felt like I was making the right decision, and that's when I decided to cut my nails.\\"      The weight of the long nails left Mr Chillal's hand in a permanently fixed position, unable to separate his fingers.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Each website and application entails different social expectations, some of which may be unmentioned. Browse the Internet to determine what forms these expectations can take. It is often considered common courtesy, for example, to message a distant acquaintance on Facebook with a brief greeting before adding them as a friend. If a website or application does list any social expectations, of course, it is good practice to follow them. Many online forums, including the more updated and newfangled Reddit, will list their rules of engagement. Breaking these rules can lead to social exclusion and, at worst, banishment from the site or application. Note that online forums will often contain different messaging boards with their own unique sets of rules--don't presume that one subforum's rules will necessarily apply to another subforum. For example, Reddit's messaging board \\"askphilosophy\\" permits you to post open-ended questions, but its messaging board \\"philosophy\\" only permits you to post questions that are followed by some sort of argument or position. Meeting people online can be incredibly intimidating, but at some point the only way to succeed is simply by going forth and actually engaging people! Remember that the relative anonymity of the Internet means that you'll be able to retreat from uncomfortable situations at any time, which is helpful to remember if you end up needing to escape an awkward interaction. On the other hand, this same anonymity is what enables certain individuals to act more rashly or harshly than they otherwise would, and so it is important to disengage with these individuals and realize that their opinions have no bearing on the real, offline you. The anonymity of the Internet also means that you can never quite be assured of who you are dealing with. Never give out more personal information than you are comfortable giving out. Never agree to go anywhere or do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Trust your gut feeling about a situation. If you ever feel threatened, reach out out to the moderators of the website or application or find the link to report the individual in question. If you need additional support, you can contact a cyberbullying hotline managed by people who understand your situation.

From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991.

Finnish is mainly spoken in Finland, and it is a minority language in Sweden, Norway, and Russia. Here is a rough translation of the given text to English: \\"I thank you for your understanding and will make sure that this does not happen again.\\" Finnish language is known for its unique features and complex grammar. Some of the main characteristics include vowel harmony, which ensures that certain vowels are grouped together within a word, and the extensive use of agglutination, in which multiple suffixes are attached to a word to convey its meaning. For example, the structure of words in Finnish usually involves adding a root and one or more suffixes to create nouns, adjectives, verbs, and other word forms. Moreover, Finnish is known for its 15 cases that help in expressing various grammatical relations such as location, possession, direction, and more. The Finnish vocabulary has also been influenced by other languages, with loanwords borrowed from Germanic, Slavic, and Baltic languages, as well as from modern languages such as English. Additionally, the Finnish alphabet uses the Latin script, with a few additional letters. Overall, Finnish is known for its rich oral and written cultural heritage that includes the famous Finnish epic poem, the Kalevala, which has influenced many aspects of Finnish arts, literature, and even inspired numerous nationalistic movements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the two major river systems fur traders arrived on to get to Manitoba? from the following article ?  Manitoba ( (listen)) is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is often considered one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and is Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers 649,950 square kilometres (250,900 sq mi) with a widely varied landscape, stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the late 17th century, fur traders arrived on two major river systems, what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system. A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called Rupert's Land. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of Métis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada, a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 that created the province. Manitoba's capital and largest city, Winnipeg, is the eighth-largest census metropolitan area in Canada. Other census agglomerations in the province are Brandon, Steinbach, Portage la Prairie, and Thompson.

Read this and answer the question The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BCE when much, if not all, of modern Tajikistan was part of the Achaemenid Empire. Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire. After the region's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of Khujand and Panjakent) was part of Sogdia, a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi (141–87 BCE) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished.

Answer:","output":"The Great Chicago Fire, one of the most devastating urban fires in history, started on October 8th, 1871, and continued to burn until October 10th, 1871. The fire caused widespread destruction across the city of Chicago, claiming the lives of approximately 300 people, leaving around 100,000 more homeless, and causing massive property damage that was estimated to be around 200 million at the time (which would be around 4.5 billion in today's value). The fire reportedly originated in a small barn owned by the O'Leary family, located at 137 DeKoven Street, in the neighborhood now known as the Near South Side. There are several theories and urban legends surrounding the cause of the fire, with the most famous being that it started when a cow, owned by Catherine O'Leary, kicked over a lantern. However, this theory has since been largely discredited. The fire spread rapidly across the primarily wooden structures that made up most of Chicago's buildings at the time. The strong winds and dry conditions further fueled the fire, making it extremely difficult for firefighters to control. The fire was eventually brought under control on October 10th, after significant rainfall began to extinguish the remaining flames. The aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire led to significant changes in building codes and construction materials, with the aim of preventing similar catastrophes in the future. It also became the catalyst for the rapid rebirth and growth of the city, as the rebuilding efforts attracted investment, innovation, and development in industries such as architecture, infrastructure, and urban planning. Today, the Great Chicago Fire remains a significant event in the history of Chicago, shaping the city's remarkable resilience and development into a major global metropolis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If The Ark, on Eustace Street in Temple Bar, is a children's cultural center that offers a changing program of plays, workshops, readings, and performances, all geared toward youngsters., can we conclude that \\"The Ark is for animals.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"The Ark is for animals\\" based solely on the information provided. The Ark, located on Eustace Street in Temple Bar, is indeed a children's cultural center that offers a diverse range of activities such as plays, workshops, readings, and performances, all aimed at young children. However, the name \\"The Ark\\" appears to be a metaphorical reference and should not be taken literally. In religious and historical contexts, the term \\"ark\\" often refers to a large boat or vessel, such as Noah's Ark from the biblical story, which carried pairs of animals to survive the Great Flood. While the name evokes an image of a sanctuary or protective space, there is no indication that The Ark in Temple Bar directly caters to or involves animals. In the case of The Ark children's cultural center, the name likely refers to providing a safe, nurturing, and creative space for young children to explore and learn through various interactive activities and performances. It can be viewed as an \\"ark\\" nurturing creativity, imagination, and curiosity, enabling children to grow and develop artistically and culturally. It is essential to distinguish between the literal and metaphorical meanings of words and names. In this instance, The Ark metaphorically represents a safe and engaging space for children's artistic and cultural growth, not a sanctuary where animals can find refuge. In conclusion, based on the given information, we cannot assume that \\"The Ark is for animals.\\" Instead, it would be more accurate to say, \\"The Ark is a dedicated cultural center for children to engage, learn and grow through various activities, events, and workshops in a creatively stimulating environment.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit.

During the 1930s, the Navy contracted a 1.5 million dredging of Pearl Harbor to allow larger battleships and the fleet's carriers to enter it. Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island.  Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened. The Army transferred its operations there, leaving Luke Field under Navy control. The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island, and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2; its former namesake was re-honored with a new base, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. A September 8, 1939, presidential emergency proclamation spurred the rapid construction of new facilities to prepare the island for additional operations. This included additional barracks, a new assembly and repair hangar, an administration building, a dispensary, a  control...

Possible A: hungry, gas, obesity, gain weight, feeling full  Why is \\"gain weight\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Gain weight\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because the user's question describes a scenario where the individual is consuming an excessive amount of food and not engaging in enough physical activity to balance it out. This behavior typically leads to a surplus of calories, which the body stores as fat.  Step-by-step justification: 1. The question states that the person is \\"eating too much,\\" implying that they are consuming more calories than their body requires to maintain its current weight. 2. Additionally, the question states that the person is \\"not exercising enough.\\" Exercise helps burn calories, which can offset a portion of the calorie intake. 3. When an individual takes in more calories than they burn, the body stores the excess energy as fat, leading to weight gain. 4. Comparing the possible answers, \\"gain weight\\" is the most appropriate outcome, as it directly follows the cause-and-effect relationship of consuming too many calories without sufficient exercise. 5. In contrast, \\"hungry,\\" \\"gas,\\" and \\"feeling full\\" do not necessarily relate to the long-term outcome of the person's habits, and \\"obesity\\" assumes a more severe level of weight gain, making \\"gain weight\\" a more general and accurate answer based on the information provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Suddenly, he heard a train coming towards him from point A with constant sound of its horn. Eventually, it reached very close to him at point B. Then the train sped by him at point C where he was sitting, reaching point D after some time. Finally, it reached even farther from him at point E.  But I can use this background: Look at the police car in Figure below . The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below.  What is an answer for this question: Which point would have lower frequency, point D or point E? Answer:","output":"Based on the Doppler effect, the point with a lower frequency would be point E. To elaborate, when the train is moving towards John (from point A to point B), the sound waves get compressed, leading to a higher frequency. This causes the pitch of the horn to sound higher. As the train passes by John at point C and continues moving further away from him (from point C to point D and eventually to point E), the sound waves become more spread out. This results in a lower frequency, and thus a lower pitch. The frequency of the sound waves decreases continually as the train moves away from John. Therefore, point E would have a lower frequency compared to point D, since the train is further away from John at point E than at point D."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways. The One is a top-notch, beautifully designed handset packed with the best specs and a ton of compelling features. It also runs a unique, fresh take on Google's Android operating system. And it's available in exactly the same configuration across the three major U.S. carriers. This is the phone that could close the gap between HTC's flagship and those from Apple and Samsung. We spent a couple of hours with the One before its big unveiling in New York today, and were thoroughly impressed by the luxurious materials used on the handset, the expert build quality holding it all together, and a slew of thoughtfully crafted software features. Although the phone carries the branding established last year with the One X, One S, and other HTC phones, the One amounts to a reboot of the company's vision for Android. The One X, HTC's previous flagship, won critical praise, but as an AT&T exclusive it failed to generate the sales the company had hoped for. \\"We think about the One X and we think 'Wow, it was big, and it was one of the best phones we've ever done,'\\" Scott Croyle, HTC's vice president of design, said. \\"But if I were to compare it to, say, other stuff that was out there, I wouldn't say it was a step-change different.\\" The company set out to build a phone that could surpass, not just meet, the performance and quality of the Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy SIII. So it put a huge effort into nailing the Sense user interface, packing the phone with the best tech and broadening its reach across carriers. Sense 4, the previous generation of HTC's Android customization, has been thrown out. Every aspect of Sense has been rethought and redesigned. The result is a slick, clean user interface, full of artful icons that match the flat, understated look Google has been trying to push with its own stock version of Android. And there's a focus in the new Sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive — such as sifting through social media and news apps, or snapping photos and video. \\"I think we came to this recognition that, 'Wow, there are these two other companies that are going to spend a lot more money than HTC,'\\" Croyle said. \\"This is the reality of the business. They have much deeper pockets and they can carpet bomb the industry and they have a tremendous amount of inertia there, particularly with Apple in the U.S. So, for the One, we really had to get it right, we really had to just go for it.\\" While it's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the One and think of the iPhone 5, the One is far from a copycat product. It has a massive — and gorgeous — 4.7-inch 1080p display with a pixel density of 468 pixels per inch. As with nearly every flagship phone out there nowadays, pixels are indiscernible on the One's generous display. Colors look vivid and crisp as well. The touchscreen dominates the front of the One, with aluminum capping each end. Rows of pinholes are machined into each strip of aluminum, serving as pathways for sound coming from a set of dual front-facing speakers. Every phone speaker we've ever heard has sounded like hell. While the One won't replace your Jambox anytime soon, its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we've heard from a phone. Inside, the One features a 1.7GHz, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, 2GB of RAM, and NFC chip, Bluetooth 4.0 and connectivity to both HSPA and LTE networks. Everything is packed into a sleek, aluminum unibody — shipping in either silver or black — that features a subtly curved back with inlaid antennas. The One weighs 5.04 ounces, and is just 0.36 inches thick. The One will also sports a beefed up camera, with a ton of photo and video features — which are so plentiful we've written a separate story focusing on the One's camera. Along with all new hardware, HTC is using the One to introduce an all new take on Android. Sense 4, HTC's last skin, was among the best versions of Google's mobile OS thanks to its simplicity and gimmick-free implementation. The latest version — now just called Sense — brings users from a lock screen to a new Flipboard-like app called BlinkFeed, which displays a feed of information, stories, photos and video from various sources of your choosing. HTC has worked in integration with a few news outlets, so news stories by topic or by outlet can show up in your BlinkFeed. And the app can be connected to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and other social networks as well. See a news story you're interested in reading? Just tap the tile in your feed and you're taken to a view that shows the story and its accompanying artwork in a presentation that makes reading clean and easy — again, very much like Flipboard, Pocket, Pulse and other \\"read it later\\" services. Tap a tweet or post from Facebook you'll be launched into that corresponding social network's Android app. You can even set up BlinkFeed to pipe in your photos and videos. Everything is displayed in reverse chronological order, just like your Twitter timeline, Facebook feed and everything else that's sorted online. While BlinkFeed is a pre-installed app, it's also the default view any One user will see once they unlock their phone. If you want to get to a traditional Android homescreen view — with apps, widgets and folders of apps — just swipe in from the right on BlinkFeed and Android as you know it will appear. \\"If you want regular Android, it's there,\\" Croyle said. \\"But, everybody's snacking on information, whether it's from their social networks or some news source that they're just interested in. So [BlinkFeed] really is geared around that recognition of how people are actually using their phones.\\" AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile will sell the One, along with many smaller regional telecom companies. The significance of this can't be overstated. Currently, only Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S III are offered as widely. The iPhone is sold through AT&T, Sprint and Verizion — and it's on it's way to T-Mobile. The S III is sold by all four of the nation's top carriers. All too often, a great phone, like last year's One X, was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones. The fact that the One is joining it's biggest rivals in a new paradigm that bucks the idea of exclusive phones is a good thing for HTC — because they get to sell their best device in more places — and consumers — because you have more choice when you go to buy your next phone.

The law allowing registered Uruguayans over 18 to buy up to 40g (1,4oz) of the drug a month is not expected to come into force before April. The government hopes it will help tackle drug cartels, but critics say it will expose more people to drugs. By Ignacio de los ReyesBBC Mundo, Montevideo This was a huge victory for the cannabis-smoking community in Uruguay. Hundreds of young people gathered outside Congress in Montevideo to follow the vote on a giant screen. Many shared a joint of marijuana with their friends. They partied amid reggae music and some waved marijuana leaves. There was an atmosphere of celebration inside the Senate too, with dozens of supporters of President Mujica following the  nearly 14 hours of the debate from the spectators' gallery. But not everyone was happy about this law. Senator Pedro Bordaberry of the conservative Red Party told the BBC his country should not become a \\"guinea pig for Mr Mujica's experiment\\". He said: \\"We used to be known for our excellent meat and football, now the world is watching us because of our marijuana.\\" Dozens of supporters of the bill proposed by the left-wing President Jose Mujica gathered outside the Congress in Montevideo to follow the vote. Presenting the bill to fellow senators, Roberto Conde said it was an unavoidable response to reality, given that the \\"war\\" against drugs had failed. \\"We have the duty as the state to give a specific answer to an open territory, small and non-producing,\\" Mr Conde said, adding that Uruguay's borders were used by cartels to smuggle drugs into neighbouring countries. But many senators also spoke out against the bill, before it was passed by 16 votes to 13 on Tuesday. The opposition member Alfredo Solari said Uruguay should not \\"experiment\\" on its people. \\"This project envisages a social engineering experiment and respects none of the ethic safeguards of experimentation on human beings, and these are important in the case of a substance like marijuana, which causes damage to human beings,\\" Senator Solari told Reuters news agency. The project had already been approved by Uruguay's lower house in July. It had also drawn international criticism. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) warned the law would \\"be in complete contravention to the provisions of the international drug treaties to which Uruguay is party\\". The INCB is an independent body of experts established by the United Nations to monitor countries' compliance with international drug treaties. The historic approval comes amid growing debate over drug legalisation in Latin America. A group of former presidents and influential social figures, including Brazil's Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mexico's Ernesto Zedillo and Colombian ex-leader Cesar Gaviria, have called for marijuana to be legalised and regulated. But President Mujica recently asked during an interview why the former leaders only spoke out about the legalisation of marijuana after they had left office. In July, without naming Uruguay directly, Pope Francis criticised drug legalisation plans during a visit to Brazil.","output":"Uruguay has made a big decision and passed a law that allows people who are 18 or older to buy a small amount of a drug called marijuana every month. The government thinks this will help with problems caused by bad people called drug cartels. Some people are really happy about this and celebrated, but others are worried that it's not a good idea and that it might be harmful. This is a big change and people all over the world are watching what will happen in Uruguay because of this new law."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Through to the second round after thrashing Highland League Strathspey Thistle 6-0 at Bellsdale Park on Saturday, the North Ayrshire side will play Lowland League outfit BSC Glasgow on 22 October as they try to keep alive surely ridiculous - but not impossible - hopes of lifting the trophy. Darren Christie, David McGowan, Kenny McLean (two), Ross McPherson and Nicky Docherty got the goals against the Grantown-on-Spey men who made a 350-mile round trip to play the tie, but the good work is done just as much off the pitch as it is on it at a club like Beith Juniors. Robert McCarter, for instance, has been a loyal servant to 'The Mighty' for over 34 years as a past president, treasurer and secretary. He received a whisper near full-time that \\"the attendance was 373 and the pies had all been sold\\". His nod of approval was significant and out came the notepad to record such detail. These bits of information matter at Bellsdale. McCarter watched the match with the aforementioned James Conway and his young son, Lewis, who was eager to express that \\"you're always guaranteed a goal\\" watching Beith. The current president is the welcoming and enthusiastic John Boal and you get a real sense from him that Beith winning the Scottish Junior Cup for the first time last season was a real 'tick it off your bucket list' moment.

Washing kit, hanging kit, filling water bottles and pumping up match balls...that's only a small part of McGuill's job. In another hub of activity, three friendly females are preparing all the necessary refreshments for fans in the food kiosk, with buttered and jammed pancakes from the local baker the highlight of the fare. But the Strathspey Jags contributed to the occasion as well, even though they were comfortably ousted from the Scottish Cup on the park. Their left-back is a Spanish architect by the name of Inaki Fernandino-Soto, who no doubt as a young lad growing up in Valencia dreamt of playing in the Scottish wind and rain in Beith. \\"You never know what life will bring,\\" was his cheery assessment of the situation.

Write a summary based on this article: AP Photo Obama vs. McKinley Alaskans praise the move to rename America's tallest mountain, even as Republicans vowed to fight it.      For 40 years, it’s been Alaska vs. Ohio.      Denali vs. Mount McKinley.      Story Continued Below      Native Americans protective of their culture vs. American history buffs mindful of the last president of the 19thcentury.      Now, after President Barack Obama removed the name of former President William McKinley from the nation’s highest peak, restoring the traditional name of Denali, the seemingly endless sagahas takena new turn. Members of Congress, led by a speaker from Ohio ,are debating whether to attempt to overturn the ruling.      A “deeply disappointed” House Speaker John Boehner of Cincinnati tweeted out his opposition Sunday night, after reports that Interior Secretary Sally Jewell had issued an order changing the name at Obama’s behest.      Congress could pass a new law to block Jewell’s order on the renaming of the mountain. But Democrats would almost surely block the move, not to mention the likelihood that Obama would veto any such legislation.      Despite the long odds, many Ohio representatives seemed eager for a legislative fight.      \\"President McKinley was a proud Ohio Republican who was assassinated during his time in office while serving our nation and deserves the recognition Congress previously awarded him,’’ declared Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Dayton, Ohio, in a prepared statement.      Rep. Bob Gibbs of rural Washington Township, Ohio, blasted the move on Twitter, calling it “constitutional overreach” and said he would be working with lawmakers on the House Natural Resources Committee to see what can be done “to prevent this action.”      Boehner’s staff said the speaker was still unsure of his next action.      But in Alaska, where the state government had long supported a name change, the reaction to the move was strikingly different. Tribal leaders and many other Alaskans cheered the move as a sign of respect for native language and tradition.      Obama’s decision to side with the native Alaskans over a president who never visited Alaska was reminiscent of other, largely symbolic recent moves to redress historic injustices to minorities or promote minority interests. They include his efforts to present posthumous medals to blacks and Jews who were denied them in past wars, his lighting of the White House in rainbow colors to support the right to same-sex marriage, and his recent hiring of the first-ever transgender White House staffer.      “This action recognizing a native language, recognizing something that Alaskans wanted to do for a long, long time ... does speak well in his legacy and treatment of Native Americans in general,” declared Ed Alexander, a board member of Gwich’in Council International. “He’s the first president to have a White House tribal summit annually. It really shows that level of respect.”      Richard Peterson, president of the central council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian tribes of Alaska, agreed.      “It symbolizes that our first people of Alaska are still here,” he said. “President Obama, especially in his second term, has done more than any other president for Alaskan natives in recent history.”      Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, joined in praising Obama’s move, noting that most Alaskans had been fighting for decades to make the name change.      Dana Wright, a descendant of one of the first people to climb Denali, who then himself climbed the massive peak in 2013 to draw attention to the need for a new name, said of Obama: “In terms of things he could do, this probably took very little effort but had a big impact for a lot of people. If he hadn’t done this, it probably would’ve gone back and forth in Congress forever.”      Indeed, the fight over renaming the mountain would likely have been resolved years ago, if not for the doggedness and maneuvering of former Rep. Ralph Regula, an Ohio Republican and ardent backer of McKinley’s legacy who worked for decades to block the renaming of the peak.      Early on, after the Alaska legislature asked the federal government to change Mount McKinley’s name in 1975, Regula helped broker a compromise that named the broader national park Denali while keeping the mountain itself named after McKinley. But that peace offering failed to mollify Alaska lawmakers, including fellow Republicans like Rep. Don Young, and the feud between the two states continued to simmer.      So Regula came up with a new legislative gambit to prevent an obscure government agency—the United States Board on Geographic Names—from bowing to Alaska’s wishes. Because the agency’s own guidelines forbade the board from changing a name if Congress was also considering the matter, Regula introduced legislation affirming the McKinley name, thus blocking the agency from taking action, a tradition he continued until his retirement in 2009.      But fellow Ohio lawmakers took up the torch and continued his blockade after his retirement, even as members of the Alaska delegation offered their own bills to change the name to Denali.      In the end, it took an Obama administration executive order to lay the matter to rest, although Jewell nodded to the Regula strategy in her order to change the name.      “While the Board does have a policy of deferring action when a matter is being considered by Congress, contradictory bills on this issue have been proposed by various members of Congress since the late 1970s,” Jewell wrote, while noting that the Interior secretary can take action when the “Board does not act within a reasonable time.”      Not surprisingly, many Ohioans dispute that interpretation.      Ohio Sen. Rob Portman called Obama’s move “yet another example of the president going around Congress.”      Portman added, in a later tweet, “McKinley was a proud Ohioan, and the mountain was named after him as a way to remember his rich legacy after his assassination.”      Actually, McKinley’s name was affixed to the mountain by Alaskans before his election to the presidency. Alaska, at the time, was a large producer of gold, and McKinley’s Democratic rival in the 1896 election, William Jennings Bryan, was campaigning on a pledge to peg the nation’s currency to silver, not gold.      McKinley defeated Bryan and went on to serve as commander in chief during the Spanish-American War. He was re-elected in 1900, but six months after his inauguration he was assassinated by an anarchist while shaking hands with well-wishers at the World’s Fair in Buffalo, New York.      His vice president, Theodore Roosevelt, assumed office and took the country in a more liberal direction, leading to unprecedented growth of the federal government and its power. Though Roosevelt has assumed a larger place in history, McKinley continues to be well-remembered by conservatives who favor a smaller government.      Karl Rove, the longtime adviser to former President George W. Bush, is set to publish a new book on McKinley. But he sounded a more moderate note than the Ohioans, urging that Obama find a new way to honor McKinley.      “The 25thpresident gets overlooked too much already. Would hope the president would find another appropriate way to honor McKinley. Luckily there’s a book coming out about McKinley in November,” Rove wrote in an email to POLITICO Playbook.      This article tagged under: Barack Obama      Alaska ||||| Ohio lawmakers reacted angrily Sunday to the White House's announcement that President Obama would formally rename Alaska's Mt. McKinley — North America's highest peak — \\"Denali\\" during his trip to The Last Frontier this week.      \\"Mount McKinley ... has held the name of our nation's 25th President for over 100 years,\\" Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, said in a statement. \\"This landmark is a testament to his countless years of service to our country.\\" Gibbs also described Obama's action as \\"constitutional overreach,\\" saying that an act of Congress was required to rename the mountain, because a law formally naming it after Ohio's William McKinley was passed in 1917.      \\"This political stunt is insulting to all Ohioans, and I will be working with the House Committee on Natural Resources to determine what can be done to prevent this action,\\" Gibbs said.      The Ohio delegation's disappointment at the decision cut across party lines.      \\"We must retain this national landmark's name in order to honor the legacy of this great American president and patriot,\\" Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, whose district includes McKinley's hometown of Niles, in eastern Ohio.      Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, also blasted the decision as \\"yet another example of the President going around Congress\\", while House Speaker John Boehner said the naming of the mountain after McKinley was \\"a testament to [the 25th president's] great legacy .. I am deeply disappointed in this decision.\\"      The state of Alaska has had a standing request to change the name to \\"Denali\\" — a native Athabascan word meaning \\"the high one\\" — dating back to 1975, when the legislature passed a resolution and then-Gov. Jay Hammond appealed to the federal government.      But those efforts and legislation in Congress have been stymied by members of Ohio's congressional delegation. Even when Mount McKinley National Park was renamed Denali National Park in 1980, the federal government retained Mount McKinley as the name of the actual peak, which rises 20,320 feet above sea level.      \\"With our own sense of reverence for this place, we are officially renaming the mountain Denali in recognition of the traditions of Alaska Natives and the strong support of the people of Alaska,\\" said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell.      The White House cited Jewell's authority to change the name, and Jewell issued a secretarial order officially changing it to Denali. The Interior Department said the U.S. Board on Geographic Names had been deferring to Congress since 1977, and cited a 1947 law that allows the Interior Department to change names unilaterally when the board fails to act \\"within a reasonable time.\\" The board shares responsibility with the Interior Department for naming such landmarks.      In 1896, a prospector in the mountains of central Alaska named the range after McKinley upon learning that he had been nominated as a candidate for U.S. president.      McKinley became the country’s 25th president and was assassinated in 1901, six months into his second term. The 20,000-foot-tall peak had been previously known as Denali -- generally believed to be central to the Athabascan tribe's creation story and the site of significant cultural importance to many Alaska natives, according to the White House.      Denali also is an Athabascan word meaning \\"the high one\\" and is widely used across the state today, according to the White House.      Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who had pushed legislation for years to change the name, said Alaskans were \\"honored\\" to recognize the mountain as Denali.      \\"I'd like to thank the president for working with us to achieve this significant change to show honor, respect, and gratitude to the Athabascan people of Alaska,\\" Murkowski said in a video message recorded atop the mountain's Ruth Glacier, with cloudy snow-capped peaks behind her.      Obama will not personally visit the peak during his stay in Alaska, which runs through Wednesday. He'll spend much of the trip in Anchorage, south of the peak, where he will attend a State Department-sponsored meeting on climate change, titled GLACIER/Global Leadership in the Arctic Conference.      The conference will bring together foreign ministers of Arctic nations and key non-Arctic states with scientists, policymakers and stakeholders from Alaska and the Arctic, the White House said.      “The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and is experiencing the consequences,” the White House also said Sunday.      Supporters of the global warming theory say those changes include higher average temperatures and less winter sea ice, which is allowing for heavy storm surges that the sea ice once kept at bay, the White House said.      On Monday, Obama is scheduled to meet with leaders from the Alaska native community along with Gov. Bill Walker, Lt. Governor Byron Mallott and Murkowski to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation between the federal government and Alaska native tribes. Among the issues scheduled to be discussed is management strategies for fish and wildlife.      The Associated Press contributed to this story. |||||","output":"So, there was a big mountain called Denali in Alaska, and it was a very important place for the people living there. A long time ago, they started calling it Mount McKinley, after a man named President McKinley who was the leader of the United States. People in the state of Ohio, which is where President McKinley was from, really liked the mountain being named after him. But, the people in Alaska wanted to change the name back to Denali because it's an important word in their language, and it means \\"the high one\\". They asked for it to be changed back for a very long time, but the people in Ohio didn't want it to be changed. Then President Obama decided to change the name of the mountain back to Denali. He did this because he thought it was important to respect the people from Alaska and their traditions. Many people in Alaska were very happy about this, but the people in Ohio were not so happy. They think President Obama should find another way to honor President McKinley."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: Biblical names are out and pop culture is in for America's newborns - if this year's list of most popular baby names are anything to go by. The once hearty trend of parents naming their babies after Biblical scripture has shown a steady decline in recent years according to an annual baby name report by BabyCenter.com. What can be gathered in supplement shows a perhaps surprising uptick in inspiration from pop culture such as erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, TV show Downton Abbey and even Apple electronics. Inspired: Beyonce's newborn baby Blue Ivy, pictured with her here, may be behind the slight jump in the same names for babies born this year along with other pop culture references. Among names taken from the Bible for 2012 there were just three boys' names among the list of top 10 - Ethan, Noah and Jacob - while none made the top 10 list for girls. TOP 10 BOYS NAMES:. TOP 10 GIRLS NAMES:. That's a stark contrast from 12 years ago when Biblical names dominated the top 10 list, in 2000 it being: Michael, Jacob, Matthew, Joseph, Joshua, and Andrew. For girls in 2000 it was Hannah, Sarah and Elizabeth. If any trend can be seen this year one could blame at least one other book Americans are reading right now. From EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey, first name Grey shot up 155 spots. Anastasia rose 43 spots and Elliot - Christian Grey's brother - went up by 14 per cent. If any Downtown Abbey fans received visits from the Stork this year, they may be mutually held responsible for an increase in the names Branson (by 32 per cent), Charlie (23 per cent), Elsie (29 per cent), and Daisy (27 per cent). Names Edith, Sybil, Robert, Cora, Isobel and Violet also rose. TV admirers: Names featured in the hit TV show Downtown Abbey also showed a spike with the name Branson, like the character named Tom Branson pictured, seeing a rise by 32 per cent. Perhaps further showing the times - contrasting back when actress Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay musician Chris Martin named their baby 'Apple' surprising many who had never heard of the fruit and widespread computer manufacturer used as a name - Apple rose 15 per cent this year. Adding to the Apple iPhone, iPad, iMac buzz, the name Siri – Apple’s computer generated assistant - climbed by 5 per cent while Mac for boys jumped by 12 per cent. All three names are still deep down on the list, however, with Apple taking 3,204th place, Siri taking 1,427th, and Mac taking 624. Surprise ending: The names Grey, Anastasia and Elliot, featured in the erotic book Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James, pictured, also saw a rise among newborns. Musicians Beyoncé and Jay-Z's uniquely named Blue Ivy Carter also perhaps stirred a rise in names Blue and Ivy which both saw an increase this year - Blue by 51 per cent and Ivy by 27 per cent. Though Blue is still down on the list hitting 2,571th place, Ivy rose to 157th place. Among this year's most popular names, Aiden tops list of top 10 for the eight year in a row while Sophia continues to hold her own among the girls' 10 for the fifth year running.

Research suggests that sexual orientation is independent of cultural and other social influences, but that open identification of one's sexual orientation may be hindered by homophobic/hetereosexist settings. Social systems such as religion, language and ethnic traditions can have a powerful impact on realization of sexual orientation. Influences of culture may complicate the process of measuring sexual orientation. The majority of empirical and clinical research on LGBT populations are done with largely white, middle-class, well-educated samples, however there are pockets of research that document various other cultural groups, although these are frequently limited in diversity of gender and sexual orientation of the subjects. Integration of sexual orientation with sociocultural identity may be a challenge for LGBT individuals. Individuals may or may not consider their sexual orientation to define their sexual identity, as they may experience various degrees of fluidity of sexuality, or may simply identify more strongly with another aspect of their identity such as family role. American culture puts a great emphasis on individual attributes, and views the self as unchangeable and constant. In contrast, East Asian cultures put a great emphasis on a person's social role within social hierarchies, and view the self as fluid and malleable. These differing cultural perspectives have many implications on cognitions of the self, including perception of sexual orientation. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What social systems can greatly influence someone realization of their sexual preference?","output":"The question asks about the social systems that can greatly influence someone's realization of their sexual preference. Based on the information provided, several social systems can have a significant impact on this realization, including: 1. Religion: Religious beliefs and teachings can shape an individual's views on sexuality and their understanding of their own sexual orientation. Some religious doctrines may be more accepting or restrictive regarding non-heterosexual orientations, which can affect one's realization and acceptance. 2. Language: The language we use can reflect and shape our thoughts and perceptions about sexual orientation. Having specific words or expressions for different sexual preferences can help individuals better understand and define their own orientation. 3. Ethnic traditions: Cultural norms and expectations within different ethnic groups can influence how individuals perceive their sexuality. Some cultures may be more accepting or encouraging of diverse sexual orientations, while others may stigmatize non-heterosexual preferences, affecting one's ability to recognize or accept their sexual orientation. 4. Familial expectations and role: Family dynamics and expectations around gender roles and relationships may also influence someone's realization of their sexual preference. A supportive or understanding family environment might encourage individuals to explore and accept their sexual orientation, while a more rigid or conservative family environment might hinder this realization. Other social factors or systems can also play a role in an individual's realization of their sexual preference; however, these are some key examples mentioned in the given information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the name of the person that maintained his position as court painter?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain.

His demeanor and bearing stand out in contrast to the rag tag prisoners he shares the camp with in part because of his willingness to ostensibly advance on the needs of others. He is constantly scrutinized by Lieutenant Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp police chief, as he has gotten reports that King has robbed fellow prisoners in a poker game. It is clear that King takes pleasure in living on what would be considered a clear example of the American Capitalist version of supply and demand. He seeks ways to increase his organization by recruiting talented men like Peter Marlowe (James Fox), an English soldier who speaks fluent Malay, but refuses King's offering of money for his services. Marlowe attempts to live by a code that bonds men in a way that transcends any financial gain, and in fact considers King an actual friend because he and the American are interned together under Japanese rule. King extends his operation to include trading valuables to the Japanese and breeding rats to sell as food to the officers as a delicacy, activities that Marlowe is happy to aid in because of the smart commercial way that the schemes are launched. The ability to gain valuable items including medical supplies becomes important when Marlowe injures himself and faces serious physical danger. As Lieutenant Grey closes in to mete out the camp law enforcement, his code of conduct conflicts with Marlowe, his cabin mate. Theirs is a philosophy differing slightly and both based on survival with the most reaffirming respect for fellow man they can develop under these war conditions. As Grey attempts to arrest King and Marlowe for their criminal activity it becomes clear that the commanding officers live by a fractured value system.

Please answer the following question: This article: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré.

Question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.  \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

Question: \\"In it's simplest form, what greatly accelerated the launch of the products?\\"  Context: \\"On August 1, 2012, Windows 8 (build 9200) was released to manufacturing with the build number 6.2.9200.16384 . Microsoft planned to hold a launch event on October 25, 2012 and release Windows 8 for general availability on the next day. However, only a day after its release to manufacturing, a copy of the final version of Windows 8 Enterprise N (a version for European markets lacking bundled media players to comply with a court ruling) leaked online, followed by leaks of the final versions of Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise a few days later. On August 15, 2012, Windows 8 was made available to download for MSDN and TechNet subscribers. Windows 8 was made available to Software Assurance customers on August 16, 2012. Windows 8 was made available for students with a DreamSpark Premium subscription on August 22, 2012, earlier than advertised.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"In its simplest form, the factor that greatly accelerated the launch of the Windows 8 products was the strategic early availability to various specialized groups, coupled with the leaks of final versions of Windows 8 online. Following the release to manufacturing of Windows 8 on August 1, 2012, the launch event was planned for October 25, with general availability set for the next day. However, only a day after the release to manufacturing, a copy of the final version of Windows 8 Enterprise N was leaked online. This was followed by leaks of the final versions of Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise. Such leaks created an urgency to make the product available to customers before the originally planned date. The leaks alone would not have accelerated the launch without Microsoft's active response to the situation. The company made early versions of Windows 8 available to different groups even before the planned launch. MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) and TechNet subscribers were granted access to Windows 8 on August 15, 2012. Software Assurance customers received it on August 16, and students with a DreamSpark Premium subscription were given access on August 22, which was earlier than advertised. It was this combination of unintentional leaks and Microsoft's strategic decision to make Windows 8 available early for select groups that accelerated the launch of the products in a significant way. By doing so, Microsoft ensured that Windows 8 reached the hands of developers, students, and enterprise customers before potential competitors could take advantage of the leaked versions. This proactive approach ultimately helped Microsoft maintain its competitive edge in the market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To explain this, let's first understand what entailment is and analyze these two given sentences. Entailment in linguistic terms refers to a relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other sentence. In other words, if one sentence then the other sentence must also be true, and if any of the sentences is false, the other sentence must be false too. In this case, we are looking at two sentences: Sentence 1: George W. Bush won the Iowa straw poll. Sentence 2: George W. Bush never won a single straw poll. Sentence 1 indicates that George W. Bush has won at least one straw poll, specifically the Iowa straw poll. Straw polls are informal and non-binding votes typically used to gauge the popularity of political candidates or the public's opinion on policy issues. Sentence 2, on the other hand, claims that George W. Bush never won any straw poll. Since these two sentences convey conflicting information, they do not have an entailment relationship. Rather, they are contradictory to each other. If Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must be false, because it is claiming George W. Bush never won any straw poll, despite having won the Iowa straw poll according to Sentence 1. Conversely, if Sentence 2 is true, that would mean Sentence 1 is false, as George W. Bush would not have won the Iowa straw poll nor any other straw poll. In summary, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Rather, they are contradictory statements where the truth of one negates the truth of the other."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have: -333 * o + 469 * o = -237 * o - 453 * o + 31388 First, let's combine the o's on the left side of the equation: ( -333 + 469 ) * o We can do -333 + 469, and that gives us: 136 * o So now, our equation looks like this: 136 * o = -237 * o - 453 * o + 31388 Next, let's combine the o's on the right side of the equation: ( -237 - 453 ) * o We can do -237 - 453, and that gives us: -690 * o Now our equation looks like this: 136 * o = -690 * o + 31388 Let's move all the o's to one side. To do that, we'll add 690 * o to both sides: 136 * o + 690 * o = 31388 ( 136 + 690 ) * o We can do 136 + 690, and that gives us: 826 * o Now our equation is: 826 * o = 31388 To find the value of o, we'll divide both sides by 826: o = 31388 / 826 And when we do that calculation, we get: o = 38 So, the answer to the problem is o = 38.

Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What determines a mammals diet type?\\" Choose from: +yes +no","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type.\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What determines a mammal's diet type?\\" However, it is important to note that it only gives a part of the entire solution that would be needed for a fully detailed response. Size is indeed one key factor that can influence the type of diet an animal has, because larger animals tend to require more food and energy to survive than smaller ones, thus impacting the type of food they must consume to fulfill those needs. Mammals, specifically, display a lot of diversity in terms of size, ranging from tiny creatures like shrews to gigantic ones like elephants. The size of a mammal plays a significant role in determining what and how much it eats. Larger mammals such as elephants, whales, or rhinoceros need to consume a larger volume of food daily compared to their smaller counterparts. This necessarily means their diet would consist of food types available in large amounts, typically plant matter. Herbivores like these thrive on plant-based diets because plants are abundant and rich in the nutrients these large mammals need. On the other hand, smaller mammals like rodents, rabbits, or certain types of monkeys might have a mixed diet (omnivorous) or be entirely carnivorous, as they require less food and can thus manage to consume nutrient-dense meats or a variety of food sources. Beyond size, other factors also determine a mammal's diet. Environmental availability is another significant determinant. It is typically easier for an animal to consume what is readily available in their environment instead of finding specific nutrients elsewhere. For example, aquatic mammals like dolphins or seals primarily consume fish and other sea life because that's what their environment offers. Digestive capabilities of mammals also come into play in determining diet type. Some mammals like cows have specialised digestive systems that allow them to ferment plant material in a separate stomach chamber and extract nutrients that way. On the other hand, carnivores like lions and tigers have shorter, simpler guts suited to a diet heavy in proteins. Therefore, while the sentence does partially answer the question about what determines a mammal's diet type, the topic is more complex and includes other factors such as environmental availability and digestive capabilities, alongside the size of the mammal. Each of these aspects contributes to the understanding of a mammal's diet, and together they paint a detailed picture of this intricate biological decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tin Machine were an Anglo-American hard rock group formed in 1988, notable for being fronted by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. The band consisted of Bowie on lead vocals, sax and guitar, Reeves Gabrels on guitar, Tony Fox Sales on bass, and Hunt Sales on drums. Both Tony and Hunt are the sons of comedian Soupy Sales. Guitarist Kevin Armstrong was an unofficial fifth member of the band, playing on the first studio album and both tours. The group then went on hiatus while Bowie conducted his solo Sound+Vision Tour. In December 1990, Bowie split from EMI. Hunt Sales said that EMI \\"kind of freaked out a little bit at the strident, single-less Tin Machine debut\\", which partially explained why Bowie switched music labels. In March 1991, the band signed to Victory Music, a new label launched by JVC and distributed worldwide by London Records and Polygram, and recorded more new material. This was combined with tracks from the Sydney sessions to form the Tin Machine II album. The album was described as \\"just as impure and twisted [as their first album], but more R&B and less abrasive.\\" Gabrels explained the change between the first and second album was because by the second album, \\"we knew one another as musicians. ... It wasn't as dense. And we actually left more room, I think for David to come up with some interesting melodies. There was more room for vocals on this record.\\"  In late 1991 Bowie reiterated that he was still happy being in the band during that time, stating \\"I'm content. ... I'm deriving a great deal of fulfillment from working with Tin Machine\\", and band-mate Gabrels agreed, saying \\"we're doing exactly what we wanted to do.\\" During press performances for songs on the album, Gabrels played his guitar with a vibrator and for a performance on BBC's \\"Top of the Pops\\", who banned the use of the vibrator, he mimed playing his guitar with a chocolate eclair.  From 5 October 1991 to 17 February 1992, the group undertook a larger tour, known as the It's My Life Tour. The band was joined on this tour by guitarist Eric Schermerhorn.

When sunlight is so strong that it kills plants, it affects the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants produce oxygen while converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose using sunlight energy. If plants are unable to perform photosynthesis due to extreme sunlight conditions, it will lead to a decline in the production of oxygen. The described process of oxygen distribution within the human body (air brought through the mouth, passing through the lungs, into bronchial tissue, removal of carbon dioxide, and lungs bringing oxygen to the rest of the body) is not directly affected by the strong sunlight. However, the overall availability of oxygen in the environment may be impacted due to reduced oxygen production by plants.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of Accelerated Evolution when Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

The formation of the party was aimed at consolidating political support across various ethnic groups and regions in Kenya. The newly formed party then backed Uhuru Kenyatta, who was running for his second term in office during the 2017 general election. Successfully, President Kenyatta won the election and secured his second term. The party has a strong support base throughout the country and is known for its commitment towards national unity, economic growth, and social development.

What is the last name of the person who exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Here is a question about this article: The most common symptom of LED (and diode laser) failure is the gradual lowering of light output and loss of efficiency. Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur. Early red LEDs were notable for their short service life. With the development of high-power LEDs the devices are subjected to higher junction temperatures and higher current densities than traditional devices. This causes stress on the material and may cause early light-output degradation. To quantitatively classify useful lifetime in a standardized manner it has been suggested to use L70 or L50, which are the runtimes (typically given in thousands of hours) at which a given LED reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively. What is the answer to this question: What could cause early light-output degradation in LEDs?","output":"Early light-output degradation in LEDs can be caused by higher junction temperatures and higher current densities.

Let's break down the elements that contribute to this sentiment. 1. Use of the term \\"beautiful film\\": This phrase conveys a positive appreciation for the film, as the word \\"beautiful\\" implies that it has an aesthetically pleasing and emotionally evocative quality. By describing the film as beautiful, the speaker endorses it as a noteworthy piece of art. 2. Target audience: The sentence specifies that the film appeals to \\"people who like their romances.\\" This narrows down the intended audience to those who have an affinity for romantic stories. By singling out this group, the speaker acknowledges that the film might not be universally appealing, but it holds great value for the people who enjoy this genre. 3. Inclusion of French realism: The reference to \\"French realism\\" can be interpreted in multiple ways:     a. Geographic specificity: It suggests that the film either features, or is influenced by, French culture, artistic styles, or storytelling traditions. French cinema is commonly associated with emotionally complex, character-driven stories that focus on the genuine and often subtle emotions shared between characters, rather than grand, action-packed plotlines. For a viewer who appreciates these qualities, the mention of French realism adds a layer of cultural depth and sophistication to the film.     b. Realism in romance: The realism in the context of a romantic storyline implies a more grounded, authentic portrayal of relationships and love. Instead of an idealized or over-the-top portrayal of love, like those sometimes found in fairy tales or Hollywood blockbusters, the film may present a more honest reflection of the challenges, subtleties, and emotions involved in real-life relationships. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence can be seen as a positive endorsement of the film for a particular group of viewers - those who appreciate romantic stories with elements of French realism. That said, the mention of French realism and the specific target audience may also indicate a niche appeal, acknowledging that the film's style and content may not be universally appreciated or enjoyed by every viewer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William has helped the U.S. Coast Guard bust a drug smuggling boat carrying cocaine worth a minimum of 80 million. Prince William has helped bust a speed boat smuggling 80 million worth of cocaine. William, who is serving in the Royal Navy, helped make the bust last weekend when he spotted a speedboat found to be carrying nearly a ton of cocaine in the Atlantic Ocean, Britain's Ministry of Defense said Wednesday. William, 26, was one of the crew members aboard a helicopter attached to the frigate HMS Iron Duke who spotted the ocean-going speedboat hundreds of miles northeast of Barbados, the defense ministry said William is in the middle of a two-month attachment with the","output":"Royal Navy, gaining experience in various maritime operations as part of his military training. The operation was a coordinated effort between the U.S. Coast Guard, the Royal Navy, and local law enforcement agencies in the Caribbean to crackdown on drug smuggling in the region. Upon spotting the suspicious speedboat, Prince William and his crewmates immediately alerted the HMS Iron Duke and the U.S. Coast Guard, who intercepted the vessel for further investigation. The crew of the speedboat attempted to flee, abandoning their cargo in the process, but were quickly apprehended by the combined forces. The bust resulted in the confiscation of nearly a ton of cocaine, with an estimated street value of at least 80 million, marking this as a significant victory in the ongoing battle against drug trafficking. Authorities believe that the drugs were en route from South America to Europe, where they would have been distributed across various cities. The success of this mission has been praised by officials from both the U.S. and the UK, highlighting the importance of international cooperation in combating global drug trafficking. Prince William's involvement in the operation has helped raise awareness of the serious issues faced by law enforcement agencies in tackling drug smuggling and has contributed to his growth in understanding the broader roles and responsibilities of the Royal Navy and military service in general. As Prince William's attachment with the Royal Navy continues, he is expected to work on similar missions and broaden his knowledge of maritime security operations. This experience will provide him with valuable insight into the complexities of international security issues and the vital role that military forces play in maintaining peace and order worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What suite written for military band remains a brassbands staple? ?  Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906–07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which...

Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is a comedian of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special interest-driven political climate. Specifically, he makes fun of the American two-party system. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for president. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican U.S. Senator Mills. A parallel plot follows Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company in California called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings (Rick Roberts) via e-mail. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously â perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, when, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains a distant third to Kellogg and Mills. Election Day arrives, and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says...

A retired Marine with nearly two decades of aviation experience has stepped forward with a compelling theory about a mysterious plane that was spotted flying over Texas last month. On March 10, photographers Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over Amarillo, and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes. Retired-Marine James Vineyard has submitted one of the more interesting explanations, telling the Houston Chronicle he believes they are SR-72 Blackbirds - a spy plane that can cross the U.S. in less than an hour, unmanned. The triangle over Texas: Two photographers captured this mysterious object flying over Texas last month. Mystery solved? A retired Marine says the plane pictured in Amarillo last month is the SR-72 Blackbird - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour. The mystery aircraft  seen over Amarillo on March 10. Three of the craft were spotted flying by. In 1956, British magazines started. getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the Lockheed U-2, then. operating out of RAF Lakenheath on its first spy flights over the Soviet. Union - marking the first sight of a stealth plane that government's. had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes. It provided day and night, very high-altitude (70,000 feet / 21,000 m), all-weather intelligence gathering. Vineyard spent 17 years as a Marine and also worked with a jet squadron in Arizona. He. says the Pentagon may have dispatched the planes to the Indian Ocean to. aide in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. But Douglass, who saw the planes himself, doesn't agree.

SR-72 is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California,. and according to the company's website they say the plane could be. operational as early as 2030. It. is the predecessor of the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew. from New York to Lonton in less than two hours in 1976. Lockheed. Martin's Hypersonics program manager Brad Leland wrote that the plane. is designed to 'strike at nearly any location across a continent in less. than an hour.' 'Speed is. the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next. several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater,. similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today,' Leland said.

Douglass believes that the planes are a no type of spy plane - a. stealth transport plane that could sneak troops into a another country. unseen. Highlights:","output":"1. Photographers Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett captured images of three unidentified aircraft flying over Amarillo, Texas on March 10. 2. Retired Marine, James Vineyard, suggested that the aircraft could be SR-72 Blackbirds, a type of unmanned spy plane capable of crossing the U.S. in less than an hour. 3. The SR-72, currently under development by Lockheed Martin, is expected to be operational by 2030. It is the successor to the SR-71, a plane which set speed records in 1976. 4. Vineyard theorized that the Pentagon may have sent these planes to aid in the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. 5. However, Douglass disagrees with Vineyard's theory, stating that the SR-72 is still in development and the planes they observed were not moving at high speeds. 6. There was also speculation that the planes could have been B-2 stealth bombers, but this was ruled out after it was confirmed that no B-2s were in operation in the U.S. that day. 7. Douglass proposed instead that these could be a new type of stealth transport plane, designed for covert troop movements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - working ground - quarry - desert - work area - under ground  Explain why a human would choose \\"work area\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"work area\\" to answer the question above because an excavation site typically refers to a location where archeologists, researchers, or construction workers carry out specific tasks related to unearthing or digging up artifacts, structures, or materials from the ground. Each of the options provided can be associated with an excavation site in different contexts, but \\"work area\\" seems to be the most appropriate choice as it encompasses the general concept of the site and its primary function. Let's break down each of the options to better understand why \\"work area\\" is the best choice: 1. Working ground: This term could be relevant to an excavation site, as the ground is being worked upon for various purposes. However, it does not have a significant focus on the actual activities or tasks, and may not capture the essence of an excavation site being an organized space for conducting work or research. 2. Quarry: A quarry can also be associated with excavation, but it primarily refers to a place where large amounts of stone, sand, or minerals are extracted. While excavation might be a part of quarry operations, it is specific to the mining context and does not accurately represent other possible purposes of an excavation site, especially those related to archaeology or construction. 3. Desert: A desert could be a location where an excavation site exists, but as a standalone option, it doesn't convey any information about the nature of work conducted at the site. It is simply the geographical or environmental context for the excavation site, rather than the characteristics of the site itself. 4. Work area: This term accurately describes an excavation site, as it refers to a designated location where specific tasks are carried out. Work areas can be found in various industries, and excavation sites are a type of work area where digging, researching, and unearthing occur. This option best represents the primary function and purpose of an excavation site and encompasses its various contexts, such as archeological, construction, and even mining. 5. Underground: While excavation sites may involve digging and unearthing objects or materials from under the ground, the term \\"underground\\" in itself does not encapsulate the range of activities and functions that take place at an excavation site. It refers more to the location of the site relative to the surface rather than the site as a designated work area. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"work area\\" because it best encompasses the core concept of an excavation site - a location where digging, unearthing, or researching activities take place in various contexts such as archaeology, construction, and mining. It reflects the primary function of an excavation site and provides a more accurate understanding of the site's purpose rather than the other options, which focus more on the geographical location or specific contexts of the site."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The most interesting morality play is The Castle of Perseverance which depicts mankind's progress from birth to death. However, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is Everyman. Everyman receives Death's summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by Kindred, Goods, and Fellowship - only Good Deeds goes with him to the grave. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What goes to the store with Everyman in the morality play?","output":"In the morality play \\"Everyman\\", it is not specified that the character Everyman goes to a store during the development of the narrative. The use of \\"store\\" could be metaphorical, symbolizing something else, such as goods or items. In this iconic play, the primary focus is placed on the journey of life, particularly the inevitability of death and the concept of morality. Everyman, representing all humanity, receives a summons from Death. He attempts to evade this summons but finally comes to understand its inevitability. Along his journey, he engages with various characters that symbolize different aspects of life, each meant to represent different facets of human experience that he interacts with and relies on. However, as the narrative progresses, Everyman is sequentially deserted by Fellowship (his friends), Kindred (his family), and Goods (material wealth), as they cannot accompany him in death. These elements also symbolically represent societal linkages, familial ties, and material possessions, respectively. These elements, although considered valuable or important in life, are ultimately portrayed as transient and incapable of providing salvation or companionship in death. In the end, it is only Good Deeds who agrees to accompany Everyman to the grave - underlining the central message of the morality play that only our moral actions, our good deeds, truly matter in the end, and those are what we'll be judged on. Hence, if we assume that the 'store' represents a place (metaphorical or otherwise), as per the narrative of this morality play, it would be Good Deeds who would accompany Everyman. Thus, reinforcing the essence of this drama - the enduring value of moral rectitude and virtue in human life - symbolized by the character Good Deeds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution process. 1. Simplify the equation: 0 = 3*t + (68587 - 68620) 0 = 3*t - 33 2. Now, we need to isolate the variable t by moving the constant term to the left side of the equation. 0 + 33 = 3*t - 33 + 33 33 = 3*t 3. Next, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get the value of t. 33 ÷ 3 = 3*t ÷ 3 11 = t So, the solution for the equation 0 = 3*t + 68587 - 68620 is t = 11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: During what war, fought during 1558-1583, did the Siege of Wesenberg occur? Answer:","output":"The Siege of Wesenberg, which took place from January 22 to February 3, 1574, occurred during the Livonian War. The Livonian War lasted from 1558 to 1583 and was fought between several regional forces that included the Kingdom of Poland, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the combined forces of the Livonian Confederation, the Teutonic Order, and the invading forces of the Tsardom of Russia. The war began when Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia invaded the territories of the Livonian Confederation, which comprised much of present-day Latvia and Estonia. The goal of the Russian invasion was to gain control of the strategically important and economically prosperous Baltic region. As the war progressed, factions within the Livonian Confederation sought assistance from neighboring polities to resist the Russian advance. Consequently, the Kingdom of Poland and the Kingdom of Sweden intervened to challenge Russian dominion in the region, leading to the complex multi-sided conflict that characterized the Livonian War. The Siege of Wesenberg, also known as the Siege of Rakvere, was a notable engagement during the conflict. Rakvere, known as Wesenberg in German, was an important fortified town in the territory of the Livonian Confederation. Located in present-day Estonia, it served as a critical stronghold for the regional forces. In January 1574, the Russian army led by Prince Mikhail Serebryany-Golovin began the siege of Wesenberg. They subjected the town to a relentless artillery bombardment and launched several attacks on its defenses. Despite the odds against them, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking Russian forces. The steadfast defenders of Wesenberg, led by Johann von Uexküll, managed to repel the Russians' advances. Eventually, the besieged defenders broke through the Russian blockade and emerged victorious, forcing the Russian army to withdraw after suffering significant losses. The resolute defense of Wesenberg marked a significant setback for the Russian campaign in the region during the Livonian War. The Livonian War ultimately concluded in 1583 with the Treaty of Plussa and the Treaty of Jam Zapolski. As a result of these peace agreements, the Livonian Confederation was effectively dissolved, and the territories of modern-day Estonia and Latvia were divided between Sweden, Poland, and Lithuania. Consequently, Russian ambitions to control the lucrative Baltic Sea trade were thwarted, and the foundations for the subsequent political order in the Baltic states were established. The Siege of Wesenberg stands as a testament to the determination of the Livonian forces during the war, and its outcome had a lasting impact on the regional balance of power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We believe by the time Texas is over, we'll be very very competitive in delegate count.\\" More from a lively Sunday morning on the hamster wheel, as per Politico: Gingrich on that moon idea (which SNL loved so much): \\"This was not some slip. This was a deliberate effort to start a conversation.\\" He added, \\"I didn't propose any additional spending.\\" Mike Bloomberg on the Bush tax cuts: Obama should \\"veto any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts.

As Gingrich shares his thoughts about Governor Romney, he openly declares his disapproval for Romney's approach, but when compared to President Obama, Gingrich stresses that \\"there would be no choice.\\" This stance adds a unique perspective to the ongoing saga concerning the Republican party and its key members. Gingrich made the rounds this morning, as reported by Politico, emphasizing the fact that he has no intention of stepping down. Instead, the goal is to push towards Super Tuesday, where he claims the grounds will be much more favorable. Gingrich remains optimistic and staunch in his belief that the delegate count will be competitive by the time the Texas elections are over.  Adding to the mix of the lively Sunday morning was the topic of Gingrich's moon idea, which even caught Saturday Night Live producers' attention. Gingrich does not back down from the controversy surrounding his concept of establishing a moon colony. Instead, he states that this was a deliberate effort to jumpstart a thought-provoking conversation and not just some casual or impulsive slip. The former Speaker of the House clarifies that any additional spending was never part of the plan. As an idea-generator, Gingrich's moon colony proposal is certainly working on getting people talking, debating, and sharing their views on the potential and technological advancement it might hold. Mike Bloomberg, on that same talk, shares his opinions regarding the Bush tax cuts, urging President Obama to veto any extension. Bloomberg emphasizes the need for everyone to pitch in, and avoid focusing solely on raising taxes for the wealthy, as it will not solve the problem and generate enough money to address the issues at hand. Ron Paul comments on the ongoing 'intellectual revolution' in the Republican party, with discussions focusing on free-market economics rather than Keynesian welfare-ism and interventionism. Paul notices a significant shift in the approach of young people and those who had remained neutral in politics for years. Although the intellectual revolution seems to be in motion, the translation to concrete political change seems to be a work in progress. Meanwhile, Santorum shares an update on his daughter Bella's health, stating that she is doing great and has recovered from a rough time just a week ago. This personal insight humanizes the political personas and adds a layer of emotion amidst the ongoing political discussions and controversies. Bob McDonnell attempts to attest to Romney's conservative credibility, mentioning accomplishments such as covering a 3 billion deficit without raising taxes and governing as a pro-life governor in a blue state. In the same breath, he takes the opportunity to display how Gingrich worked with Nancy Pelosi on global warming and criticized Paul Ryan's budget as \\"social, right-wing engineering.\\" In conclusion, the dynamic dialogues on this lively Sunday morning, from Gingrich's role in the Republican brawl to his moon colony idea and other political perspectives, showcase the intellectual evolution within the Republican party. While concrete changes might still be awaited, these discussions are shaping new political thought and ideas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Let's break them down: 1. \\"The South Deep mine is a large mine located in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng.\\" 2. \\"The Mine South Deep is a big mine in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng.\\" Step 1: Identify the key elements in both sentences. The key elements include the name of the mine (\\"South Deep\\"), the size of the mine (\\"large\\" or \\"big\\"), and the location of the mine (\\"in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng\\").

In both, the mine is named \\"South Deep\\", the size is expressed as \\"large\\" or \\"big\\", and the location is the same (\\"in the northern part of South Africa in Gauteng\\"). Step 3: Conclusion. The only language difference is the switch in the order of key elements between \\"South Deep mine\\" and \\"Mine South Deep\\", and the change from \\"large\\" to \\"big\\". These differences don't change the fundamental meaning of the sentences, so yes, they mean the same thing.

The annual weekend gathering is known for providing an open and informal... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The Homeland Security Department has drafted sweeping new guidelines aimed at aggressively detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, according to a pair of memoranda signed by DHS Secretary John Kelly.      The memos dated Friday seek to implement President Donald Trump's broad directive to crack down on illegal immigration. Kelly outlines plans to hire thousands of additional enforcement agents, expand on the priority list for immigrants marked for immediate removal and enlist local law enforcement to help make arrests, according to a person briefed on the documents, who confirmed the details to The Associated Press.      \\"The surge of illegal immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States,\\" Kelly wrote.      He said apprehensions on the southern U.S. border had seen an additional surge of 10,000 to 15,000 per month from 2015 to 2016.      The memos leave in place one directive from the Obama administration, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows young people who were brought into the country illegally as children to stay and obtain work permits. The program has protected about 750,000 immigrants since its inception in 2012. Trump has previously indicated his desire to end the program, but at his press conference last week he indicated that he would \\"show great heart\\" toward the program.      The memos were reported first by The Washington Post and other news organizations. A U.S. official familiar with the documents did not dispute the accuracy of the memos signed by Kelly, which were originally scheduled for release Friday before they were postponed for White House review.      A White House official said officials there had raised objections with the documents and were working with DHS to finalize the policy. The official was not authorized to discuss the process publicly and insisted on anonymity.      Under the draft guidelines, Kelly seeks to \\"expeditiously hire\\" 10,000 more enforcement agents and 5,000 Border Patrol officers.      Seeking to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the Mexican border, Kelly also calls on Customs and Border Protection to \\"immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as patrol and access roads.\\" He describes the wall as necessary to deter illegal immigration and calls it a \\"critical component\\" of Trump's overall border security strategy.      He says the department will also prioritize for more immediate removal those who have been convicted of a crime; charged with a crime; committed fraud in connection with a matter before a government agency; abused any program related to public benefits; or have not complied with orders to leave the country.      Joanne Lin, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, criticized the proposed guidelines as a Trump style of immigration enforcement in which \\"due process, human decency and common sense are treated as inconvenient obstacles on the path to mass deportation.\\"      \\"The Trump administration is intent on inflicting cruelty on millions of immigrant families across the country,\\" she said in a statement. ||||| CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Anti-Trump protestors are taking advantage of the federal holiday that celebrates Presidents to oppose the one that is currently in office.

The memos, first reported by The Washington Post and other media, offer a list of sweeping new guidelines to law enforcement agencies that would implement many of the executive orders on immigration enforcement recently signed by President Trump.      The guidelines, signed by DHS Secretary John Kelly, include hiring thousands of additional enforcement agents and increasing the number of immigration judges, expanding the pool of immigrants prioritized for removal, enlisting local law enforcement to help with arrests and speeding up deportation hearings. They also propose prosecuting parents and family members in the U.S. who pay smugglers to bring over unaccompanied minors.      The memos were a draft order and still being reviewed by the White House, according to the Associated Press.      The guidelines would put into play legal tools available to presidents for years but largely overlooked by past administrations, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a non-profit research institute that promotes stricter control on immigration.      Expediting the removal of immigrants who have been in the country illegally for less than two years, for example, has been a legal remedy since 1996, but underused by past administrations, she said. She called the guidelines, if implemented, a “step in the right direction.”      CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Lawmakers fear Trump could use the information Dreamers provide on their DACA applications to deport them. Video provided by Newsy Newslook      “What this administration is doing is using the tools available in the law to a greater extent to address problems that have been neglected the past eight years by the Obama administration,” Vaughan said. “They’re changing the message to people who are thinking about coming here illegally.”      Notably missing from the guidelines is any change to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which allows young people brought to the USA illegally as children to stay and obtain work permits. Trump harshly criticized the program on the campaign trail last year but said at a recent press conference that he would “show great heart” toward the program. The program, initiated by the Obama administration in 2012, has protected about 750,000 immigrants.      Mark Silverman, senior staff attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a pro-immigrant rights group based in San Francisco, said the guidelines outlined in the memo were “very disturbing” and “draconian,” particularly the section about prosecuting parents trying to bring their children to the USA. Recruiting local law enforcement to help identify and remove undocumented immigrants would also result in widespread violations of civil liberties, he said.      “Essentially, this memo is implementing the inhumane and nonsensical scapegoating of immigrants, especially Latinos, for problems in this country which they did not create,” Silverman said.      The guidelines also call for the border wall to begin construction, instructing U.S. Customs and Border Protection to “immediately begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall, including the attendant lighting, technology (including sensors), as well as patrol and access roads,” although funding for the wall’s construction and maintenance still needs approval by Congress.      In a statement, Joanne Lin, American Civil Liberties Union senior legislative council, called the enforcement plans a breach of “due process, human decency and common sense” and vowed to fight them.      “The Trump administration is intent on inflicting cruelty on millions of immigrant families across the country,” she said.

Obtained by NBC News, the new directives signed by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly provide greater detail about two of President Donald Trump’s executive orders relating to his campaign promises of building a border wall with Mexico and increasing deportation efforts.      The memos were to be filed on Friday, but are still not final. Currently, they await interagency and White House review.      Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly testifies before the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. Andrew Harnik / AP      If approved, the memos would order officials to end the release of people captured at the borders while they await hearings, and direct officials to hire additional ICE and Border Patrol agents, as well as send more immigration judges and asylum officers to the border. The documents would also order officials to work with agreeable local police and sheriffs to enforce the new regulations, and allow for expedited removal proceedings for detained immigrants who have been in the U.S. for two years or less.      The memos would also allow authorities to criminally prosecute parents who are undocumented immigrants if they paid smugglers to bring their children to the United States.      \\"Many of these children fall victim to robbery, extortion, kidnapping, sexual assault and other crimes of violence by the smugglers and other criminal elements along the dangerous journey through Mexico to the United States,\\" the memo obtained by NBC News alleges.      In line with Trump’s executive order, one draft memo directs the hiring of 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents and 500 “Air &Marine Agents/Officers.” ICE, meanwhile, would be able to hire 10,000 additional agents “as well as additional operational and mission support and legal staff necessary to hire and support their activities.”      U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are pictured. LM Otero / AP      Those hirings would greatly expand ICE, and the memos would allow for Customs and Border Protection to “begin planning, design, construction and maintenance of a wall” — seemingly fulfilling many of Trump’s campaign promises, especially those within his Aug. 31, 2016, address on immigration.      \\"The White House has raised objections to some aspects of these memos and we are working with DHS to finalize the policy,\\" a Trump administration official told NBC News, emphasizing that the White House did not have problems with some of the language.

Finally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.  we ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).  On to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.

This prestigious horse race is held annually at Epsom Downs Racecourse in Epsom, Surrey, England. The Epsom Derby is considered one of the five British Classic Races and is the most prestigious of the three Classics, which also include the 2,000 Guineas and the St. Leger Stakes. Lester Piggott, born on November 5, 1935, is an esteemed retired jockey hailing from Wantage, England. Often regarded as one of the greatest flat racing jockeys of all time, Piggott boasts an impressive career, spanning over four decades, during which he amassed an astonishing 4,493 victories. Piggott was well-known for his distinctive and innovative riding style, which involved crouching low over the horse's neck, allowing for better aerodynamics and control. Teenoso, bred in the United States, was a bay colt sired by Youth out of the mare Furioso. He was trained by the esteemed horse trainer Geoff Wragg and owned by Eric Moller. Lester Piggott's connection to Teenoso was instrumental in securing the victory in the Epsom Derby, as the jockey's vast experience and race strategies contributed to the horse's performance. The partnership of Teenoso and Piggott was exceptional, with the duo winning the 1983 Epsom Derby by three lengths despite the unfavorable weather conditions and a muddy track. The 1983 Epsom Derby marked Piggott's ninth and final triumph in the race, solidifying his status as a legend of the sport. His previous Derby wins included victories with these horses: 1. Never Say Die (1954) 2. Crepello (1957) 3. St. Paddy (1960) 4. Sir Ivor (1968) 5. Nijinsky (1970) 6. Roberto (1972) 7. Empery (1976) 8. The Minstrel (1977) Lester Piggott retired from professional racing in 1995, though he did make a brief comeback in the late 1990s in a series of races for charity; his final race occurred when he was 58. Today, Piggott remains an iconic figure within the world of horse racing, with countless fans and aspiring jockeys continuing to look up to his exemplary career, talent, and dedication to the sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Justification: - In Finnish, the verb \\"edistää\\" means \\"to promote\\" and is used to express the idea of fostering or advancing something, like the creation of new jobs. - The phrase \\"uusien työpaikkojen luomista\\" translates to \\"the creation of new jobs\\" and maintains the same idea as in the original English sentence. - The conjunction \\"ja\\" is used to connect the two parts of the sentence, just like \\"and\\" in English. - The verb \\"auttaa\\" translates to \\"help\\" and is used to express the idea of providing assistance or support. - The noun \\"työttömyyden\\" is the genitive form of \\"työttömyys\\" (unemployment), which is commonly used in Finnish to show possession or association. In this case, it shows that the help is related to fighting unemployment. - The noun \\"torjunnassa\\" is the inessive form of \\"torjunta\\" (fight or combating), indicating the action of combating something.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Take a few minutes to laugh either by yourself or with others. Whether it's a short 2-minute video of a cat wearing pants or a feature length comedy, laughing has many health benefits:  Laughter stimulates many organs. When we laugh we take in more oxygen than usual, and that stimulates the heart, lungs, and muscles. Laughing increases positive thoughts, leading to the release of stress and disease-fighting neuropeptides. Laughter itself increases mood and leads to feelings of enhanced interpersonal connection when shared with others. When you have negative or nervous feelings, it is hard to stop yourself from wallowing in them. Crack a big smile. It might be fake at first, but think about something that genuinely makes you smile, and keep working at it. A great big smile will momentarily trick your mind into thinking more positively, helping pull you out of a rut. Power posing is a way of holding your body to convey confident and dominant body language. In turn, this can help make your mood more relaxed and confident. For example, when speaking in a meeting, cross your arms across your chest and sit up straight. If you are closing a deal, show that you are engaged by standing, leaning forward, and resting your hands on a table while looking at the client or other individual. Summary:","output":"This article says that it's good to laugh, because it helps our body be healthy and happy. Laughing can make our heart, lungs, and muscles work better and help us feel more connected with others. If we feel sad or worried, we can try to smile and think happy thoughts, and it will help us feel better. Standing tall and confident is also good for our mood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

He wrote a book about his story of playing chess in December,1786. In this book, he hoped to find connections between chess and life. He and his friend even used chess to learn Italian. It was a very interesting experience in his early life. Not only a great chess player, Franklin is also known to play the violin ,the harp  , and the guitar. He used some glasses to produce a clear and sweet sound just like birds' singing. Benjamin Franklin died at his home in the USA at the age of 84.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Diabetics have higher levels of sugar and glucose in their blood and vaginal secretions. This is an ideal environment for abundant growth of yeast cells, which normally cause fungal infections. As a result, your child may suffer from recurrent fungal skin infections.  Notice if your child seems to be itchy in the genital area. For girls, you may notice that they have repeated vaginal yeast infections, characterized by genital itching and discomfort, with mild white to yellowish foul-smelling discharge.  Another type of fungal infection that can be a result of the immune-compromising feature of juvenile diabetes is athlete's foot, which causes white discharge and peeling of the skin in the webs of the toes and soles of the feet.  Boys, especially if they are uncircumcised, may also develop a fungal/yeast infection around the tip of the penis. The reflex that enables the body to fight against infections under normal circumstances is hampered by diabetes, as it causes immunological dysfunction. Increased glucose in the blood additionally causes unwelcome bacterial growth, often resulting in frequent bacterial skin infections such as boils or abscesses, carbuncles, and ulcerations. Another aspect of recurrent skin infections is the slow healing of wounds. Even small cuts, scratches or wounds from minor trauma take an abnormally long time to heal. Be on the lookout for anything that doesn't fix itself up as usual. Vitiligo is an auto-immune disorder, leading to reduced levels of the skin pigment melanin. Melanin is the pigment that gives human hair, skin, and eyes their color. With the occurrence of type 1 diabetes, the body develops auto-antibodies that destroy melanin. This results in white patches on the skin. Although it occurs much later in the course of type 1 diabetes and is not very common, it is better to rule out diabetes if your child develops such white patches. These symptoms can accompany diabetes as it progresses. If you notice your child vomiting or overly deep breathing, this is a dangerous sign and you should take your child to the hospital immediately for treatment. These symptoms may be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can result in a potentially fatal coma. These symptoms come on fast, sometimes within 24 hours. If left untreated, DKA can be fatal. Summary:","output":"Diabetes in children can lead to recurrent fungal and bacterial skin infections, slow wound healing, and potential development of vitiligo; parents should monitor for symptoms and seek immediate medical attention for signs of diabetic ketoacidosis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. Answer:","output":"Xuanzang"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Erin's campaign excelled at developing a powerful narrative that resonated with the city's residents. With the guidance of their seasoned campaign manager, Erin maintained a consistent message that focused on local issues such as improving infrastructure, supporting small businesses, and increasing funding for public schools. This clear and purpose-driven messaging strategy was essential to building a loyal following of supporters. Furthermore, Erin's seasoned campaign manager implemented a robust grassroots strategy which included a vast network of volunteers. These volunteers were instrumental in canvassing neighborhoods, making phone calls, and attending local events. This ground-level engagement ensured that Erin's message reached a wider audience, creating awareness and enthusiasm about their platform.

Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper), an Iraqi soldier fighting in the Iran-Iraq War, is called to become a \\"fedai\\" (\\"body double\\" or political decoy) for Uday Hussein (also played by Cooper), the playboy son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (Philip Quast). Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened.Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and, over the next three years, practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari Mondial 3.2 and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and beaten. After an appearance at a conference with several Kuwaiti leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a Kurd. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been slant drilling from Iraq's Rumaila oil field. Iraq invads Kuwait in August 1990 which begins the First Gulf War. With the fall of Kuwait, Uday proclaims \\"The Age of the Sheikhs is over!\\"Uday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14 year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party.

Dennis had an arrogant personality but Neil was a very humble person.  Select from:  A). Dennis rubbed a lot of folks the wrong way.;  B). Neil rubbed a lot of folks the wrong way.;","output":"A). Dennis rubbed a lot of folks the wrong way.  Dennis and Neil were two contrasting characters that people came across in their community. Dennis was known for his arrogant personality, which was quite off-putting to many. His self-importance, condescension, and constant need for admiration were sources of discomfort for those around him. Time and time again, he would put down others in order to highlight his own achievements.  Individuals who had to interact with Dennis found it increasingly challenging to maintain a cordial relationship with him. His air of superiority often led to people avoiding him whenever possible. His domineering attitude and lack of empathy made it difficult for colleagues, friends, and even family members to tolerate his presence. At social gatherings, Dennis had a knack for dominating conversations and dismissing others’ opinions as he believed his own viewpoint to be infallible. For some, it felt demeaning to have their perspectives disregarded so vehemently. In discussions, rather than listening to others with an open mind, Dennis consistently tried to establish his own thoughts as the only correct ones. As a result, people around him felt unimportant and disrespected. In stark contrast, Neil was a humble individual who radiated warmth and positivity. His unpretentious nature and ability to treat everyone with equal respect were qualities that endeared him to many. People were drawn to his genuineness, feeling at ease whenever they were in his company. They loved his sincerity and admired his selfless attitude. Neil was genuinely interested in others and valued their opinions. He would listen intently and acknowledge their thoughts without disregarding them. When he disagreed, he would do so respectfully and provide constructive criticism to keep the conversation flowing in a productive manner. He lifted the spirits of those around him, encouraging them to engage in conversations, be they casual or profound, without fearing any belittlement. Often, Neil would remind others of the importance of staying grounded. He believed that humility, openness, and empathy were the keys to building strong connections and effective communication. People who met him walked away feeling respected and heard, knowing they had encountered a rare, exceptional individual. In conclusion, the differences between Dennis and Neil were striking. Dennis's arrogance rubbed many folks the wrong way, making it hard for them to enjoy his company. On the other hand, Neil's humility and willingness to value others made him a well-liked and appreciated member of their community. Ultimately, it is clear that people were more drawn to Neil's selflessness and warmth than Dennis's overbearing pride."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Place shavings in water and use tin can to remove when melted.","output":"(A). Place pot of water on stove and bring to a boil. Place shavings in tin can and place tin can in boiling water. Steps and justification: 1. Gather necessary materials: wax shavings, a tin can, a pot, and a stove. These materials are necessary for the task at hand. 2. Place the pot of water on the stove: This provides a source of heat to melt the wax shavings. 3. Bring the water to a boil: Boiling water (100°C or 212°F) will be hot enough to melt the wax shavings effectively. Additionally, it creates steam, which will help the heat transfer to the tin can more evenly. 4. Place the wax shavings in the tin can: The tin can serves as a makeshift double boiler, allowing the wax to melt while preventing direct contact with the heat source. This indirect heat reduces the risk of igniting the wax or damaging it. 5. Place the tin can with wax shavings into the boiling water: By placing the tin can into the boiling water, the heat transfers from the water to the tin can, and then to the wax shavings to melt them. 6. Monitor the melting process, ensuring the tin can remains balanced and stable in the boiling water. This prevents any accidents or spills that may occur. 7. Remove the tin can from the boiling water once the wax shavings have melted. Use caution, as the tin can and melted wax will be hot. You may use tongs or oven mitts to handle the tin can. Option A provides a safer and more efficient method for melting wax shavings using a tin can. This technique ensures even heat distribution and prevents the wax from making direct contact with the heat source, reducing the risk of accidents or damage to the wax."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Dress lightly (but take a jacket if you need to) and take only what you need. If you take your own food, check the park permits this and make sure your amusement park offers storage first. Try to check the weather report for the area you're going visit. Dress accordingly for the weather. Try to avoid wearing dark colored clothes (such as black or dark grey) if it is during summer. Wearing these colors could make you warmer and you may start sweating. Also, if you're going on the water rides, have a swimsuit on underneath your clothes. Flip flops aren’t really the best idea for an amusement park, especially rides that leave your feet dangling. Wear supportive sneakers or walking shoes. If you want to wear a hat, always remember to put it in a secure pocket before going on a ride. Keep your wallet or purse secure! They can be easily lost in the hustle and bustle of an amusement park. Hair past shoulder length can easily get tangled on a windy ride. Braids are recommended, as they stay closer to the head and don't have loose hair like ponytails. Many coasters can be rough, and you don’t want holes poked into the back of your head. Some earrings may get stuck in your hair or attire. However, if you really want to wear earrings, wear non-dangling ones such as studs or pearls. Especially in the summertime. Most of the ride lines will subject you to the elements, whatever they are. Take a water bottle. It's easy to get dehydrated out in the sun all day. Unless you’re visiting with someone who won’t be riding most of the rides, don’t take huge bags or purses with you if you can help it. You won’t be able to take these on most of the rides. You’ll either have to leave them with a non-rider, pay for a locker, or stuff them into bins before getting onto a ride.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who could not render the changes in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest?, using the article: Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements., what would be the answer ?

Title: Death Ship Movie plot: A mysterious black freighter sails through the night, apparently deserted. Detecting a cruise ship close by, the ship alters course as disembodied voices announce in German, \\"Battle Stations! Enemy in sight!\\" Aboard the cruise ship, the prickly Captain Ashland is making his final voyage, attended by his replacement, Captain Trevor Marshall, who has brought along his family. The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivorsâMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morganâare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a mysterious voice speaking to him in German, telling him \\"This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!\\" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and they separate to retrieve supplies and the injured captain....

Charles-Camille Saint-Saens (French: [SaRl kamij sesas]; 9 October 1835 - 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saens was a musical prodigy, making his concert debut at the age of ten. In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saens in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote:  Saint-Saens is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman. His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing.  Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saens was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D C Parker wrote, \\"That Saint-Saens knows Rameau ... Bach and Handel, Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings. His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art.\\"  Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saens often favoured self-contained melodies. Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, \\"supple and pliable\\", more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the \\"phrase pattern AABB is characteristic\\". An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him. Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring. In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar. Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works.

Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- SeaWorld employees on Tuesday testified at a federal job safety hearing that, while the behavior of killer whales is is extremely predictable, the job of working with a 6-ton marine mammal carries a calculated risk. The hearing, before the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Review Commission, resumed Monday after a two-month hiatus. It was convened to look into the death of SeaWorld Orlando trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, in February 2010. OSHA attorneys called three witness -- all from SeaWorld San Diego, including the California park's vice president. SeaWorld strongly objected to the California employees being called as witnesses in a case involving only the Florida theme park. The family has acknowledged that","output":"working with killer whales was Brancheau's passion and that she understood the risks involved in her job. Nonetheless, the tragic incident has raised concerns about the safety measures implemented to protect trainers and whether they are sufficient to prevent similar accidents in the future. Over the course of the hearing, OSHA and SeaWorld representatives presented contrasting viewpoints on the matter, with OSHA arguing that SeaWorld had violated safety regulations while SeaWorld claimed that it had taken all necessary precautions and that the incident was an unfortunate but isolated event. After several days of testimony and careful examination of the evidence, the Review Commission concluded that, although SeaWorld had implemented a number of safety measures, there were still areas where improvements could be made. The Commission issued several recommendations, including enhanced training for trainers, regular reviews of safety protocols, and the implementation of additional barriers between trainers and the whales during performances. In response to the findings, SeaWorld announced a series of updates to its safety measures, including new trainer protocols, revised emergency procedures, and the introduction of more advanced technology to monitor the whales' behavior. The company also declared that it would increase investments in technology to allow trainers to interact with the animals from a safe distance. The changes did not come without controversy, however, as some animal rights activists argued that the real solution to this issue was not to introduce more safety measures, but to end the practice of keeping killer whales in captivity altogether. They contended that the whales' confinement in small spaces is unnatural and stressful, leading to unpredictable behavior that puts trainers at risk. As a result of the heightened awareness around the safety and ethical aspects of keeping killer whales in captivity, as well as the increased scrutiny of marine parks, a new wave of dialogue was initiated between park officials, animal welfare organizations, and the general public. Although the debate over the ethics of keeping marine mammals in captivity continued for years, this tragic event sparked notable changes in both safety practices and attitudes towards the treatment of these majestic creatures. In memory of Dawn Brancheau, her family established the Dawn Brancheau Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of children and animals in need through education, community involvement, and charitable giving. The foundation's work serves as a lasting legacy of Brancheau's dedication to both her profession and her love for animals, demonstrating that even in the face of tragedy, love and compassion can inspire change for the better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following passage  \\"Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native \\"barbarians\\" and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords.

She was arrested and when tested was found to be high on crystal meth. Is now facing three years in jail if convicted of dangerous driving. Porn star had previously played a prisoner in one of her adult movies.","output":"Title: Former Adult Film Star Sona Muellerova Arrested After High-Speed Car Chase Introduction Sona Muellerova, a 25-year-old former adult film actress, has found herself in hot water after leading the police on a high-speed car chase. This dangerous escapade began when Muellerova decided to go to the police station to hand in her driver's license following a ban.  Surrendering License Leads to Chase Ironically, the trouble began as Muellerova tried to comply with the law by handing in her license due to the recent ban. After leaving the police station, she got into her car and attempted to drive home. However, the sight of a disqualified driver climbing behind the wheel did not escape the notice of the officers present. As a result, they began chasing Muellerova in an attempt to intervene. High-Speed Pursuit Reaches 136 MPH The car chase escalated quickly, with Muellerova reaching speeds of up to 136 miles per hour as she tried to evade the authorities. It is unclear why she decided not to pull over, but the reckless speed at which she raced down the streets put other drivers and pedestrians at significant risk. This dangerous driving warranted the police's efforts to apprehend her as quickly as possible. Arrest and Crystal Meth Discovery When officers finally caught up with Muellerova, they arrested her on the spot and proceeded to test her for any signs of drug use. The results were shocking—Muellerova tested positive for crystal meth, an illegal and highly addictive stimulant. With these findings, it becomes apparent that her impaired judgment and dangerous driving might have stemmed from her drug use. Facing Possible Jail Time Now, Sona Muellerova is facing serious legal consequences for her actions, with a potential three-year jail sentence if convicted of dangerous driving. This episode marks a stark contrast to her previous on-screen role as a prisoner in one of her adult movies, as the reality of her current situation is far more severe than any scripted scenario. Conclusion Sona Muellerova's high-speed car chase story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of drug use and driving under the influence. It is essential to respect the rules of the road and avoid putting others at risk through reckless behavior. As Muellerova now faces the prospect of a lengthy prison term, one can only hope that she will learn from her mistakes and choose a safer and more responsible path in the future."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Make this proper case.","output":"Laminated sheets possess a unique property to effectively distribute heat from a concentrated heat source across their layers, ultimately allowing the heat to dissipate throughout its structure. This advantageous ability can be widely observed in various applications and industries. The process of heat spreading across the laminated sheets occurs in several stages. Firstly, when heat is applied to one side of the sheet, it quickly transfers to the adjacent layers due to the conductive nature of the laminated material. As the heat progressively disperses through the layers, the overall temperature of the sheet increases. This, in turn, raises the rate at which heat is conducted away from the source, effectively managing the concentration of heat. One of the critical factors affecting this process is the type of laminated material used. Different materials have distinct thermal conductivity properties, which directly impact their ability to dissipate heat. For instance, laminated sheets made of metals like aluminum or copper exhibit excellent thermal conductivity, making them ideal for applications that require efficient heat spreading. Another essential factor is the number of layers and the thickness of the laminated sheet. Generally, a greater number of layers and reduced thickness lead to a more efficient dispersion of heat within the sheet. This is because thinner sheets conduct heat more rapidly from one side to another, while more layers provide additional pathways for the heat to travel through before dissipating. The ability to spread and dissipate heat across laminated layers is invaluable in various industrial and technological applications. For example, in the electronics industry, laminated materials are widely used as heat sinks to prevent overheating of crucial components in devices such as computers and smartphones. These heat sinks absorb the heat generated by the components and spread it across the laminated sheets, allowing the heat to dissipate, and thus keeping the components within safe operating temperatures. Laminated sheets are also commonly used in the automotive, aerospace, and construction industries. In automotive and aerospace applications, laminated sheets can be used to distribute heat generated by engines or other heat-producing components to prevent damages or malfunctions due to excessive heat buildup. In construction, laminated sheets can be employed in walls, roofs, or other structural components to dissipate heat from solar exposure, ultimately reducing the overall temperature within the building. In conclusion, laminated sheets possess a remarkable property that enables them to effectively spread heat from a concentrated source and dissipate it through their layers. This capability can be attributed to multiple factors, including the details of the laminated material, the thickness of the sheets, and the number of layers. The efficient distribution of heat within laminated sheets delivers vital advantages across a broad range of industries, including electronics, automotive, aerospace, and construction, vastly improving the performance and stability of their respective applications."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, zombies, mummies, vampires, werewolves and witches.

Rachel chose to have natural childbirth but Emily had an epidural because","output":"Rachel chose to have natural childbirth but Emily had an epidural because they both had different pain tolerances, beliefs, and preferences when it came to the birthing process. For Rachel, the choice to have a natural childbirth was based on her strong belief in her body's ability to handle the pain and her desire to experience the full range of emotions and sensations involved in the process. She may have also been concerned about possible complications or side effects from medical interventions, such as an epidural, on both her and her baby. Additionally, Rachel may have felt that natural childbirth would allow her to bond more deeply and immediately with her newborn, as she would be fully present and aware during the entire process. Some women who prefer natural childbirth also feel that it gives them a sense of empowerment, as they are able to harness their own inner strength to bring their child into the world without the assistance of medical interventions. On the other hand, Emily decided that an epidural was the best option for her. This choice was likely driven by her desire to minimize the pain and discomfort associated with childbirth. Epidurals can be very effective in blocking the pain signals from the lower body to the brain, providing significant pain relief for many women during labor and delivery. For Emily, this pain relief was essential for her to feel relaxed and confident throughout the process, knowing that she would not have to endure excessive pain. This decision may have also been influenced by her fear of the unknown aspects of labor, or a previous negative childbirth experience, either her own or that of someone she knows. Furthermore, Emily might have been swayed by the fact that having an epidural can generally lead to a more controlled and predictable childbirth experience. With the pain effectively managed, it may be easier for her to focus on other aspects of the process, such as following her doctor's instructions and staying calm. Additionally, in some cases, an epidural may be medically necessary for certain health reasons, or if the labor is not progressing as expected and interventions like a C-section are deemed necessary. In conclusion, Rachel and Emily's different choices regarding natural childbirth and epidurals stem from their individual pain tolerances, beliefs about the birthing process, and their specific preferences for how they wish to experience labor and delivery. Both options can be valid and safe choices, depending on the circumstances and the individual woman's needs and desires. Ultimately, the most important thing is for both Rachel and Emily to feel supported and comfortable in their decisions, as this will lead to a more positive childbirth experience for them both."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year.  But I can use this background: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).  What is an answer for this question: Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Danube River's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea. This is because the Danube River delta is larger and grows faster every year, indicating that its sediment deposition rate is higher than that of the Volga River. In order for this to happen, the flow velocity of the Danube River must decrease more rapidly when it reaches the sea, causing it to deposit a larger amount of sediment and form a larger delta."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Two nearby villages are experiencing earthquakes. Bow village gets a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village gets only a few.  Answer this question please: Which village experiences fewer rocks breaking? The answer is:","output":"Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking.  Based on the given background information, earthquakes occur at plate boundaries due to the movement of tectonic plates and the subsequent release of energy that has been stored in rocks. Elastic rebound theory describes this process. When the stresses build up too much in the rocks, they break, resulting in the sudden release of energy as an earthquake. The extent of rock-breaking is directly related to the frequency and intensity of earthquakes occurring in a particular location. In the new situation described, Bow village experiences a lot of earthquakes annually, while Arrow village experiences only a few. This indicates that the rocks in Bow village have more stress accumulation which causes them to break more frequently, resulting in a higher number of earthquakes. On the other hand, in Arrow village, because there are fewer earthquakes, it can be inferred that the stress accumulation within rocks is less and consequently they break less often. Hence, Arrow village experiences fewer rocks breaking as compared to Bow village, owing to the lower frequency and intensity of earthquakes in that area."},{"instruction":"Q:I have no experience with a lazy 21 yr old.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Q: Energy constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and what type of energy?   A: Answer:","output":"Energy constantly changes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy. To better understand this dynamic relationship, let's first define these two types of energy and then explore their interplay in various real-world scenarios. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object in motion. It is dependent on both the object's mass and its velocity (or speed). The faster an object moves or the more massive it is, the greater its kinetic energy. Mathematically, kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2 Here, m represents the mass of the object, and v represents its velocity. Potential energy, on the other hand, is the energy stored in an object due to its position in a system or its configuration. There are several forms of potential energy, including gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy, and chemical potential energy. Gravitational potential energy, for instance, is the energy an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field (e.g., at a certain height above the Earth's surface). The formula for gravitational potential energy (GPE) is: GPE = m * g * h Here, m represents the mass of the object, g stands for the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2 on Earth), and h represents the height of the object above the reference point (usually Earth's surface). The interplay between kinetic and potential energy can be observed in various phenomena. For instance, consider a swing. When a person sits on the swing and is pulled back to its highest point, the system has maximum gravitational potential energy as the person is at the highest point from the ground. As the swing is released and begins its downward motion, the gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy. At the lowest point in the swing's trajectory, the kinetic energy is at its maximum, and the potential energy is at its minimum. As the swing then moves upward and slows down, the kinetic energy is gradually converted back into potential energy. This back and forth conversion of energy between kinetic and potential continues until external forces, such as air resistance or friction, eventually bring the swing to a stop. Another example is a roller coaster ride. As the coaster climbs to the top of the first hill, it gains gravitational potential energy. Once it begins its descent, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing the coaster to accelerate. Throughout the ride, the roller coaster will continually exchange kinetic and potential energy as it moves up and down hills and around bends, ultimately losing some energy to external forces like friction and air resistance. In summary, energy constantly changes between kinetic energy, associated with motion, and potential energy, tied to an object's position or configuration. This interplay is crucial for understanding energy conservation and transfer in various real-world situations, such as swinging objects, roller coasters, and even everyday activities like walking and jumping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

But that night when my dad tried to cheer me up, my laugh turned into crying. So it came as no surprise to learn that scientists believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to _ pressure is important to our emotional   health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we're very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying - holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering - can be bad for physical   health. Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems. If you have a health problem, doctors will certainly not ask you to cry.

Java: With its \\"write once, run anywhere\\" principle, Java is renowned for its portability and widespread adoption across various industries. Java's demand can be primarily attributed to its use in Android app development, as well as in large-scale enterprise applications and backend systems. 4. C#: Developed by Microsoft, C# is a versatile language used in Windows application development, game development (primarily using Unity), and web applications via ASP.NET. It is an excellent choice for those who aim to work within the Microsoft ecosystem. 5. C++: This language is regarded as the foundation for many modern programming languages and offers a more in-depth understanding of computer memory usage. It is widely used in the development of high-performance applications, game engines, and system-level software. However, it has a steeper learning curve and may be more challenging for beginners. 6. Ruby: Known for its elegance and simplicity, Ruby is an ideal language for web application development. It is often associated with the Rails framework, which has fueled its popularity among companies and startups looking for a fast and efficient way to build web applications. 7. Swift: If your focus extends to iOS application development, Swift is the go-to language for creating applications for Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, and Macs. Swift was designed by Apple to be a replacement for Objective-C, offering a safer and more efficient language option for their products. Based on this information, as a beginner, you may consider starting with Python or JavaScript, as both languages are relatively accessible and have significant real-world applications. Once you've developed a foundation and garnered experience, you can venture into learning more specialized languages that align with your interests and project requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trying to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Buccaneers, the Panthers flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 5 divisional duel with the winless New Orleans Saints. With QB Jake Delhomme out and done for the year with a right elbow injury, QB David Carr was given the start. In the first quarter, Carolina took the early lead with kicker John Kasay getting a 23-yard field goal. The Saints responded with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Panthers went back into the lead with Kasay nailing a 35-yard field goal. New Orleans would respond with Mare kicking a 28-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Carolina trailed as Saints FB Mike Karney got a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers tied the game with Carr completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith. Afterwards, Carolina sealed the win in the final seconds with Kasay nailing a 52-yard field goal as time ran out. Which player made field goals longer than 30 yards?","output":"To determine which player made field goals longer than 30 yards, let's analyze the information given in the text step-by-step. 1. In the first quarter, John Kasay made a 23-yard field goal and Olindo Mare made a 25-yard field goal. Both are shorter than 30 yards, so they don't meet the criteria. 2. In the second quarter, John Kasay made a 35-yard field goal and Olindo Mare made a 28-yard field goal. John Kasay's field goal is longer than 30 yards, so we'll make note of that. Olindo Mare's field goal is shorter than 30 yards and doesn't meet the criteria. 3. In the third quarter, there is no mention of field goals being made, only a touchdown run. 4. In the fourth quarter, John Kasay made a 52-yard field goal. That is longer than 30 yards, so we'll add it to our list. In conclusion, John Kasay made field goals longer than 30 yards.

Caoshu, cursive written text, almost always includes character simplification, and simplified forms have always existed in print, albeit not for the most formal works. In the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, and a large number of Chinese intellectuals and writers have long maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. Indeed, this desire by the Kuomintang to simplify the Chinese writing system (inherited and implemented by the Communist Party of China) also nursed aspirations of some for the adoption of a phonetic script based on the Latin script, and spawned such inventions as the Gwoyeu Romatzyh.

Write some highlights for the following article: Lower Manhattan's controversial Park51 Islamic center is now in a court battle with utility Consolidated Edison, which says the center owes it 1.7 million in a dispute over back rent. In court papers, Park51 says it owes Con Edison only 881,000 and calls the utility's demand \\"grossly inflated.\\" The center has filed suit against the company over a default notice it was issued in September, and a New York state judge has stayed any action until after a hearing in November. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Con Edison said it \\"remains hopeful\\" that it can work out an agreement with Park51, which leases part of its property from the utility. Park51's developers did not return a phone call seeking comment. The center, which includes a mosque, drew intense opposition in 2010 from politicians, conservative activists and some families of the victims of the al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center. The twin towers stood about two blocks from the site before they were destroyed by the suicide hijackings on September 11, 2001, leading critics to dub the project the \\"Ground Zero Mosque.\\" The interfaith center's leaders said the project will be a 16-story community center with recreational, educational and cultural programming rooted in a spirit of cooperation and coexistence. City officials refused to block its construction, and Park51 held its grand opening in September. According to court documents, Park51 has exercised an option to purchase the Con Edison portion of the site for 10.7 million. The center says it has been paying 2,750 a month -- minuscule by New York standards -- under its initial lease. The rent was to be recalculated based on the market value of the property after it renewed the lease in 2008, but disputes over the appraisal lasted until this August. In September, Con Edison demanded the 1.7 million it said it was owed. \\"The lease for the property calls for the tenant to pay this money now that an appraisal process has been completed,\\" the utility told CNN. \\"Under the terms of the lease, Con Edison requested payment of outstanding rent, but to date, tenant has not yet made the required payment.\\" But lawyers for Park51 argue the demand is based on \\"a fundamental misreading\\" of its lease and have accused Con Edison of improperly trying to take back the property. \\"Whether it is bowing to political pressure or seeking to retain the valuable premises for itself, Con Ed appears intent upon proceeding with its wrongful termination (and cancellation of plaintiff's right to purchase the premises) and it has expressly threatened to do so,\\" they wrote. Con Edison said Sunday it has defended Park51's right to buy the land. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","output":"- Lower Manhattan's Park51 Islamic center, which faced controversy and opposition in 2010, is now in a legal battle with Consolidated Edison over back rent. - The utility company claims Park51 owes 1.7 million, while Park51 argues it owes only 881,000, calling Con Edison's demand \\"grossly inflated.\\" - Park51 has filed suit against Con Edison over a default notice, and a New York state judge has stayed any action until a hearing in November. - Con Edison has expressed hope that an agreement can be reached, while Park51 has accused the company of improperly trying to take back the property. - The center exercised an option to purchase the Con Edison portion of the site for 10.7 million."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context:  Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Myocardial infarction in the setting of plaque results from underlying atherosclerosis. Inflammation is known to be an important step in the process of atherosclerotic plaque formation. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive but nonspecific marker for inflammation. Elevated CRP blood levels, especially measured with high-sensitivity assays, can predict the risk of MI, as well as stroke and development of diabetes. Moreover, some drugs for MI might also reduce CRP levels.

Paul goes alone off to the Cornwall coast, where his line snares on something, and he goes underwater.Paul comes to, and finds himself in a cave along with Miranda (Glynis Johns), a beautiful mermaid. Due to the nature of the cave, Paul is unable to leave, and Miranda delightfully explains that she intends to keep him as her prisoner (claiming an aversion to human men). Paul also finds the cave littered with newspapers and magazines, of which Miranda has read about humans and their ways. After a little time, Miranda decides to make Paul a deal: she will let him go if he will take her to London to see the sights. Miranda even concocts the perfect plan to get her about: they'll simply cover up her tail and say that Paul (as he is a physician) is helping her to recover.Paul is a little incensed at the plan, but goes along with it, ordering several dresses from a fashion designer he and his wife know...though the designer is rather perplexed regarding the need for a hemline that covers past a normal woman's feet.Paul returns to London with Miranda, but sends her out for a drive to see the city with the house butler, Charles (David Tomlinson). While they are out, Paul explains to Clare that Miranda will be staying with them for 4 weeks, and has arranged for a woman named Carey (Margaret Rutherford) to look after her.Over the course of the next few weeks, Miranda often displays some rather strange traits: she prefers to only eat raw fish or oysters, and some nights, she can be heard singing a lilting song in a rather unheard-of yet beautiful voice.She also manages to charm Charles (who is engaged to Betty (Yvonne Owen) the Martins maid), as well as a nearby artist named Nigel (John McCallum) who it just so happens is also engaged.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: To make the diluted essential oil solution, you’ll need to gather a few items. You’ll need your selected essential oil and your supplemental carrier oil, a separate bottle or container to hold the new mixture, and several eye droppers. Try to get dark colored glass bottles to filter out the damaging UV rays. Using two separate eye droppers to avoid cross-contamination, make your mixture based on the formula you have already established. If your formula calls for 12 drops of essential oil and 5 drops of carrier oil, use your eye droppers to extract the desired amount of each liquid and carefully squeeze it into the new container – making sure to count each drop carefully.  Once you have added both ingredients, put the lid on and give it a good shake to ensure the contents are properly mixed. And don’t forget to label the bottle before you put it away and forget what is in it. Be cautious about direct contact to the skin of the undiluted essential oils. You should also carefully weigh your decision to use essential oils if you are pregnant. There is controversy around whether or not essential oils can impact a fetus, so you should carefully consider it for yourself. Typically, you need to store your essential oils (including diluted essential oil mixtures) in a cool, dark place. It’s important to keep them out of direct sunlight or away from places that are constantly being cooled and warmed based on exposure to the sun. This will keep them from becoming useless because of increased oxidation over time. Carrier oils should be stored in the fridge during the hot summer months to avoid fatty particles from forming that will need to be re-dissolved before you can use it. But they should still be at room temperature when you use them for mixing, so take them out of the fridge twelve hours before you intend to use them. Summary:","output":"Creating a diluted essential oil solution involves several steps and materials. First, the essentials required for the task include a chosen essential oil and complementary carrier oil besides a bottle or container, ideally dark-colored glass to block harmful UV rays, and a couple of eye droppers to prevent cross-contamination. The mixing formula is predicated on predetermined measurements; for example, for a formula that demands 12 drops of essential oil and 5 drops of carrier oil, these quantities are drawn out using the eye droppers and slowly deposited into the new container. The blend needs to be thoroughly shaken after the lid is fixed on to ensure appropriate blending. It's also vital to label the bottle to avoid future confusion. For safety reasons, any direct skin contact with undiluted essential oils should be avoided. Expectant women specifically need to carefully consider their use of essential oils due to the contentious discourse regarding essential oils' potential impact on the fetus.  The storage of essential oils, both in their pure and diluted states, should ideally be in a cool, dark place, away from any direct sunlight or temperatures fluctuating due to sun exposure. They can degrade and become ineffective over time due to elevated oxidation. During summer, carrier oils should be kept refrigerated to inhibit the formation of fatty particles that would need redissolving prior to use. However, they need to be brought to room temperature during the mixing process, meaning they should be removed from the fridge about twelve hours before."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Please answer the following question: -  Plates on the Earth&#x27;s crust move slowly past each other - As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process after energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves is the occurrence of an earthquake. Earthquake events are the direct result of the release of energy from the Earth's crust due to the constant motion and interaction of tectonic plates. This energy travels as seismic waves, which cause ground shaking, vibrations, and deformations at the surface and beneath. As seismic waves propagate through the Earth's interior from the point of the crust break (the earthquake's focus or hypocenter), they lose some of their energy, but they still carry enough force to the ground surface (the earthquake's epicenter) and surrounding areas. Upon reaching the surface, seismic waves cause the ground to shake, often leading to various degrees of damage depending on the earthquake's magnitude and the affected area's geological and structural conditions. There are two main types of seismic waves associated with earthquakes: body waves and surface waves. Body waves, which comprise of primary (P) and secondary (S) waves, move through the Earth's interior, whereas surface waves, which include Rayleigh waves and Love waves, only travel along the Earth's surface. The shaking caused by earthquake-related seismic waves can result in landslides, liquefaction, surface rupture, and tsunamis. In addition, these ground motions can result in the collapse of buildings, damage to infrastructure, and other hazards to human life and property. Following the earthquake event, there will also be aftershocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same region as the mainshock. Aftershocks are a consequence of the adjustment of the Earth's crust after the abrupt displacement as the tectonic plates continue to interact and reposition themselves. Aftershocks can last from hours to several weeks or even years after the main earthquake, and although they are usually smaller in magnitude than the initial quake, they can still cause additional damage to structures weakened during the main event or increase the risk of landslides. In summary, after tectonic plates exert a great force and cause the crust to break, the stress is released as seismic waves, which lead to an earthquake event. The seismic waves travel through the Earth and cause ground shaking, resulting in multiple hazards such as landslides, surface rupture, and infrastructure damage. Moreover, the energy release initiates aftershocks, which adds a prolonged effect of the earthquake and can cause additional destruction in the affected areas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Telmatosaurus (meaning \\"marsh lizard\\") is a genus of basal hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania.   - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU.  - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time.  - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.  - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus .  - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.  - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used.  - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park.  - The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.

He was the son of Stephen VIII Báthory  of the noble Hungarian Báthory family and his wife Catherine Telegdi. He had at least five siblings: two brothers and three sisters. Little is known about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553 Báthory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Zápolya's supporter, Báthory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favour at Zápolya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, Gáspár Bekes. Báthory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Zápolya. After Zápolya's death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected Báthory Voivode of Transylvania.

Answer:","output":"\\"Snoring\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a common noise produced by humans during sleep. Snoring occurs when the flow of air through the mouth and nose is partially blocked, causing the tissues in the throat to vibrate.

BRISTOW, Okla. – It’s a case that sparked outrage in an Oklahoma community, and caused state leaders to take action against a little known loophole in the law.      “He’s like right there, practically in my backyard and that kind of makes me nervous and not want to go home ever,” 21-year-old Danyelle Dyer told NewsChannel 4.      Danyelle says her uncle, Harold English, was just released from prison after he was convicted of molesting her when she was a child.      While she hoped to moved on after his conviction, her family says no one expected what would happen after English was released.      Instead of being out of her life, English moved in with his mother, who lives just over the fence.      “Not only is my daughter feeling her past come back to haunt her, but a lot of years of rage and anger that I’ve kept under my collar is sitting right outside my door,” said Greg Dyer.      After learning about the situation, the community came out to support Danyelle and urge Oklahoma officials to change the law.      Now, it seems that change is in the works.      On Thursday, Judge Richard Woolery issued a 1,000 feet protective order for the Dyer family, meaning that English has 10 days to vacate the premises.      Current law prohibits sex offenders from living within a 2,000 feet radius of schools, daycare centers and parks, but it does not stop a sex offender from living within a certain proximity of the victim.      “Supposedly, he paid his debt to society and as long as he’s not near a church or a daycare or where children gather, he’s free to do as he wishes,” said Greg Dyer.      Lawmakers say their hands are currently tied since they are not in session, but say they are committed to changing the law once they get back to the Capitol.      “We applaud Judge Woolery for taking the steps necessary to protect the victim and her family. While we are grateful that this specific situation has been resolved, we remain committed to fixing this loophole in the law next spring. It is unacceptable that a sex offender could move in next door to the victim, and furthermore, a victim should not have to go through the trouble of hiring an attorney to prevent this- it should simply be the law.      Many individuals have come forward to help this family, but specifically we would like to thank the Attorney General’s office and Representative Scott Biggs for going above and beyond to point the family in the right direction throughout this difficult situation.      The courage Danyelle has shown throughout has been incredible. Through her advocacy in the last month, she has brought national attention to a loophole that is present in 45 out of 50 states. Thanks to her, hopefully this will never happen anywhere in the United States ever again,” a statement from Rep. Kyle Hilbert and Sen. James Leewright read. ||||| A convicted sex offender who moved next-door to his victim following his recent release from prison must find a new home after an Oklahoma judge granted a protective order prohibiting him from living within 1,000 feet of the niece he molested when she was a little girl.      PEOPLE confirms that 21-year-old Danyelle Dyer was granted the order against her uncle, Harold English, during a hearing held Thursday before Judge Richard Woolery.      English, now 65, served more than a dozen years behind bars following his 2004 conviction on lewd molestation charges. Upon his release on June 13, English moved into his mother’s home in Bristow, Oklahoma — only yards away from Dyer.      “I was coming back from class and he was out mowing in my grandmother’s backyard, and it made me uneasy just being home,” Dyer told PEOPLE in June. “I go to school in Edmond, [Oklahoma,] so I’m only home half the time, and I think twice before going home now. I have a very close family, so it’s hard for me to not constantly be with them.”      Five states, including Alabama and Tennessee, place restrictions on how far an offender can live from his or her victim.      Oklahoma statute bars sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school, playground or child care facility, but it does not restrict where offenders may live in relation to their victims.      State Rep. Kyle Hilbert tells PEOPLE he’s “very happy” for Dyer, who was unavailable for comment Monday, but notes the protective order only resolves her dilemma and not that of other victims who might be in similar situations.      “She is almost certainly not the only person going through this right now,” he says.      • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Harold English Oklahoma Sex & Violent Offender Registry      “This protective order lasts forever, but even with this happening and us getting a positive result for the family, I will still move forward with legislation that will bar sex offenders from living within a certain distance of their victims,” Hilbert says.      “A victim should not have to hire an attorney and go through this legal process and face their assailants in court again,” he says.      Hilbert lauded how Dyer has “been able to highlight this issue” far beyond Oklahoma.      “She has brought national attention to this loophole and is going to help victims all over the country,” he says. “I’ve already had two different attorneys contact me who have been involved in similar cases. I thought, ‘Surely, this never happens,’ but unfortunately it does.”      Oklahoma’s legislature meets between February and May, meaning lawmakers won’t return to the capital until 2018. Hilbert has said he hopes to get his new bill in front of the state house as soon as possible.      “I was pretty outraged,” Dyer said in June. “But I have channeled that rage into a more positive outlet, which, for me, is sharing my story and empowering other victims of sexual assault.”      PEOPLE has been unable to reach English or his mother for comment, and Dyer said that she, too, had had no contact with them since June 13.      Source: Larina Dyer/Facebook      “I think Danyelle is okay for trying to get a law passed,” her grandmother told CNN in June. “But she shouldn’t blame me for what happened because this is my son and I just give him a place to stay until he can find a place on his own.”      “I don’t agree with what my son did,” English’s mother said.      Dyer told PEOPLE that she no longer wanted anything to do with her grandmother because of the older woman’s decisions. When Dyer was in high school, her uncle was released and lived with her grandmother until he violated probation and “went right back” to prison, Dyer said.      She said she wrote her grandmother a letter about the situation, but she did not get a reply.      “She is supposed to protect me, she is supposed to take care of me,” Dyer said, “so for her to turn on me like this, she obviously doesn’t care about me.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"An Oklahoma judge has granted a 1,000 feet protective order for a family after convicted sex offender Harold English was released from prison and moved in with his mother, who lives next door to his victim, his niece Danyelle Dyer.

How to hang bathroom towels  Use free standing racks to store many towels for family or guests.  Standalone racks are a great option for hanging your towels when you lack enough room for wall racks. Hang towels in matching or coordinating colors (like light blue and green) on the rack's bars.","output":"The most logical next event after obtaining and setting up a free-standing rack for hanging bathroom towels would be organizing, maintaining, and routinely refreshing these towels. To help create an inviting ambiance and ensure cleanliness in the bathroom, here are some steps to follow: 1. Organize your towels: Keep your everyday-use towels separate from guest towels. You can designate specific bars on the standing rack for each purpose, or even use color-coded towels (e.g., white for guests and blue for family members) to avoid confusion. Alternatively, you can also keep guest towels in a separate space such as a linen closet, and bring them out only when needed. 2. Fold towels uniformly: To create a neat and visually appealing display, fold towels consistently. For example, fold them in halves or thirds lengthwise, and then fold them again in half or thirds, depending on the size of towels and the space on the rack. This will ensure that all towels are of equal size and shape when hung or stacked on the rack. 3. Hang towels properly: Hang towels on the rack with equal space between them to allow proper air circulation and faster drying. Ideally, the folded edge should face the wall, while the open ends hang down, to give a neat and polished appearance. Also, ensure that the towels are hung straight and do not touch the bathroom floor. 4. Practice hygiene: To maintain cleanliness, wash your towels frequently. The frequency of washing will depend on individual preferences and usage habits but aim for every 3-4 days for daily use towels and every two weeks for guest towels that are not used often. 5. Rotate your towels: Rotate different sets of towels to prevent overuse and wear on any particular set. It will also help to prolong the lifespan of your towels, as constant use can lead to them becoming thin, less absorbent, and less soft. 6. Refresh the display: Occasionally, change the color coordination or arrangement of your towels to keep your bathroom looking fresh and invigorated. This can also be done seasonally, with lighter-colored towels for the warmer months and darker, warm-colored towels for colder months. 7. Add finishing touches: To create a pleasant atmosphere in your bathroom, consider adding a few decorative elements, such as candles, potted plants, or a small piece of wall art. Choose items that either complement or contrast the color of your towels, creating a harmonious and stylish arrangement. Implementing these steps will enhance the appearance of your bathroom and provide an organized system for towel storage and maintenance. Following these guidelines will ensure your bathroom remains a comfortable and functional space that leaves a positive impression on both family members and guests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have never done any kind of run before. What advice do you have for us? Choose from:  1). no;  2). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Buying a solitaire diamond ring for your wife When buying a solitaire diamond ring, there are several aspects you need to consider: 1. Budget: Determine your budget first before you start looking at diamond rings. This will help you stay focused and find the right ring within your price range. 2. The 4Cs: Diamonds are evaluated using the 4Cs - carat, color, clarity, and cut. Learn about these characteristics, as they will help you choose the perfect diamond for your wife. Here's a brief overview: a) Carat: Carat is the unit of weight for a diamond. A larger carat size typically means a more expensive diamond. However, a bigger diamond does not always mean better. Choose a carat size that is suitable for your wife's preferences and your budget. b) Color: Diamonds come in a range of colors, with colorless (D) being the most valuable, and slightly yellow (Z) being the least valuable. Aim for a diamond with a color grade of H or better, as it will appear colorless to the naked eye. c) Clarity: Clarity refers to the presence of inclusions (internal) and blemishes (external) in the diamond. The highest clarity grade is FL (flawless), while the lowest is I3 (included). Select a diamond with a clarity grade of SI1 or better, as these will have inclusions that are not visible without magnification. d) Cut: The cut of a diamond is crucial as it affects how light is reflected and refracted, ultimately influencing the diamond's sparkle. The cut grades are excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor. Aim for a diamond with a cut grade of very good or excellent. 3. Ring setting: Choose a setting that complements the diamond's shape and highlights its beauty. Popular solitaire settings include prong, bezel, and tension. 4. Metal: Select a metal for the ring, such as gold, white gold, rose gold, or platinum. Consider your wife's preferences and lifestyle before making a choice. 5. Ring size: Make sure you know your wife's ring size before buying the solitaire ring. 6. Certification: Always buy a certified diamond from a reputable lab like GIA, AGS, or EGL USA. This ensures you are getting an accurately graded diamond. 7. Purchase from a reputed jeweler: Do your research and find a reputable jeweler with good customer reviews and a solid return policy. You can also consider buying from online retailers like Blue Nile or James Allen. Question 2: Preparing for a 5k color run As first-time runners, here are some tips to help you prepare for the 5k color run: 1. Choose the right shoes: Invest in a comfortable pair of running shoes with proper cushioning and support. 2. Training: Start training around 6-8 weeks before the event. Gradually increase your running distance and pace, incorporating walk breaks if needed. Aim to run at least 3-4 times a week. 3. Cross-training: Add cross-training activities like cycling, swimming, or yoga to your weekly routine to develop overall fitness and flexibility. 4. Hydration and Nutrition: Drink plenty of water and maintain a healthy, balanced diet for optimal energy levels during training. 5. Listen to your body: It's important to avoid injuries, so pay attention to any pain or discomfort, and rest or consult a healthcare professional if needed. 6. Practice running with colored powder: Familiarize yourself with running through colored powder, as you may encounter it during the event. You can use cornstarch mixed with food coloring for practice. 7. Dress appropriately: Wear white or light-colored clothing to showcase the colors, and consider using a bandana or goggles to protect your eyes and mouth from the powder. 8. Research the event: Know the race route, location, and schedule of activities in advance, so you arrive well-prepared on race day. 9. Warm-up: Warm up with dynamic stretching exercises for 5-10 minutes before the race. 10. Enjoy the experience: The color run is meant to be a fun, non-competitive event, so focus on enjoying the experience with your wife and embracing the colorful atmosphere.
