Going by this definition,Yes, India is a Secular Country because it is not governed by any religious organisation . I can recall from the NCERT text book: “To be truly secular, a state must not only refuse to be theocratic but also have no formal, legal alliance with any religion. The separation of religion-state is, however, a necessary but not a sufficient ingredient of a secular state. A secular state must be committed to principles and goals which are at least partly derived from non-religious sources. ” List of Gazetted Holidays for 2016 DoPT order ref:[LINKED_TEXT: http://F.No] [URL: http://f.no/].12/7/2015-JCA-2 “REPUBLIC DAY 2.

Coming to your implicit question “..is Modi Secular” Besides being the PM of India, Sh Narendra Modi is also an individual and has the freedom of practicing the religion of his choice (India being a Secular Country), thus if he feels like celebrating the Hindu festival of Diwali, how does it affect the secular fabric of India.

Guns have been plentiful for centuries here. But from the 1950's mass shootings have increased exponentially. The problem of gun violence is the public not the guns. People have changed and they respect human life less. There's no fear of a mortal sin anymore. But fixing society is hard. Once respect and trust is gone it's nearly impossible to get again. So instead it's easier and lazier and more dishonest to blame guns, while subverting a Constitutional right, then it is to restore law and order with a genuine fear of breaking the law, and instilling a faith and commitment to that kind of community. So yeah, gun control wont work because you didnt change the people.

Here’s why… King Kong is simply a gigantic gorilla, so his strength is that of a 100 foot gorilla, or however tall he is. If he’s 100 feet tall, then he’s about 20 times the size of a real gorilla. Real gorilla’s are roughly ten times stronger than humans, putting 100 foot Kong at about 2,000 times stronger than a human. If we’re generous, and use the world-record bench press of 1,075 pounds as our human strength starting point, that would mean King Kong could bench 1,075 x 10 x 20, which equals 215,000 pounds, or 107 tons. Hulk’s STARTING strength, when he first “Hulks up,” is about 100 tons or more. So when the fight starts, King Kong will be about equal in strength with the Hulk. Then, as Kong hits him, and pisses him off more, Hulk gets bigger and stronger, and pretty soon, he's throwing Kong around like a rag doll, and that’s with a really generous strength estimate for Kong. That estimate, that gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, is probably not based on the strongest human who has ever lived. It is more likely based on normal humans. The average bench press for a normal man is about 135 pounds. That sounds low, but that’s likely due to a lot of guys grossly exaggerating how much they can bench. I have benched 210 a few times, and that was when I was at my strongest. Currently, I could probably put up like 170, and I am a fairly big guy, 5′11″ 225 lbs. If you know someone that can really bench like 300 or more, they are very strong. The 1,075 pound bench press world record is freakin insane lol. So, if gorillas are 10 times stronger than humans, and the human average has a 135 pound bench press, and Kong is 20 times stronger than gorillas, then Kong’s max bench is 135 x 10 x 20, which is 27,000 pounds, or 13.5 tons. Yikes, by that reckoning, Hulk would win in a nasty curb-stomp."},{"instruction":"Are openworld video games getting too big for their own good?","output":"Open world games are actually getting too small. Have you played a little game called Arena, back in 1994? This was a mindboggingly huge openworld game. Spanning an entire continent. It would take you 10 hours of real world time to walk from the town to a nearby lake. Just like it would be in real life. If you tried to walk from one end of the game to the other… it would take a month I think. I know some people tried. Today? Arena’s successor, a little-known game called Skyrim, is only one of the nine provinces in Arena’s world map. And it’s a mini-me’d version of the Skyrim in Arena, and it only takes you thirty minutes give or take to walk from one end of Skyrim to the other. Talk about corporate downsizing! Today’s open world games are not big. Not by a long shot. They are more detailed and more fleshed out, sure, but they are not big. *** EDIT *** Okay just for fun, in response to one of the comments below incredulous about walking from one end of Skyrim to the other in 30 minutes, I tried doing it again right now. I started at Markarth, and went running at 11:20am MLA time. I ran until I got to Fort Dawnguard. I ran through The Reach, across the Whiterun Tundra, then past teh Throat of the World, got lost in the mountains around Fort Amol, then climbed up to the Rift and ran to Fort Dawnguard. It got there at 11:37am. It only took me 17 minutes to do it. I actually hit the other end of the map at around 11:30 (just southeast of Windhelm), but I wanted to run south to Fort Dawnguard to prove the point. I killed a bunch of stuff along the way, and stopped to check my map at least a dozen times. Along the way I casually killed: 3 dogs1 wolf5 necromancers6 cave bears1 minotaur (from Mihail’s Mods)1 Leshen (also from Mihail’s Mods)3 spiders And maybe a few more stuff I forgot. The necromancers were the most annoying because they had freeze spells that slowed my movement down. This is with a mage with 100 stamina and gets tired running to the door. I did not use any stamina potions but I think I had one piece of gear with a Stamina Regen enchant. Thirty minutes was an extremely generous estimate. That’s how tiny Skyrim is, that’s how small openworld games are these days. Meanwhile in Daggerfall (the second Elder Scrolls game) this guy walked from one corner of the map to a town just a “short” distance north on the same end of the province (not even the other end of the map, not even to another province in the map). It took him 8 hours."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"Two things. Be physically congruent with your message to kids.

If you are angry, use an angry face, not just words. They watch what you do to see if you are sincere rather than listen to what you say. Use upcoming milestones to help kids achieve goals. For example: “I know you need to suck your thumb now because you are only three years old. But when you are four years old, you won’t suck your thumb anymore.” Or, “Did you know that when you have your birthday you won’t need diapers anymore?” Start repeating the message weeks before the event and as the day approaches, remind them of the miraculous change that is going to happen on their birthday this week.

Robotic milking reduces the workload to the point an older farmer can keep going for a few years rather than being forced into selling and retirement. They're still a lot of work.

However, the truth is that microwave ovens are safe and can be a convenient and efficient way to cook food. Microwave ovens work by using electromagnetic waves to heat up water molecules in food. This causes the food to heat up quickly and evenly, making it a popular cooking method for many people. However, some people believe that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by microwave ovens can be harmful to human health. The truth is that microwave ovens are designed to be safe and emit very little radiation. The amount of radiation emitted by a microwave oven is far below the level that is considered harmful to humans. In fact, microwave ovens are regulated by the FDA to ensure that they meet safety standards and do not pose a risk to human health. Another concern that some people have about microwave ovens is that they can cause a loss of nutrients in food. While it is true that cooking food at high temperatures can cause some nutrient loss, this is not specific to microwave cooking. In fact, studies have shown that microwave cooking can actually help preserve the nutrients in food better than other cooking methods, such as boiling or frying. One potential downside of microwave cooking is that it can sometimes lead to uneven cooking or hot spots in food. This can be mitigated by stirring food frequently or using a microwave-safe lid to trap steam and heat for more even cooking. Overall, microwave ovens are a safe and convenient way to cook food. They can help to preserve nutrients and are regulated to ensure that they meet safety standards. As with any cooking method, it is important to use caution and follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe and effective use."},{"instruction":"What are some less known facts about Mars?","output":"Their candy bars are delicious."},{"instruction":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","output":"Unlike in the US, it’s perfectly straightforward to be ‘fiscally conservative and socially liberal’ in the UK, several members of Mrs. Thatcher’s advisors were openly gay for example, Matthew Parris for one.

The landlord of my first flat in SF—aka Creepy Ron the Landlord—didn’t provide any refuse for the two flats in the building, or the *restaurant* on the ground floor! Maybe two or three times a year, the City would force him to haul off the backyard full of trash bags, or face a fine. No idea if the haulers were, in fact, taking the load to a legal trash dump (see below). The City now mandates everyone have basic trash/recycling pickup, but back then (1980s), apparently not. I got into the habit of taking small bags of trash to work, where I could toss it in the dumpster out back, or put it in one of the street cans along the way. → People living in SRO hotels or cheap apartments often have laughably bad trash (and, later, recycling) service. Maybe one 50-gallon can for a 20+ unit building. Some landlords would cram families—mom, dad, a few kids, maybe grandma—into studio apartments, and while they’d bump up the rent, they wouldn’t increase their trash capacity, because (1) it might tip off the authorities that they’re overcrowding, and (2) cheaper. So a building that with, say, 20 units designed to house 1–2 people, max, could now have as many as 80 people living there, and the trash bin would be overflowing the day after pickup. What to do? Do like I did, take it out yourself and that leads to…. → “Vietnamization”. Yikes. Unpack that bit of slang from the early 80s. (“Vietnamization” was the name of a failed US counter-insurgency strategy during the Vietnam War.) SF had an influx of SE Asian refugees after the end of the Vietnam War, most of whom ended up in the Tenderloin and South of Market neighborhoods. And, yes, many of them were crammed into SROs and studios and lacking proper refuse service. So, to keep things tidy, they’d take it out to the nearest public trash can or a private dumpster in some back alley. Pretty soon, everything was overflowing, businesses were putting padlocks on their dumpsters, and street cans became…scarce. Little bags of trash began stacking up alongside the remaining street cans, in alleyways, wherever. This was dubbed “Vietnamization” (“My dumpster got Vietnamized last night!”) Conservatives accused the refugees (and most Asians in general) with being dirty and a blight on the City. (This was before ‘model minority’ became a thing.) Having used the DIY method of trash-removal, I knew that they were just trying to keep their homes *clean*. I’m guessing that this era is what lead the powers-that-be to make trash (and, later, recycling) mandatory. → SF v Vancouver: I’m guessing it rains more in BC than in SF, yeah? Things get washed away? Uh-huh. Plus, while Vancouver proper has a slightly smaller footprint than SF (roughly 45 sq.mi vs. 49 sq.mi), SF has about 250,000 *more* residents. That’s just residents—add in tourists, workers, shoppers, students, etc., and we probably host a million people in SF on many a day. Not all of them are neat as a pin, sorry to say. → Illegal dumping: A lot of trash piles that get blamed on the ‘homeless’ really are illegal dumps, e.g., hauling services (et al) save on dump fees by throwing stuff on the streets, usually in poorer neighborhoods. A lot of individuals do the same; gotta get rid of an old mattress? Junk it on the sidewalk near the freeway overpass—everyone will blame it on the homeless guys! I visit friends in Oakland, who live near two freeway overpasses. There are homeless camps under the freeway, and the area gets hit with small but illegal trash dumps. The clue? Plenty of construction debris. Big and/or heavy items that no one there could have wrestled to their camp: king-size mattresses, heavy office furniture, couches, and appliances, including full-size refrigerators. → Do “The Homeless” litter as well? Of course. But they’ve got company. Tourists are courted and welcomed to SF, and they litter, too. In fact, having seen the crud left behind by tourists in many National Parks—no, not just during the recent shutdown, but going back to my teen years on family vacations—I’d say they carry as much blame as the homeless for any litter woes we’ve got in SF these days. So why do we not demonize the tourists and shame them for their inability to know how to dispose of a coffee cup? Finally, why, how, when did people get the very strange idea that major urban areas are all supposed to be clean as a whistle, quiet, beige, dull? That’s what the suburbs are for, and if that’s what your comfort zone is, why bother coming into the Big Bad of San Francisco? There is, of course, a dog whistle being used here: ‘urban’ has long been shorthand for ‘African-American,’ and ‘dirty’ is a word that has been used against pretty much anyone who’s not a straight/white/dude with a suburban brain. Demonize one group—refugees, non-white residents, hippies or gays or older people—to make it easier to ‘clean up’ by cleaning *out* everyone who’s poor. All the better to gentrify their old homes.

Noise found three ways to be a great leader: Show vulnerability Over one-quarter of the folks (in the study) said leaders build trust by admitting their weaknesses. That’s no surprise. Lencioni’s classic work on teamwork says trust is all about vulnerability. When people trust each other they share information about failures, weaknesses, and fears. When people face the truth about themselves, they avoid wasting time and resources on political games. Vulnerability is a shortcut to authenticity. It is a two-way street: The vulnerable leader appears more empathetic, and trusted. Each person knows the other person’s strengths and weaknesses. It is crucial information. Effective teams have no mysteries. No one gains from keeping skeletons in the closet. Explain the intent behind your actions. Over one-quarter of the people said leaders must explain the intent behind their actions. Why? Workers are increasingly sophisticated, educated, and informed. They want to understand why the leader takes various steps. Intent is part of a three-step process. First, clarify the goal. Then formulate action plans. Finally, explain why the action steps are necessary to achieve the goal. Ambiguity on intent is toxic to the team’s overall commitment. Your intent must be 100% crystal clear. As Friedrich Nietzsche said: “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” ‘Walk the talk’ – Accountability: Almost 2/3 of the sample participants said leaders must ‘walk the talk.’ The leader is answerable to his team; team mates are accountable to each other; and the entire team is responsible for overall success. Follow-through and consistency are critical to leadership. When leaders are fully answerable for their roles, peer-to-peer accountability soars because people know the leader will hold them responsible for their individual contributions to the plan. However, this needs to be flawless: Neither the leader nor the team members can accept poor work or shoddy behavior, from any member of the team. Everyone must toe the line. What doesn’t build much trust? Some traditional trust-building techniques simply don’t work. Retreats and traditional team-building exercises were the least useful. Barely 1% of the staff said these techniques worked. Second, recognition is overrated as a trust-building tool. Yes, people expect recognition for good work, but it is not a major foundation of trust. Third, more information was important for only 10% of the workforce. Again, workers expect information, and they get it from various sources. Information is not a motivator—by itself—unless it illuminates individual and team vulnerabilities, intent, and accountability. Information needs to be meaningful; otherwise, it is noise. Conclusions: Building trust is a slow process. But you can lose trust quickly. So, it is imperative to stoke trust, at all levels. Trust has three pillars: The leader and his team acknowledge and admit their weaknesses, failures and fears. Leaders are crystal clear – not only about their action plans but also regarding the intent behind their actions. Finally, the leader does his part of the plan, holds others accountable for executing their parts of the plan, and team members hold each other to the same standard. Building trust is simple, but not easy. And it is worth every calorie of effort. Build trust, and be the leader you were born to be."},{"instruction":"Why are western countries including the United States publicly stating what military equipment they are sending to Ukraine?

There is a lot of economic regulation from the state that's somewhere making the private players to not control production and price with market demands. Until India becomes a market economy, there will be no major changes in the economic progress of current India. Before actually getting into the tweaks we need in our economy, let's look at our economic legacy since independence. Until 2014, we had something called as Five year plans that were designed to serve as a roadmap for India's economic progress for the next five years that followed up. It was started by the Nehru govt in the year 1951. The economic model that we had adopted was from the Soviet Union which comprised of centralised economy where the state had a very big role in controlling the economy — yes, the socialist model. We were no different from China until 1980 when the latter decided to open it's economy which we partially did in 1992, a decade later. Today China is a super power and we are still a developing nation. From 1951–1980, every five year plan focused on industrialisation fueled by the agricultural income. We, actually, never focused on improving agriculture by increasing its productivity through reinvestment rather we always wanted to fund and fuel every other domain capital through the agricultural income. Something which China didn't do. They didn't do inspite of having a food surplus while we did all these experiments with food deficit. Hence they were able to outnumber us by 2.5 times in 1980 who once were significantly less than us comparatively right after our independence in 1947 The next speed breaker to the already low growing Indian economy came through the super socialist policies of Indira govt where she nationalised banks, wholesale trade and coal industry. We had an average growth rate of less than 3% until 1980. In 1992, we were hit by a very large economic recession which forced us to open up our markets. Hence we had the first phase of economic liberalisation of Indian market by PV Narasimha Rao and Dr. Manmohan Singh. We opened up our markets ‘truly’ for the first time. Again, it was more of a deregulation and we still continued to inherit the Soviet Union model. Fast forward to Vajpayee tenure, it was the first govt to focus on disinvestment and infact had a seperate ministry for it. Sadly, even he couldn't do much of altering on the socialist model that we had since independence and he continued those five year plans which had similar agendas that were never achieved since it's inception . But his govt was able to control inflation to a large extent which was very much commendable. Fast forward to 2011, where India was listed in five fragile economies of the world. Inflation hit double digits. Though we had one of the greatest economists as our PM, some how the economic progress of the country stalled in his second tenure. India saw it's next parliamentary elections in 2014 and then came Modi whom people saw as a ray of hope for India's economic progress. Modi was already famous for turning Gujarat from ashes into the most developed state of India. He was seen as a pro-capatalist politician whom India needed badly. One of his first decisions after assuming the PMO was to abort the five year plans. He introduced something called as the Three year action agenda. Sadly, the inheritance of the socialist principles continued to haunt the three year action plans that were brought in by Modi as well. Modi, some how, couldn't translate his pro-capatalist policies to India that he did to Gujarat. Most of the economic policies that we follow today are still strictly under govt regulation making the private players somewhere irrelevant in deciding the production and prices. To the people who believe that Modi's economic policies are of right-wing and pro-capatalist — No, they aren't. They are not economic right wingers. They actually sit in the center of the two economic wings and are infact influenced by some of the socialist policies of RSS. There are some key economic reforms brought-in by the Modi govt like privatisation, NPA monetization etc, no denying that. But when I see people of the left cabal complaining Modi on his capitalist policies, I really wish that was true. We need a second wave of liberalisation of Indian economy now to really put India into the economic progress and achieve atleast 10% annual GDP growth rate. The first wave in 1992 had a small quantam to tweak with and mostly was focused on deregulation not on reforming the Indian economic system as a whole. But today, we really need a strong economic reform that comes with these things: Nullify the central command over economy. This should start by strict deregulation of socialist system into a free market system.Not to introduce any union bodies to control the already performing areas like we introduced the unnecessary IT ministry when IT was already flourishing since 1996.To refom the agri sector. We failed to capitalise on agriculture when the Chinese did in the past. Now with the same old agri economic policies, we can never bring in a revolution that we need. We might need to bring in the farm laws back.Finally, Modi should go back to his Gujarat CM mode and turn into a complete pro-capatalist politician. His second tenure is mostly focused on welfare schemes and no major economic reforms were brought in. This is surely not going to help us.

Biomass has the largest contribution with 50%, followed through hydroelectricity at 26% and wind electricity at 18%. Geothermal energy is generated by using harnessing the Earth’s herbal heat. There is a exquisite quantity stored in the planet with the conduction price pegged at 44.2 terawatts. According to a recent report, the global enterprise is expected to supply around 18.4 gigawatts by 2021. Wind power, on the alternative hand, makes use of air drift to move big wind turbines. The mechanical action generates electric strength. Rows of windmills are commonly constructed along coastal areas in which there are not any obstacles to impede waft. This enterprise could make up 35% of US electrical production by way of 2050. By that time, experts believe that sun energy may be imparting us with 25% of our electricity needs.

They are, in a very real way to those who believe them, religious beliefs. They provide order to a universe that is so bewildering and complex that it can be disorienting & nauseating. And like religious beliefs, people are willing to kill and die for them. Why? Because, from the perspective of the believer, the alternative is worse: “Let’s face it” my deep throat had said to me, “nobody rules the world anymore. The markets rule the world. Maybe that’s why your conspiracy theorists make up all those crazy things. Because the truth is much more frightening. Nobody rules the world.

For the pizza-throwing incident at a 2004 association football game between Manchester United and Arsenal, see Battle of the Buffet § \\"Pizzagate\\" . Proponents of Pizzagate connected Comet Ping Pong (pictured) to a fictitious child sex ring . \\" Pizzagate \\" is a conspiracy theory that went viral during the 2016 United States presidential election cycle. [1] [2] [3] It has been extensively discredited by a wide range of organizations, including the Washington, D.C. police . [2] [3] [4] In March 2016, the personal email account of John Podesta , Hillary Clinton 's campaign chair , was hacked in a spear phishing attack. WikiLeaks published his emails in November 2016. Proponents of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory falsely claimed the emails contained coded messages that connected several high-ranking Democratic Party officials and U.S. restaurants with an alleged human trafficking and child sex ring . One of the establishments allegedly involved was the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C. [5] [6] Members of the alt-right , conservative journalists, and others who had urged Clinton's prosecution over her use of an unrelated private email server spread the conspiracy theory on social media outlets such as 4chan , 8chan , Reddit and Twitter . [7] In response, a man from North Carolina traveled to Comet Ping Pong to investigate the conspiracy and fired a rifle inside the restaurant to break the lock on a door to a storage room during his search. [8] The restaurant owner and staff also received death threats from conspiracy theorists. [9] Pizzagate is generally considered a predecessor to the QAnon conspiracy theory. It also generated another offshoot conspiracy theory, called Frazzledrip , which involved Hillary Clinton participating in the ritual murder of a child. Pizzagate resurged in 2020, mainly due to QAnon. While initially it was spread by only the far-right , it has since been spread by teens on TikTok \\"who don't otherwise fit a right-wing conspiracy theorist mold: the biggest Pizzagate spreaders on TikTok appear to otherwise be mostly interested in topics of viral dance moves and Black Lives Matter \\".

When a piece of online content spreads rapidly across social media, it is said to go “viral.” Conspiracy theories are akin to a cognitive virus. They insidiously jump from person to person so rapidly that it makes Covid-19 look like a case of the sniffles. The narrative structure of conspiracy theories is behind this. People like nothing better than a good story. This may seem a bit abstract, but it’s not. Conspiracy theories can and do destroy the lives of individuals, communities, and entire nations. Nazi Germany & Stalinist Russia grew their power and influence among their citizens largely through propaganda fueled by conspiracy theories. They provide a sense of order & meaning to the lives of those who believe them, pushing back the forces of despair, chaos, & nihilism. That’s why they are impervious to rational arguments.

This time is precious, this is where you are getting the feedback and direct one-on-one advice from the very same person who is going to grade your work. You are not only learning those precious academic writing and research skills, getting hints, direction and helpful material, you are also establishing a bond between yourself and your professor - it is highly valuable and will prove useful many, many times in the future.

I overheard him telling the next table that his wife was sick and had missed a lot of work so he was working as many hours as they would allow him. They had a small child and he was worried about paying the rent. I believe in tithing, but I like to decide where my money goes. I tipped him 500 and left before he had a chance to look at the receipt. I never saw him again but I hope it helped him take off a shift or two so he could spend time with his little family. I have left large tips of several hundred when I was treating the whole family. But this was on a ticket of less than 50. Thank you all for the votes and the nice comments.

I typically give cash and sometimes put it in the hand of the server. I do this because I have witnessed tips stolen off of tables.

I put up in New Delhi, India and am a travel freak, one of the reasons why I’m into hospitality marketing; I tend to travel at least once a month, be it an office trip or a personal one. Last year (2020) was a rough year due to a ban on travel because of a nation wide lockdown in India. Even after the lockdown was lifted, people were still scared to travel because of Covid-19, so was I. Never thought it will have so much impact on me as I was getting depressed due to a lack of travel. I just wanted some time out, so one of my friends suggested me this beautiful destination - Pragpur in Himachal Pradesh. He told me that the place is less travelled by tourists and thus it had almost 0 count of Covid-19 patients in a vary large radius around the destination. So, I went there, it was a 8 hours drive from New Delhi and we did not take any stoppages. We had kept some food and were drinking very less water so we don’t get the urge to pee. I know, we were taking it a little overboard but someone close was suffering from Covid-19 thus we were a little scared during that time. And finally it happened, we entered Pragpur. It’s located on the foothills of Kangra Valley thus you get a perfect view of the mountains and a serene environment all around. The Judge’s Court staff was following all the Covid-19 protocols and literally made it a perfect weekend getaway. The best part was that they have an in-house fruit/vegetable and a dairy farm. The food was so fresh, just like farm-to-table. The travel was really a stress buster and I felt a lot lighter, it gave me a lot of energy. I have visited many other hotels, I mean working in the hospitality sector does give you a lot of perks, but why I like The Judge’s Court most is because it came in just at the time when I was in need. Thanks to the management and staff for making my stay a memorable one. And yes, here’s the number of Mr. Sunil Kumar, the manager of the property, you can call him for discounted rates - 9816335949 Cheers!"},{"instruction":"Does Canada feel animosity towards the Trump administration for the threats and tariffs of the last two years?","output":"Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum is ridiculous. There’s nothing at all related to national security about it. Historically it was considered “Fortress North America”. There’s no possible scenario where steel and aluminum from Canada would ever not be fully accessible to American industry. If it’s a strategic concern, then he should be doing things to build up Canadian capacity to produce steel and aluminum as much as he wants to for American production. It’s not a security related concern at all. He’s just looking to pander to his base, telling them that he will create more working class jobs in these industries. Neither the Canadian nor American mills are modernized or as efficient as Chinese or Korean steel mills, and it would take billions of investment to fix this.

To an extend that I hardly recognize myself on my older photos. So this is me exactly 5 years ago, age 18. I was a sophomore, a diligent student, with lots of hobbies. A little socially awkward - that is a personality trait that has always been around more or less. Romantic, optimistic, a little careless and outgoing. Those were the years of ultimated freedom, and I was exercising my liberty to the max. Making mistakes, getting new emotions and experience. This is me now, the photo was taken just yesterday. Well, the picture speaks a thousand years. Whether I look better now or then I can’t judge. But I’ve changed inside: I stopped making things that destroyed my personality, I’ve become much more consistent in my actions and words, and I’ve learned to take responsibility willingly.

Let me be a bit harsh, since you asked my opinion. As others point out: “Big Whisper” is your own speculation in two self-published Medium articlesIt is not a theoryYou don’t seem to understand current theory beyond pop-science-book level, and that includes various misunderstandingsWhen folks point out flaws in your ideas, you turn that into “my writing is not so good” — no, it’s not the writing; it’s the ideas that don’t make sense to those who understand Big Bang theory well. If you want to replace BB with something better, you first need to make sure it reproduces the same results. For example, why is there about 75% H, 25% He and trace amounts of Li? BB comes up with numerical predictions that are very close to observed amounts. BW would need to similarly make that accurate numerical prediction, but it doesn't. That’s a major, major problem, not a detail to sweep under the rug. Next, a new theory (which BW is not) needs to solve problems that BB doesn’t solve. You propose such things — singularities and “energy is always conserved” — but these are not problems. BB theory in general does not require a singularity. And energy is usually conserved… except not necessarily at a temporal boundary, or any time when the laws of physics vary with time (as they might at a boundary) — see Noether’s theorem for when energy is conserved. And it’s not at all clear that energy conservation is broken in inflation theories, where there already is a “before the BB.” So what you have are straw-man arguments. Friendly advice: I know how exciting it can be to have an idea and pursue it. Just do it right: read a textbook on GR and make sure that you understand the math (Foster and Nightingale, for example). You should get how line elements are used in measurements. You should thoroughly understand the FLRW metric used in the simpler BB models. Work though the paper “Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the universe” by Davis and Lineweaver. Then revisit your idea. There may still be a grain of something interesting in it, though your idea may morph several times as you learn GR. This is not easy. It takes time. It can be frustrating. But it works."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"There are more than 100,00 dev shops and agencies in the US and it is almost impossible to point out a single name which is the best, hence I would like to bring your attention to a neutral platform to hire the world’s top 5% talent, risk-free. After becoming frustrated with the process of posting projects online, interviewing agencies and freelancers, and never knowing if the hired people would work out, we created Digitalogy LLC to offer a better solution. [LINKED_TEXT: Digitalogy ] [URL: http://www.digitalogy.co/]is a Virginia-based on-demand tech sourcing and custom matchmaking marketplace that connects people with pre-screened & top-notch developers and designers based on their specific needs across the globe. We have a very stringent vetting process and less than 5% of teams/agencies get to work with us. We interview their developers or ask for code samples, we verify the portfolios, conduct background references check with their ex-customers, English speaking skills, check the founder’s credentials, and their work history and once all of them are satisfactory, we enroll them as our vendors. We like to work with small, tightly knit, cooperative, and lean teams. Our partners are spread across more than 40+ countries. We start with a 15-minute call to understand the needs of the customer which involves things like - budget, tech stack. geographic location preferences, project details. Our internal matchmaking algorithm is fed by the data collected during the call, we shortlist a couple of teams and ask them to bid once they agree to work on your T&C’s and tick all the checkboxes. We introduce you to them (1–2 teams) within 48-hours and you get to work and discuss directly with them, we do not interfere in any way whatsoever. Plus, our development partners pay us to be a part of our network so we don’t charge you anything for these matchmaking and project management (optional) efforts. We are different from other freelancing and tech sourcing marketplaces as: We save your time by not needing to go through 50+ profiles, websites, and portfolios. We shortlist 1–2 agencies for you which are the perfect fit for your needs.The race is not to the bottom because we do not work with unreliable freelancers and rather work only with teams who are lean, cutting edge, and have great credentials.We are only working with the top 200 odd teams at the moment so your project is always in the safe handsThe teams tend to be more cooperative and fast as we tend to blacklist those who are mediocre in their performance and client satisfactionSmall projects are given to newly enrolled teams to check out their performance rather than big projects.

The position of The Master: I know your desires better than you know your own desires; indeed, you do not know your own desires, since they are unconscious. I, however, am conscious of what is unconscious in you. This is perhaps what Steve Jobs meant when he said, notoriously: “Some people say, ‘Give the customers what they want.’ But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, ‘If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!’’ People don't know what they want until you show it to them.

Not necessarily, if you include New Orleans. Early jazz harmony was much simpler than what can be heard now, wasn’t it? I’d venture that outside of context (such as venue, player, or tune), a piece requires two things to be considered to be jazz, or to be influenced by jazz: syncopated rhythmthe use of dominant seventh chords as tonic chords. Now, I may be imprecise by including Blues as a subset of jazz: syncopation, tonic dominants, plus going to the IV 7 from the I. As for the technical difference between jazz and blues?

Here are some key elements to consider: Knowledge and Research: A solid understanding of the sport you're betting on is crucial. Stay updated on the teams or athletes, their recent form, injuries, head-to-head records, and any other relevant information. Researching statistics, trends, and historical data can help you make more informed decisions.Bankroll Management: Properly managing your betting bankroll is essential. Set aside a specific amount of money for betting and avoid wagering more than you can afford to lose. Establishing a staking plan and sticking to it helps control risk and avoid impulsive decisions.Strategy and Discipline: Develop a consistent and disciplined betting strategy. This could include focusing on specific markets, such as point spreads, over/under totals, or moneylines, and avoiding impulsive or emotional bets. Be patient, stick to your strategy, and avoid chasing losses.Value Betting: Look for bets that offer value. Value betting means identifying odds that are higher than the actual probability of an outcome occurring. This involves assessing the likelihood of an event happening and comparing it to the odds provided by bookmakers. Over time, consistently finding value bets can lead to long-term profitability.Line Shopping: Comparing odds across different bookmakers allows you to find the best possible value for a specific bet. Different sportsbooks may offer slightly different odds, so taking the time to shop around can make a significant difference to your overall profitability.Emotional Control: Avoid letting emotions dictate your betting decisions. Stay rational and objective, even after a series of wins or losses. Emotional betting often leads to impulsive and irrational choices, which can be detrimental to your success.Record Keeping and Analysis: Maintain a record of your bets, including the details of each wager and its outcome. Analyze your past performance to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This helps you learn from your experiences and make adjustments to your strategy over time. Remember, sports betting involves an element of chance, and no strategy guarantees success. It's important to approach sports betting with a realistic mindset, understanding that losses are possible. Responsible gambling practices, sound strategy, and continuous learning are key to maximizing your chances of long-term success."},{"instruction":"Why is it that Entergy in Louisiana is allowed to charge a storm restoration fee that adds up in the millions but there is no audit or public record of what the money is used for?","output":"They would rather keep doing that than put utilities under ground."},{"instruction":"Which is a better band: Iron Maiden or Judas Priest?","output":"I think Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden is a better front man only because his stage presence is such he is very energetic and moves around the stage throughout the whole concert.

I went from highschool, in to the Army at 6′ tall and 140 pounds.

If somebody gave me 118 million, I wouldn't sneer and say, That's not enough.","output":"The general rule of thumb is that a movie needs to make twice it’s budget to be considered a success. Now Hollywood accounting is notoriously shady. But generally speaking a movie that costs 275 million to make doesn’t ACTUALLY cost 275 million. For one thing that number doesn’t include the marketing. Commercials, print ads, publicity tours. All of that isn’t included in the budget. But it’s still an expense. Then there’s the fact that the producers of a movie don’t get all the revenue from the box office. After all, the movie theater has to make money somehow. Typically they get the highest percentage during the opening weekend, and a lower percentage later on. As well as a lower percentage of international tickets overall. Once you factor in the increased cost and the lowered profits, the movie very well could have cost Disney money. But even if the movie made money that doesn’t mean it made enough. Making movies is an investment. A risky investment. That means people expect a lot of return. At the moment the interest rate on government bonds is 1.5% (which is actually a bit low). This is about as safe an investment as you can make. So any other investment that doesn’t get you at least that much money is a failure. You took all that risk and ended up worse than if you’d taken the safest investment imaginable And that’s without getting into the initial cost of making Solo. Disney paid over 4 BILLION dollars for Star Wars. They had high expectations for the franchise. A net profit of 118 million, even if they actually saw that money, which they didn’t, is nowhere near enough to recoup the loss of getting the intellectual property."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"In today’s advanced world, smartphones are more attractive and simple to use for business professionals. it has converted the requirement of the advanced generation.

The point is that the Electoral College, like the US Senate, gives small population states a measure of voting clout that makes it more difficult for large population states like California or NY to dominate them.

Say for e.g. 'has never been or never has been', which is the correct one to use? Even after doing a google search for the same, you are unable to find the correct result then I have an ideal solution for your problem. This trick can let you discover the correct choice between some constructions you are confused about. You know we all have a psychological influence towards things that are already popular. And that influence is now gonna help you discover the right choice of sentence. All you have to do is, do a Google Search but a more Advanced one. Say, first you do a google search for \\"never has been\\" and search for 'Books' in the more option of the Google Search. Google Books( a service that searches the full text of books and magazines that Google has scanned), it will help you identify the usage of construction 'has never been' in all the scanned books and magazine. See the number of results that are displayed, in this case, '11,10,000 results' Then, input your second sentence which is creating the confusion, say \\"has never been\\" and click on the Books tab once again. See the number of results that are displayed, in this case, '21,60,000' results' Compare the results of both the sentences and bang on, you get the ideal one. Note: Don't just fully rely on it and use your common sense as well, do proper searches alongside and if you still could’t decide which one is correct. Then, this trick could be used as a last resort. Although, in the above-shown example, I am aware that ‘never’ can also precede the auxiliary and the main verb. So, in some case, this method might not be true as a sentence can be framed using either of the constructions but this trick can save your time to choose a most used option.

When you are helped by a doctor, you can trust that your stated concerns will be correctly addressed. that is why a treated condition is much safer than an untreated condition. Depression/anxiety left untreated can worsen - and no matter how you are feeling now, it can get worse. That is why you must ask and think about what options you have for relief.

I’m going to take a shot at it, even though I’m not really qualified. The computations of supersymmetric string theory are performed in a space of 10 dimensions. This is a consequence of “following the math” from certain premises. In other words the use of 10 dimensions didn’t start from any direct physical observation in the world. In the world of our everyday experience, there seem to be 3 dimensions of space plus the passage of time. So in order to make useful predictions about the world, string theorists need to somehow reconcile their 10-dimensional math with the 3+1 dimensions we experience. One way to do this is to hypothesize that 6 dimensions of space are tightly curled up, so tightly that we cannot observe their consequences. If you again “follow the math” seeking a transformation that will tightly curl six dimensions of a 10-dimensional space, you come up with a known mathematical structure called a Calabi-Yau Manifold. After this was discovered, the study of the mathematical objects became an important part of string theory. Now returning to your question, it seems to me that asking about “the same” C-Y manifold probably caused confusion to experts (which I’m not). It’s confusing because it’s not plural (“manifolds”). There are an enormous number of possible transformations from 10 dimensions to 3+1. I don’t know if the number is infinite (an example of my lack of expertise) or just enormously large. I think this is equivalent to saying there are an enormous number of C-Y manifolds. This enormous number is a key factor in the current inability of string theory to make accurate predictions about the world. String theorists need to find a transformation that leads to a 4-dimensional theory matching all the things we have already learned, particularly the data from particle accelerators. Finding that transformation is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Perhaps the largest haystack ever in human history. If you were just asking narrowly whether all of my statements above apply equally to all of the 5 supersymmetric string theories linked by M-theory, I’m afraid I do not know. I hope this helps."},{"instruction":"My mom says cigarette smoke can reprogram cells in your airways, causing COPD to hang on after smoking ends. I'm 16 and I smoke about 14 cigs a day so far.

It’s True that there is no job after Graduation in Forensic Science in any govt. Contractual job vacancy. So, it’s better to opt for Masters in F.S. And it’s very important to choose Good University or College(Govt. and Private) for your Post Graduation. As per Current Placement Record (2021) by National Forensic Science University has placed their students in Govt. (mainly in Delhi Police as Forensic Experts)as well as in Private Sector (PwC, Deloitte, TATA AIG, etc.). In future, they might expand and provide forensic experts to other state police as well. So, scope of Forensic science(Master and above Level only) in India is getting better day by day. If you want to pursue Masters in Forensic Science in private colleges then you must check previous placement record by the university and does the university has fully functional placement cell. Considering these points you can search for good career in Forensic science. Many Private Colleges have good placement cell division placing their student in big private companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst & Young (EY) and Bank of America, etc. Or as 3rd option you can pursue for UGC NET after you masters in Forensic Science only if you have interest in teaching.

There are very ignorant teachers who truly believe in gardner’s false belief we are in their words, “naturally good at some thing and not good in other areas”. Those ignorant teachers probably have no idea this was never science but simply an assertion by gardner many years ago, we simply evolved with different strengths and weaknesses which are more or less permanent in nature. Those ignorant teachers boosted also by very ignorant administrators who also believe in the false genetics models and in addition, are also most usually businessmen with absolutely no real care for education or students. As a result, over the years, the myth continues to be blindly accepted as dogma or false accepted as fact. They have also taken firm hold of galton’s belief of evolved abilities regarding “sheer effort” or as he stated, “succeed by ability and effort”. So those ignorant educators began doing all they could to work with that one variable, “effort”, again having no concept of attention spans; frustration tolerances; fatigue limits; improper pace and intensity before proper mental frames are established or need for proper dynamics, slowing down for newer mental work; understanding how our individual environments create many many different amount of maintained layers of average stress along with very different verbal/social vocabulary from their environments. Instead, they simply follow galton’s myth of simply “succeed by effort”, creating more time on task without sufficient breaks if any and attempting to not only get more effort but assigning much more difficult work than the students are prepared for. What they are really doing is simply working the students very hard and then separating those students who appear to meet their needs for achievement. Those students with sufficient support and care from home are then either put in what they call gifted classes or pulled out of their rooms, openly said to more advanced. As they reach fifth grade, they also given individual classes for each subject area, with higher and lower achievement standards. When they get to middle school, then begins the full separation of creating very average classes with lots more busy work, stereo typing treatment by teachers to fit their positions as just average, receiving more simplistic instruction, more patronization, and more authoritarianism. At that time those students fully recognized the handwriting on the wall: they have been assigned as failures by the school system with no avenue for any real change and improvement. Many just coast along while others become increasingly angry and frustrated. Many then turn to drug/alcohol abuse, even suicide as a result of the accumulated psychological suffering from teachers, parents, and peers for being labeled as such. So yes, the system hurts everyone to a degree by teaching permanence in ability, but for those labeled as average or below, it becomes a never ending torment. The whole idea of some fixed intelligence came from a time when darwin first brought his “belief” we all simply evolved over time to humans. then his half cousin galton brought out his “belief” we all evolved with different abilities. Those persons back then in 1800’s had absolutely no idea how very complex our minds truly are and how greatly they are affected by our individual environments. Sadly all of the people in society at that time were just as ignorant. Many in college: those in education; science areas; others, simply felt it was correct, with no science to back it up. This myth crept into our schools into society on the false pretense of science, probably because from an observer those with knowledge and skills appears to be be more set in place. Today the myth of genetically fixed abilities has become dogma or myth accepted as fact. Those in research probably in fear of peers rejecting them for espousing environmental variables and/or just so self-centered on themselves were and are content to simply keep this awful myth alive. The reason why those abilities appeared to be more fixed and from certain families was that those from more stable, knowledge rich, supportive families would have lower average stress, much more ease of learning, a much higher social vocabulary/communication skills from their families and peers, etc. At the same time the vast majority of persons were dwelling in areas with much less knowledge, support, care, skills, and many more continuous anxieties, fears, needs, etc. This taxed their mental, emotional, and physical energies much more, so they had to work much harder to receive the same mental reward and for those persons also, they would have to approach many academic areas as much more new mental work, so they were and are still not able to have the mental, emotional, physical energy to gain sufficient mental reward received for mental work expended and keep this up with enjoyment for years. The problem as back then and also now lies in two areas. 1. Those in education still do not realize our minds in its complexities are not just working on some present situations or work, they are also working on many other past, present, future -experiences, fears, anxieties, needs, preparation for defense along with many weights and values (many faulty) accumulated from youth regarding strength, power, status, image, force, hard work, etc. which their minds keep in gear and accumulates in harm or higher average layers over time. These layers take up real mental energy, hurting thinking, learning, motivation, and mental health. At the same time, those from more stable, supportive environments with lots support and knowledge have much lower layers of average stress, more ease of learning, and so much more enjoyable learning or long-term motivation for learning. 2. Also there is a second variable/tool those in science either through intent or blind ignorance are not showing everyone. The myth by galton and others “simply succeed by ability and effort” or in this case effort, has created the awful myth that those who are not succeeding are simply not able or not trying hard enough or effort. This is very false. You see in those more stable environments, those students have much lower average stress and much more ease. When they approach a newer mental work, they are bringing with them much more knowledge and skills *and ease to that new mental work. With this ease they are more naturally able to slow down for that newer mental work and also have more previous knowledge and skills to latch onto that newer mental work. This creates a more proper dynamics of slowing down for newer mental work and then as they gain more knowledge in that area, their pace will pick up and gain more knowledge faster, with even more enjoyment and motivation. Those those students from more harsh environments or less than stable/knowledge rich environments will have far more layers of average stress of some many needs and anxieties which will feed much more so into their pace and intensity in approaching that newer mental work, *raising much more so their already, higher average stress hurting more so their thinking, learning, motivation, etc. Sadly usually there is also much more newer mental work thus causing more mental work and more improper pace. This creates much much less mental reward for mental work expended, thus hurting their thinking and learning much more so. So here we can see just how our individual environments, not genetics are greatly affecting our thinking, learning, motivation, and mental health over time. I see our subconscious as an extra mental work bank to deal with information our mind is working on subconsciously. I see our subconscious as working on many layers of mental work just below our consciousness. I don’t see it as having power, but something which may take up much wasted mental energy leaving less mental energy for performing more conscious thinking, learning, motivation, and mental health. I see it as like in baseball “a kind of on deck things that our minds are working on subconsciously, while we are consciously working on what we may consider more important. The higher those layers of subconscious work, the less mental energy we will have for our conscious thinking, learning, motivation, and mental health. This our real average stress and takes up much, in many cases, much wasted mental energy or work on things we can slowly learn to resolve and remove. This is why our individual environments greatly affect our thinking, learning, motivation, and mental health, not genetics. I see our unconscious mind as much dormant memories which will be awakened at times by some stimulus or “things in our immediate environment: music, places, sounds, etc. which may be connected to some more dormant memories. These would then be awakened and sent to our subconscious or conscious mind if needed there. Our unconscious mind may also contain memories which have too much mental work to be allowed into our subconscious or consciousness (like repressed memories) perhaps as an automatic protection part of our mind. I am pasting the first few pages of my learning theory below. I hope my learning theory will release students and adults from the very harmful, false teachings of genetic permanence in ability being taught to our students from a young age. This teaching did not come from science but from a mere false assertion of evolutionary development. This teaching in school and society is creating love and honor for those who appear to measure up in some way and more isolation and lack of care for those who appear not to measure up. It is creating much false feelings of anxiety and hopelessness along with many deaths from drug/alcohol abuse, suicide, and now mass violence with suicidal intent. Yes, our schools are creating this problem by teaching permanence in ability. We can help all students and adults by redefining our average stress in a more complex – but a much better, more effective way. The present belief that stress “only occurs” during some immediate mental, emotional, and/or physical work and the misconception of stress occurring for both old and new mental work has greatly clouded our understanding of average stress. Whether by intent or ignorance, these beliefs have allowed the false belief of genetics in ability to flourish from the time of galton, later gardner. We must remove this false teaching from our schools and begin providing tools to help students continually change and improve their lives. My learning theory shows how our individual environments, not genetics are greatly affecting our lives and how we can approach our lives more delicately/thoughtfully to continually change and improve our lives. My learning theory redefines our average stress as “many maintained layers of mental work which take up real mental energy from many past, present, future - experiences, needs, unresolved conflicts along with (many improper) weights and values developed from a young age which may act as continual magnets for more accumulating layers, leaving less mental energy for new mental work” far beyond some immediate situational stress. The remaining area of mental energy is what is left for new learning and also, according to the figure (page 4), our leftover length of reflection time or time for more complex, longer-term thinking. This has applications for learning, motivation; reflection time; early failure in school; psychological suffering from high maintained layers; and many escapes from over-eating to drug/alcohol abuse/suicide, and suicide with violence. It also explains the growing male crisis where boys even in middle class homes are falling behind their female peers collectively due to more harsh less supportive treatment from infancy. By teaching permanence in ability we are killing many students and adults. This represents an important change in our understanding of how our individual environments greatly affect our thinking, learning, motivation, and mental health. This also shows how layers of average stress “can be more permanently reduced to continually improve our lives and abilities”. My learning theory also provides two large tools we can use to help parents, teachers, and students continually change and improve their lives. My learning theory is for all to read. I will also send my complete theory with many applications to all on request and answer any questions regarding my paper. I hope we can help many students and adults have much more hope, esteem, and tools to continually improve their lives. We can Remove the Myth of Genetics in Ability We have something wonderful we have not researched and which could help many students and adults. Due to our current, false, dogma of genetics in ability and grossly, incorrect definition of average stress, researchers, teachers, and administrators are not looking into a wonderful way to provide hope for continual change and improvement for many students and adults. This involves a much more correct definition of average stress, not just as some situational stress or work, but also many maintained layers of mental work which take up real mental energy. Try to visualize an upright rectangle, representing our full mental energy. Then begin at the bottom, drawing in narrowly spaced, horizontal lines (really innumerable) to represent many layers of mental work from many past, present, future - experiences, fears, circumstances, needs, anxieties along with “many weights and values many of which may be faulty we may have developed from a young age wrongly valuing power, status, image, preparation for defense, self-worth through defense and which will act as magnets for other accumulating layers of mental frictions which take up real energy. The space leftover shows our “leftover mental energy for learning new mental work”. This shows us just how “our own” individual environments, not genetics, greatly affect our thinking, learning, motivation (mental reward for mental work expended), reflection time, and our mental/emotional health. This theory (which can be researched), affects all persons and provides tools we can all use to continually change and improve our lives. This represents a very new and very important change from our current, very improper definition of average stress, which only shows stress as some immediate work, need, or problem. The false genetics models in regard to learning have completely sidetracked everyone into a very vague and useless definition of average stress. When we approach a new mental work or have a situational event there is an increase in layers along with improper pace and intensity in approaching that new mental work or situation, but this new mental work “goes on top of our already present layers of mental work which represent a much larger overall total of our maintained layers of mental work. Try to see the upright rectangle again and think of how a situational stress would go on top of our already present layers of mental work. I have drawn a Figure on page 4 to show how layers of “maintained mental work” accumulate; take up real mental energy from all of us; and hurt our overall thinking, learning, motivation, reflection time, and our mental health. This very important, new definition of average stress affects all persons in all areas of society to some degree. The very good news for all of us is “we are not just naturally good at this and bad at that”. That very false and deadly myth has killed many students and adults for many years. It has also created many needless anxieties and feelings of hopelessness for millions of students today. We are literally creating needless anxiety and much hopelessness in our schools by teaching the myth of genetics in ability to our students and adults. This in turn is creating many escapes, from overeating and over shopping to drug/alcohol abuse, violence, and suicide, some with mass violence involved. We can all learn how to more permanently reduce layers of mental work to “continually and more permanently” reduce our layers to continually change and improve our abilities and our lives over time. It is long past time for removing this deadly myth of genetic permanence in ability from our schools. This is the first cognitive tool for lowering our average layers Many Persons with high layers of mental frictions will have to work harder to receive the same mental reward for mental work expended. Ask yourself, which makes more sense, are we just genetically more or less able, or do our individual environments greatly affect our ability to think, learn, and develop skills. For our own good, we need to recognize how our individual environments greatly affect ability and how we can more permanently reduce mental frictions to continually improve thinking, learning, and mental/emotional health. This tool provides a way to permanently reduce layers of mental frictions. To permanently reduce our mental layers of average stress, we need to do more than just solve a problem or unresolved mental work creating a mental friction. We need to look at the elements in our lives that create those subconscious, mental frictions or average layers and the many weights and values that may be creating many of those frictions or average layers. Then, we can slowly begin to understand a little more each day how the elements of our lives are creating mental frictions as they come up. Then with a small change or slight tweaking in a weight or value we are placing on something in our lives and developing an improved mental principle or rule in a certain area of our life, we can then resolve and more permanently remove that layer and like layers of mental frictions. This involves a more complex understanding of average stress and how it greatly affects our lives in various small and large ways. By slowly understanding how layers of mental frictions are created, we can learn to approach those elements in our lives more correctly to keep like mental frictions from occurring in the future. This enables “all of us” to more permanently reduce layers of mental frictions that hurt our ability to think and learn. Savants, or a very small segment of persons with autism, are able to perform mathematical or musical feats because theoretically, the mind is dysfunctional in many areas and is delivering extra mental energy to other rare, whole areas like math or music that in rare instances, have been left undamaged. Since we as so-called, normal human beings are affected adversely by many layers of mental frictions in other areas of the mind which function normally, our abilities in those areas are impeded by our mental energy being more taxed, thus limiting our abilities in those areas. This shows how mental energy can be distributed and also taken up by many other layers of average stress in a person, thus limiting ability due to their “maintained average layers of mental work”. With each more permanently removed layer of mental friction we will continually improve thinking, learning, and extend reflection time (think more deeply, with more complexity, and more correctly). Remember, to more permanently reduce layers of mental frictions we need to change or at least tweak the principle or value that created that mental friction, “not just solve that problem” to prevent similar mental frictions from occurring. This involves tools for all students and adults to use at all ages when they are able to understand this vital cognitive tool for long-term change and improvement in their lives. I personally use various mental cues that signal me when I need to make an adjustment to reduce some layer of unresolved mental work or average stress. When I feel even slight areas of anger, fear, anxiety, and any feeling of force, power, or improper pace when approaching a new mental work, those feelings are serving as notice to me that I am not applying a correct principle or I need to revise and make a small change in some (my own perceived) weights or values I am placing on something. Then by making a small change or understanding and applying more correctly a principle I already have, I can then continually hone my principles to maintain lower average stress or lower layers of mental work. I have also learned years ago to try to understand why I view persons, things, actions, values, and various other areas in society as I do. I know if I do not look independently myself, I can then become blind to the possible negative effects of using those faulty values on my life. I feel all of us can fall victim to more blindly following the values of those around us, regardless of the potential for creating more needless, unresolved conflicts for us later. Important: when I talk about removing layers related to anger, fear, anxiety, force, or power, I am not talking about retreating from growing or competing. On the contrary, I am talking about understanding how truly smart, intelligent persons grow over time. Yes those persons living all of their lives in much more stable, supportive, secure environments with much more mental, emotional, academic input will have a huge advantage along with naturally having much less anger, fear, and anxiety from those more secure environments. This provides those few persons with much lower layers of average stress. The truly intelligent persons are not that smart, they just able to accumulate more knowledge, more easily from a younger age with “less effort” due to lower layers and much raw material of support from a young age. They don’t try that hard, they are just able to “enjoy the process with lower layers. What the rest of us need to do is to slowly reduce many needless layers of mental frictions or average stress, so we can approximate the stability those few persons enjoy. Then we can slowly change, improve, and grow just as well as anyone – and understand that we are “all very equal” but come from many very different, complex environments which create many different outcomes over time. We can all, now become newer and better each day, fully understanding there was never anything wrong with us in the first place. You “cannot” use physical exercise, relaxation, or mediation to more permanently reduce average stress. It does not work. When you use physical exercise, you are temporarily removing the energy dealing with mental work and sending it to perform a more physical task. Then when your body recovers, that energy is then re-fed back to your average stress, so nothing is accomplished. When you use Relaxation in an attempt to reach greater ease or use forms of meditation to alter your state of consciousness, you are only temporarily removing the mental energy to your mind. Then when you attempt a new mental work, that energy is then re-fed back to your average layers or average stress you were dealing with in the first place. It is kind of like turning off the faucet to a multi-prong hose or “layers of mental frictions”. This works good as long as the faucet is turned off. However, when you attempt a new mental work, it is like turning the faucet back on. Your mental energy is then re-fed not just to that one mental work but to all of the others also. As a result, nothing is accomplished from physical exercise, relaxation, or meditation. It is time for all of us to begin using cognitive tools to improve thinking, learning, motivation, and mental health for all of us. If we are honest hearted and really care about our students, friends, and others who are close to us, we will not allow the long-developed egos; falsely feeling superior; simply wrongly feeling we have just worked harder to keep us from creating tools of hope for others we care about or should be caring about. If we are professionals who work with others to help others, we should definitely be willing to remove any stumbling blocks of ego and false feelings of superiority to help those we as professionals are supposed to be striving to help. If on the other hand, we are business persons who have grown up more isolated from the hardships of others and/or have been modeled, taught, and benefited from the myth of genetic permanence in ability through much better support, then it will be much harder for those persons to break free from those false teachings to help others, even though they may be in a position which calls for them to care for those other persons. Sadly much of education today is filled with many many business persons and persons from nice, middle class environments who care little or nothing about helping to improve the lives of others perfectly content to espouse their egos and simply broad information from the front of the room with no understanding or care creating change in students. Situational stress and new mental work do occur on top of our already present layers When we have a situational stress: This occurs on top of our already present, layers of mental work or average layers. Situational stress is composed of multiple, new mental work and also a mentally rushed time frame, which amplifies that new mental work. This temporarily raises significantly, our layers of average stress on top of our already present layers. This makes situational stress much more hazardous for persons with high layers of average stress. This can greatly shorten thought processing and reflection time. A shorter reflection time and psychological suffering can lead to many harmful escapes that would not occur had there been lower layers of mental frictions before that situational stress occurred. By more permanently lowering layers of mental frictions, we can prevent many deadly forms of escape and increase our reflection time or time taken think with more complexity, plan, and make decisions. As for psychological suffering and escapes: as a person accumulates “high” layers of mental frictions, he begins to experience two bad things at once; he experiences psychological suffering and his reflection time shortens - His desires, goals, enjoyments, and methods of problem solving become more simplistic, short-term, and less thought-out. The psychological suffering and much shorter reflection time create a powerful need for relief. This condition makes drug/alcohol abuse, the catharsis of violence, and suicide more appealing in view of the immediate, temporary reward or release from layers of mental frictions such escapes provide. By helping students and adults maintain lower layers of mental frictions, we can help prevent this psychological suffering. This skill can be more enhanced with training. To simply say a person is mentally ill will do nothing to help that person or help prevent another person experiencing higher layers of average stress from escaping in a like manner. We need to understand we are all very human and those escapes are not mental health dysfunction but real psychological suffering any of us may fall victim to with high, maintained layers of mental work. Also remember this includes mostly many past, present, future – experiences, fears, anxieties along with *faulty weights and values which may be acting as strong magnets for many other accumulating layers of mental conflicts or average stress. This is the problem with our false, genetic models; they offer no real insight or hope for changing and improving our lives. In today’s technological world, this is even more critical as there are many persons we are in contact with who may be experiencing just such psychological suffering and who may have access to and have planned from prolonged psychological suffering a major, violent catharsis or event against society. By teaching this skill of more permanently lowering our average layers or average stress, we will greatly improve better and deeper thinking and reflection time for students and adults to develop and accumulate more complex information age skills over time. Teaching this skill is also extremely important for creating intrinsic reward in students needed to stimulate more independent learning by students outside the classroom, namely homework from more intrinsic reward. We cannot teach students all they need to know inside the classroom. Again, we need to provide these tools for students to accumulate from both home and the classroom all of the necessary knowledge and skills they need to compete in the information age. By teaching this skill we can also reduce the psychological suffering that leads to many harmful escapes. Too bad this wonderful technique is not being used in our schools today. I feel average stress rises much higher for students/adults in lower socioeconomic areas. The lower the socioeconomic environment and time in those environments create many more continuous, real fears, anxieties, and hardships which create continuous, higher average layers for those students. This also hurts students where the shared “real” anxieties, fears, and needs in a family will be increased through the osmosis of shared and modeled emotions. This forces those students to work two or three times as hard to receive the same mental reward for mental work expended. There is also much less knowledge/skills/support in those areas which make thinking, planning, and decision making more short-term due to a much small knowledge/skill base and the much higher layers over time which have created more simplistic thinking in dealing with life. The much higher layers of needs and anxieties along with less knowledge have usually created a firm, learned helplessness from longer-term thinking and little development of more complex skills requiring mental energy, time, and support in developing in maintaining those skills, not to mention the need to continue the process over time. This makes it extremely difficult for those persons to rise above from their current thinking. Durn it, yes sadly, the myth of genetics hurts those students and families even more, for those students come home from school with the only help their Middle class teachers have learned from their more middle class environments, just to work harder and try harder in school (from galton), not realizing those less supported students need tools to change and improve. Another unseen problem for persons with higher average layers is having an accompanied higher muscle tension which will create much less fine motor coordination and related skills to writing, keyboard activity, and other fine motor skills necessary in the information age. This is affecting many many boys/men today and a few girls/women as many boys/men and a few girls/women are given much aggressive treatment, much less support, and much more anxiety, creating much higher average stress and higher muscle tension hurting much more their fine motor skills. No, boys do not have developmental delays in fine motor skills. The much more aggressive treatment creates higher muscle tension, creating poor fine motor skills. Some may point out how some students from poor environments do manage to “work” their way up and out of those areas. This does occur, but we need to see many of those advances as coming from newer poor: from families who have drifted in to lower areas with support from more stable families. Also since poor and thinking in lower areas falls on a continuum, there are families who will develop ideas, principles and longer-term values over time. This will create more stability, care, and nurturing in those homes which will create more accumulated knowledge, skills, and lower average stress. At some point, their sons and daughters (mostly daughters from better treatment in general) will rise up sufficiently to gain higher skills and finally go on to college and move up into a more secure, middle-class. So this is not genetics at work but slow, accumulating social acquisition of knowledge, skills, and care over time. Second tool: The myth of hard work is beneficial only when performing old work (skills already mastered), not in performing new mental work (skills in process of being learned). There are misguided beliefs regarding mental learning when they attempt to compare mental learning with physical work. As a result, we have false sayings such as “Just believe you can do it\\" or \\"put your mind to it\\" and you will succeed. These phrases sound good but still follow the false, harmful teachings of fixed intelligences from galton and gardner, “succeed by ability and effort”. The false idea persons are just naturally quicker or more intelligent is just a way to justify less conscience for others who are not doing well; not well supported; more put upon by their individual environments; and have long-since stagnated due the learned helplessness such conditions create. The attitude of hard work when performing a new mental work actually impedes learning and long-term motivation or desire to acquire more knowledge and skills. As our pace and intensity in approaching mental work exceeds our immediate knowledge and experience, we create much greater mental friction and further impede our ability to think and learn. We also corrupt to some degree the thinking, learning, performance we are trying to master at that time. When we exceed our present mental frames or – previous knowledge and skills in an area we are trying to force more information on those mental frames before a logical understanding or connection is established. This creates much mental tension, further hurting our learning along with both short and long-term motivation in mental areas for students by reducing mental reward received for mental work expended. This also shortens our length of reflection time (ability to think more deeply). I feel at least 25 percent of our average stress is created from improper pace and intensity when approaching a new mental work such as academics. When approaching mental work, situations, or academics we should begin slowly even if just reflecting on the information we have. This will create a small base area of knowledge or mental frame with notches to add more information. As we slowly add more information, our base area of knowledge will increase naturally and the number of notches to add more information will multiply, thus naturally expanding our pace and intensity of learning. If we applied our present myth regarding mental work and applied a lot of mental energy, we would waste energy trying to place a lot of information onto just a few notches. In this way, we can see how incorrect pace and intensity kills both short and long-term motivation in mental areas. By trying too hard, we are overwhelming our minds with information before understanding and usefulness is established. This is another reason why the myth of permanence in ability and its false belief in learning continues, because only slight improvement occurs with hard work. High layers of mental frictions also “cause” students to approach mental work in an incorrect way or try too hard. If we were to have a point of perfect stability then the dynamics of approaching mental work (academics) would be approached in a more dynamic way: the child will more naturally approach new mental work more slowly at first. As a person gains knowledge and skills in an area, his pace and intensity will increase naturally with equal enjoyment of learning. Again, in lower socioeconomic environments and time in those environments there will be both much higher layers of average stress and much more, improper pace and intensity applied from the natural funneling of higher average stress in their present approach of a situation. With higher layers of mental friction and less stability, the added instability disrupts or causes the child use the energy from the mental frictions in his life or try too hard or apply too much effort. In this way, any higher average stress will funnel improperly into a person’s pace and intensity in approaching a newer mental work. This may raise that student’s higher average stress much higher and impede more so their learning and motivation to learn. This hurts boys much more so due the myth of hard work and the tough commands given boys to just work harder, which forces them to try way too hard and learn improperly. Many children need to be taught the dynamics of approaching new things more slowly at first to help offset the tendency of trying too hard or applying too much effort. This hurts motivation or mental reward received for mental work expended. Both high layers of mental frictions and improper pace and intensity accumulate over years to create large deficits in learning for many students and adults. Approaching mental work correctly is important for students to learn and enjoy learning new knowledge and academics to maintain long-term motivation. The little girl said \\"This goes here and that goes there.\\" had the right idea. In time, she will know where this and that goes and will learn more advanced skills with equal enjoyment. In the physical world, we may work hard; in the mental world we need to work easy. The proper dynamics of approaching all mental work correctly affects every aspect of our lives. We can begin modeling and later teaching the proper dynamics of approaching newer mental work to students from kindergarten through high school. We need to take the time to reflect: Reflection is very important for thinking, learning, motivation to learn, and visualization of things. This means we need to not just slow down for newer mental work, but we also need to take the time to extend our minds when we are entertaining new areas of thought, problems, material, etc. This then allows our minds to see much more connecting areas with more insight, more complexity, more understanding, develop a much deeper, possibly even new understandings, and so, a much more sustained and quality memory of that new mental work material, etc. Again, this is definitely “not about retreating from competing” it is about learning how those seemingly more intelligent or smarter students/adults really learn. Those smarter students have, from a young age, slowly began seeing and learning new mental work which from having more ease of learning enjoyed the process and accumulated from longer refection (slower pace), more visualized understanding. From this better, more visualized understanding they are then able to add to that knowledge or skill area a little faster over time due to having a better understanding. Note the lower average stress, much more support, and proper, more enjoyable pace creates much more intrinsic reward, so they enjoy academic/mental work more so. This grows in time and their learning, their pace increases over time, so they “simply appear to be smarter and appear to work harder when in fact, they are simply operating with much more accumulated skills and also more accumulated experience in approaching newer mental work; mind you, this could never be accomplished without having lower layers of mental work; much raw material of support from a young age; and a nice slowing down or proper dynamics of approaching newer mental work. Today in schools, the myth of genetics is still very strong; however, they are using a new idea from the false belief regarding effort. They are attempting to create a more demanding coursework along with much more computer programs in an attempt (very faulty) to get those students to progress more quickly in knowledge and skills. However, the much more heavy coursework is being given almost completely without proper prior knowledge and support. Only those very few students with sufficient support, knowledge, and skills from home will be able to keep up. I am finding such as the ability to read and write properly is being completely ignored in exchange for simply providing one or two word answers for questions usually on computers. They are being asked to either read pages or worse, just listening to someone read once, and then afterwards write on that material with depth. Note in some cases, the students are only in the third grade and have virtually no reading or writing skills to accomplish those assignments. I can kind of see where they are trying to create computer skills to fill notches for companies who simply require form and function. But through this improper, heavily burdened, and over fast pace, we are killing off motivation to learn/independent learning or love of learning; creating more burnout, more stagnant students, more feelings of hopelessness; more lagging of students from other more supported students; more hatred of school; and much lower esteem for those students. Also, with the emphasis on strength, power, and simply trying hard, we are creating much more escapism into the physical/strength areas as compensation along with much more early rebellion and power conflicts with teachers/others, even as early as first grade and rapidly increasing with each grade after that. I fear our present, very uneducated administrators who are bent on simply requiring more stringent work, much less true knowledge/skills reflection time, and much more power/authoritarian based teaching are going to create much more escapism and great violence with suicidal intent along with very little hope, esteem, and self-worth. We must change from this present, harmful path. True academic knowledge and skills accumulate over time through intrinsic reward and enjoying the long-term process of learning. This long-term learning requires stability, knowledge, and support from others to maintain that learning and motivation. As persons gain knowledge and skills in certain areas and less weighed down by other worries, their skills improve, and their speed increases. Low average stress “layers” and proper pace and intensity allows much more free energy for thinking, reflection, and bringing together complex knowledge and skills over time. However, be certain it is not magic or genetics but simply long-term “intrinsic reward” or love of learning which creates improved skills and confidence over time. Remember this: the presentation of money, power, status, image, or power is “all superficial” and has nothing to do with those I know of who are truly intelligent and love learning. Many learned later how to change and slowly increased their learning, love of learning, and accumulation of knowledge and skills to be as confident and understanding as anyone. They have learned that those shallow things people present really stem from insecurity, fear, ego, and other vain things which take up much needless energy, so such ones are really hurting themselves from such thoughts and behavior. Those who understand and use my learning theory see the vanity and waste of such behaviors. They also recognize how we are all so very equal and greatly affected by our individual environments over time. So instead of thinking more of themselves, they are instead, much more down to earth and have much full respect for everyone in view of those many environmental influences and “not genetics or effort”. Hopefully my theory will provide a means to achieve some of this need even when lacking at home and not in that person’s individual environment. By lowering layers of mental frictions and changing pace and intensity in approaching newer mental work, we will increase motivation to learn and develop more complex mental/emotional/social skills over time. These tools will create the mental reward received for mental work expended or long-term motivation, intrinsic reward, and love of learning that are vital to being a life-long student. This makes a student better able to compete in the information age. Students who begin this process late in life will still lag behind their peers in knowledge, confidence, and experience in certain areas. However, using these principles, students and adults can begin to catch up and even go ahead of their peers. After correcting my speech impediment, I did this. We need to show students how to understand their environments as affecting their lives, not some false, genetic weakness, so they will see more confidently how to set their mental, emotional, and academic growth line in a more gentle slope to allow more time to “recover and develop the skills they need over a longer period of time”. I find it hurtful when persons in media reflect their more supported, stable environment along with various knowledge and skills they have received from a young age upon others. Those persons then admonish students and adults to simply turn off the video games, try hard, and make good grades. While this may create a positive, emotional atmosphere at the moment, such motivations are short-lived and cannot be maintained by the average person over the long-term. Those kids are desperately searching for a love, honor, and respect from society (essentials of self-worth) through those efforts yet have no understanding of the long-term support that is required. Society appears hell bent on its lack of understanding of learning and motivation and is leading its children down a hopeless path. We need for role models to acknowledge the support and care they have been given over the years that enabled them to rise and accomplish what they have accomplished. You see the genetic model of “succeed by ability and effort” taught in school and the media are creating hopelessness in our children and in turn, many harmful escapes and needless suicides. Telling students to work harder when they have high mental frictions will only lead to more frustration. Those students will still have to work harder than their peers to receive the same mental rewards. The lower mental frictions must come first. The teacher can then push such students only according to the mental reward and confidence they are receiving for mental work expended. If a teacher tries to build up his students' esteem without giving them tools to improve their lives, the teacher may do more harm by fostering more short-term escapes to maintain that esteem. This information is important. Few of us are able to rest our security/inner-security upon money, power, or status. There isn't enough to go around. We must teach students our innersecurity is more important. This is accomplished by showing students how our individual environments greatly our affect ability to think and learn and providing tools students can use to continually improve their lives. This will provide students with more inner-security and tools to continually improve their lives. This will also release students and adults from the present very false and very harmful, even deadly weight of the myth of genetics or fixed abilities. Peer pressure is created by the myth of genetic ability. If a student feels inferior in one or more areas, he will be more reliant on peers for support, love, honor, affection, protection, etc., and even feel it necessary to gain some knowledge they may feel must have and feel more helpless in themselves. They will also be more in fear of rejection and thus losing those things. This creates peer pressure. By showing students how they are all very equal and how their individual environments greatly affect their ability to think, learn, long-term motivation to learn, and grow mentally and emotionally, students will have much more respect and esteem for themselves and for others. By providing students with tools to approach their lives more delicately and differently to continually change and improve their lives, students will have a continuous hope of developing in time, many if not all of the qualities they admire in others over time. Students will then have a continuous hope of changing and becoming newer and better persons with each passing day. This will reduce much hopelessness, many harmful escapes, and many other problems created by the terrible teachings of fixed intelligences in school such as dropouts, drug/alcohol abuse, catharsis of violence, and suicide. This will lower peer pressure by making students less reliant on peers for support and remove the fear of rejection. Although rejection may continue, a person will not fear it. The myth of permanence in ability is the force behind class distinctions. Students falsely believing they fall into their positions through genetic abilities or order, are driving themselves to obtain various forms of achievement, money, power, status, image, and popularity to symbolize their place in that mythical order of permanence or class. Yes, those who feel they cannot achieve will attempt to impress others they are able to achieve. Since society values worldly or material success over other qualities, students and adults today are attempting to use various outward displays of greater money, power, status, image, and popularity to at least give the impression they are in a certain class. They use class distinctions to help symbolize their place as different and separate from those they feel are inferior or wish to line up more with those they admire. Many people, both students and adults devote their lives to the false god of permanence in ability through class distinctions. By showing students how our individual environments do greatly affect our ability to think and learn, we will remove once and for all, the fire from this mythical dragon of permanence and the class distinctions it causes. This will create greater esteem, respect, and hope for everyone. We must understand the old belief “boys/men should be strong and its very aggressive, less supportive treatment by parents, teachers, and society is causing us to lose boys and men in the information age. We are losing generations of boys, later men potential and creating much more drug/alcohol abuse, suicide, and violence. I fear this will grow out of control unless we take immediate action to provide much of the same, kind, stable, *verbal interaction, and mental/emotional supports we as girls are receiving from infancy through adulthood. We must end this differential treatment in the information age if we wish for boys and men to compete equally with girls and women. We Are Losing Whole Generations of Boys/Men Due to More Harsh Treatment – Male Crisis We must understand the old belief “boys/men should be strong and its very aggressive, less supportive treatment by parents, teachers, and society is causing us to lose many boys and men in the information age. We are losing generations of boys, later men and creating much more drug/alcohol abuse, suicide, and violence. I fear this will grow out of control unless we take immediate action to provide much of the same, kind, stable, *verbal interaction, and mental/emotional supports we as girls are receiving from infancy through adulthood. We must end this differential treatment in the information age if we wish for boys and men to compete equally with girls and women. My complete learning theory with many applications will go to all on request. The Male Crisis is growing due to much differential treatment from infancy. We need to remove our genetic models and see how differential treatment from infancy is creating the Male Crisis. The genetics models greatly favor individuals in higher socioeconomic environments who then falsely justify the plight of less affluent persons as not as intelligent or simply not working hard enough. They do not say how Female students in their areas are doing better collectively than their Male peers from their same socioeconomic environments. The myth of genetics and sheer effort is greatly hurting students in lower socioeconomic areas who have also been told the myth of genetics and hard work. They are totally ignoring how individual environments greatly affect their thinking, learning, motivation, reflection time, and their mental health. I have developed a learning theory that shows average stress in a much more correct way. This shows our average stress as made up of many maintained, unresolved layers of past, present, future - experiences, circumstances, needs, fears, preparation for defense along with many weights and values we have developed over time that may act as magnets for other accumulating layers of mental work or conflicts over time. This shows average stress as more complex and is maintained by our minds as many unresolved mental conflicts. Each of those layers take up real mental energy, which leaves us with less mental energy for thinking, learning, motivation, shortens our reflection time and hurts our mental health. This shows us just how our individual environments and differential treatment “not genetics” greatly affect our abilities over time. This begins in infancy. The good news is along with this article, I have developed a learning theory, which provides children and adults with tools to continually change and improve their lives over time. My learning theory will go to all on request by e-mail (top). Without such tools, it requires long-term stability and a nurturing of knowledge and skills to be successful. Higher average layers and much less support create a much harder road to travel. My theory helps us understand and more permanently reduce those layers of mental work to make it easier to think, learn, and extend reflection time (higher average stress shortens reflection time). We need to look at much differential treatment of boys and girls beginning from infancy through adulthood. It is amazing to me that such differential treatment has not been looked at by the researchers. I imagine there are two reasons: 1. The false belief in genetics has blinded the researchers to the great social, environmental causes of learning and motivation in academics. 2. There is the present, very improper view of average stress, which sees stress only as occurring from some immediate situation, event, or work. We need to see how our average stress is made up of many layers of past, present, future layers. We can see this by drawing an upright rectangle representing our full mental energy, then drawing in from the bottom and upward, many (innumerable) layers of unresolved mental work, all of us are acclimated to – to some degree – and also places all of us at some environmental disadvantage from others. So all of us suffer from some amount or layers of maintained, unresolved mental work from many past, present, future – experiences, fear, needs, anxieties along with many faulty weights and values of strength, power, status image, etc., which limits our leftover mental energy for thinking, learning, reflection time, and mental health. As we can see the problem involving differential treatment and learning is much more complex than school curriculum or boy chemistry. We need to stop looking at where boys are in life, character, and behavior and begin seeing how boys are treated, very differently from us as girls, from infancy by parents, teachers, peers, and society all to make them tough. This is creating the activity, less maturity, more learning problems, and more fear and dislike for authority figures. The belief boys should be strong allows more aggressive treatment as early as one year of age, designed to create more layers of anger, fear, and tension, so they will be prepared to fight, defend, and be tough. This is coupled with “much less” kind, stable, (very little kind verbal interaction) and much less mental/emotional support, knowledge, and skills for fear of coddling. It is this more aggressive, less supportive treatment, which creates the toughness or extra maintained layers of average stress: anger, fear, preparation for defense, anxiety, etc. These layers remain in the mind and take away real mental energy from academics, so those boys will have to work two or three times as hard to receive the same mental reward for mental work expended. This aggressive, less supportive treatment along with less verbal interaction creates more social/emotional distance/distrust of others – parents, teachers, peers, and others in society. It creates much less social vocabulary, knowledge of syntax and other communication we as girls are given on a continual basis from infancy. I feel this much less interaction also deprives boys, later men of many more areas of knowledge and skills girls are given through much more continual interaction and support/communication from everyone. Worse, this more aggressive and less supportive treatment leads to even more, sustained weights and values of more distance and even less social development over time while girls, later women who are given much kind, caring, verbal interaction/support continue are able to develop and use more and more social vocabulary and much more knowledge over time. From this treatment, I feel boys effectively understand about a third of the communication they have with parents, teachers, and other adults. The higher average stress creates more activity for stress relief (not genetics environmentally created). The total effect including less care and support creates much more failure and a feeling of hopelessness, especially with our false genetic models firmly in place. Also to make it even tougher for boys is the granting of love and honor (feelings of self-worth) only on condition of achievement, status, or image. This was designed to keep Male esteem and feelings of self-worth low to keep them striving and be willing to give their lives in war for small measures of love and honor from society. Males not achieving in school or other areas are given more ridicule and discipline to make them try harder. Support is not given boys for fear of coddling and the false genetic models. Many boys (as you would expect) thus falling behind in school then turn their attention to sports and video games to gleam small measures of love and honor not received in the classroom. The belief boys should be strong and the false belief in genetics creates a blatant mental denial of the differential treatment, which is creating the lower academics, low esteem, and other problems many boys are facing today. So strong is the belief boys should be strong there is an almost emotional cannibalism allowed upon boys and men who appear weak in some way by society: parents, teachers, others, even from many girls and women, especially in the media. Note, this is not about showing feelings or openness from boys and men, it is about support, care, and respect for boys even when appearing weak in some way. Remember aggressive treatment is increased for any sign of weakness and so boys have much wariness for parents and teachers who feel it necessary and are more freely allowed to use more aggressiveness for any sign of weakness or vulnerability. This is condoned by many in society today. As for reading, we need high social vocabulary, much social/verbal interaction experience with sentence structure and “lower average stress” to perform and enjoy the abstract skills of reading: decoding, visualizing, organizing, reaching into their social vocabulary/knowledge of words to learn new words in print, and enjoy the process. Boys are deprived in these areas due to much less care, verbal interaction, and much more aggressive treatment. As for writing, we also need much social vocabulary to understand, plan, and to put words into print. We also need lower average stress to create more ease of writing. The higher average stress creates significant higher muscle tension, which then creates a much tighter grip and more pressure on their pen or pencil. This creates poor handwriting and early fatigue. This kills off their motivation to write, hence more two and three word sentences from boys with and less motivation. I feel the shows of masculinity and misbehavior are pretty much cop outs to both show separation from failure and also to generate small measures of love and honor from their peers. Their defensiveness from authority is really pretty straight forward, especially in lower socioeconomic areas where strength, power, and status hold very real currency in those areas. For those students it is not just misbehavior but a real tug of war or fight for minimum feelings of self-worth from a continual fight they feel outside the classroom as well as in. The suicide epidemic for boys and men is the result of Males being deprived sufficiently from essential feelings of self-worth and so being denied love and honor from others. The more aggressive, less supportive treatment boys are given from an early age is creating much more failure and hopelessness in school, preventing many boys, later men from competing in the information age thus losing the means to secure legally, income, status, and power to earn love and honor from society. This then creates many more instances of more aggressive, less respectful treatment, which slowly wears down their feelings of self-worth or desire to live right on to the point of suicide. I feel long before this point is reached, many many more boys and men are already escaping in various harmful ways from video games and sports to drug/alcohol abuse in an attempt to live despite the low feelings of self-worth they are feeling. There is a wrinkle to this. There are a \\"very few boys\\" given more stable, correct support from a few families which is enabling those few boys to succeed in school. This enables those boys to do well in school and receive love and honor from others, which they must continually keep doing to keep earning love and honor from society. This then becomes a never-ending drug for those boys which drives them to continually achieve in school. Those very few boys will be driven to continually achieve both in school and society with much more success due to the drug of achievement to earn love and honor. However the vast majority of those boys receiving very little support and much more aggressive treatment will not do well in school. Early on, they go into other areas to generate love and honor such as escaping to sports and video games, later to the military, (far right groups), or other areas just to generate ounces of love/honor from others. Sadly, indulgence pays in the information age, while less supportive, more aggressive treatment hurts development in the information age. As girls we are treated much better and enjoy much more hope and care from society. Since we as girls are given by differential treatment, much more continual, positive – mental, social, emotional support, verbal interaction from an early age onward, this creates quite the opposite outcome for girls when compared with the boys. The much more verbal interaction also transfers and creates many small and large arrays of real knowledge and skills, which are “important for learning, communication, and working with knowledge and skills”. I feel this is creating a significant advantage for girls and women. We enjoy much more care and support from society, from infancy through adulthood and receive love and honor simply for being girls. This creates all of the good things. This is even so for lower socioeconomic environments, where even here, girls, later women are able to perform very well in school and society due to much better continual support from everyone. We enjoy lower average stress for more ease of learning. We enjoy much more freedom of expression from much protection that makes us look more unstable at times. Of course we can also use that same tremendous freedom of expression to give verbal, silent abuse, and hollow kindness/patronization to our Male peers with impunity knowing we are protected. We enjoy much lower muscle tension for more ease and ability in handwriting and motivation to write. We enjoy much more positive, trust/communication from parents, teachers, peers, and more support for perceived weaknesses. We are reaping a bonanza in the information age. The lower the socioeconomic bracket the much more amplified the differential treatment from infancy and more differentiated over time through adulthood. Now with girls and women taking over many areas of society, we are enjoying even more lavishing of love and honor from society, while the boys and men are now failing more so and are now given even more ridicule and abuse by society. Mind you, this is also now coming from many girls and women using our still very protected freedoms of expression and more so with false feelings of superiority in society. What is worse, the modeling of an aggressive posture by parents, teachers, peers, and the media toward boys, later men and much more love and honor for girls have created a growing institutionalized acceptance of feelings of superiority and much vocalization of more patronization/condescending speech toward boys and men today. I witness this continually in the classroom, employment, stores, and offices where today, many women are now taking over and imitating the more harsh condescending speech we as girls/women have been so intensely modeled. As for girls there is a wrinkle also. We are given love and honor simply for being girls. This allows us to choose less than top planes of success and still find wonderful planes of innersecurity. We are not as driven. However, as the middle class continues to drop, there will be fewer boys able to receive the bare adequate support to be successful academically. Also more girls will begin \\"choosing to go into those higher fields by choice”. This will slowly allow women to begin taking over those higher fields just as we have already taken over the other fields. Society needs to face up to one very very large problem in its search for gender equality everywhere. You cannot allow gross gross indulgence/support from infancy through adulthood for one group, while providing gross gross confrontations/lack of support for the other group from infancy through adulthood and have them grow to equality at adulthood in the information age. With the exception of the previous wrinkles spoken of, the more indulged/supported side will always win. In note, I feel feminism has not created the Male Crisis, but – the information age has. The belief boys should be strong is still here and this improper treatment is causing many boys and men to greatly fall behind in society. The belief girls, later women should be protected, is allowing for much more proper treatment for girls and women. This much better treatment is creating many more successful girls and women. There is - “some connection” with the growth of feminism and its effects on Male achievement and esteem. The belief boys should be strong as this article shows, is already creating much lower real esteem and lower feelings of self-worth for boys and men. For boys/men there is now a much lowered feeling of self-worth and lowered esteem along with much more wariness for future failure. This has made boys and men extremely more sensitive to any further derision from others for any more failures. This also enhances their sensitivity to more derision from girls and women which is already acutely high due to our very collective, more open, and yes more freely institutionalized, accepted, abrasive speech and who are now in greater numbers surging ahead of our Male peers. Yes, everyone, both girls and boys, along with men and women fully realize this change in our lives today. This is already creating much more subtle and outright aggressive, patronizing, and overall, less respect toward boys and men by parents, teachers, peers, female managers, and even the average female office workers or supermarket personnel in stores and offices. When boys and men are then thrown into a position of expectancy of further abuse from more appearance of some weakness, especially among girls and women, this then signals to boys and men they will receive, if only from past abuses, now even more derision and ridicule when appearing weak in some way. This shows just how those many layers of hurt, anger, fear, and preparation for defense have created many harsh values within boys and men, which only amplifies their sensitivities to other present or future hurts and abuses which only add to their already present layers of hurt. This then creates more defensiveness and more preparation for defense as society knows only to provide more ridicule and derision for boys and men who are failing. I am afraid this same playbook is given to parents, teachers, peers, and others in society. This alone will cause more boys and men “not to compete where girls and women are involved” so as to not receive the double threat of both failure and “in their minds” more enhanced ridicule and derision “yes more ridicule from girls” on top of their already numerous layers of hurt, especially when their esteem and feelings of self-worth are already critically low to begin with. This is something boys, later men have much experience with from mothers, female teachers, girls, and women today. This is increasing due to both greater feelings of superiority by women and more accepted modeling from teachers, the media, and many other women they see in society today who are using this almost institutionally accepted use of more verbal, silent abuse, and much more patronization, sometimes with the intent to put something over on some usually more naive boy or man who is being sincere and not looking for such subtle abuse. This has sadly become very common among many girls and women today. This is the only connection with feminism tending to add more hurt to boys and men. This very great differential treatment over time is creating an ever increasing gulf in academic and information age achievement. This is also creating a growing gulf in understanding each other by gender. Our reactions from distrust, resentment, and fear from various events and interactions between girls and boys; men and women; can become much worse, even more hostile over time. We must look beyond the very simple expressions and interactions and see much more deeply into how our individual environments, differential treatment, and the information age could create more devastating problems in the future for boys and girls, and later for men and women. With increasingly, more boys and men losing their feelings of self-worth and loss of ability to even support themselves on top of the already present abuse they are receiving, this could cause the two groups to become even more distant (a gender divide by true wealth collectively greatly favoring women); and more hate toward each other in the future; this could bring about more open verbal and much more physical abuse by men toward women. My learning theory provides wonderful tools we can all use to continually change and improve our lives, freeing us all from the very harmful, false teaching of genetics permanence in ability or sheer effort. My learning theory and its applications will go to all on request and provides tools all of us can use to continually change and improve our lives. Oh, the idea of women making 80 Cents for a man’s dollar is understood by the belief boys should be strong allowing respect for boys/men only according to achievement, status, image, and money. This creates a never ending drug effect for many of those boys/men who feel they must keep achieving in order to keep receiving love and honor from society. This has already created a few, very rich men in the world whose earnings definitely tip the scale in favor of men, while the vast majority of boys, later men are failing in school and society. For women the belief women should be protected also allows for love and honor simply for being girls/women. This allows for much more satisfaction and fulfillment in areas we may find more enjoyable and enriching in our lives. However, as the middle class continues to drop there will be fewer boys/men given the proper support, stability, and care to become higher achievers, this will then create much more stagnation for boys and men later. As is the case now, more and more women will simply choose to go into those more open stem fields and other professional areas. They will then take over those areas just as we have already taken over in many other areas of society. My learning theory provides wonderful tools we can all use to continually change and improve our lives, freeing us all from the very harmful, false teaching of genetics permanence in ability or sheer effort. My learning theory and its applications will go to all on request and provides tools all of us can use to continually change and improve our lives. My learning theory can be researched showing while average stress cannot be controlled by relaxation or meditation, it can be more permanently reduced by slow understanding of mental conflicts along with continually forming newer and better weights and values within those elements in our lives. This will create both a dissolving of past mental conflicts and prevention of future, like mental conflicts within elements of our lives. This theory along with understanding and exercising proper dynamics of approaching newer mental work by slowing our pace and allowing our mental frames to grow allowing for better learning, long-term motivation, esteem, and continued improvement in all areas can be researched using initial readings from biofeedback along with self and observer evaluations for hope, confidence, esteem, reflection time, longer-term planning, etc. There should be improved or lowered readings monthly from initial biofeedback readings along with \\"much more sustained hope, confidence, esteem, reflection time, and longer-term planning, etc each month. The use of relaxation or meditation can be used as placebos for the other group. Also, subjects could be re-evaluated after many months or years to determine if any returned to their baseline. There should still be improved scores – not returning to their base line measurements."},{"instruction":"What is the Mega Millions jackpot, and how do you participate?","output":"The Mega Millions jackpot is a massive cash prize that can reach staggering amounts, often surpassing hundreds of millions of dollars. It is a lottery game played across multiple states in the United States, offering participants the chance to win life-changing sums of money. The drawing for the jackpot takes place twice a week, with players selecting five numbers from 1 to 70 and an additional Mega Ball number from 1 to 25. To win the grand prize, one must match all six numbers drawn. Participating in the Mega Millions jackpot is relatively simple. Players can purchase tickets from authorized retailers in participating states or even online through licensed websites. Each ticket costs 2 and allows you to select your own numbers or opt for quick-pick, which generates random numbers for you. Additionally, players have the option to add the Megaplier feature for an additional 1 per play, multiplying non-jackpot prizes by 2x-5x depending on the drawn Megaplier number. For many individuals seeking opportunities to make money and potentially change their lives overnight, participating in the Mega Millions jackpot can be an exhilarating experience filled with anticipation and hope. However, it's essential to remember that winning such a substantial amount of money requires sheer luck and should not be relied upon as a primary source of income.

There are many different chart types available, and each one is best suited for a different type of data. Using the wrong chart type can make your data difficult to understand or even misleading.Using too much data. It's tempting to cram as much data as possible into a visualization, but this can make it cluttered and difficult to read. Instead, focus on the most important data points and use them to tell a clear story.Misleading color contrast. Color can be a powerful tool for data visualization, but it's important to use it carefully. Using too many colors or colors with poor contrast can make your visualization difficult to understand.Improper use of 3D graphics. 3D graphics can be visually appealing, but they can also be misleading. If you're using 3D graphics, make sure they're used in a way that doesn't distort the data.Omitting baselines and truncating scale. Baselines and scales are important for providing context to your data. Omitting them can make your visualization misleading or difficult to understand.Biased text descriptions.

Most of the time, in a major composition, this is a mix of both. Especially when the composition is a form that will require a symphonic orchestra. Indeed, in a concerto, there is most of the time an overture where the solo instrument, say the piano, does not play for many bars before the exposition. On the other hand, in the Cadenza, the piano will be playing alone without orchestra. So, although, a composition could start as a solo piece, the composer could see fit to use an orchestra after some times. On the other hand, I sure can imagine a dude like Chopin starting a piece with orchestra and suddenly decide that, after all, he does not need it and call it good for piano solo. When he composed his Krakoviac Rondo, he might have changed his mind and decided after all that an orchestra would be in order. Listen to it and you’ll see how it could be done without orchestra but the opus is of such a grandeur that a symphonic orchestra makes all the difference.

These are epithets of a Universal Phenomena - the force of destruction and transformation personified in the form of Rudra in the Vedas.

Rather, while the smartphone has been listed on the website with this Mediatek chipset, the cost of the device has still not been confirmed. So this makes Tecno Spark 7P a mystery device with its Mediatek chipset and people are expecting the smartphone to start at around 8k in India. However, the other features of the smartphone look really good and has brought 90Hz display with as much as 5000mAh battery.

Speaking from my experiences, self confidence has done me great deals in my life. It plays a small but significant part in almost everything. For example, sports, meeting new people, interviews or even writing. In a team, self confidence boosts everybody's spirits. Being positive to situations by simply believing in yourself could bring everyone together in the toughest of times. During exams, confidence makes me calmer, allowing myself to focus better. When writing, confidence is reflected through your writing. The more confident you are, the more conviction your arguments have. I believe it's similar for debate. During interviews, self confidence almost always gives a plus point. It makes you appear smarter and more reliable. However, overconfidence kills. There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Do not cross that line and self confidence will bring you good."},{"instruction":"Can severe, prolonged stress levels affect the capacity to feel one's own emotions?","output":"Absolutely it can.

Because our farm is near to industrial area so chemicals are often mixed with water & colour of water becomes red Then we have to search for peoples to plant our saplings in farm, after it is planted daily care has to be taken like water & pesticides, We have to take care of our crop for 4 -5 months depending.. In those 4–5 months we feed water & pesticides in regular interval of time , make fence around our farm to protact crop from animals.. we hire people for cutting crops & sometimes by harvester then we collect all produce in one corner of our farm & last time taht was so difficult. Then we check for price in govermental firms & privet firms of our produce in market coz sometime it is higher & sometimes it is lower.. We can not keep our produce in our farm for long time so we sell it when price are at high level on average.. But sometimes they don’t give good price by giving excuses that quality of our produce is not good & all …so sometimes we sell it in privet firms by comparing prices they offer..

If a child had an IQ 25 points below the mean they would be getting remedial teaching and special attention, 25 points above and they have ‘issues’. Both my children score around 135 but have had very different experiences. My son was always suspected of having ADHD, until we had him tested and he turned out to be bored out his head most of the time at school. He was an oddball, lots of tics, and not one of the gang, fortunately for him he was really good at sports, which gave him some status among his peers, plus he was tall so they didn’t try it on physically. He ended up with a specialist tutor in a group one day a week who helped him martial his thoughts and helped us help him. My daughter in the other hand just pottered along under the radar, usually the youngest in her class anyway. In the Netherlands there are a series of tests to determine what sort of high school is appropriate, she took a trial test and scored 100%, then they decided to give her the test for the final year, scored 100%. They suggested she skipped a grade - there was a full assessment to determine if she was emotionally and socially able to make the change. She went from group 6 to 8. At the end of the year 100% again. She will be 16 when she starts university later this year. They are both happy well adjusted and comfortable in their skins now but for both of them the saving grace has been activities outside of school. For her it’s musicals and theatre, for him it was soccer and football. Schools can be intense and overwhelming places. It really helped to have another circle of friends. Now they’re older they seem to enjoy being smart, plus as they progress through their academic career they end up surrounded by cleverer people, but it was a struggle for the early years. Fortunately they have my wife’s input in terms of social skills and managing relationships whereas I am much more introvert and academic. They come to me for help with homework and to her for help with life. I would say that the worst part is that for a while things come easy. They ‘get it’ without having to work too hard. But the day will come when you need to put the hours in and that can be a shock. If you have a bright child - make sure they learn to work for what they want."},{"instruction":"Zoroastrianism seems to be very different from other Middle Eastern religions, what is its unique appeal?","output":"Q: Zoroastrianism seems to be very different from other Middle Eastern religions, what is its unique appeal? Firstly, Zoroastrianism is about the only still wholly surviving religion traditionally present in the Middle East which is completely independent of the Abrahamic lore. The other extant traditional religious communities of the Middle East have religions which are either completely Abrahamic (like Islam, Christianity, Judaism or Samaritanism), semi-Abrahamic (like Yazidism) or at least related to Abrahamism (like Mandaeism). Secondly, Zoroastrianism is a religion rooted among the indiginous traditions of some Indo-European speakers, specifically of the Iranic subbranch. It is the only Indo-European religious tradition historically surviving in the Middle East, and nowadays moreover also pretty much the only wholly continuously surviving Indo-European religion from other than the Indian spectrum worldwide. Thirdly, the Iranic people actually lived roughly from the area of the contemporary Tajikistan in the Central Asia through the area of the contemporary Afghanistan to the area of the contemporary Iran in the Middle East. Zoroastrianism is widely considered to reflect in its roots the ancient Iranic cultural continuum stretching between the east of Iran and the Central Asia. It is thus not purely nor typically Middle Eastern religion, it is a religion anciently reflecting the easternmost periphery of the Middle East and/or beyond.* * “Avestan society represents one of the most difficult problems. Its has long been established that its material culture was archaic. The Avesta makes no mention of iron, although bronze was in use; and a sophisticated urban life, enduring states or crafts practised separately from farming are unknown. The Gāθās, the earliest part of the Avesta, which reflect the material culture and social relations of eastern Iran and Middle Asia in the pre-Achaemenid period, depict a society of sedentary herdsmen and farmers, still preserving a system of clan and tribal relationships. As the clan communes disintegrated, so early class units began to spring up, and the emergence of classes is reflected in the Gāθās, which contain a protest against the rule of the tribal elite.”(M. A. Dandamayev, in History of Civilizations of Central Asia: The Development of Sedentary and Nomadic Civilizations, 1994, p. 42)"},{"instruction":"Can stress damage your brain?","output":"Adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol are stress hormones.

I pee everytime I laugh or sneeze or cough too hard after two very wanted pregnancies. Pregnancy negatively changed my body. I had two friends get life threatening preeclampsia. Two women I know had serious birth injuries impacting their ability to walk. Pregnancy and childbirth are risky. Until science makes those risks something the father experiences, he should have no legal say in the mother's healthcare decisions. However, if you don't go around screwing random women, and only get in relationships with women who also want kids in the near future, and treat those women well, then an accidental pregnancy is unlikely to result in an abortion without a serious discussion with you."},{"instruction":"w do I buy a stock after the markets close on Upstox and Zerodha?","output":"There is a Post closing session after the market gets closed ..

Here are a few commonly cited disadvantages: Cost: Developing, purchasing, and maintaining robots can be expensive. The initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs may not be feasible for all individuals or organizations, particularly smaller ones with limited budgets.Job displacement: The automation of certain tasks and jobs through the use of robots can lead to job displacement for humans. As robots become more advanced and capable of performing complex tasks, there is a concern that they may replace human workers in certain industries, leading to unemployment or the need for workers to acquire new skills.Lack of adaptability: Robots are typically designed for specific tasks or environments. They often lack the flexibility and adaptability of human workers, who can quickly adjust to changing circumstances or perform a wide range of tasks. This limitation may make robots less suitable for tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, or handling unpredictable situations.Safety concerns: Robots are typically designed to operate in controlled environments, but they may not always handle unexpected situations or interact safely with humans. There is a risk of accidents or injuries if proper safety protocols are not followed or if the robots malfunction.Ethical considerations: As robots become more autonomous and capable, ethical considerations arise. Questions of responsibility and accountability can emerge when robots make decisions or take actions that have significant consequences. There is also a potential for misuse or malicious use of robots, such as in warfare or surveillance.Social implications: The widespread use of robots could have social implications. Some people may feel uncomfortable or anxious interacting with robots, particularly in social or caregiving roles where human connection and empathy are valued. The increasing reliance on robots in various domains may also contribute to a sense of alienation or job insecurity for some individuals. It is important to note that the extent and significance of these disadvantages can vary depending on the specific context and application of robots. Additionally, ongoing technological advancements and ethical considerations may address or mitigate some of these concerns in the future.

So look for another surge forward in about 12 years. Why 12?

The receiver or monitor is only used to view the live or recorded footage from the camera. CCTV cameras are typically connected to a digital video recorder (DVR) or network video recorder (NVR) that stores the recorded footage. The DVR or NVR is designed to continue recording even if the receiver or monitor is turned off or disconnected. However, if the camera's power source is disconnected, the camera will not be able to record footage. Additionally, if the DVR or NVR is not properly set up or configured, it may not record footage even if the camera is on. It's important to note that laws and regulations around the use of CCTV cameras vary by jurisdiction.

Any emotion come with it? Probably 3-5 times a day. Disgust, probably why I've been working on losing weight lately. -Have you tried to lose weight? How did it go? Is it like quitting smoking where you feel urges to over-consume, or does it just feel like you're starving to death so you go back to eating as much? Yes, since last January I've gone from 400lbs to 275. My end goal is 185 by next December. -Is pooping any harder when you're obese? Pooping, no, wiping, yes. -When you shower, do you actually lift layers of yourself to scrub in between? I used to have to, I'm not that fat anymore. -When you go out to bars or whatnot to look for women/men, do you intentionally look for other fat people? Do you actually find other obese people attractive? Fuck no, to both. -If you were ever average weight, what did you think of obese people then? Now? For a very brief time when I was in the Marine Corps I was skinny, I felt pity. This has not changed. -Do you think people judge you on a daily basis for your weight? Like people on the street, bus drivers, store owners, etc. Yes. -Are you concerned about the health risks associated with obesity? If so, what's keeping you obese? Yes, and the only thing keeping me obese is that it takes a long time to lose 225lbs in a healthy way that will keep it off. -What's your monthly grocery bill? Or daily caloric intake? Right now? 1700 but, I'm working on losing weight. Didn't track it before I started. -What sort of stuff do I not even think about because I'm average weight that you have to deal with because of your obesity? How do you handle it? Getting tired just because you walked up a flight of stairs sucks. So does having to adjust parts of your body to be able to fit into a car's driver seat.=== Former obese person, now a \\"normal\\" sized person, responding to the call. How often on a daily basis do you notice that you're obese? Any emotion come with it? There's not a moment where you don't realise it. Beyond a certain point it affects practically everything you do, from getting out of bed to visiting the bathroom to sitting in a chair to going shopping to talking to people at work. And for my part the emotion that came with it was a combination of self-loathing and resignation. Have you tried to lose weight? How did it go? Is it like quitting smoking where you feel urges to over-consume, or does it just feel like you're starving to death so you go back to eating as much? I did, yes, and frankly it feels like the dice are loaded against you from the start. You become hungry far more quickly, and because you've come to depend (both physically and psychologically) on such a vast caloric intake you start to feel pain and faintness when you drastically reduce what you're eating. Beyond a certain point, reducing food intake is the only option you have, as exercise becomes difficult to the point of impossibility - if you fall badly, as you are prone to do, you might just end up breaking something. Is pooping any harder when you're obese? No, but wiping certainly is. When you shower, do you actually lift layers of yourself to scrub in between? Yep. And you have to do the same when drying otherwise you'll basically end up with nappy rash in unexpected places. When you go out to bars or whatnot to look for women/men, do you intentionally look for other fat people? Can't speak for anyone else but when I was obese this is simply something I would never have considered doing. The very idea seemed futile. Do you actually find other obese people attractive? Not especially, but if you already loved these people before they became obese then you're likely to still feel the same way if you're in the same boat. If you were ever average weight, what did you think of obese people then? Now? I don't recall thinking much about them at all. I knew a few people who were very overweight when I was normal and generally just thought \\"Nice chap, hope he doesn't drop stone dead of a heart attack some day.\\" Nowadays they make me feel a bit sad, purely because I know they get no sympathy and that it can be difficult to live a normal life when you're in that state. Do you think people judge you on a daily basis for your weight? Like people on the street, bus drivers, store owners, etc. Yes. Everyone. Are you concerned about the health risks associated with obesity? If so, what's keeping you obese? I was but not enough to make me do something serious about it. It's a slippery slope and I think that unless you suffer genuine health problems while sliding down it you're not likely to climb back purely on the basis of what might happen to you someday. What's your monthly grocery bill? Or daily caloric intake? Have forgotten the weekly bills by now but my daily caloric intake was probably on the order of 3000-4000+ depending on the day. Alcohol makes a big difference to this too, and a lot of obese people drink way more than they should purely because they feel they need to and it takes a lot more to get them drunk. What sort of stuff do I not even think about because I'm average weight that you have to deal with because of your obesity? How do you handle it? Buying clothes. Meeting people. Going to the cinema or the theatre and trying to fit in their seats. Having sex, or even considering it. Walking to the shop or the postbox on the corner and feeling like death afterwards. Being given a lift in someone else's car and you can't even do up the fucking seatbelt. Feeling fine while you're in your own home and everything is built for you and you feel normal and then you step outside and you're a complete freak and everyone can see it. That was just a random string of questions. Please don't be offended by them- I'm honestly just curious about the lives of obese people. Not offended. Worthwhile questions.One more thing worth bearing in mind is that obesity is not usually something that happens in a short space of time. You don't wake up one morning and realise \\"Holy crap, I got fat - what happened?\\" It's insidious, a creeping malignancy that everyone else notices but never mentions in time because they don't want to offend you. And then when you finally realise the problem it's so far down the line that simply turning round and heading back is not usually an option.I took the easy option - bariatric surgery. Mainly because I was so obese that I was a danger to myself just when walking around (BMI was around 55 at my peak). I say easy, but it was painful and awkward and I've had to do a lot of work afterwards to keep my strength and rebuild my fitness. I can't imagine how I could have done this without the surgery. Anyone who can has my utmost respect and admiration. === I'm 5'9\\", 335lbs. I've been fat my entire life. I'm responding to this because I often have my own awkward questions that I want to know the answers to (FOR SCIENCE!). How often on a daily basis do you notice that you're obese? Any emotion come with it? Every day, whenever I move or relax. Whenever I walk somewhere, I become aware that I'm breathing heavier than I should be. I try to make sure that other people don't notice, so I breathe slowly and steadily through my nose, often feeling like I'm out of breath because of it. When I relax at the computer or in a chair, I realize that I probably look like a pile of flesh as I slouch down into my chest and onto the arm of the chair. Have you tried to lose weight? How did it go? Is it like quitting smoking where you feel urges to over-consume, or does it just feel like you're starving to death so you go back to eating as much? I've tried to lose weight many, many times with varying degrees of success. The most recent time, I got down to 316. Then I plateaued. Then I was 346. I don't ever have any urges that seem to me like I'm eating more than I should be. I think I tend to just make really horrible choices for what I eat. Today I had a chicken biscuit from Chick-fil-a and a diet lemonade for breakfast, a container of tuna with oil/salt/pepper on WASA bread for lunch, bunch of candy in the afternoon because my stomach knotted up and candy was the only thing around, and two slices of pizza for dinner. It's easy, when I think about it, to identify everything I'm doing wrong... it's very hard to effectively change the behaviors. Is pooping any harder when you're obese? Yes. When I sit down, it's difficult to get my junk down to where I can urinate. When standing, the fat pad above the genitals causes my penis to withdraw from sight, making urination awkward. I also often have pain when pooping and sometimes there's blood. My shoulder often pops when I wipe. Having written this (for science), I feel really disgusting as a human being. When you shower, do you actually lift layers of yourself to scrub in between? No. I'm built like a linebacker, so everything is distributed pretty well. My excess sags, but not really a lot (compared to other fat people). When you go out to bars or whatnot to look for women/men, do you intentionally look for other fat people? Do you actually find other obese people attractive? I met my wife at college in Marching Band (I weight 268 back then). She is not fat but she thinks I'm funny and loves me. I've never gone looking for women at bars. When I admire people I see throughout the day, I rarely find overweight women attractive (but personality is a large part of attraction for me). I would never seek out a fat person just because they were fat. If you were ever average weight, what did you think of obese people then? Now? I've never been a normal weight. Not even from childhood. I think obese people look disgusting and lazy (this includes myself, so I'm no hypocrite). Do you think people judge you on a daily basis for your weight? Like people on the street, bus drivers, store owners, etc. How could they not? I feel people's eyes (or lack thereof... some people don't look at you and it's obvious they think you're stupidly fat). Even my coworkers who I get along with either occasionally make fat jokes in regards to me or in general (how could I not take that personally?). Are you concerned about the health risks associated with obesity? If so, what's keeping you obese? I am extremely concerned about the health risks. I have 3 sons and want to be able to play with them and be around for them as long as I possibly can. There are a lot of things keeping me from losing weight. The general difficulty of it is a large part. A bigger part is finding time. I work all day and then have to come home for my family (and I'm tired after work). I've tried working out with a friend before, for motivation, but he kept pushing me too hard, too fast. I do fine with regular exercise if I can get a routine. My wife doesn't cook much, though, so I end up eating out for basically all three meals every day. What's your monthly grocery bill? Or daily caloric intake? Grocery bill? Very low. We spend probably 800 a month on eating out, though. I don't know what my caloric intake is. I would have guessed it to be 2000-2500, but the formula for figuring out how many calories I'd need to maintain my weight says I'd need around 3000. What sort of stuff do I not even think about because I'm average weight that you have to deal with because of your obesity? How do you handle it? It's difficult to go to the movies with friends unless the theater chairs have raise-able arms. It's hard to sit in a booth with people at a restaurant. It's very easy to feel alienated because people don't want to sit on your side of the booth because they fit better with the other skinny people. Underwear is uncomfortable. And pants. Clothes are so hard to find. Shoes are hard to find because apparently there's no call for wide shoes. I second the opinion on folding chairs - those things look like they'll fold up the other way if you sit on them. We sweat more. Shoes are hard to put on and tie. I can hear my knees crackle and click with every step I take. If I crouch down to pick something up, I have to raise myself up very slowly, or else it feels like someone has stabbed an oyster shucker behind my patella and is trying to pop it off. I've never experienced the feeling of being hit on by more than one person.Also, fat people are probably stronger than you think. We are constantly carrying around hundreds of extra pounds (ALL THE TIME). I could leg press 495 pounds in college, but could only curl 70 pounds. That was just a random string of questions. Please don't be offended by them- I'm honestly just curious about the lives of obese people. I'm glad to hopefully have been helpful in answering your questions (FOR SCIENCE!). Writing this whole response has been incredibly depressing, however, and makes me feel like doing bad things, so... I going to go and try to stop being said and be awesome instead. === For more threads, see http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/search?q=obese&sort=top&restrict_sr=on"},{"instruction":"w can I become a successful digital marketer here in Nigeria?","output":"learn first, the practice, and make a good portfolio"},{"instruction":"Could Data pass the Kobayashi Maru in Star Trek?","output":"Yes.

Go back to the Kobyashi Mary scenes in Star Trek 2. Compare them with the scenes in Star Trek 2009. As a cadet, Kirk reprogrammes the computer to make it possible to win. His manner is cocky, self satisfied. He’s joking around and showing off. He’s arrogant. It’s not appealing. You can see Uhura rolling her eyes at him. The scenes in TWOK show really interesting character development for Kirk. I really love them. McCoy, one of Kirk’s oldest friends, says something like “you are looking at the only cadet ever to beat the Kobyashi Maru.” He’s half-smiling. He’s not praising Kirk, he’s teasing him. He knows exactly how his friend feels about his earlier behaviour and is teasing him. How does Kirk respond? Reluctantly. He doesn’t want to be drawn on it. HE’S EMBARRASSED. Now 50, he looks back on his behaviour in his youth and recognises it as foolish and arrogant and he’s embarrassed. His behaviour wasn’t heroic. It demonstrated a character flaw and looking back, he recognised that. Those scenes are really great.

I was living in a four story walk up in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan about twenty years ago. Several months after 9/11, many residents had either left Manhattan or were in the process of leaving. Lots of folks just didn’t feel safe (fearing a follow up attack) or didn’t like living in the aftermath (heightened security protocols, carpool mandates, etc.). With the law of supply and demand being king, rental prices had dropped by almost a third. I decided to take advantage of the reduced prices in the rental market and gave my landlord the 60 day notice to vacate as required by the lease agreement. Before I moved out my landlord telephoned me to ask what was going on in his building. He said four of his tenants were moving out that month alone and this was in a building that only had 16 tenants. I explained the decline in rental prices and that I knew tons of people in Manhattan that were moving from one apartment to another to take advantage of the reduced rents. He had no clue that rental prices had dropped so much. He offered to cut my rent right then and there on the telephone by a third to get me to stay. I suspect it was because I was an excellent tenant. I thanked him but as I had already signed a lease at another building, I had to decline."},{"instruction":"Why is Dany's reaction to Viserys's death considered to be a sign of her madness? Sansa, for example, also smiled when she took out someone who used to brutalize her.","output":"Sansa had no relationship with Ramsay apart from him brutalizing her. Ramsay, it’s implied, had always been sadistic, similar to Joffrey. There was no “good” there and never had been. In Viserys’ case — and this is clearer in the books — he wasn’t innately sadistic so much as a life of deprivation, humiliation and desperation had driven him to the brink. That doesn’t excuse what he did to Dany, but to act like Dany and Viserys’ relationship was anywhere close to being comparable to Sansa and Ramsay’s is nuts. As for the reaction itself, that is indeed the thing. Sansa takes satisfaction in killing Ramsay because she’s killing her abuser, the guy who desecrated her home, and the man who murdered her brother. It’s extremely clear what she’s feeling and why. Dany’s reaction to Viserys dying is not similar to this. There’s not relief at the end of her torment, satisfaction in killing her tormentor, or even, after the fact, immediate sadness at losing her brother and caretaker despite what he’d done to her. Instead she gives a weird rationalization for his death: “He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.” (It’s the same in the book, only she thinks this rather than says it out loud.) That severe emotional disconnect is … well, it’s weird, isn’t it? In the end Viserys’ death doesn’t elicit a reaction you might expect, and is instead put in the context of what she perceives to be an ill-defined shortcoming of his: He wasn’t a “real” dragon. You say Sansa “also” smiled, but Dany … isn’t smiling here. She has a vacant, ethereal look on her face. There’s no emotion here at all, just a rendering of judgment — Viserys was “unworthy,” but he wasn’t “unworthy” for any of the list of reasons why he shouldn’t have been “unworthy.” He’s “unworthy” because he … was killed by molten gold, like any Targaryen would have been, including Dany if it had been her in that moment (in the books’ continuity, anyway). I’ve seen the argument made that Dany is compartmentalizing here and her reaction to Viserys’ death is a defense mechanism to avoid the psychological trauma that actually confronting it would cause. I think this is a fair argument, except that Dany never really does confront what happened to Viserys, until the end of the fifth book when she hallucinates seeing him in the Dothraki Sea. The interesting thing about that is that the book ends with Dany seemingly resolved to stop “planting trees,” i.e. this is when her eventual descent really begins, it just hasn’t played out in the books yet. That is to say, once Dany finally does really confront what happened to Viserys, her takeaway isn’t satisfaction at killing her abuser; she does seem to express some residual guilt or sadness at his death that wasn’t evident at the time he was killed. Mostly though, her takeaway is to become more like Viserys, by following the “fire and blood” path. But she, unlike him, is a “real dragon” (no, she’s not inherently immune to fire in the books, but that’s her takeaway), and will succeed where he didn’t. That’s also kind of the fucked up part — her eventual, endgame takeaway isn’t that Viserys was a monstrous abuser or had a mindset to be avoided; it’s that she can be a better, more successful version of him. Her contempt for him isn’t that he was an abuser; it’s that he failed, and she plans to succeed.

Mars is famous for its very thin atmosphere with 95% carbon dioxide, 1.6% argon, 0.15% oxygen. Mars has around 1% of atmospheric pressure that normally found at sea level on Earth. 2.Largest dust storm The magnetic field in the crust of the Mars that can be at least 10 times more strongly magnetized than anything measured on Earth. The largest storm in the solar system is The dust storms occur on Mars which is capable of blanketing the entire Mars planet and can be last for many months. This image can give the idea about Mars dust storm 3.Much colder than the earth Mars is a very cold planet due to its greater distance from the sun. At the equator, it has a normal temperature of 80 degree Fahrenheit. The average temperature on Mars is around minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit which is below freezing point. In winter it can vary around minus 125 degree celcious. 4.Second smallest planet In terms of landmass, Mars and Earth have approximately the same landmass. Even though Mars‘s diameter is 6,791 which is half of the earth diameter and makes Mars the second-smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury. 5.A day and Years Mars takes 687 Earth days to complete one revolution around the sun it is almost twice the time Earth takes to complete a full revolution around the sun. A day on the Mars only lasts 40 minutes more than one day on Earth because it takes around 24.6 hours to rotate on its own axis.([LINKED_TEXT: source] [URL: https://mars.nasa.gov/all-about-mars/facts/]) 6.Core of mars like another terrestrial planet, Mars interior is divided into three layers: a crust is about 30 miles thick, the mantle is about 900 to 1,200 miles, and core which is between 1,800 and 2,400 miles in diameter. Mars maximum core pressure is expected to be 400,000 times the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level. 7.Mission Mars There are 39 Mars mission were done and out of them, 18 Mars mission was successful. In 1960 – the first spacecraft on a mission to Mars was launched. The USA made the first successful mission to Mars in 1964. on July 20, 1976, the first photograph of Mars was taken from its surface by Viking 1. 8.Got the name from Blood red appearance.

The CORE 4 portfolio is the lowest cost way to invest in index funds that there possibly is right now, all you have to do is put the money in and not worry about it, its a hands off strategy. I do recommend that you be looking at a long term time horizon if you really want to make a lot of money. For a millennial doing this kind of portfolio can turn you into a multi-millionaire. The cost of this portfolio is 0.032% and it literally one of the lowest cost ways to do this type of investing.

I remember back when I was a teenager, my older brother’s friends were going off one day about some album by the band that featured former members of Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden. I had one of the earlier, punkish albums by Soundgarden… Ultramega OK… so I kinda listened. Temple of the Dog was a sort of “supergroup” with members of Soundgarden and Mother Love Bone. Those were “established” bands with records and all so I suppose Temple of the Dog was, by default, established the moment they started recording. If you mean “established” in the sense of being famous or popular, I don’t know. I’m not certain Soundgarden was famous or popular at the time. I’m not even certain Nirvana was considered main steam at the time. Personally, I think Bleach and Ultramega OK were better than anything either (respective) band released after 1990 anyway so whether or not Temple of the Morning Dog was established or mainstream, I say give it a go. It’s probably a good album.

Remove movement and awareness also goes away. Think of deep sleep where there is no awareness. The body relaxes into stillness. Awareness withdraws from the senses which are organs that perceive through movement and we rest in the soul state - the state of consciousness at rest. The same is true of samadhi. We consciously let the body and mind rest and our awareness withdraws from mental movement or activity. We then experience pure uniformity. We will not be aware but upon coming out of the meditation you can observe the effect of the samadhi state on your mind and body. Now, in rare instances, for someone who works diligently on their practice, a person can reach the fourth state or turiyatit, also called constant remembrance. This is an entirely different realm. A person is immersed in samadhi at the deepest level within, continuously, forever, without any break. Yet, they are fully aware and awake and function normally. This is the objective of meditation practice. Anyone is welcome to experience samadhi in a practical way, easily experienced with the help of yogic transmission, steady-state subtle energy that brings uniformity to the mind quickly. There are four sessions a week. I suggest planning to attend several meditations to have a real taste of it for yourself. This way you will understand these things through practical experience.

For the sake of discussion, let's say you have a domestic violence/alcohol call, and you are told that the man is a former heavyweight boxer.","output":"It has never been slightest of a concern to be very honest with you. No matter how large, aggressive or formidable a person is, if we have befell upon him to make an arrest, he’d be taken in easy way… or the real easy way. Of course the person would be told to cooperate and surrender first but if he refuses… he’d be manhandled accordingly. And we’re really good at manhandling if needed. As for the above mentioned scenario in your question. We do not respond to disturbance calls by sending just a single cop. Suppose if I was the only respondent… It is obvious I wouldn't be able to control this man who’s a professional fighter or boxer and even more importantly he is intoxicated thus a is very good chance that he wouldn't be obeying any request from me. And he would most probably mop the floor with me if I tried subduing him on my own. Of course my first reaction would be to make constant requests to him to please calm down and cooperate. And I’d definitely call for backup while at it, and sincerely pray that they reach well in time… this once. :) It is a hope that person comes in to senses and backs down, or at least remain calm until the cavalry arrives. But there is absolutely no way that I’d let this person bodily hurt his family or anyone else during this charade. He could be as much overwhelming and fearsome he wants to, but what he cannot do is physically harm his wife, children or neighbors in my (cop’s) presence even if that hopeless attempt to subdue him guarantees getting me beaten to dust. I can assure you of this on behalf of each and every cop there is. Though a spray or taser could come handy but we do not have/carry those around here if you’re wondering. Mean while the backup must have arrived by now. And I told you… we are really good at manhandling.

In fact, microwaves are a safe and convenient way to cook, heat, and defrost food. Microwaves work by producing electromagnetic waves that cause water molecules in food to vibrate, which generates heat and cooks the food. The microwaves only penetrate about an inch into the food, so they do not alter the molecular structure of the food in the same way that other cooking methods, such as grilling or frying, do. Like any cooking method, it is possible to overcook or improperly cook food in a microwave, which can affect the quality and taste of the food. It is also important to follow safe food handling practices, such as properly storing and reheating leftovers, to prevent the risk of food poisoning. Overall, microwaves are a safe and efficient way to cook food and can be a convenient option for busy individuals or families. Related: [LINKED_TEXT: Delicious Microwave Recipes To Try Now] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/amazingrecipe/home] Why People Think Microwaved Food is Bad For The Health There are a few reasons why some people may think that microwaved food is bad for their health: Misconceptions about microwave radiation: Some people may believe that microwaves produce harmful radiation that can be absorbed by the food and cause negative health effects. However, the levels of microwave radiation emitted by microwave ovens are well below the levels that are considered to be dangerous to humans.Concerns about nutrient loss: Some people may believe that microwaves cause more nutrient loss in food compared to other cooking methods. However, research has shown that microwaves can actually be a more efficient way to cook some types of food, as they can help to preserve the nutrients and prevent the loss of water-soluble vitamins.Misinformation about plastic containers: There is a common misconception that microwaving food in plastic containers or wrap can cause harmful chemicals to leach into the food. While it is true that some types of plastic can release chemicals when exposed to high temperatures, this is not a concern when using microwave-safe containers. Overall, it is important to remember that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to cook, heat, and defrost food, and there is no scientific evidence to suggest that microwaved food is inherently unhealthy. Here are a few tips for microwaving food safely and effectively: Use microwave-safe containers: Make sure to use containers that are specifically labeled as microwave-safe. These containers are designed to withstand the high temperatures and microwaves that are produced by the microwave oven. Avoid using metal containers or containers with metal trim, as these can cause sparks and potentially damage the microwave.Cover the food: Use a microwave-safe lid or wrap to cover the food while it is microwaving. This will help to retain heat and moisture, and prevent splatters and spills.Avoid overcooking: Microwaves cook food quickly and efficiently, so it's important to keep an eye on the food as it cooks to avoid overcooking. Overcooking can cause the food to dry out or become rubbery.Stir or rotate the food: If the food you are microwaving is not evenly cooked, try stirring or rotating it halfway through the cooking time to help distribute the heat more evenly.Use a microwave-safe thermometer: To ensure that the food is cooked to a safe internal temperature, use a microwave-safe thermometer to check for doneness. This is especially important for meats and poultry, which should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature to prevent the risk of food poisoning."},{"instruction":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","output":"Your question grabbed my attention as it's a topic that intersects my daily life as a programmer and tech enthusiast. The choice of incorporating touch screens in laptops, including Macs, isn't a simple one and it's quite intriguing. As a digital art enthusiast, I find touch screens to be a double-edged sword. On one hand, they offer a direct interaction with the software, but on the other, they can be a nuisance with accidental touches.

It's actually where I learned about the difference between various laptops, including those with touch screens and those without. Here's the article that helped me understand this issue better: [link to the specific article] Apple's philosophy has always been about creating the best user experience. They probably believe that touch screens may compromise the quality of their display or the overall user experience. Additionally, MacOS is not designed for touch input, and redesigning it would be a massive undertaking. In my opinion, while touch screens can be handy in some cases, they're not always necessary or beneficial for every user or system.

That is to say, in a healthy relationship, they would have already decided, as a couple, what levels of risk of pregnancy were acceptable, and what they would do in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, before it became reality. The couple would also have the ability to change that decision at any time, considering the benefits and potential dangers of a pregnancy if it happened. So, the man would have learned from his partner that she was pregnant, and would already know the decision of abortion ahead of time, and therefore already had a say in his share of the relationship’s power dynamics. Of course, the couple could change their mind after finding out about the pregnancy. In an ideal relationship, the woman shouldn’t push for abortion without talking to her partner, and the man should not push for forced birth without talking to his partner. The decision to have a child, or not, should be a mutual decision, based on the couple’s collective decision considering the reasons why a child may or may not be the best option. It could be based on career planning, or finances, or academic pursuit, etc. However, at the end of the day, it is ultimately up to the woman to make that decision.

TWICE!!!! This is a man who has brought to life absolutely timeless classics, who helped bring actors like Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, and many, many others into the A-List. His filmography consists of so many different films, it would be surprising if we all didn’t have at least one of his films in our collections. Guaranteed we’ve all seen at least one of his films for sure. Fincher started his career directing music videos for a few bands and artists you may have heard of. In 1989 he directed Aerosmith’s Love in an Elevator and Madonna’s Express Yourself and Oh, Father. Flash forward a year to 1990 and he directed George Michael’s Freedom ‘90 and Madonna’s Vogue. He also directed Michael Jackson’s Who is It and The Rolling Stones Love is Strong. But enough on that. Let’s get to his films. Fincher tends to lean towards the dark and macabre with his films. You won’t find too many happy endings here. His vision in film is dark, gritty and grounded in reality. You watch his films and know that this could really happen. That’s what makes his works most times feel frightening as hell. His first film was Alien3. Now granted, not his best work, and roundly criticized for his killing off of two main protagonists from the previous film. However he story demanded that those characters be killed off. This was his film, not James Cameron’s from the film before. He would have to keep Ripley, no getting around that, but he made sure that’s where the similarities between the films ended. Also, this is one of the more realistic of the Alien franchise. The fear is palpatable, the characters people you wouldn’t normally root for(prisoners on an abandoned planet in the middle of nowhere). The xenomorph, granted, was pretty horrible CGI but overall I thought it was a lot better than anyone gave it credit for. From there, he blew the roof off horror suspense with his next outing. Se7en. You’ve seen it. Don’t lie. This telling of a serial killer who’s murdering people after the seven deadly sins is a taught thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. It’s like a bad car accident . You want to look away but you can’t. It’s ugly. It’s bleak. It’s terrifying, made even more terrifying by the fact that you can see this happening in real life. This isn’t some fantasy or nightmare it’s real. It’s climactic scene at the end tells you the viewer that the good guys don’t always win. Innocence can be lost. That there isn’t always a happy ending. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt lead a terrific cast that includes R. Lee Ermey, John C McGinley, Leland Orser(character actors in other words) a young unknown named Gwyneth Paltrow and it’s capped off with a command performance, as only he can give, by Kevin Spacey. The Game, a psychological thriller came next with Sean Penn and Michael Douglas. A cult film classic and critically acclaimed film, Fight Club with Brad Pitt(again) and Edward Norton came soon after. Panic Room, with Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto , Dwight Yoakam and a young Kirsten Stewart followed and the biopic Zodiac, with Jake Gyllenhall, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr after that. All these films again, dark, gritty, terrifying, and absolutely grounded, no matter the premise, in realism. Hell with Zodiac it was real. Finally he churned out back to back the two films for which he’s been nominated for the directing academy award. Turning towards one of his favorite actors in Brad Pitt for a third time, he brought us The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. He followed up that masterpiece with another biopic, this the telling of a young man by the name of Marc Zuckerberg, and his little website you may have heard of called Facebook. The Social Network may be his highest grossing movie to date, and I would imagine is his most viewed film to date as well. For both Benjamin Button and The Social Network he was nominated for best director but did not win. After that, Fincher directed Rooney Mara in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, and Tyler Perry in Gone Girl. Since then he has directed only one more thing, the Netflix film Mank which came out in 2020. His filmography speaks for itself. He is easily one of the best, if not the best director in Hollywood today. Did I mention he’s mainly responsible for the TV shows Mindhunter and House of Cards? Ya so there’s that to add on his resume as well. He’s a fantastic visionary who’s films grab you, keep you in your seat and bring it home to you. He hasn’t won yet, but it’s only a matter of time until he does"},{"instruction":"My family wants to put my cat down. She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"Has your cat already been taken to the vet? Peeing everywhere and vomiting can be symptoms of kidney failure.If this is the case, and if she is stage 4 or end-stage kidney failure, then your parents may be doing the right thing for her. But without a diagnosis from a vet, to be sure, no one can know that! All it would need is a blood test. Otherwise those two symptoms could be caused by something else, and the possibilities are many. I don't know what is happening to your cat. Only a vet who examines and tests her can say. Have you asked your parents why they want to have her put down? My opinion is that your cat should have a blood test first, to find out if there IS anything serious going on. If not, it could be that a course of antibiotics and/or a stomach medicine might help her get better."},{"instruction":"What is the most compelling evidence for the existence of the Loch Ness Monster?","output":"There isn’t any."},{"instruction":"Are teachers who tell students that math is racist actually hampering the future success of those students?","output":"That may well be the most reprehensible stupidity I have ever heard on the subject of racism, and we've all heard some literally incredible stupidity from the race-baiters in the last few years!!!

Mars has a slightly longer day than Earth, with a period of rotation (referred to as a \\"sol\\") of approximately 24 hours, 37 minutes, and 22 seconds. This is very close to Earth's day length of 24 hours. The Martian day is often referred to as a \\"sol\\" because it is the term used by NASA's Mars rovers to mark a Martian day. The similarity in day length between Mars and Earth means that a Martian day can feel quite familiar to us. However, there are some differences. The Martian day is divided into 24 hours, just like Earth, but the minutes and seconds are slightly different. A Martian hour is about 2.7% longer than an Earth hour, while a Martian minute is approximately 1.6% longer than an Earth minute. Similarly, a Martian second is about 1.6% longer than an Earth second. These small differences in time measurement may seem insignificant, but they have practical implications for operating missions on Mars. Scientists and engineers involved in Mars missions need to adjust their timing systems to account for the slight variations in the Martian day length. Understanding the Martian day length is crucial for planning and coordinating activities on Mars, including scheduling the operations of rovers and landers, conducting experiments, and managing power systems. It allows mission controllers to synchronize their activities with the Martian environment and optimize the utilization of resources available during specific parts of the Martian day. Overall, the similarity in day length between Mars and Earth provides a convenient frame of reference for human missions to Mars and enables efficient planning and coordination of activities on the planet's surface."},{"instruction":"What is a good gun for home defense?","output":"That’s kinda like asking people what’s their favorite flavor of ice cream , first an foremost it should be a weapon that you are capable an comfortable with using , For me a 12 gauge short barrel shotgun with #4 buckshot , An second a small semi auto handgun , once again Caliber is something you need to find that is useable to you . Lots of ppl like to jump on the bigger the better bandwagon . But really that’s just a false sense of security for them , some ppl are not able to use a large caliber round ie a .45, sure you may get one round off , but no matter how tight of a grip you have on that weapon it’s going to move off target on recoil , An then it takes time to resight your target , lots of ppl like using the expression of Knock Down Power - well there’s no such thing period !! ! , this is something that Hollywood invented , An people can An will argue this all day long , for a lady or man that might be shall we say of small build that large weapon is pretty much useless no matter how much they practice and train with it as they’re just not able to control it , in this case I recommend a smaller lighter handgun like say a .380 , An yea your going to get ppl saying I don’t want no Mouse Gun , An hey that’s fine if they feel that it increases their lack of Manhood , however that person with the .380 is going to put 3 rounds in you before the one with the .45 can get a second shot at the bad guy , it really don’t matter how large of a weapon you have if you can’t accurately use it it’s pretty much worthless , And another fact that people fail to consider is that most of your poachers use a lowly 22 LR and are very successful with it , so my recommendation to you if you’re considering to get a fire arm for protection to try to find a shooting range close by , many of them will rent you various weapons to try out , there’s no such thing as one size fits all , and I know I’m going to get people replying oh well you know all the small calibers you’re not going to get the wound cavity and penetration that you will with a large around , 10 years ago that was partially true but now you can get smaller round ammo that is almost equivalent in performance to the larger rounds so that pretty much a mute point , and I saw earlier post where somebody mentioned getting a revolver and putting hollow points on it so the bad guy can see that you have hollow point ammunition , from 20 feet away I don’t think anybody can tell you what type of ammo you had a revolver especially with it being low light conditions , So I don’t know where they’re getting this idea from I guess maybe it sounded good to them , An aWheel Gun / Revolver is a good choice for many ppl , I just like the capacity of a Semi Auto , I myself prefer my 9mm+p ammo , an my ole trusty .357 Ruger is just a tad heavier to lug around .I can only offer real world experience , not some video game - Hollywood movie - bunch of guys sitting around shooting the breeze on something they have never really experienced in real life , Good Luck An go make some noise ,"},{"instruction":"What are some hobbies that will heal an INFJ?","output":"We are artists. Sometimes we are artists with a very limited idea about what that really means. I am currently going to a physio psychotherapist, which has been a fascinating journey. I am currently working on connecting my creative self (the free child spirit) with my dominate need to plan and track most aspects of my life in order to feel in control. So here are some of my outlets: Writing is a given. I make sure to write something every day. But writing the things that are not easily accessed is the true exercise. For me, it is a scene in my novel introducing a secondary main character. I've been struggling for months finding the right way to go with it. Dancing it out. 3 minutes of fast cardio is the easiest way to soothe the nervous system. Walking the 10 flights of stairs hard and fast to my apartment leaves anxiety in the dust. I am currently at a new position at my company that has me stationary when I am used to working in operations where I am walking, lifting and using my body all the time. This new project doesn't need that. So I have a standing desk, I take the tram and walk instead of drive. I hate the idea of exercise. I love the idea of using my body as a tool. I'm in a new home and am currently learning how to paint. I have zero natural talent, but each painting gets a little bit better than the one before it. (I'm using watercolor on white walls for fun) I have an interesting eye for photography. Again, rather than focusing on perfection or talent, I focus on expressing myself. I am also a passable camerawomen and a film editor. I need plants and trees and wind through the leaves. I garden as I am able in my apartment, but also love walking and hiking in the city, outside of the city and especially walking the kleingartens here in Leipzig. I lust after them and one day will have one of my own. I like leaving my house feeling like I am armored against the world. I am never going to be a huge fan of makeup nor much of a clothes horse. But I like feeling like I am protected. My INFP daughter is my fashion consultant and my muse. I love chunky earrings and adding color wherever possible. This is indeed a functional artform. I take my hair dying and the condition of my hair seriously. I love to cook when the mood strikes (very different from being required to when my kids were growing up). I will make a 3 course midnight snack when the mood strikes. I love color balance and presentation and I love giving others food orgasms. I am also talented at food porn photography. Talking shop with other artists. This is my social nirvana and inspires and energizes me. Writing, editing, books, movies, tv shows…breaking it all down with other storytellers makes me very happy. Crocheting is also another path to soothing the nervous system and giving orderly direction to my thoughts."},{"instruction":"Which is the affordable bulk SMS marketing service provider in Bangalore?","output":"Growth of every business resolves around its marketing strategy.

It’s just meant to be a joke. I don’t care about the X-Force or anything like that. Everyone is missing the objectively correct answer. The Vanisher, from Deadpool 2. This is the scene where he’s introduced. As you can see, he looks like he’ll be super cool. He’s probably going to be the best member of Deadpool’s team. Without him, they have absolutely no hope of success in rescuing the obnoxious kid who was put in jail. And yet, when it comes time for the mission, he simply goes and dies. At least the other members of the team, despite also dying before doing anything, held some conversation with the rest of the crew. But I mean, look at Brad Pitt’s character in the above image.

Parfum – Made up of 15-25% Fragrance Oils Do not confuse this with the word ‘Perfume' which you most probably will but these are most concentrated fragrances because of the 15-25% oils present in them. Parfums definitely last the longest but do not have the strong scent trail which more dilute Eau De Parfums do. 2. Eau De Parfum/ Parfum De Toilette – Made up of 8-15% Fragrance Oils You can definitely associate this with the ‘Perfume' you have been buying since ages because it has the standard oil percentage which comes in perfumes nowadays. Most noticeable and evident amongst all, Eau De Parfums are worn by most of us. These smell the best on special occasions but not when you go out in the severe heat. 3. Eau De Toilette – Made up of 4-10% Fragrance Oils Less concentrated fragrance for obvious reasons that it has 4-10% oils in it, Eau De Toilette is your everyday scent for warm weather. Not too strong, these are great for people who like breezy or lighter fragrance notes. 4. Eau De Cologne/ Cologne – Made Of 2-5% Fragrance Oils The least concentrated, Eau De Cologne is usually associated with men because of their light citric fragrance notes. But this doesn't mean that EDCs do not come for women, they definitely do in a lot of different scents. 5. Pour Homme/ Pour Femme – Homme is for men and Femme is for women This is widely known to many but not all. Pour Homme and Femme are just male and female in French. So, if you come across these terms, you know which one to buy. 6. Antiperspirants Sprays/Roll Ons – Helps contain and reduce sweat through its aluminium chloride ingredients Antiperspirant deodorants include aluminium chloride salts that dissolve into sweat, forming a gel that creates a mask on the sweat gland that helps reduce sweat. 7. Deodorants – Helps in containing body odour Do not confuse deodorants with antiperspirants because deodorants play the substitute role of perfumes and just give out fragrance which helps contain body odour (Antiperspirants stop sweat which causes body odour).

What do you think of this action? What are the consequences or how will this play out in the Middle East?","output":"In order to know what the action will be from Iran's end, it’s important to note the history between the US and Iran. In many respects, it has been focused on destabilization- meaning the countries have had animosity towards each other, but, in the case of Iran, there has been the avoidance of strictly getting into pure warfare. Let’s take this a step further and note an extremely important political event: The freeing of American Hostages upon Reagan’s election. This is extremely noteworthy not only because of the freeing of American hostages, but the reasoning as to why. At the time of this, the conflicts between the U.S and the Soviet Union were still fairly present. Apon electing a highly capitalistic US president, the cultural shift of the US at a time of extreme tension meant that, for an upcoming country like Iran, it was best to get out of the way from a new leader like Reagan- who’s temperament was unknown compared to the predecessor of Jimmy Carter. It acts on necessity. Now, let’s compare and contrast this to the positions of the US and Iran today. At this point in time, Donald Trump’s temperament is very well known, and it is Iran that is in a more destabilized position. Simply attending to the fact that Iran is now more destabilized and has an even greater ax to grind, it’s quick to come up to the assumption that Iran could try and begin forming violent conflicts with the U.S. But that’s not entirely the case. Let’s look at the other variables that are present: Iran is not as great of a powerhouse as it used to be in terms of oil manufacturing- and extremely high unemployment along with a currency value of 33333.33 Rial to 1 USD.They just lost someone who, in many respects, was a second-in-command of their state. This is a brutal shakeup when considering further destabilization of the country itself from a political standpoint, making it’s ruling more uncertain. He was a brutal fighting force for them, and his loss puts them at a much greater vulnerability.At the same time, the U.S is also politically shaken. The election in 2020 is incredibly pitting- meaning that the next leader of the country is too early to call, while at the same time, the country is notoriously divided within it’s parties. A soundable echo of the country won’t be backing greater war efforts within Iran.This also means any actions Iran takes right now will greatly affect their relations with the next leader of the US.U.S relations with China are already on thin ice as the country clearly begins to extend itself as a rival superpower, but it’s allegiance with Russia has also grown formidably tighter. Putin is clearly a tough leader, meaning that he is unlikely to act quickly unless these tensions affect Russia directly. This means, that until further notice, the superpowers likely to be involved are the U.S and China. However, under fighting forces in Hong Kong, China will be playing with fire with U.S forces under getting involved. There will be mostly seclusion from other countries until it directly affects them. That being said, what could this mean for conflicts with the US and Iran? Well, let’s begin by being clear about the positions- this would be a game of incredibly difficult offensive and defensive decisions on Iraq’s end- while the U.S’s tactics would be most intended under a more offensive strategy while securing general defensive strategies to deter further escalation. This is clear because, though tempered, Trump is not a war-president. He also cannot afford to further escalate conflicts with Iraq if he wants to continue rallying low commodity prices. If this begins to shift, it’s probably the indexes could begin to show further signs of panic- leading to a correction that would deter the index-fund hot-hoop strategy that most employers and investors use right now. Running into 2020, his best bet is the economy, not war. As a result, what we can predict from Iran will attempt to push U.S forces out- as a direct reaction that they can now explain, at a scale, they could not before. It’s likely Trump will continue to press on this issue- and there are two possible outcomes that form from this. A reaction from the Quds Force and it’s extreme reactivity towards this event will occur brutally inside of Baghdad- destabilizing the entire region and forcing national leaders to begin reacting and re-strategizing relationships with the Middle East. Iran will definitely begin facing further sanctions and could see a destabilizing revolt by citizens. The nation on it’s own will not react further, then focusing on defensive strategy. It will re-shape the country, but it’s effects will be seen most likely through the economy. You can begin to predict a surge of Quds potentially growing attacks and grow it reaches across the middle east, turning it into a political problem for whomever the incumbent president will be at the time. The Iran Nuclear deal will not be saved- and it will cause a panic in all countries- and thus, stabilization efforts from some countries, while others still poke. The US is likely to poke. If this continues to be a growing problem, it is possible at a later time, US forces may invade Iran under a Republican President after Trump.There will be independent attacks coming from INSIDERS in Quds force, demonstrations, and protests. The US will react minimally to these, and grow it’s a military base in quiet overtime to further prevent outbreaks. Iran will not react to any independent attacks, and those will continue as the region begins to further destabilize. Price hikes on imports are inevitable, and you can expect tariffs from the US to also expand as a result, but very slowly over time. Oil prices will be a problem for the next term. The Nuclear deal will not be saved, though there will be efforts to save it by mitigating the damage done. Other countries will take in greater benefits from their power and oil, and will force the US to try and re-open negotiations with Iran. These two broadly outline the reactions that will occur, as the attack is a destabilizing attempt, who effects will be played on extremely thin ice per attack so as not to break the defenses of Iran to the point in which it directly affects the US. Doing so will not bode well for any of the two countries. But the major note you’ll see here is conflict- because war will not be advisable for both countries. However, it will certainly become a problem for the U.S to find a way to deal with- as most destabilizing efforts can produce."},{"instruction":"What exercise can lose face fat?","output":"Seven Steps to Reduce Face Fat There are below Embrace a Balanced and Healthy Diet: To reduce face fat, it is essential to maintain a balanced and healthy diet. Focus on consuming nutrient-dense foods while limiting the intake of processed and sugary foods. Incorporate plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats into your meals. Opt for a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn, promoting overall fat loss, including in the face.Stay Hydrated: Drinking an adequate amount of water is crucial for overall health and can also help reduce face fat. Proper hydration keeps your body functioning optimally and aids in flushing out toxins. Additionally, staying hydrated can help prevent water retention, which can contribute to a bloated appearance in the face. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day.Engage in Regular Cardiovascular Exercise: Cardiovascular exercises, such as jogging, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking, can help burn calories and promote overall fat loss. Regular aerobic exercises elevate your heart rate, increasing your body's calorie expenditure and aiding in reducing excess fat, including in the face. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise per week.Incorporate Facial Exercises: While the effectiveness of facial exercises in reducing face fat is debated, some individuals find them beneficial for toning facial muscles and improving overall facial appearance. Facial exercises can target specific areas such as the jaw, cheeks, and neck. Examples of facial exercises include chin lifts, cheek presses, and jawline exercises. Remember to perform these exercises gently and consult a professional if you have any concerns.Practice Good Posture: Maintaining good posture can have a positive impact on your facial appearance. Slouching or poor posture can contribute to the appearance of a double chin or a less defined jawline. By sitting or standing upright and aligning your head, neck, and spine, you can enhance your facial contours and reduce the appearance of face fat.Get Sufficient Sleep: Adequate sleep is crucial for overall health, including maintaining a healthy weight and reducing face fat. Poor sleep can disrupt hormone levels, leading to increased appetite and potential weight gain. Strive for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support your overall well-being and weight management goals.Manage Stress Levels: Excessive stress can contribute to weight gain and water retention, potentially affecting the appearance of your face. Implement stress management techniques such as exercise, meditation, deep breathing, or engaging in hobbies to reduce stress levels. By managing stress effectively, you can help prevent weight gain and minimize the impact on your facial appearance.Your Can Also Use Below Products for Face Slimming [LINKED_TEXT: Navya Export Jawline Exerciser Tool Men Jaw Exerciser Jaw Exerciser For Men Jawine Shaper Jawline Exerciser Tool Women Face Exercise Equipment (Jawline)II JAWLINE EXCERCISER : II Say goodbye to chubby cheeks.

Here are some ways to better support these dedicated individuals: Adequate funding: Donor countries and international organizations should provide sufficient financial resources to peacekeeping missions in Mali. This funding can be used to enhance the capabilities of peacekeepers, improve infrastructure, and provide necessary equipment and supplies.Training and capacity building: Invest in comprehensive training programs for peacekeepers, including training in conflict resolution, mediation, cultural sensitivity, and human rights. Strengthening their skills and knowledge will enable them to effectively navigate complex situations on the ground.Security and logistics support: Ensure peacekeepers have access to adequate security measures and logistics support. This includes providing proper equipment, transportation, communication systems, and medical facilities. Enhancing their safety and operational capabilities is essential for their effectiveness and well-being.Collaboration and coordination: Foster greater collaboration and coordination among different peacekeeping missions, regional organizations, and local authorities in Mali. This will help streamline efforts, share information, and avoid duplication of tasks. Cooperation between peacekeepers and local communities is vital to build trust and achieve sustainable peace.Addressing root causes: Recognize that peacekeeping efforts must go beyond military interventions. Addressing the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, inequality, and governance issues, is crucial. Supporting development programs, promoting good governance, and engaging in dialogue with all stakeholders can contribute to long-term peace and stability.Support for local communities: Provide support to local communities affected by the conflict. This can include humanitarian aid, infrastructure development, education, and economic opportunities. By addressing the needs of the population, peacekeepers can build stronger relationships and foster sustainable peace.Mental health and well-being: Prioritize the mental health and well-being of peacekeepers. The demanding and often traumatic nature of their work can have long-lasting effects. Establish support systems, counseling services, and regular rest and recuperation periods to help them cope with the stress and challenges they face.Public awareness and advocacy: Raise public awareness about the importance of peacekeeping missions in Mali. Advocate for continued support from governments, international organizations, and civil society. Promote understanding and empathy among the global community to garner more support and resources for peacekeeping efforts. Remember, supporting peacekeepers in Mali is a collective responsibility. It requires the commitment and engagement of governments, international organizations, local communities, and individuals to create a safer and more peaceful environment."},{"instruction":"w do I combine Word documents into a PDF?","output":"To convert .doc files (Microsoft Word documents) to .pdf files, you can · Open the .doc file in Microsoft Word. · Click on \\"File\\" in the top left corner. · Choose \\"Save As\\" or \\"Export.\\" · Select \\"PDF\\" from the format options. · Choose the location to save the PDF file and click \\"Save.\\" [LINKED_TEXT: https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=793442&brand=fiverrcpa&landingPage=https%3A%2F%2Fln.run%2FsRJaD] [URL: https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=793442&brand=fiverrcpa&landingPage=https%3A%2F%2Fln.run%2FsRJaD]"},{"instruction":"What hiking gear should I never buy?","output":"It's important to be cautious when shopping for hiking gear.

I was a manager at a retail store. 8 months pregnant and huge. I absolutely loved my job, my employees and my customers. I had a few favorites. One was a former Green Beret, who at this time was working as a Sheriff. His life's work made for a lonely existence. He was never married. Most of his blood relatives had passed away. I wasn't the “back room” manager type. I loved to be visible, active, and available to everyone. Every single time the Sheriff came in, we always enjoyed long conversations. If he didn’t immediately see me, he would ask who the manager-on-duty was to see if I was there. This particular day, I was scheduled to close the store. An employee had checked the schedule and chose this particular day to attempt his deed, because he had me pegged as the easiest target. He asked me if we could speak privately in the office. I said, “Sure!” We went into the office, shut the door, then we both sat. The next thing he did was pull out a gun. He pointed it at me and demanded that I open the safe and give him the contents. He was shaking and sweating profusely. So I asked him, “You're hooked on heroin, aren't you?” He said, “Yes, how did you know?” I explained that I had a brother who was also hooked, so I knew what they go through. He went on to threaten that if I didn't open the safe right now, he'd shoot me in the head, then in my stomach, so neither my baby or I would be savable. I told him no. Let's talk about this. We talked for hours. I told him my brother's story. Gun still pointed at me as he shook violently. I asked him if he would put the gun down so he didn't accidentally fire it. He was shaking so violently, I was worried his finger would jerk against the trigger. About 6 hours into being held, the Sheriff came in. He looked around and didn't see me, so he asked who was on duty. He was told it was me, so he asked my employee to get me. They came to the back, knocked on my office door, and let me know I was being requested by someone. I yelled through the closed door that I was busy at the moment and unable to come out. This is something I never did, ever. I always made myself available. My employee went back out and told the Sheriff what I said. He asked when was the last time anyone saw me on the floor. He was told that during my whole shift, I was in the office. He knew I was in some kind of trouble. He asked my employee to contact the district manager right away and let them know we had a situation. He then called some friends in the police department and requested every available officer right now, with no sirens. Within 5 minutes, the store was flooded by police and they kicked the office door in. Because I had my employee put down the gun, they were able to grab him before he could shoot. They cuffed him and put him in the back of their vehicle. The Sheriff was waiting off to the side with a comforting hug, and letting me know he knew I needed help and that he had organized my rescue. I was so thankful. It was the craziest experience ever. Best wishes."},{"instruction":"Can I keep my dog with me in a hostel in GMCH, Chandigarh?","output":"No hostel will permit the inmates to keep their pet.

What will be the consequences?","output":"What happens if 1 Rupee = 1 USD? – Pros and Cons As it is always a race in currency exchange market, 1 USD vs INR, every Indian wish is that Why cant be 1 Rupee = 1 US Dollar? This is the question quite similar to “Why cant we just print money to pay all the debt?” Pros and Cons of Dollar equals RupeeThere are some pros and cons to this situation. But lets see what happens if overnight or in very short period of time Dollar equals to Rupee. First of all the high value of currency does not mean that the economy of the country is stronger. If that was the case then Bangladesh would have a stronger economy than Japan. Because 1 BDT = 1.4 Yen. 1 Rupee = 1 Dollar – Pros Now Pros of the situation. 1. Buying Goods will be cheaper for Indians in the International Market. Because this will make imports cheaper which is good for a developing country. 2. Buying luxurious goods will be cheaper. For example, an iphone will cost just INR 650 which is cheaper than the current market rate. 3. As import prices are cheaper, then petrol prices will be cheaper resulting in cheaper transportation cost of goods around the country. These looks like quite a good scenario. But this will not last long for the situation. Because other side of the story is completely different. 1 Rupee = 1 USD – ConsNow Cons of the Situation 1. Exports will be expensive if value of Indian rupee and dollar are the same. Because Indian products will be expensive compared to other competing nations. Indian exports have been booming well in recent years. If it is expensive, why would any country buy from India when other competitors can offer the same at cheaper price. 2. There would be no foreign Investment if Rupee equals dollar. The primary reason for a foreign investment in India is the cheapest labour cost. Foreign companies will not be investing in India when the cost of labour is higher compared to other countries. 3. Service sector contributes almost 60% in GDP and give 27% employment in India. Investment in IT Sector and Service Sector which contributes huge amount for the Indian Economy will be gone if 1 Dollar is equal to 1 Rupee. Now as 1USD= 1INR why any company will pay to an employee USD 60,000 or Rs .60,000 per month if they can hire someone outside who will do the same work for USD 3000 or Rs.3000. Eventually people will loose job which will increase unemployment. 4. When money does not come into India, it will result in complete economic slowdown. 5. Outsourcing of job in India will be stopped. 6. Companies which are presently in India will start to move out as it will not be profitable for them. Similar situation happened in India during 2007-08 when dollar was strong around Rs.40, the imports were good. But the BPO and IT Sectors suffered a lot. VerdictThe situation of 1 Rupee = 1 USD is just not affordable for a growing or developing country."},{"instruction":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

That can be anything at all, and frequently is. Here in the States, all the big cities and suburbs have places that are open 24/7, including police stations, hospitals, restaurants, hotels, service entities like fire departments an other first-responders, and businesses that deal extensively in foreign markets. Under these circumstances, it is often tough to have traditional breakfast foods to break the sleeping fast (that’s the origin of the word.) Traditional US breakfast foods include eggs prepared several ways, often with meats such as bacon, sausage, and scrapple (here in Philly and the surrounding regions, it’s a favorite), and some kind of fried potato dish. Pancakes, waffles, quiches, and hot (e.g., oatmeal, grits, farina) and cold cereals (there are hundreds of options) are common. Some fast-food places offer breakfast burritos, typically scrambled eggs, cheese, and a “breakfast” meat wrapped in a tortilla. Some breakfast foods are appropriate for lunch, brunch (a combination of breakfast and lunch often featuring the breakfast foods and lunch foods), and even for dinner (because, why not?) and some dinner meats are now routinely served at breakfast, including kielbasa and ham. Steak and eggs is common. In other words, the picture is blurred and loses even more focus when vegetarian, vegan, and continental options are chosen. For a lot of time-pressed Americans rushing to work, leftover Chinese, pizza, or fried chicken makes a meal. For others, it’s a V-8 and an apple or banana. Sometimes, a coffee and a breakfast sandwich rom a drive-through, or a doughnut (or two, or a toasted bagel with cream cheese works.

I’d like to offer this: Relationships and interactions are a “system”. Two people interacting forms one system. Add a third person, another system. Add a fourth person and another system is created. And so on. We know how to read prople because we have experimented early on with understanding (interpersonal) systems. I’ll spare you the, “I observe people, watch people,” etc. That is a given. We all do that. People who are good at reading and/or manipulating are good with these systems. It’s part of the calculation and cunning that we’ve developed as a result of our experiences. If I/you have interacted with various personality types from early on, which is not hard to do unless you live under a rock, we have stored the data in our memory banks. We do this because it may serve a purpose down the road. For instance, we meet a person who worries a lot. We see their mannerisms. We see their reactions to good or bad news. And so on. All of data has been collected. Now it’s what I do with the data going forward that is of use. Fast forward to 18–20 years old, I am in a group setting, say 4/5 people, and their is a person who worries more so than others, I have that data “catalogued”, if you will. I may say something to another person in the group to “test” the person that worries a lot. I am playing and manipulating the system. I am gauging how the person reacts and comparing it to what I already know. Some may call it pattern recognition. Whatever floats your boat. I have “catalogued” many, many personalities. Now I just have to ask the right questions early on, observe a new person for a short period of time to pull up the catalogued personality and now I have a general meeting template for how to read and manipulate the system to my advantage. Within about 2–5 minutes I can usually have a pretty good handle on what type of person I’m dealing with-the hot shot, the anxious person, the elitist, etc. To me, this is where the idea of knowing how to “push someone’s buttons” comes from. Knowing how to “work someone over”, con someone, tell a sob story, play the “game”, etc. These are all mechanism geared at reading and tinkering within a given system. Narcissists, psychopaths, sociopaths have catalogued/ pattern recognized, and are willing (risking) to manipulate systems more than the typical person because we gain something from it. There is motivation and prior success that allows us to read and operate in systems we occupy and play in."},{"instruction":"My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52.

But I would like to ellaborate on the term ‘assault weapon’, aka ‘assault style weapon’ or ‘millitary style weapon’. Assault rifles are pretty well defined and mostly unavailable to civilians unless you have a lot of money and a very clean criminal record. So gun grabbers have created a new term to classify more guns they can try to ban, enters state left the ‘assault weapon’. The definition for assault weapon varies wildly from place to place. But in general, they just mean a gun that looks scary. Below are two very popular rifles. They are chambered for the same medium size cartridge (the .223 Remington). They use the same semi-automatic action - one bullet per trigger pull. They have the same length and the same weight. They also have the same 30 rounds magazine capacity. I think you can spot right away which one gun grabbers call the assault weapon. But next time you hear the AR-15 being called an assault weapon, pull out this picture above and ask them to explain what exactly makes the scary looking gun more dangerous than the wooden one. Than come back here and explain it all to us gun nuts. Because we are all dying to find out what makes the AR-15 more dangerous than other guns."},{"instruction":"English is an almost grammarless language. — Richard Grant White. What do you make of this statement?","output":"Richard Grant White lived from 1822 to 1885, therefore dying before Ferdinand de Saussure’s Cours de linguistique generale founded modern linguistics. Like other educated people of his day, his notions of grammar were drawn from studying Latin. Latin had ‘real’ grammar, and everything else was inferior, and more so as it departed from Latin. In his terms, English does indeed have little in the way of grammar—meaning is almost entirely determined by word order, whereas in Latin the word order is largely irrelevant because the structure of the sentence is around the morphology and inflection of the words themselves. In modern terms, his statement makes no sense at all. Otto Jespersen’s Grammar of the English Language ran to seven volumes.

The first one is there is something wrong with our theory of gravity, and there is an extra term that increases as a function of distance BUT remains small enough to be undetectable in the solar system level. The problem with that concept is first. it is ad hoc in that there is no evidence for it at distances we can test, and it will involve bot a term and a function that just have to be put at certain values to make it work. The biggest problem is probably the function because I suspect it will need more terms than one additional one, and it probably will mess with General Relativity. That means we have to throw out a lot that we are very happy with just to get a possible answer to this problem. The alternative is there is a whole lot of matter there that we cannot see. By itself,l that is far from impossible; all we ask is we have matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic field. Up to a point we already have that: neutrinos. They are far too small to account for this, and because of their size they tend to travel at near light speed, but there is no reason why there cannot be heavier versions. The problems with this explanation are (a) this additional matter has to be present in galaxies at similar matter distributions. Again, not impossible, but it is disturbingly awkward that there aren’t some galaxies short of it. Of course, maybe there are and we just haven’t collected the data. The other problem is that all our attempts to measure it and determine what it is have failed so far. However, there may be reasons for this. First, there may not be very much of it in the solar system; note we have no gravitational anomalies so the density of it must be small. Second, we may not be looking properly. The experiments have tended to involve things that we can detect. Some of the guesses involve finding heavy particle decays but that is very unlikely because we have no evidence old galaxies behave differently from new ones, all other things being equal. So we are left with a problem, and while we have two possible candidate solutions, neither is convincing."},{"instruction":"Were WW2 mosquito pilots really labelled as crazy?","output":"They were mostly hiding in the dark; some Mosquito units had absurdly low losses for the number of sorties.

Small ones. Big ones. But the most remarkable are those, that promise a future with permanent change. Change that is uplifting, stirring, and impactful. Sushant Singh’s untimely death created shockwaves and has almost started a revolution of sorts, for genuinely embracing quality content, without the nepotistic forces at play. Dil Bechara will be the movie that shall usher the new age of Indian cinema into greener pastures. Built on the bedrock of the death of a star that was revered, loved, and cherished by the masses, Dil Bechara holds a special place in cinematic history. In all honesty, Dil Bechara is by no means a cinematic masterpiece, nor does it have stellar performances that break the glass ceiling in terms of acting pedigree. But what it does have is an honest, earnest attempt to portray the uncertainties of life, survival, and the many emotions that are felt when faced with the inevitable, by gentle uncertain beating hearts. Though there is a constant feeling of dread and death lurking around the corner, Dil Bechara manages to fight those moments with some beautiful lines and set pieces that infuse an immediate rush of positivity and hope. A remake of the immensely popular The Fault in our Stars, Dil Bechara walks a tight rope in terms of adapting it for the Indian audience without leaning towards the Hollywood adaptation. For me, though the chemistry between Sushant and Sanjana Singh did not match the intensity as shared by Augustus Walters and the wonderful Shailene Woodley, it does hold its own in a way that outsizes its imperfections. Adding to it is the maestro A.R. Rahman’s haunting score that plays a pivotal role in setting the tone and pace of the film. For me, the main differentiator between the Hollywood version and the Bollywood version is in the execution. While the fault in the stars took more of a coming-of-age route, Dil Bechara focuses much on the love story between the charming duo. The coupling of Kizie Basu, a thyroid cancer patient compelled to perenially carry an oxygen tank around, and Immanuel Rajkumar Junior (Manny) whose bout of osteosarcoma left him with an amputated leg is an odd but immensely warm and affable one. It is this coupling that is the beating heart of the film. Manny is the more spirited one, a hardcore Rajni fan, which complements the infectious energy that Rajput brings to the film. It's refreshing to see Rajput bring this version by choosing not to go the oh-i-am-so-manly-cool route but instead dials up the charm meter whenever on screen. The transition of an initially reserved Kizie falling for his charm thus becomes largely believable. A shout out to the excellent (Sahil Vaid), playing Manny’s friend who brings much needed comic relief and a sense of believability to everlasting friendship in a film that basks on things never lasting forever. Swastika Mukherjee and Saswata Chatterjee play perfect foil as Kizie’s concerned parents, who lend much-needed depth to the source material as dark as this. Dil Bechara involves a subplot of hunting down an obscure author “Abhimanyu Veer”, (played by Saif Ali Khan in a bizarre cameo) as a tool to fulfill Kizie’s bucket list of sorts. It here where the film stumbles and the plot looks seemingly rushed in places without actually exploring the dynamics between Kizie and Manny when they are on their own while being most vulnerable. All in all Dil Bechara is a celebration of life as much as it is dealing with the realities of death. It's a movie that isn't perfect but definitely meets its expectations. Dil Bechara pays a fitting tribute to Sushant’s irresistible charm, earnestness, and energy. It shall always be the movie that though had its burning flame extinguished, it managed to spark a wildfire, a revolution. No one can deny that."},{"instruction":"What kind of food do people from the UK eat that is considered an acquired taste to the rest of the world?","output":"Haggis.

Owing to the hitting nostalgia and the fact that they will be witnessing Sushant’s work for the last time, some people have in the spin of emotions, have started giving Dil Bechara a rating of 9.6 on IMDB. Emotional Fools! I won’t be mincing my words and will not nerf the facts. Acting: Sushant- Om Shanti to the Great Soul, you will always be missed ! .Standard Sushant Singh performance, Natural and Suitable like always , he lived the character upto the standard level that movies demand from the actors. He looked absolutely convincing in the role of an optimistic and over-jolly young man, who doesn’t give two hoots about the world.Dialogue delivery, motion-conceiving was good and he justified the role. But realism was missing from the movie, Sushant looked like perfectly fine and fit individual, perhaps too fit for an amputee! and amputated legs come with motional constraints and the fashion in which an amputated person moves and translates is certainly not showed in the movie. Let alone dancing and throwing your legs in frenzy, which was showed in the title track. Overall Sushant did his part excellently , but there was a lapse from the director’s end. Ratings: 4.5/5 (1/2 star deduced due to director’s lapse)Sanajana Sanghi- Looked confused and naive, owing to her young age(23). She pulled off the role in a mediocre manner.She was somehow okay in her job. But again, the same problem of realism struck back. A cancer patient who is on regular high-concentrated dose of anti-carcinogenic drugs doesn’t look as impeccable as Miss Sanghi did. Her hairs were perfectly fine, her skin was overly smooth and fine, basically she looked too much pretty for the role for a terminal Thyroid cancer patient who needs regular oxygen supply. Cancer is brutal and rips apart people, cancer patients that too on terminal end, don’t look so glossy. Ratings: 3/5 (1/2 star deduced due to director’s lapse)Sahil Vaidya- Absolutely convincing and perhaps did the most marvellous job in the movie as the best friend and side kick of the protagonist. Completely justified his character with the right amount of Bihari accent(thanks for that). His comic timing was also accurate and to the point. Pulled off the job really well. Ratings: 5/5.Father-Mother duo- They are legends of Bengali Cinema.They both Pulled off the jobs of a concerned caring mother and joyful NatGeo-loving father in a great way. Of course, it would have been far better if some more insights about Kizie and her parents relationship would have been showed into the movie. I guess their role was not given the due footage. Ratings: 5/5 Story: Completely bogus and rotten cliche concept. The same age-old poetic lie about love healing everything and this-that. Nothing new to offer. The book was overrated and so was the original hollywood adaptation. Rating 1/5 Summary: The movie can only be watched in a remembrance of a great soul that left us devastated and confused. Sushant is the only USP of the movie, the only shinning star.The nostalgia makes the movie look better than it actually is. Personally felt that the movie should have been a little, say 30 mins longer to show some more aspects of Manny and Kizie’s individual lives, Manny’s family was completely ignored and it would also have given us more time to cherish our beloved on the screen Sigh!, but Still, that does not hides the fact that the movie is a utter piece of crap and had Sushant been alive, the movie would be mercilessly trolled. The movie can solely watched as an ode to our beloved actor, otherwise it offers nothing new. Final Rating: (2+1)/5 (one star extra for Sushant)"},{"instruction":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","output":"Your life is a canvas.

Hanuman is a revered deity in Hinduism, known for his strength, courage, and devotion. Chanting a Hanuman mantra with sincerity and faith is believed to help overcome difficulties, remove obstacles, and offer protection from negative energies like bad luck and black magic. Here is a Hanuman mantra that is believed to be effective in removing bad luck and black magic: \\"Om Shree Hanumate Namaha\\" This mantra is a simple yet powerful chant that invokes Hanuman's blessings and protection. You can recite this mantra multiple times a day, ideally in the morning or evening, or whenever you feel the need for protection and positive energy. It's important to note that chanting a mantra alone may not be enough to remove the effects of black magic or bad luck. It's always advisable to seek the guidance of a knowledgeable and trusted spiritual advisor or healer for specific remedies and guidance. Hanuman Chalisa is a devotional hymn dedicated to Lord Hanuman, a revered deity in Hinduism. It is composed of 40 verses or \\"chaupais\\" in Awadhi language, a dialect of Hindi. The Hanuman Chalisa is considered to be a powerful prayer that invokes Hanuman's blessings and protection. Here are the first few verses of the Hanuman Chalisa in English: \\"Jai Hanuman gyan gun sagar, Jai Kapis tihun lok ujagar Ram doot atulit bal dhama, Anjani-putra Pavan sut nama.

The mighty warrior and the valiant one with a thunderbolt-like physique, The one who destroys negativity and enhances positive qualities.

Just try to master onesport like cricket. Watch all matches (mens womens domestic). Slowely cut yourmistakes and at the end you will succeed. 2-Suppose you have chosen Cricket. Now there are many things on which you can bet.Sessions, Wicket Not, Match Trading, Odd even Tie etc. In this also there are manythings like picking Chase Team or defend or Doing sessions Yes or Not , Player run Yesor Not. I will Suggest here also to focus only on one thing. Either only playNot/Defend or Only play Yes/Chase. This may seems a joke to you but i myself havewithdrawn 48 Lakhs from ID (winning amount whose video proof i have shared in mychannel). I only focused on Wicket Not & Defend team and today i can beat books anydayanytime. It was not at all easy but i gave my 5 years of precious time in this CricketBetting. Now coming to the topic 100 out of 99 people loses their money and all of them playsboth Defend and Chase as well as Yes & Not. What interesting thing one should noticeis no one wants to study why they are losing. What i am saying is in Yes or Not alsoyou try to master only one thing. Try to come close to expert level by doing andthinking only one thing ( I chosen Not) 3-Last is Withdraw daily and keep your limit in check as always. Playing in your limits(no need to say plz do not take loan sell your things for betting). First study and get ajob or do any business and then use 20% of that income in betting. Refill and playsmall.

Every time I went out of my class and I saw him standing near the railings my “dil would go zmmmmm” 😂 I had such a huge crush on him but never had the courage to tell him how attractive I find him and how cute he looks in uniform (sad fact: we had uniform in our college) though I was not courageous enough to tell him but I was stupid enough to tell about this to a classmate who later I came to know is her cousin sister T_T … So in short he got to know about my feelings before I could tell him , but he never confronted me or tried to talk neither did I (I was a little shy and embarrassed too because of the way he came to know about this crush thing) but he started noticing me and used to smile every time we had an eye-contact FAST FORWARD almost two months passed with no response or effort on both sides and I thought may be he’s not interested BUT fine day we had a cultural event in our college , I was busy in the event as I was involved in temporary tattoo making , although I was busy with the work but at times i used to wonder what if my crush comes to our stall what a moment it would be ……but none of that happened and it was time to wrap up the things and go back to the buses . I was so tired with all the work I did and was going back to the bus parking with heavy steps when suddenly I heard somebody calling my name When I turned around i was bewildered to see my crush waving at me , he was sitting with his friends in the ground and asked me to join them . I walked towards them thinking “whyyy god why of all these days when I look like a horrible mess he suddenly wants to talk to me” I went and sat down with them and this is how the conversation went CRUSH : Hi, kaha thi aaj poora din dikhi hi nahi (where were you? didn't see you the whole day) ME: aree, woh actually stall k kaam main busy thi (I was busy with the event work) HIS FRIEND(she's a girl lets call her Disha) : tu tattoo vale stall pe thi na? ( you were a part of tattoo making) CRUSH: ohoo tu sabke tatto bana rahi thi mere nahi banaegi ( will you not make a tattoo for me?) le me : (thinking) Bhagwaan aaj ye kya ho raha ( goddd what's happening today) ME (after a long pause) : haan haan, pen se bana dun abhi vahi hai mere pass (should I make it with pen, that's the only thing I have at the moment) And then moved little closer to me and held his hand up to me and said “acha sa banaiyo kuch” (make something nice) My heart was beating so fast as if it was going to burst ,with trembling fingers I held his hand and started drawing on his hand. And I was like “tham jae pal ye yahi bus mai ye sochun, sochun main tham jae ye pal ye paas mere jab ho tum” ( I wish I could stop this moment here) I just wanted to remember as much as I could, I wanted to remember how his hand felt how weird and nice at the same time is this feeling. I just wanted to encapsulate every minute detail his every expression , every moment i just hoped that it stays vivid and intact in my memory forever the entire four minutes and 26 second I held his hand I couldn't stop blushing and smiling , and whenever i used to look up he’s cute smile would make me look down shyly. after I finished he looked at me and said “acha hai” (it’s nice) , then I also drew on his friend’s hand. And how could this meeting end without a picture, this picture is the proof of the time when I felt closest to my crush the hand with black ink on it is mine and besides it is my crush’s hand and the third hand is of Disha P.S: I drew a heartbeat because my heart beating was the only prominent thing that I could feel at that time :)🤍"},{"instruction":"w often do popular Quora users go anonymous?","output":"I've never thought of myself as a popular Quora user, but I guess after having been a 2016 top writer and recently reached 1k followers, I’ll have to face that there are a decent number of fellow Quorans who sort of like my content. That said: I haven't, yet, gone anonymous. Which is easy enough for me to pull off. I live in one of the most socially liberal cities of a rather socially liberal country. I work in a field where very few prospective employers will care much, if at all, about your social media presence, as long as you don't go openly spouting Neonazi propaganda or inciting violence - neither of which I'm in the least inclined to do. I am lucky enough to have rather liberal parents and friends who are unlikely to be shocked by most sexual or social ‘deviations’ I could come out about — and, boringly, I’m a basically straight cisgender guy without any heavy duty fetishes, apart from a moderate interest in / curiosity about the whole BDSM thing.

I'm an agnostic leaning atheist — which is just barely not officially the majority position here in Berlin, in part due to my still officially being a member of the German Lutheran Protestant Church.

Are we seeking Him or what He can give or do for us? Second is: Do we even KNOW Him? If you are not seeking to know God through reading His Word [at LEAST the New Testament] then you are wasting your time even if you go to church every day. We do not get to know God through ritual. We get to know Him through relationship and that means EFFORT through reading His Word and talking to Him. Ask Him to give you His Spirit so you may know Him as He is, not for who you think He is.

This is effectively the primary key of the record, if you want to use a database analogy. That said, you’ll soon find that the database analogy is a poor one when it comes to Kafka. You can retrieve a specific record by connecting a free consumer (without specifying a consumer group), assigning it the partition in question and seeking to the offset of the record that you wish to read. Of course, this assumes that the record exists. (Kafka truncates old records based on its configured retention policy.) This is a bit of work — unfortunately, Kafka does not provide you with a straightforward way of reading a specific record. And there is a good reason for that: Kafka is not designed around individual record retrieval. Kafka’s strength is in the processing of unbounded streams of records. Still, it can be done. Finding arbitrary records, on the other hand, is not a trivial task, as Kafka is not a database, despite what people would want you to believe. In other words, Kafka does not provide you with an efficient means of searching for records based on arbitrary attributes, as this requires a user-definable secondary index (which Kafka does not have and probably never will). If you need to locate arbitrary records, you essentially have two options at your disposal: Topic scan. Brute-force read through all the records in the topic, filtering the ones you need. This may work for small, compacted topics; however, it is impractical for any decently-sized topic.Materialised view. Consume the records and populate a separate read-optimised view that will support the types of queries needed by your use cases. This takes a bit more up-front work but pays dividends down the track. This is also the idiomatic way of finding historical records. We’ll come back to this in a moment. But what if you need to locate records in real-time, as they arrive? This seems like it should be right in the ballpark of Kafka’s capabilities, being an event-streaming platform. And in fact, it is. There is an excellent open-source project designed to augment Kafka with SQL-like capabilities called ksqlDB. It is an event streaming database for Kafka. Like the platform that it is built upon, ksqlDB is distributed, scalable, reliable, and (near) real-time. It combines the power of real-time stream processing with the approachable feel of a relational database through a lightweight SQL syntax that should hopefully be familiar to most developers. If you think about it, there is little difference between real-time stream processing and the processing of historical records. From a consumer’s perspective, everything is historical. But as we learned, processing historical data is slow, amounting to a full range scan. If only we could cache this data as we process it, to make subsequent queries faster? It turns out we can: ksqlDB allows you to define materialised views over your streams and tables. Materialised views are defined by what is known as a persistent query. These queries are known as persistent because they maintain their incrementally updated results using a table. CREATE TABLE hourly_metrics AS SELECT url, COUNT(*) FROM page_views WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 1 HOUR) GROUP BY url EMIT CHANGES; Results may be \\"pulled\\" from materialized views on demand via SELECT queries. The following example will return a single row: SELECT * FROM hourly_metrics WHERE url = 'http://myurl.com' AND WINDOWSTART = '2019-11-20T19:00'; Hopefully, this gives you all the answers to you need to be able to query Kafka for records. If you would like to learn more about Kafka, I would recommend my book: Effective Kafka: A hands-on guide to building robust and scalable event-driven applications. It focuses on the core platform and covers a broad range of topics, ranging from beginner to advanced skill levels, with lots of examples.

If you study the behavior of modern people, you’ll notice two very different characteristic behaviors that evolved in ancient humans. One character trait can be traced back to people who were exiting Africa through the Levant at a time that Neanderthals were living there. The character traits which these people inherited made them very aggressive, with tendencies toward conflict, cannibalism, and genocide. Since some modern people have traits that are completely opposed to those that were inherited by exiting Africa through the Levant, it stands to reason that there was another group of people who took an alternate route out of Africa, one that did not require traveling through Western Asia. The most likely alternate route would require crossing from Northwestern Africa to the Iberian Peninsula by boat. Searching for ancient haplogroups that originated in Africa that also could be found in Iberia might lead you to maternal haplogroup L2a1k. This is a haplogroup that is exclusively Iberian, but has recent relatives primarily in Africa. These genes would have had to cross the Mediterranean by boat to arrive in Iberia. The estimated time of arrival of the genes which crossed from Africa to Iberia is 10,300 +/- 5,150 years ago. These genes do not exist in Africa prior to 13,700 years ago. This is significant, because it means that the time of arrival could have coincided with a global catastrophe which would have created mega tsunamis on the coast of West Africa and Western Europe, and probably throughout the world. The Younger Dryas Impact occurred 12,880 years ago. Climate change events which preceded the impact and which follow the impact led to accelerated evolution (increased rate of genetic mutations) in humans and Eurasian mammoths that were living in the far north. The climate change, as well as the impact event, caused mass extinction of many species throughout the world. The genetic mutations which were created in humans may have had a profound effect on human behavior. At any rate, a time of mass migration, conflict, genetic replacement, and cultural change began to occur after the impact event. 10,000 years ago a Y-chromosome bottleneck (a time of reduced diversity of reproducing males, or male genocide) began to occur, which led to the extinction of most of the male haplogroups of the Iberian Peninsula. The first wave of people who began to migrate into the Iberian Peninsula were Middle Eastern farmers (which led to the story of Cain, an aggressive Canaanite farmer, who kills Abel, a peaceful Iberian shepherd, and a snake that tempted Eve with the fruit of his garden). At the same time, people began to mine copper in North America’s Lake Superior (a likely epicenter for the impact event that melted the Laurentide ice sheet and caused global flooding), and copper began to be used in the Mediterranean, in pre-dynastic Egypt, the Near East, and the Middle East. While searching for the origin of people who are not aggressive and not cannibalistic, I found something that may be a clue. At the time that the Hittites were at war with the Egyptians, there is a peace treaty that was created between the two groups. The peace treaty is thought to have been negotiated by a third party intermediary. At that time, there were people living between the Egyptians and Hittites who were independent people, they were not draw towards civilization, they were not draw towards conflict. They were called Iberu, Apiru, Habiru, or Haberi. The word Eber (as in Hebrew) means “over”. It has the same meaning as Iber (as in Iberian), and Aber (as in Abram, Abraham, and Abel). The name Abraham could be interpreted as Iberian-African. The ancient Iberians are believed to have had a culture that was very different than the Eurasian Canaanites (Biblical Cain, named for the moon god Cin or Sin) that exited Africa through the Levant. They seem to have a very egalitarian culture, and buried their dead in communal graves. This would be a culture that is very similar to the Native American Ancestral B, the Old Copper Culture (the people who began mining copper in Lake Superior 9,600 years ago) that buried their dead in communal graves, did not have wounds related to conflict, did not wear ornamentation to represent social status, but wore clothing that was utilitarian. The people of the Old Copper Culture were fishers and carpenters, they made copper tools that they used to build boats for deep sea fishing. They had the same culture and occupation as many of the ancient Hebrews. The aboriginal Iberians, the ancient Hebrews, and the Native American Ancestral B may have all been people with ancestors who crossed “over” the Mediterranean at some point in time. So, the idea of “Biblical Noah” being a person who crossed the Mediterranean or the Atlantic near the time of a global catastrophe which caused world wide flooding, it’s entirely possible. There is plenty of archaeological, geological, and genetic research which could suggest that it did actually occur. [LINKED_TEXT: TERRESTRIAL EVIDENCE OF A NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE IN PALEOINDIAN TIMESFrom: THE MAMMOTH TRUMPET (March 2001) TERRESTRIAL EVIDENCE OF A NUCLEAR CATASTROPHE IN PALEOINDIAN TIMES [ PDF version includes tables, figures, etc. ] [ updated response to post publication questions ][ .doc version ] by Richard B. Firestone, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and William Topping, Consultant, Baldwin, Michigan THE PALEOINDIAN OCCUPATION of North America, theoretically the point of entry of the first people to the Americas, is traditionally assumed to have occurred within a short time span beginning at about 12,000 yr B.P. This is inconsistent with much older South American dates of around 32,000 yr B.P. 1 and the similarity of the Paleoindian toolkit to Mousterian traditions that disappeared about 30,000 years ago. 2 A pattern of unusually young radiocarbon dates in the Northeast has been noted by Bonnichsen and Will. 3,4 Our research indicates that the entire Great Lakes region (and beyond) was subjected to particle bombardment and a catastrophic nuclear irradiation that produced secondary thermal neutrons from cosmic ray interactions. The neutrons produced unusually large quantities of 239 Pu and substantially altered the natural uranium abundance ratios ( 235 U/238 U) in artifacts and in other exposed materials including cherts, sediments, and the entire landscape. These neutrons necessarily transmuted residual nitrogen ( 14 N) in the dated charcoals to radiocarbon, thus explaining anomalous dates. The evidence from dated materials We investigated a cluster of especially young radiocarbon dates concentrated in the north-central area of North America. For example, at the Gainey site in Michigan a 2880 yr B.P. radio-carbon date was reported, while the thermoluminescence date for that site is 12,400 yr B.P. 5 Other anomalous dates found at Leavitt in Michigan, 6 Zander and Thedford in Ontario, 7 Potts in New York, 8 Alton in Indiana, 9 and Grant Lake in Nunavut 10 are summarized in Table 1. The Grant Lake Paleoindian site is most remarkable because its 160 [rc] yr B.P. age is nearly contemporary, while adjacent and deeper samples give ages of 14803620 [rc] yr B.P. Stratigraphic associations place Paleoindian occupations at depth on the pre-historic North American landscape on sediments that form the old C horizon composed of parent material, Wisconsinan deposits that predate Holocene sediment buildup. 11,12,13 The young Paleoindian dates cannot be correct, particularly since there are no patterned anomalies noted in later-period prehistoric assem-blages relating to higher stratigraphic positions. In a pioneering study of the Paleoindian site at Barnes, Michigan, Wright and Roosa observed that Paleoindian artifacts were deposited before the formation of spodosols ceased in this area about 10,000 yr B.P. 14 This conclusion was based on observing that cemented sediments on artifacts, found outside their original context, defines their original stratigraphic position.

In the study by Petaev et al ., high-resolution (2.5–4.6 y) time-series of ice core samples were analyzed for trace and major element concentrations using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Petaev et al . 1 reported the presence of a Pt peak anomaly at the Bølling-Allerød/Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB), coincident with a large shift in δ 18 O values, confirming the onset of cooler conditions at the beginning of the YD interval. This peak interval is represented by a rise in Pt concentrations over 14 years and subsequent drop during the following 7 years, consistent with the known residence time of stratospheric dust 1 . This sharply defined Pt anomaly at the YD onset in GISP2 is coeval with other YDB impact-related proxies, including nanodiamonds and melted spherules, found in Greenland and across four continents and is proposed by Petaev et al . to have resulted from a highly fractionated, Ir-deficient, iron-rich, extraterrestrial impactor. However, ten additional YDB studies have reported different concentrations and ratios of Pt and other platinum group elements (PGE), including iridium (Ir), osmium (Os), ruthenium (Ru), and rhodium (Rh), all of which usually co-vary ( Supplementary Information , “Summary of PGE Occurrence in the YDB”). These other studies do not rule out an extraterrestrial impactor as source of the PGE anomalies, but do not support the conclusion that it was highly fractionated and Ir-deficient, leaving open the question of the exact nature of the Pt source (see Supplementary Information , “Potential Sources of YDB Platinum”). Sawlowicz 2 notes that PGE anomalies may result from multiple processes of enrichment, including: a) cometary or meteoritic influx [ Supplementary Table 7] ; b) impactites from an extraterrestrial impact event [ Supplementary Table 7] ; c) volcanoes [ Supplementary Table 10] ; d) mantle material, e.g., from tectonic motion or in cratons [ Supplementary Table 7] ; e) exhalative-hydrothermal processes; f) precipitation from seawater; g) post-depositional transport and precipitation at redox boundaries; and h) reduction from intermediate and low-temperature solutions. In this study, we evaluate evidence of PGE enrichment from archaeologically-stratified sedimentary sequences across North America that date to the YDB in order to test the implications of Petaev et al . 1 who suggested the likelihood of a global Pt anomaly.

This event is proposed to have created the Younger Dryas boundary layer (YDB), which contains peak abundances of magnetic spherules 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , meltglass 7 , 8 , carbon spherules 1 , 12 , glasslike carbon 1 , 12 , charcoal 13 , 14 , platinum 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , iridium 17 , 18 , nickel 19 cobalt 19 , and/or nanodiamonds 12 , 20 , 21 , 22 at ~40 sites across North America and Europe, including from Abu Hureyra, Syria (Appendix, Fig. S1 ). In this paper, the term “airburst/impact” refers to a collision of a cosmic body with the Earth’s atmosphere, after which numerous smaller fragments may strike the ground forming transient surface craters. These studies propose that such an impact event triggered a cascade of secondary effects, including a brief impact winter and severe Younger Dryas (YD) climate change (span: ~12,800–11,500 cal BP) 1 , 13 , 14 , along with possible contributions to the megafaunal extinctions and human population declines 23 . Moore and Kennett 24 concluded that impact-triggered climate change caused the prehistoric villagers at Abu Hureyra to transition from hunting/gathering to cultivation, indicative of earliest agriculture, one of the most significant cultural transformations in human history. Since the introduction of the hypothesis, there have been many scientific publications supporting it and some against it 10 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 . It is beyond the scope of this study to present them again in detail, and so, for in-depth details and references, see Pino et al . 9 , Supporting Information, and Wolbach et al . 13 , Appendix, Table A3 . At Abu Hureyra, Bunch et al . 8 investigated large quantities of Abu Hureyra meltglass (called here “AH glass”) and identified high-temperature minerals, such as corundum (Al 2 O 3 , melting point at ~2044 °C), mullite (3Al 2 O 3 ·2SiO 2 at ~1840 °C), and suessite (Fe 3 Si at ~2300 °C). The latter mineral is rare on Earth but common in meteorites, suggesting a cosmic connection. Those researchers proposed that the melted minerals indicate the village was destroyed by a cosmic airburst/impact event. They also found similar coeval meltglass in YDB strata at Melrose, Pennsylvania and Blackville, South Carolina, which are ~10,000 km away. The most distant YDB site containing high-temperature melted evidence is at Pilauco, Chile 9 , 14,000 km away or ~35% of Earth’s circumference. Arguing against the results of Bunch et al . 8 , Thy et al . 30 examined meltglass from Abu Hureyra and several other sites in northern Syria, conducted heating experiments, and concluded that AH glass resulted from thatched hut fires that melted AH sediment at no more than ~1200 °C (Appendix, Text S1 ) .

Multiple airbursts/impacts produced the YD boundary layer (YDB), depositing peak concentrations of platinum, high-temperature spherules, meltglass, and nanodiamonds, forming an isochronous datum at >50 sites across ~50 million km² of Earth’s surface. This proposed event triggered extensive biomass burning, brief impact winter, YD climate change, and contributed to extinctions of late Pleistocene megafauna. In the most extensive investigation south of the equator, we report on a ~12,800-year-old sequence at Pilauco, Chile (~40°S), that exhibits peak YD boundary concentrations of platinum, gold, high-temperature iron- and chromium-rich spherules, and native iron particles rarely found in nature. A major peak in charcoal abundance marks an intense biomass-burning episode, synchronous with dramatic changes in vegetation, including a high-disturbance regime, seasonality in precipitation, and warmer conditions. This is anti-phased with northern-hemispheric cooling at the YD onset, whose rapidity suggests atmospheric linkage. The sudden disappearance of megafaunal remains and dung fungi in the YDB layer at Pilauco correlates with megafaunal extinctions across the Americas. The Pilauco record appears consistent with YDB impact evidence found at sites on four continents.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38089-y] [URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38089-y] [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/090878v1.full] [URL: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/090878v1.full] [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381518/] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381518/]The Lost History of Iberia: [LINKED_TEXT: The Lost History of IberiaAncient DNA reveals Bronze Age replacement of Iberian men, raising new questions.https://www.harvardmagazine.com/iberia-men-19] [URL: https://www.harvardmagazine.com/iberia-men-19] [LINKED_TEXT: The bitter end: Last woolly mammoths plagued by genetic defectsThe world's last woolly mammoths, sequestered on an Arctic Ocean island outpost, suffered from serious genetic defects caused by generations of inbreeding that may have hampered traits such as sense of smell and male fertility in the doomed population.https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN20200I] [URL: https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN20200I] [LINKED_TEXT: Researchers Have Increased The Distance at Which a Supernova Could Kill Us AllWere you to look up in the sky roughly 2 million years ago you would have seen a star die in a spectacular blaze of glory.https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-rethink-the-impact-of-ancient-supernovae-in-our-neighbourhood] [URL: https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-rethink-the-impact-of-ancient-supernovae-in-our-neighbourhood]Re-examining Late Chalcolithic Cultural Collapse in South-East Europe: [LINKED_TEXT: https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1588&context=etd] [URL: https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1588&context=etd] [LINKED_TEXT: A Violence in the BloodA Violence in the Bloodhttps://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/a-violence-in-the-blood] [URL: https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/a-violence-in-the-blood] [LINKED_TEXT: The Bible described it as the perfect, pure blue.

The 10 Commandments that are the “moral law” which is simply “the schoolmaster” that the serpent who is the fallen ones name too deceived Eve into disobeying god. He’s the “father of lies.” And we literally had heaven on earth but God only told Adam and Eve that they could have everything but not to eat from the tree of knowledge which is the knowledge of good and evil. Pretty wonderful God but Satan went to the woman and convinced her that “God surely didn’t say you would die?” God was speaking about a spiritual death, not a physical death. The Serpent, Satan, formerly Lucifer again, always lies and uses deception and so do the secret societies. The Masons will say, “We aren’t a secret society. We are a group of people that has secrets.” What are you hiding? When Jesus comes back His light will expose all your so called “secret sins.” Ever since Lucifer was jealous of God who created Lucifer to be the “most beautiful angel and chief musician” and STILL wasn’t happy with that! So he rebelled against The One who created him! Instead of being grateful, he convinced 1/3rd of the Angels to rebel with him. They are heavily outnumbered and even know they have a short time to wreak havoc on the world and to use any and all means to keep us from knowing the Savior of Jesus Christ. THIS AT ITS CORE A LYING EVIL ORGANIZATION AS THERE ARE MANY OTHERS AND THEY ALL HIDE UNDER THE GUISE OF PHILANTHROPY! YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS. LOWER DEGREE MASONS AND SHRINERS AND THE LIKE HELP EACH OTHER OUT WITH BUSINESS, IF ONE DIES, THEY’LL HELP THE WIFE’S THAT ARE “LADY’S OF THE EASTERN STAR” PUT THEIR KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE AND DO SOME GOOD THINGS. THE SERPENT CONVINCED EVE THAT SHE WOULDN’T DIE AND SHE DIDN’T PHYSICALLY SO BEWARE OF HALF TRUTHS WHICH ARE WHOLE LIES. THE EASTERN STARS LOGO IS A PENTAGRAM. MY STEP GRANDFATHER AND STEP GREAT GRANDFATHER WERE GENERATIONAL MEMBERS AND TWISTED PUPS. I THANK GOD MY DAD KNEW SO MUCH ABOUT THEM THAT HE TOLD THEM TO STUFF IT WHERE THE SUN DOESN’T SHINE AND EVEN BROKE OFF COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIS MOM FOR JOINING SOMETHING SHE WAS SO0 IGNORANT ABOUT. WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT? HER HUSBAND LOST HIS VERY HIGH PAYING JOB AT A VERY OLD AIRLINE THAT WENT UNDER AND SHE DIVORCED HIM IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS WAS A GOLD DIGGER! SHE WAS STUNNING AND LIKE A DOORKNOB, EVERYONE GOT A TURN. SHE KNEW SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND LIVED WELL INTO HER 90’S. THIS IS THE REALITY. Satan can never “Be like the most high” which the created can never be THE most high. He can be like the Most High through deception. [Think in terms like a holograms, or to be “omnipresent” like GOD, think camera’s everywhere because Satan is his name now and he’s not omnipresent like God is. Think one world central bank digital currencies, think chips smaller than a grain of rice implanted under your skin. We can do this ALL RIGHT NOW. But by 2030 or sooner is “The Great Resets Goal.” It may be a different technology by then. but think the Useless Nations who planned Covid and it never was a virus. It was a snake venom which is why they wouldn’t let people use hydroxychloriquine, Ivermectin, or any anti-snake venom UNLESS it actually was a snake bite. The Serpent was a snake. These are facts] Dig deep into ALBERT PIKE! CONFEDERATE GENERAL WHO WROTE THE BOOK “MORALS AND DOGMAS.” HE WAS AN OPEN “SATANIST” DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND DEDICATED HIS BOOK TO LUCIFER. HE ALSO WAS A 33RD DEGREE MASON WHO PREDICTED 3 WORLD WARS. THEY WORSHIPPED HIM AND HE HAD A STATUE UP IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY UNTIL BLM KNOCKED IT DOWN DURING THE RIOTS OF THE SUMMER OF 2021. ASK YOURSELF WHY A CONFEDERATE GENERAL WOULD BE IN A NORTHERN CEMETERY? WE’VE BEEN BEING PLAYED I WAS JUST FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A SURGERY AND WASN’T FOND OF TV. HAVING THE BACKGROUND I HAD ALREADY, WHEN I WAS IN A HARD COLLAR FOR NEARLY 18 MONTHS, I LEARNED A LOT FROM BILL COOPER. THE FIRST TRUTHER TO INFILTRATE NAVY INTELLIGENCE AND HAD A HAM RADIO SHOW BUT WAS EVENTUALLY TOUCHING SOME NERVES WHEN HE LEFT THE NAVY AND WAS KILLED IN AN AMBUSH FOR USING HIS PERCEIVED RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH….WHILE ALWAYS CARRYING. A MAN’S MAN! The Masons will always try to tell you gradually as you’re being desensitized to GOD’S TRUTH that they’ll make you a better person. Great. But being good doesn’t get you to heaven. “There’s only one advocate between God and man. That is Jesus Christ.” Jesus said that. Goodworks may make heaven better for you but the one criminal on the cross realized a perfect person was being killed and Jesus told him, “Today you will be with me in paradise.” These guys are sick twisted perverts at higher degrees. of course they’ll deny it. God sees and knows all."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension. I haven’t payed enough in for old age pension and I am alone. What will I do?

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"I’m a British teen, last year of Highschool (year 11), attending a private school in England. However, I went to a public school before, for 2 years and a private (non boarding) for a few months. Most of my friends, outside of school, go to public schools. Therefore, I feel qualified to answer this question. Let’s establish the differences and similarities. From my experience; the children in private and public schools behave the same. Children are children. Money can’t buy ‘good behaviour’ or less fights. Bullying still occurs, bitchiness, racism, homophobia. The lot. Stupidity and rowdiness happens, mainly from the boys. However, unlike public schools, where (from my experience) things either don’t get dealt with, lack of authority, punishments are minimum. In private schools, tend to deal with it quicker, more harshly and effectively. Another thing I noticed is that most children in private schools are generally sheltered and lack world knowledge. A girl in my year thought ‘isis’ was a country. The people, just seem to be oblivious to the world around them.The education in private schools is the same. The only difference is, most teachers at private schools, tend to genuinely care about their students. I never got this from my previous school. In private schools we start GCSE’s in year 9, rather than year 10 - giving us more prep. Now, obviously I seriously think this depends on the school you go to. There are some really good public schools in England, that are probably better than private schools. Perhaps, I just attended a really bad public school. Who knows. During Covid 19. All schools in England were shut for a good few months (except key workers children). This really highlighted how advantaged private schoolers were. All children had access to computers, printers. Everything they could possibly need, all of our lessons were online. We didn’t miss any education at all. However, I know my friends at public schools, were at a huge disadvantage. When we started back, in September. Some hadn’t picked up a pen in nearly 6 months.The biggest difference is size. The maximum children a private school would have is 300 (the entire school). A public school would have nearly 300 in each year. In my opinion, the smaller the better. It means the teachers pay more attention to you, know you inside out. You build connections with everyone and if anything bad happens, the teachers find out within minutes and it gets dealt with. But then a downfall to it being small is, if you fall out with a group, either the entire school falls out with you, or the entire school sides with you. Usually the first. Super itchy uniforms (private school, girls T shirts) So, to conclude, I would say there’s qualities that are the same. However, I much prefer private schools. Boarding schools can be depressing and overwhelming. I get grades that I’d never be able to achieve, whilst attending public school. I don’t have anything against public schools. This is just my preference."},{"instruction":"w can you determine where a mortar is being shot from?","output":"crater analysis."},{"instruction":"What is the best way for preparing for GATE CSE?","output":"Consistently read, practice and revise concepts while simultaneously practicing coding Can't say for other subjects but GATE CSE is quite demanding.

That being said, overall weight loss and other factors can lead to a slimmer face. Here are some methods that could potentially help: As mentioned, overall fat loss often leads to losing fat in the face. So a well-rounded approach including a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and adequate sleep can be beneficial. Drinking enough water can prevent bloating that can make the face look rounder.Alcohol can dehydrate your body, leading to water retention and puffiness in your face. Although research is limited, some believe that facial exercises may help tone the muscles in your face, giving the appearance of a slimmer face. As to how much weight one can lose within a given period, it really depends on a variety of factors including their current weight, diet, physical activity level, metabolic rate, and more. A commonly recommended safe and sustainable weight loss rate is 1 to 2 pounds per week. This means, for instance, if someone is highly committed and consistent with their efforts, they could potentially lose around 4 to 8 pounds in a month.

Science is divided into four parts: Natural science, formal science, applied science (Engineering) and social science. Natural Science: Universally true. Humans did not create this, and these will exist if humanity is eradicated. For example, even if we die, two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen will still make water anywhere in the universe, the law of gravity will hold true anywhere in the universe, etc. It is entirely based on facts, evidence, experimentation and observation. Related to discovery. Physics, chemistry and biology falls under this category. Formal Science: Formal science is a weird mixture of abstractness and science. Humans created a major part of formal science, in order to use it as a language to understand natural and applied science. Formal science can be seen as the pillar which holds natural science together. A lot of formal science principles are just agreed upon to be true, like, there are 10 unique digits (0 to 9), the value of sine is perpendicular/hypotenuse, or a triangle has three sides. Someone may ask ‘why are there 10 unique digits’ but there is no definitive answer to it. Natural science and applied science depends wholly upon formal science to be understood. Mathematics, logic, computer science are formal sciences in the broad sense of \\"systematic and formulated knowledge\\". Applied Science: This deals with innovation and application. This is not a ‘true science’ but of more of an application of the theories discussed in true science. We apply the laws of chemistry, the laws of mathematics and physics to invent devices, engineer new technologies and to improve human lives. Engineering, medicine etc falls under this category. Social Science: Fully man made. Not empirical or universal; however it involves the ‘scientific tools’ used in applied sciences to study the societal systems. It is a method of humanities which help us understand the world better with the help of observation and inference, much like pure science, however, replaceable. Sociology, Critical Theory, Economics, Gender Studies, Political Science etc fall under social sciences. Unlike the other sciences, social science is entirely created by humans, for humans, and it is extremely dynamic and relative; observations of social science will vary from region to region, planet to planet; unlike natural or applied science which is true anywhere in the universe. In a sense, this makes it similar to formal science, however unlike formal science, social science is very dynamic and has got a lot of room for dogma, disinformation, propaganda; because nothing in social science is natural. Questions in natural, formal or applied science can frequently be answered in a “Yes/No” pattern, and hypothesis can be proven, however, it is not true with social science. Moreover, social science allows plenty of room for debate, disagreement, dissent and varying opinions, but principles of the other three sciences are not ‘debatable’ or subject to disagreement; either they have been proven, or not. Therefore social sciences lack the rigor and objectivity of the other three sciences. If humanity gets wiped out for a thousand years, and somehow starts from scratch again, natural and applied science books will be recreated exactly as it is. Formal science books may witness slight changes changes (for example, Roman numerals contain 7 unique symbols, but Indo-Arabic numerals contain 10 unique digits, so this is subject to the dominant civilization) but formal science logic and theorems will still hold true. Social science, on the other hand, will be almost fully revamped and re-invented. TL;DR: Social science could be science, or not science, based on how you define it. If science to you is something which involves rigorous scientific methods and processes to formulate, like statistics or probability, then social science is science. However, if science to you is based on empirical truth, evidence and something which is universally valid, social science cannot be termed under science."},{"instruction":"Should I buy a OnePlus 6 or a Samsung Galaxy S8?","output":"For camera & picture quality S8 would be better but for games & all-rounder good phone OnePlus 6 is best."},{"instruction":"What company offers good mobile application development services?","output":"Crowdbotics is one the best app development services out there for both mobile and web apps read this article for more information [LINKED_TEXT: https://link.medium.com/UBHVnFtNFzbhttps://link.medium.com/UBHVnFtNFzb] [URL: https://link.medium.com/UBHVnFtNFzb]"},{"instruction":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?","output":"Every trader is money lover and look for best day trading rules to gain profits.

Day traders must square off their positions at the end of the session. This is easy when you are trade in large cap, index- based stocks which are highly liquid and get traded in large volumes every day. 3. Trade in only 3-4 scrips at time. It is advisable to diversify the portfolio while investing in stocks when it comes to trade. Limit yourself to just 1-2 stocks. Also track the stock movements closely. 4. Do extensive Research. There should be 10-15 stocks on your trade watch list. You should be aware of all the forthcoming news like stock splits, bonuses, dividends, result dates, mergers as well as technical levels of the stock. 5. Know the entry price and target levels. Before you enter the market always set your entry price and level. The psychology changes after he bought a stock where you could interfere with judgment and sell quickly even if the price moves marginally. 6. Use stop loss to minimize loss.

If so, it betrays a serious lack of historical knowledge. First, the U.S. government didn’t even exist until the Constitution was ratified. The Bill of Rights was ratified a very short time later. The government that behaved so heinously as to make it worth specifically spelling out the right to keep and bear arms was the British government, which, among many other abuses, started the War of Independence by attempting to confiscate cannons, guns, and ammunition from the Colonists. This undoubtedly provides some historical context. However, note that the right to keep and bear arms is most decidedly not granted by the Second Amendment, but recognized by it. Notice the text: A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. Notice it specifically does not claim to establish the right to keep and bear arms. The right itself is presupposed to already belong to the people. The Second Amendment merely promises not to infringe upon that right. In other words, every sane and law-abiding person in the world, and in the history of the world, has had an inherent right to bear arms as the ultimate means to safeguard their own liberty. The fact that most governments do not recognize this right does not mean it doesn’t exist; merely that they find it disconcerting to their power, and so pretend the right doesn’t exist. Our Founders noted that most old-world governments had restricted this right for centuries (if not longer), and that so doing was contrary to every principle of human freedom and dignity. They therefore enshrined this basic human right in our founding document. The history of the world since that time has continued to prove that governments that restrict the right to keep and bear arms often do commit heinous acts. Therefore, it is easy to see that the American Founding Fathers made the right decision to include the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights."},{"instruction":"Without appealing to emotion or using ad hominem attacks, how can I convince conservatives that gun regulation is a good thing?","output":"You can't, any more than I could convince you that it is a bad thing.

The ideas which fill your mind about how society should be ordered spring from the very font of reason, balanced with knowledge and leavened by erudition and sober consideration of facts and the rights of all men. Therefore, there is no way that I could convince you that your thinking is a skewed product of Frankfurt-school deconstructionism, the philosophical base of modern transformative liberalism. Instead, I find it easier to simply dig in my heels and resist your attempts. It’s easier on both of us that way.

To leave a significant mark, such as changing a river channel or building a huge castle, requires a lot of human resources as well as some technology.

Another aspect, in my opinion, is the impossibility of such rapid technological development because of geographical and natural conditions.

It is the one of the best things that can ever happen to you:- Every other friend in your group doesn’t fail to ask you this, “Are you guys dating?” -_-Dating can get tough. He/She is around you almost every minute.You have a constant and strong emotional support from him?her. You pretty much have a trustworthy shoulder to cry on.You get to understand the opposite gender in a better way ;p. Comes in handy if you fall for someone.You’ve got a place where you can vent out your feelings without the fear of being judged or trolled.You childishly fight with each other for small things like a bench to sit on or the last piece of Double Cheese Margarita.Being a guy, you won’t be judged by her for crying your heart out. Being a girl, you won’t be judged by him for being tomboyish.There is no “Boys/Girls talks” in such a friendship. You guys can openly and shamelessly discuss any topic.Just to tell you guys about an incident; Back in Class 8th, There were these two seniors in my school bus (A boy and a girl). On one particular day they were laughing over something and then there was a long stare. *Harsh words alert. Stop reading right now if cheesy lines creep the hell outta you* I swear the guy responded with this, “Aise kya dekh rhi hai? Mai hila nahi raha hoon yaha (What are you staring at?

If any flooding of any compartment occurs that can't be fairly simply and quickly stopped or controlled will be reason to surface. The bow section is the most likely area to suffer the most immediate damage. Since the main sonar hydrophone arrays are there, sonar will be rendered out of commission and therefore the sub would be “flying blind” so to speak. One sub I was on hit a sea mount and the entire torpedo room and sonar arrays were completely devastated. Many of the crew in that part of the ship were injured to one extent or another but, thankfully, no one was killed. The boat was able to return to port on its own power and no damage was caused to the reactor and no radioactive leakage occurred."},{"instruction":"Did they ever prove that George Floyd intentionally used counterfeit money, and is there a way to posthumously charge Floyd with fraud?","output":"It has not been proven nor can it be under the US legal system.

It is a way of eating that involves restricting calorie intake for a set period and eating in a shorter eating window. The most common windows include the 16/8 method and the 20/4 method, whereby one eats within an eight-hour and four-hour window, respectively. Those who start this type of routine often see an improvement in energy levels, focus, and digestion. However, a common question arises when hearing about it: how do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals? Fortunately, there is science to answer these questions. Here’s why people who practice intermittent fasting don’t feel hungry as often: 1. Increased satiety: Eating a smaller number of meals that are rich in protein, healthy fats, and fiber leaves people feeling satiated, and less hungry during the day. Protein and fiber are two nutrients that take a longer time to break down in the stomach and helps you feel fuller for a more extended period. 2. Lower insulin level: Eating less frequently reduces the body's insulin levels. When the insulin level is reduced, the body becomes more efficient at burning stored fat as energy. The lower the insulin level, the lower the likelihood of storing excess fat. 3. Improved insulin sensitivity: A regular diet with frequent intake of food leads to a continuous spike in insulin. Over time, this leads to insulin resistance, where the body’s cells are no longer responsive to insulin. However, with intermittent fasting, the body gradually improves insulin sensitivity, making it more responsive to insulin and better equipped to manage blood sugar. 4. Increased growth hormone: Evidence shows that intermittent fasting helps to increase the growth hormone, which is essential in preserving muscle mass, reducing body fat, and maintaining a healthy weight. 5. Increased energy: Contrary to what people think, fasting doesn't necessarily make people feel sluggish or weak. Instead, it helps to increase energy levels while reducing fatigue and enhancing mood. Surprisingly, some people get an energy boost during fasting as a result of ketones, which are fuel produced from burning stored body fat. So, to answer the question: people who eat once or twice a day while practicing intermittent fasting do not feel hungry between meals because of increased satiety, lower insulin levels, improved insulin sensitivity, increased growth hormone, and increased energy. However, it's essential to note that intermittent fasting may not be the right choice for everyone, including those with conditions affected by irregular eating patterns. If you're thinking of trying intermittent fasting, talk to your healthcare professional first.

I watched ‘Dil Bechara’ just because of the emotions attached to it after the untimely demise of its hero, SSR. I am still obsessed with its original work ‘The Fault In Our Stars’ by Josh Boone, starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, adapted from the novel with the same name by John Green. Even though I am not an ardent fan of the romantic movie genre, this was one of my favorites alongside the likes of Roman Holiday, Casablanca, Bridges of Madison County, A Walk To Remember, etc. So ‘Dil Bechara’ right from the beginning had its own problem, it was not an original work. Truly speaking, Sushant Singh deserved a better movie than this as his swansong. I am sure this will be minting money riding on the sentiments overflowing after SSR’s death, but had he lived to see the release of this movie, would it have generated this much interest or love? Practically, this movie had no taker to release it in a theater while Sushant was alive. Many of those who refused to even distribute this movie are now shedding crocodile tears after Sushant’s untimely death. Sad, but true. Anne Frank rightly wrote, ” The dead will always receive more flowers than the alive because regret is stronger than gratitude”. Coming to the review, the direction is hopeless and hapless. The plot in its valiant effort to match its original counterpart becomes cliched, out of date, and lackluster. In many scenes, it is evident that the director became less interested to complete the work after he was given a clean-chit in the case of “Me Too” accusations against him and certain scenes were hurriedly packed up hampering its flow. Sushant Singh as I have already said deserved a better swan song. Even though he looks charming with his cherubic smile, after ten minutes or so that becomes monotonous and apart from some stiff and hackneyed expressions, his performance does not rise above the bar. I was vehemently hoping to get the glimpses of his skills from his MSD or Kai Po Che days, but sadly my wishes were not granted. Sanjana Sanghi looked plastic throughout and it looks like she may not bag some new roles even after the super success of this movie. So, from a neutral point of view, ‘Dil Bechara’ is a sheer disappointment. If you are calling it an excellent movie, you will perhaps cheat Sushant once again. He deserves the truth, at least once in life. Will miss you, Sushant.

Even as a beginner a long time past, I never saw the F chord, presuming this to be the first fret barred position or the unbarred version played on the D, G, B, and E strings, to be something to avoid. In fact, it is ridiculous to avoid this or any chord if you expect to become adept at guitar playing. Its an extremely common and essential chord in music and particularly the guitar. On the other hand, when I did first start learning, I had a book that showed chord diagrams for a lot of extended chords, e.g. 7ths, 9ths, etc. Some of these are indeed challenging, involve practice to fret and switch to them, and some are more theoretical than physically possible. The F chord does not fit into this challenging class of chords. Perhaps the beginner experiencing this difficulty needs to strengthen their hand or become comfortable fretting two strings with one finger as a necessary part of learning to play. I read where a lot of beginners are frustrated with some of the necessary discomforts that need to be overcome, such as developing calluses or fretting an F chord.

However, it's important to note that the concept of twin flames is subjective and can vary depending on individual beliefs and experiences.

Idealization: If you find yourself idealizing your twin flame to the point where they seem perfect and flawless, it could be a sign of an illusion. Real relationships, even soul connections, have their flaws and challenges. When you project an idealized image onto someone, you may not be seeing them as they truly are. [LINKED_TEXT: Yin and Yang With regards to Chakra (In Context with Shiva and Shakti)] [URL: https://www.yogacosmicscience.com/2020/06/yin-and-yang-shiva-and-shakti.html] 2. Fixation on the Concept: If you become overly fixated on the idea of twin flames, constantly seeking validation or signs that support this belief, it may indicate that you are creating an illusion. True connections, including twin flames, are organic and natural, rather than something that needs constant affirmation. 3. Lack of Reciprocity: If your twin flame connection feels one-sided, with little or no reciprocation of emotions, efforts, or commitment from the other person, it is important to re-evaluate the nature of the relationship. Genuine connections are built on mutual exchange and support. 4. Escapism: If you find yourself using the concept of a twin flame to escape from your current reality or to avoid addressing underlying personal issues, it might be a sign that you are creating an illusion. It's important to ground yourself in reality and address your own personal growth and healing. 5. Disregard for Boundaries: If you constantly disregard the other person's boundaries or ignore their needs and desires, it suggests that you may be more invested in the idea of a twin flame than in fostering a healthy, balanced relationship.

The draft is always a guessing game. There have been many many instances of the best, “can’t miss” NCAA prospects having dismal NBA careers. So…the folks who chose other players over Jordan simply felt he was not “clearly” the best choice, to use your word. Sure, they probably regretted their decision years later, but this is all part of the process and nobody is to blame. Choosing college athletes to play for your professional team has never been an exact science. It is not even today, with all of our computer models, sabermetrics, and thorough scouting systems which cost millions. The reason is……………………. The athletes are human beings. Just like the guys who do the drafting. Thus, are susceptible to making mistakes or not living up to potential. OR, on the other hand…totally and amazingly surpassing their potential! Works both ways, amigo. And again…there is no blame for either outcome.

A sense. It exists in our core. It can only be attained once a significant personal connection has been made. It’s a powerful confirmation that’s formed and guided by our moral compass. An allegiance that can only be earned through meaningful interaction. Loyalty Loyalty is commitment. Its presence is never guaranteed but its absence can be easily assured. Loyalty can be mutually reciprocated, yet is content to exist on its own. Loyalty is an option that can be exercised between friends, family, associates, customers, etc. For some of us, loyalty is first-nature and effortlessly occurs in our everyday interactions. A calming nature, trustworthy persona or a staunch reputation are all characteristics that contribute to loyalty. For others, it is an allusive, lifelong struggle. Regardless, loyalty is a principle; with predictive elements, which, when understood, can help make loyalty more present in our many relationships — including business. Professional loyalty often behaves differently than personal loyalty. The principles that shape this bond are identical for both. Most of us are loyal to someone and have those who are loyal to us. Fundamentally, we know how these loyalties formed and why they’ve lasted. As business owners, we need to realize these same principles apply to our companies. A general rule in business: if someone buys from you once, there is a less than 40% chance they’ll return and buy a second time. If they buy from you twice there is a greater than 70% chance that they’ll return for a third purchase. Regardless of our chosen route, there are no short cuts to LoyaltyLand. There are principles we can follow, to take the most direct route, with fewer pot holes and pit stops. By adhering to three basic principles, you’ll accelerate your journey and make it more enjoyable. 1. Care. Care as a feeling is useless in business… unless it inspires action. Care must be demonstrated. My friend and colleague, Kelly Keddington has been teaching Advocacy to sales teams for more than 20 years. He first introduced U.A.R.R. (you are) in the mid-90’s, which is the idea that everyone wants to be Understood, Appreciated, Respected and Recognized. By delivering on just one of these in each customer encounter, we demonstrate Care in a form that customers absorb internally. It’s the internalization of the Care encounter that then lays the foundation for advocacy. Example: Chipotle. Chipotle has been able to maintain their customer loyalty despite rising prices. Bottom line, their customers are willing to pay more for fresh, sustainably grown ingredients. Chipotle recently launched their “Farm Team” loyalty program. This program offers perks to their best customers while promoting part of their core mission. Providing fresh food through environmentally conscious practices. Chipotle’s customers are loyal to the brand because they provide a superior product through a commitment to social responsibility… and it doesn’t hurt that their customer service training covers 13 characteristics, of which 4 are devoted to making customers happy. 2. Listen. People want to buy, but no one wants to feel like they’re being sold. Listening allows us to discover customers’ interests & needs. One great path to advocacy is commonality. Listen, and commonalities between you and your market begin to appear. Example: Virgin Trains. Some time ago, a twenty-something passenger on a Virgin Train found himself in a bathroom that was out of toilet paper. So he did what any millennial (at that time) would do in this situation — he tweeted about it. A direct mention of Virgin Trains in said tweet resulted in a few pings of communication between departments and an employee hand-delivering a fresh roll of TP to the stall. This story went viral. Taking that moment to listen to their customers and react in real time resulted in insane publicity for Virgin, upped their reputation, and by default, boosted their customer loyalty. 3. Provide a Great Customer Experience. Is the customer always right? Of course not. But does the customer always have options? Yes. And perhaps more importantly, the customer has access to reach that extends far past the traditional rolodex. Try pleasantly surprising your customers when they walk through your doors. Some say it’s unrealistic to think you can surprise customers every time. I disagree. For instance, what do you think your customer’s basic expectations are? Most would answer with something along the lines of good quality and strong value. The key word is expectations. Therefore, your surprise to your customers doesn’t have to be life-altering, it simply has to be more than expected. Example: Zappos. Zappos is the gold standard in customer service. They’re known for going above and beyond for their customers, some of which is outlined in their [LINKED_TEXT: ten core values] [URL: http://www.zappos.com/d/about-zappos-culture]. Their support stories have reached epic levels. Take, for instance, the team member who went to a rival shop to get a customer shoes when [LINKED_TEXT: Zappos was sold out] [URL: http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&site=businessinsider.com&xs=1&isjs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.practicalecommerce.com%2Farticles%2F2662-The-Zappos-Effect-5-Great-Customer-Service-Ideas-for-Smaller-Businesses&xguid=59f5d4db8299c6124647bd6a508b416a&xuuid=1c55cfd6628dc55a1564cda8d412db82&xsessid=23c4b808f0c97b40b0c561d7fcaad844&xcreo=0&xed=0&sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fzappos-customer-service-crm-2012-1&pref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&xtz=420]. Or the time they [LINKED_TEXT: overnighted shoes] [URL: http://consumerist.com/2011/05/zappos-saves-best-man-from-going-barefoot-at-wedding.html] to a best man in a pinch, at no cost. The great thing about Zappos is that they’re able to deliver on that service across many channels — live chat, email, phone, and social support are available 24/7, all backed by their dedicated Customer Loyalty team. On social, they’re not afraid to have a little fun with emojis and GIFs, but at the end of the day, they’re all about putting the customer first. Whether it’s because of a superior product, listening to customer needs or personalized service, these companies cut through the competitive noise and thrive in their respected markets. These principles apply in all industries regardless of the size or age of your company. By creating loyal customers-for-life, your business will increase revenue through brand ambassadors, leading to sustainable and healthy profit. Loyalty begins and ends with relationships. No program or CRM will ever create customer loyalty. Good marketing can create a solid repeat customer base. A good customer rewards program can help attract customers, get them to return and you’ll streamline communication and data management. But without brand loyalty, very little will stand in the way of your customers choosing an alternative. There you have it. You want loyal customers for life? Care about them. Listen to them. And provide them with a great customer experience. When in Doubt, Add More Value, Shaun"},{"instruction":"A 500 ft. train travelling 500 ft per minute must travel through a 500 ft long tunnel.

The biggest difference between granite and marble is that granite is a sedimentary rock while marble is an extrusive rock. Granite is a hard rock made up of quartz, feldspar, mica, and other minerals. Granite is formed by the chemical and physical breakdown of other rocks. The crystal grains of granite give a rough texture to granite and make it a very durable stone. Marble, on the other hand, is an extrusive rock made up of calcite (CaCO3 ). Marble is also a very hard rock but it is softer than granite. Marble can be polished smooth and is used for things like sculptures, countertops and buildings. Granite and marble are used for the same things. One difference is that granite is usually used for kitchen countertops because of its great strength. Granite is a good choice for the kitchen because it is stain-resistant and does not absorb heat. Granite is also more affordable than marble."},{"instruction":"Why do masons show up in a brother's funeral?

Here’s a bunch of software tools that my team and I use to boost our productivity. You’ll notice the theme revolves around marketing to attract leads to our sales guys and maximizing both this marketing and lead generation strategy. The first tool I’d like to highly recommend is a system called [LINKED_TEXT: Calendr] [URL: http://calendr.it/]. This is a new product currently in private beta at time of writing, so go ahead and request access. This system is a very simple, yet effective, meeting scheduler. Here’s how it’s effective: Reduces time trying to arrange meetings/demo’sProvides our clients and prospective customers an efficient way to schedule a meeting/demo with the team (I just share a link)Has increased our demo calls by 300% Point 3 is probably what caught your attention, and rightly so. The way we’ve increased our demo calls by 300% is by simply embedding the [LINKED_TEXT: Calendr] [URL: http://calendr.it/] system to a webpage on our website. As visitors hit our website, we use systems such as [LINKED_TEXT: Sumo] [URL: http://sumo.com/], [LINKED_TEXT: Optimizely] [URL: http://optimizely.com/] and [LINKED_TEXT: Google] [URL: http://google.com/] Analytics to A/B test our website and track what road our visitors take around the site. This has lead us to design our website in the most efficient way we possibly can, directing visitors to the [LINKED_TEXT: Calendr] [URL: http://calendr.it/] page. By directing people to the Calendr page, they have direct access to our teams calendars and thus can go ahead and immediately book themselves a slot for a demo call on whichever day they want. This alone is how we’ve increased demo calls by 300%. We’re currently speaking to customers who have booked through the embedded [LINKED_TEXT: Calendr] [URL: http://calendr.it/] tool, and so far (it’s early days) it seems they liked how they didn’t need to pick up the phone or send an email to schedule a meeting. They’ve always found that process off putting. A few have also mentioned that they feel if they picked up the phone to try to arrange a demo call, then they feel they’re more likely to be forced onto a demo call at that moment, even though they weren’t quite ready for whatever reason. It also helps people in different time zones not need to make calls at awkward hours or even overseas people struggling. With all of this said, the Calendr tool as you can see is very good if you’re looking to not only boost productivity, but even lead generation as part of a wider marketing strategy. As I touched on [LINKED_TEXT: Sumo] [URL: http://sumo.com/] and [LINKED_TEXT: Optimizely,] [URL: http://optimizely.com/] I just wanted to detail a little on what these two fantastic tools offer: Optimizely is is an A/B Testing tool. A/B Testing (sometimes called split testing) is comparing two versions of a web page to see which one performs better. You compare two web pages by showing the two variants (let's call them A and B) to similar visitors at the same time. The one that gives a better conversion rate, wins! For example, you may test a different color on a ‘Buy Now’ button. You may test one button in blue and one in green. Whichever performs best over say, 2 weeks, you’ll change all of the buttons to that color. You’ll then try again. Say green won the test, you do the same but with green and red, and so on. Next, you may change the position of the buy now button. Having it to the left or right of the page. Maybe higher, or lower. Maybe above a product or below. All of these are tests. By testing your website using this process, you’re gaining evidence based results rather than just purely what you think works. It’s evidence vs. opinion. Evidence wins every time. Sumo is a sales platform that offers a lot of features including exit pop ups, smart bars (the bar at the top of a website advertising an offer or a deal that is ending soon) and so forth. They also have an awesome blog that teaches you so much about marketing and lead generation that I definitely recommend you check out. So to conclude, 3 tools that I recommend are: [LINKED_TEXT: Calendr] [URL: http://calendr.it/][LINKED_TEXT: Sumo] [URL: http://sumo.com/][LINKED_TEXT: Optimizely] [URL: http://optimizely.com/]"},{"instruction":"What happens when you get pulled over doing 100 mph?","output":"It depends.

He said he once rode motorcycles himself but stopped after seeing so many accident fatalities as a police officer. He said I was racing at the safest time of day (ie: early Sunday morning) when there was little traffic. He wrote me a ticket for 90mph and never turned it in. Feeling extremely grateful, I never rode that fast again. Conversely, I was once stopped for speeding (in a car this time) en route to a seminar I was attending the next day.

I like the idea that you have to work with the other people inside to be effective. The pilot/driver has to position the vehicle to give gunners an angle, for instance. I remember in one of the original battlefront games, if someone was in the gunner’s seat of a snow speeder, the pilot could fly around an AT-AT, and the gunner had to shoot the harpoon onto the AT-AT’s leg, allowing the pilot to tie it up. Pulling stunts like that with your friends unfortunately seems to be lost on modern games, and I’d like to see it become a more common feature.

How Does Stress Influence Our Health and Intellectual Abilities? Scientists have discovered that stress for a short period of time can help to shake up the brain, but chronic prolonged stress harms our brain and prevents the development of intellectual abilities. We can’t avoid stressful situations, but we can create an environment that doesn’t provoke uncomfortable situations. In addition, we should develop the ability to not react to stressful events that force us to lose our state of equilibrium. We should accept that only the control of our own emotions is able to protect the brain from damage. The World Health Organization has forecast that depression will rank as the number one illness from which people will suffer in 2020. How does this state influence our brain, our cognitive abilities, and our development? Researchers have identified two types of stresses, both having different effects on the human body and mind. The first type is short-term or acute stress. The second type is the long-term or chronic stress. What actually happens in the brain when we are under suppression from external events or internal thoughts? An action or an emotion changes the brain activity, either strengthening or weakening neuron collections, and also subsequently turning on or turning off of certain neuron patterns. Interactions between neurons take place due to both electric pulses and specific chemicals are known as neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters contribute to the transmission of neuron impulses. The state of tension stimulates the human body to generate the hormone cortisol, a neurotransmitter. How does this hormone influence the human body and mind? Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley have discovered that stress can be either helpful or harmful. A certain effect depends on the dose of attack that one receives. In general, stress is a protective and adaptive response to trouble. Stress hormones, in particular, cortisol, secreted in such moments, quickly mobilize our body and brain to cope with adversity. Acute stress rearranges the human body and the brain into a state of combat, a natural reaction to danger. When this occurs, cortisol is released into the bloodstream, helping humans to manage negative situations by giving the body and the mind a burst of energy. This increases our tolerance for pain and improves memorizing. This mechanism is beneficial because all power of our body and brain get mobilized. The researchers have determined that acute stress stimulates neurogenesis, the formation of new neuron cells from stem cells stored in the brain. Such short-term stress enhances the synthesis of a specific substance that provokes the growth of new neurons. However, too much cortisol in the human body may have adverse effects on health. The experiments have shown that chronic stress, which is accompanied by a huge increase in stress hormones, suppresses the activity of stem cells in the hippocampus, thereby preventing neurogenesis. Moreover, chronic stress damages existing neuron patterns because the process of neuron activation gets out of control. Excessive functional activity provoked by the huge release of cortisol harms neuron cells and their connections. This process negatively affects the functioning of neuron patterns and leads to their death. During sleep, the brain removes the products of biochemical reactions from the body, increasing the stress resistance of human organisms. Therefore, short stress is needed to help reinvigorate the brain, but chronic stress harms our brain and prevents the development of intellectual abilities. We can’t avoid stressful situations, but we can create an environment that doesn’t provoke uncomfortable situations. In addition, we should develop the ability to not react to stressful events that force us to lose our state of equilibrium. We should accept that only the control of our own emotions is able to protect the brain from damage.

When I joined EY, I was assured that my experience will be taken into consideration. Those who interviewed me were from the Bangalore head office and told me that although I'll be joining one level lower than my previous ranking (as I had switched field), I'll be promoted after my first year if I learn quickly and my work reaches the mark. I am a fast learner by nature and started working on independent projects with very minimum supervision within 6 months (probation period). As per what they had promised in the beginning, I was eligible for the promotion cycle that was 1.5 yrs from my days of joining. But I received news that the manager who took my interview had moved to a different division and the current manager said that it was “too soon”. He didn't talk to me or conduct any sort of appraisal review to find out whether my work had been good or not, whereas the truth was that I was working with many Senior Managers in a collaborative role and all of them had given me good reviews. Later, I found that my manager happened to be an ego-maniac who made a fun team connect mandatory and wanted his team members to be there till the last minute no matter what, his reason being “this is the first one that I'm scheduling ever since we started working from home”. Since I had to drop off the call for a mere 5 minutes for some important work that came up, he was infuriated that I chose to do my job over his 'fun event'. It was explained to me that the priority was to do what our direct service-line manager wants, a.k.a., to cater to your service-line manager's whims and wishes over the actual job priority. This is a real incident that happened in EY word to word.

The steel must be worked very hot - almost white hot. For reference, the coals in your campfire are usually cherry red at the low end and bright orange at the high end. This temperature range falls around 1000 degrees. Add an additional 1000 degrees and you’re approaching the proper forge welding temperature. Once the temperature is reached, the steel is folded over and tacked. It goes back into the forge for more heat. Then the flux is added. This will bind the steel together, acting as a glue. This is where the heavy, controlled hitting comes in. By hammering the steel together with a decent amount of force, you’re pressing it to itself and encouraging a chemical binding to take place. Why We Do It Forge welding developed as a way to strengthen otherwise lower grade steels. By combining low carbon steel with some high carbon steel and folding it repeatedly, the steel gains durability while retaining ductility (resilience)."},{"instruction":"[math]x^2 + y^2 + 1 = z^2[/math]","output":"Given that [math]x+y+z=xyz[/math], Consider [math]x(1-{y^2})(1-{z^2})+y(1-{z^2})(1-{x^2})+z(1-{x^2})(1-{y^2})[/math] Divide&multiply with xyz =[math]xyz(frac{x(1-{y^2})(1-{z^2})}{xyz}+frac{y(1-{z^2})(1-{x^2})}{xyz}+frac{z(1-{x^2})(1-{y^2})}{xyz})[/math] =[math]xyz[/math]{[math](frac{1}{y}-y)(frac{1}{z}-z)+(frac{1}{z}-z)(frac{1}{x}-x)+(frac{1}{x}-x)(frac{1}{y}-y)[/math]} =[math]xyz[/math]{[math](frac{1}{yz}-frac{y}{z}-frac{z}{y}+yz)+(frac{1}{zx}-frac{z}{x}-frac{x}{z}+zx)+(frac{1}{xy}-frac{x}{y}-frac{x}{y}+xy)[/math]} =[math]xyz[/math]{[math](frac{1}{yz}+frac{1}{zx}+frac{1}{xy})-(frac{y}{z}+frac{z}{y}+frac{z}{x}+frac{x}{z}+frac{x}{y}+frac{y}{x})+(yz+zx+xy)[/math]} =[math]xyz[/math]{[math](frac{x+y+z}{xyz})-(frac{x+y}{z}+frac{y+z}{x}+frac{z+x}{y})+(xy+yz+zx)[/math]} If [math]x+y+z=xyz[/math] =>[math]x+y=xyz-z[/math]=>[math]frac{x+y}{z}=xy-1[/math] In the similar fashion we get =[math]xyz[/math]{[math]1-(xy-1+yz-1+zx-1)+(xy+yz+zx)[/math]} =[math]xyz[/math]{[math]4[/math]} =[math]4xyz[/math]"},{"instruction":"Why do waitresses ask if Coke is okay instead of Pepsi?

A small fish in a large tank with heavy filtration may not cause any problem. If the tank has many scavengers they may eat the dead fish which may also prevent any problems from happening. Leaving a dead fish in the aquarium is much like overfeeding the fish. You put in excess organic matter that begins to decay. If this exceeds the filter’s capacity to break down nitrogenous waste you could have an ammonia spike or get cloudy water. This adds stress to the remaining fish. The larger the fish compared to the aquarium the more likely you will have a problem. Removing the dead fish is comparable to removing excess food if you overfeed. There is rarely a good reason not to remove a dead fish if you see it. If the fish is recently dead, it is always a good idea to examine the fish to see if the cause of death is obvious.

Here are some steps to help you identify potential stocks for these trading strategies:Define your trading strategy: Determine your preferred time frame, risk tolerance, and trading objectives. Swing trading involves holding stocks for a few days to weeks, while positional trading involves holding stocks for several weeks to months. Use fundamental analysis: Conduct research on companies to identify those with strong fundamentals. Look for companies with solid financials, a competitive advantage, strong management, and positive industry outlook. Key factors to consider include earnings growth, revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, and industry trends. Screen for technical indicators: Apply technical analysis techniques to identify stocks with favorable price patterns and trends. Some common technical indicators used for swing trading and positional trading include moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillators, and Bollinger Bands. Look for stocks with clear chart patterns, such as breakouts, reversals, or trends. Scan for catalysts: Identify potential catalysts that could drive stock price movements. Catalysts can include earnings announcements, product launches, regulatory approvals, industry news, or economic events. News sources, financial websites, and earnings calendars can help you stay informed about upcoming events. Monitor volume and liquidity: Ensure that the stocks you select have sufficient trading volume and liquidity. Higher trading volume ensures smoother execution of trades and tighter bid-ask spreads, reducing the impact of slippage. Evaluate risk-reward ratios: Assess the potential risk and reward of each trade. Determine an appropriate stop-loss level to limit losses and establish a target price or exit strategy to capture profits. Ideally, you should seek trades with a favorable risk-reward ratio, where potential gains outweigh potential losses. Backtest and analyze historical data: Validate your trading strategy by backtesting it against historical stock price data. This process helps you assess the performance of your strategy under different market conditions. Analyze the results and make any necessary adjustments to your strategy. Stay informed and adapt: Continuously monitor the stocks in your portfolio and stay updated on market trends, news, and company-specific developments. Adjust your positions as needed based on changing market conditions."},{"instruction":"Was Art Carney winning the Oscar best actor for Harry and Tonto over Al Pacino in The Godfather: Part II and Jack Nicholson in Chinatown the worst acting choice ever?

And now imagine Turkey wants to be part of a privileged club in which sweden is one of the big partners. What would the swedes do? Oh yes, I know. They would say that what Turkiye is doing is a very modern and humanitarian thing, you know, giving those poor terrorists opportunities for free speech and unlimited propaganda. And they definitely would open their arms to welcome Turkiye into their priviliged club. Oh yeah. Letting idiots burn holy books of other religions? in front of the embassy of those countries whose vote you need to get into NATO? under police protection? Seriously guys, just grow up. Things don’t work that way in real life. Turkiye is a VERY reliable and absolutely important NATO partner. Nobody in NATO would replace Turkiye with Sweden. That would be an extremely stupid move.

You can not assume that they would believe your lie and be happy. Also you may need to repeat this lie as the Alzheimer's patient would forget what he had been told. This is different than agreeing with them to keep them calm. Here are some examples from patient interactions I had during my career: My patient was getting very stressed and agitated because she had to go to work. I told her that she had today off. She was very grateful and thanked me profusely. Another night a patient with severe dementia was bound and determined that she was going to leave. I could have argued with her and attempted to reorient her to her situation and her surroundings. But to what avail? I pointed out her bed and told her, “Here's a bed where you can rest while you’re waiting.” She got into bed and went to sleep. That was the last I heard from her about wanting to leave. This is one of my husband’s favorite stories. I went into a room because from the hallway, I could hear an old man yelling, “Murder one!! Murder one!!” repeatedly. I went into his room to see what’s going on. He's in bed yelling “Murder one!” while he's pulling on his Foley catheter. A Foley is a tube that goes into the bladder through the penis. It is connected to a drainage bag at the opposite end for urine collection. The tube is kept in the body by a small balloon that is filled with saline. My concern is that he will pull the Foley out with the balloon inflated and hurt himself. Not to mention it would be quite painful. I told him to stop because he was going to hurt himself. I tried to get him to let go, but he wasn't having any of it. He continued to pull on the catheter while yelling “Murder one!! Murder one!!” I told him, “It' s not murder one. It's involuntary manslaughter.” Don't ask me why, but this appeased him. He stopped yelling and let go. I started my career as a nurse’s aid in a nursing home in the mid seventies. Back then reality orientation was a thing. I watched a film strip in which a patient told her NA that her husband was coming to see her. The NA gently reminded her that her husband had died. Perhaps she meant her son. The patient agreed and said that she had forgotten..In real life nobody does this. They either start grieving like they're hearing this for the first time, or they get angry and call you a liar. Now you have someone who is still disoriented but is also angry, agitated, and upset. This is entirely different from outright lying and telling someone he's in an awesome resort. What if he wants to check out? Go to the pool? Order room service? What if he tells you that this is the worst place he has ever stayed? Don't lie to people. That isn't very nice. Work with them to stay calm and to try to make some sense of their surroundings. I should also point out that I have no examples of what happened after I outright lied to a confused and disoriented patient about where he was because I have never done that not been aware of anyone else doing so."},{"instruction":"w do you imagine life in 100 years?","output":"Why should I?

In fact many persians share common genoms with middle easterners. → This makes an East Asian origin for proto-Turkic unlikely. We see that East Asian ancestry was very low in the beginning and increased over time and with the migration of Mongolic and Tungusic groups.

Clearly you feel it’s for you because you’ve seen it come up again, also remember their hiring criteria might have changed. However maybe think more laterally this time about how you can get in front of the hiring manager without getting disqualified by HR first (who may not wish to accept they made a mistake first time around), getting your resume through HR can be a very random experience. Long while ago I saw a job advertised that interested me, I applied but HR told me no go. However I happened to discover an old university friend of mine was VP at that same company and knew the hiring manager well. We had dinner together that night and he told me the job was mine. We’d been drinking so my wife came to pick me up and accidently drove into his car, don’t know if that was why the job never happened or just HR wanted to assert themselves:). With hindsight I’m not sure we shared the same ethical values, so maybe that all turned out for the best. Even longer ago I wanted to transfer from the Australian sales office to HQ for a California Tech Company. I made sure I had a good relationship with one of the HR people and would call her each week. Not much was happening so I eventually quit my job in Australia and jumped on a plane. Got talking to a manager who told me the PERFECT job for me had just been given to someone else. Turns out the company had 3 HR recruiters who each had their own portfolio of roles to fill, the person I’d been talking to had no interest in passing my resume around to her colleagues. Moral of the story again is don’t trust HR - if you really think the job is for you try to build a direct relationship with the hiring manager."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite RDBMS (commercial or open source) and why? Is your perspective as a DBA or developer?","output":"Before answering, let me say one thing: I believe in using the right tool for the right purpose. I won’t hide behind this idea, and I will answer. Just remember that I appreciate all good products, with a preference with the open source vision. Whoever enjoys only one product is very far from me, it doesn’t really matter if we happen to prefer the same DBMS. That said… my favourite is MySQL (which includes Percona Server and MariaDB, for me). I will be honest: I have of course objective reasons, but I also have personal preference. That is true for all of us. All DBMSs are good, yet you will always hear very good professionals saying that X is much better than everything else, or Y is terrible - and maybe you know that X misses some feature that the rest of the world has, or Y runs successfully some huge services. Then, why? Simply because even good professionals often try to “objectivize” their personal preferences. I won’t. So let’s start from the personal preference. MySQL was the first DBMS I put my hands on, after a brief parentheses with Access and SQL Server. It was 2000… frankly, at the time Access was more than enough to run an average website. But sometimes it could corrupt without any chance to recover data (yes, it happened to me). SQL Server was of course much better. But for all things I needed, it was equivalent or outperformed by the little MySQL. Yes, I wrote outperformed. I didn’t need foreign keys, I didn’t know I needed transactions, I didn’t know what triggers are. Nowadays it supports all these things, and sometimes I wish it only supported transactions. My skills grew with MySQL, I learnt some things when MySQL implemented them. I learned how to optimize SQL in general (on any DBMS) mostly by reading MySQL documentation. I think that this explains why I love it. But fortunately that’s not all: I’m still a professional, not a fan. Now, to the more objective stuff. MySQL is not yet feature complete (compared to something like Db2), and will never be really clean. It will always be full of small dirty details that give its haters an opportunity to say “Oh my gosh, how can anyone who is supposed to be more evolved than an amoeba conceive this stupid s**t”. And they write this on all social media, trying to forget that all of them rely mainly on MySQL. Why? Because in practice, it works. And it works amazingly well. Stored procedures may be buggy and slow. It may be unable to cope with big transactions. But when you bomb it with many short, concurrent transactions, it just responds well. This is vital, stored procedures are just cool. Does it cause some pains in the neck? Of course it does. Is recovery fast? No. Does it work well with tables without a primary key? No. Is fulltext friendly with realistic workloads? No. But come on, if this is a problem and you don’t invest your money in a DBA who is capable to cope with this, the problem is you. And let’s not forget how it can make a DBA’s life easier: only one buffer pool (in the first place… it has a buffer pool), replication is extremely simple, slow log if configured properly is a powerful tool, it supports a wide range of online DDL, and above all there is no need for autovacuum. And then, there are objective non-technical reasons. A lot of them. For example, if your company has problems with Oracle (tell me about it :) ) you can have other support providers, or even use a different flavour. Bug tracker is public (obviously, you say? well, Postgres doesn’t have one). Community is very active, and its behaviour is always extremely constructive. Probably all giants except for Amazon contribute to MySQL or MariaDB. Do I like it in all contexts? Well, if you read the first part of my answer, you should know that the answer is no. For example I would not recommend it for non-trivial analytics, or timeseries workloads, or where some features are needed but MySQL implementation is disappointing (stored procedures, XA transactions…)."},{"instruction":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","output":"Earning 1,000 per month as a freelancer is definitely achievable with the right strategies and dedication.

It is commonly built in two configurations - Foam based and Spring based. Spring mattresses make use of either one of the bonnell, offset, pocket-spring and continuous coils as the core/support material on top of which a comfort layer is attached. it is meant to provide adequate comfort and cushioning to the user’s body. When lying/sitting on a spring mattress, the body does not get sunken into the mattress like in case of foam mattress, but stays above it. This facilitates easier turning movements during sleep. As a thumb rule, springs having diameter in the range of 1.3-1.7 mm (14 to 16-gauge) make up for a high quality mattress which provides the best balance between firmness and cushioning and provides the best support to the body.Whereas, the springs having diameters above 1.7 mm (12 gauge) make the mattress too firm and it no longer remains supportive or comfortable. Whereas, Foam based mattress makes use of either PU or Memory foam as the core/support layer, on top of which the comfort layer is built. Among the two, Memory foam provides better all-round comfort to the body as compared to a PU foam and is well suited for people who suffer from neck/spine issues or other who prefer body hugging comfort. On the other hand, mattresses built with PU foam provide better temperature regulation and the user sleeps cooler than in case of memory foam mattress. In addition to the insights shared above, factors such as the dimensions of the mattress one should decide on according to the dimensions of the bed and awareness about the ways by which some brands cut manufacturing costs and produce low-grade mattresses which cause several neck and spine issues too play influential roles in determining the product one should opt for.

Unfiltered air is emitted with this sort of mask, as the wearer exhales. Health care workers must be qualified and undergo a fitness test before using an N95 respirator in the workplace to ensure a proper seal. The N95 masks are meant to be disposable, like surgical masks. Scientists are therefore exploring ways of disinfecting N95 masks so that they can be reused. Some N95 masks, and even some cloth masks, have one-way valves which facilitate breathing through them.

And how do you move on in everyday life?","output":"It’s hard. The trauma bond is a constant companion that no one else can see. It’s everywhere. It’s in everything. It follows me in the car. It sits with me at work. It goes to the grocery store with me. It watches tv with me. It’s on the treadmill at the gym with me. It goes to bed with me. It wakes up with me. It’s in the shower with me. It makes coffee and eats breakfast with me. It pumps gas with me. It goes out with me when I let my dog out. It’s standing next to me when I do the dishes and when I make dinner and when I fold my laundry. It never leaves me. But I can still drive my car. I can still do my job. I can still do the dishes and take my dog out and watch tv. I can still get to the treadmill at the gym, climb on and push the “start” button. Jokes are still funny. My co-workers still make me laugh. My dog still warms my heart. I’m still proud of my son and excited to see him plan his future. I still go to bed and I still get up in the morning. I can still put one foot in front of the other. I can still smile. I can still help someone else. Everything hurts, but everything is still there. Everyone around me still sees me standing here, unaware of the knife I can’t pull out of my back. I’m still here. My life is completely different now, but nothing has really changed other than some missing furniture and an open space where someone used to always sit and make me nervous. How do I go on? I just do. What other choice is there? Sometimes I wonder what the point of it all is. I never realized the amount of pain and misery that a human being could carry around with them. But then I’m thankful, because I do realize that now. I have so many years left in my life, and I won’t spend one more of them being blind to the pain that some people feel. I will understand. And if we’re not here to learn and grow and understand each other, then what are we here for? How can we ever understand each other when we’ve never felt the pain of another person? How can we ever help each other through life when we can’t understand? I have so much more left to do and so many more people to meet. There will come a day in my life when I can look someone else in the eye, lay my hand on their shoulder and say “I understand”. That’s what the point of it all is. Pain and misery exists. To live an entire life avoiding it all is not to live at all. None of us are ever really alone, and when one more person can understand how another one feels, we are that much more connected. Pain is the catalyst for growth. A bone grows back stronger where it breaks. What will I be when I am healed? I will be better than I was before. Much better. Nothing in life worth anything comes without some pain. I have faith that through the pain of trauma, I can be a better person. I can make a greater difference in the world. I will become who I was always meant to be. This pain is temporary. My compassion and understanding will stay with me for the rest of my life."},{"instruction":"Would a random number generator be more or less random than me just randomly saying numbers? Why or why not?","output":"It depends on the random number generator and you, but most likely the random number generator would be more random. Random is an interesting concept. What does it mean for a number to be random? How about what it means for a sequence of numbers to be random? What does it mean for something to be more or less random? The answer to all these questions is it depends. What is the set of possible results? Is the set bounded by range, such as [math][0,1)[/math],* or by value, such as integers or even numbers? Is the probability distribution uniform, or some other non-uniform distribution such as Poisson distribution? Any constructed random number generator generates numbers with finite precision within a finite range. So as a human, if I understand the bounds on the random number generator, I can choose to give values outside that range. That makes my “random” number less predictable and thus “more random” than values from the random number generator. This is true even though as a human, I’m incapable of anything uniformly random. However, if I’m confined to the same bounds as the random number generator, AND that generator is sufficiently random and uniform, then the generator will be “more random”. * The notation [math][0,1)[/math] means numbers [math]n[/math] such that [math]0 <= n < 1[/math]."},{"instruction":"Who would win between Mr. Mxyzptlk (DC comic) and Gojo (Jujutsu Kaisen)?","output":"Mxyzptlk dont have any limit except the writting simply because he's not a real character.

When I was publicity officer of the Raoul Wallenberg Committer in London, one night when I was slightly drunk, somebody asked me what Wallenberg was like as a person, and without thinking I said “Bertie Wooster with Jeeves’ intellect”. Most of my favourite lines from my own writing are from filk (SF-based folksongs) or fanfiction. Explaining these involves spoilers. In the Chanur series by CJ Cherryth the story is told from the viewpoint of a lioness-like alien called Pyanfar Chanur, She becomes politically involved with an alien overlord whose policy is to encourage his subordinates to gain power for themselves, but if they become a threat he kills them and takes all their gains. I wrote a song about Pyanfar’s story, which goes to the tune “I was a young man, I was a rover”. It contains this verse: For my dark master gave me power,Meaning to harvest ere I grew too grand;But the seed has harvested the sower -Now all the worlds are in my hand. That one line, “The seed has harvested the sower”, pleases me the most out of anything I’ve ever written down. Then there are a few from Harry Potter fanfics. There’s one where Snape - who is in a hospital bed recovering from pneumonia - is talking to Remus, the werewolf, and trying to explain why being stripped and publicly humiliated by the gang of bullies Remus used to hang around with at school did him so much psychological damage. Remus isn’t really getting it, and Snape gives him a weary look and says “I’m sitting - no, lying here talking about dignity to someone who washes himself with his tongue.” Another line I’m fond of, from the sequel to that story, has post-Hogwarts Harry and Snape discussing Peter Pettigrew. Snape says \\"Wormtail is such a twitchy little shit that not even a psychopath like Riddle could place much reliance on him, but he does have his Master's ear,\\" and Harry mutters under his breath “Yeah - probably in a box in the fridge.”"},{"instruction":"f you quit Quora, do you think anyone would miss you?","output":"Definitely I miss one peculiar person her name was [LINKED_TEXT: Krishna Ashok] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Krishna-Ashok-12] such a kindhearted person well I would miss her alot though she was not available now.

While most of them have evolved from the dancing rituals at the temples and involve storytelling mostly about Gods and Goddesses. There are eight dance forms recognized as classical dances by the Sahitya Natak Akademi. 1. Bharatnatayam: This dance form has its origin in the state of Tamil Nadu. Bharatnatyam itself has been derived from a dance form called Sadir, it was performed by Devdasis in temples. The dance form is characterized by half sitting postures commonly along with different Mudras (figures made using palms and fingers). The expressions are a very important part of any classical dance form. Bharatnatyam involves a lot of eye movements. EDIT : That's me performing :D 2. Kuchipudi: It originated in the state of Andhra Pradesh and is named after a village in the same state, where it was practised extensively. It shares a lot of similarities with Bharatnatayam (both the dance forms are believed to be based on Natyashastra written by Bharat Muni). There are certain stylistic differences between the two dance forms. One thing that is specific to Kuchipudi is Tarangam the artist holds plate with two diyas (small oil-burning candles) in his or her hands while balancing a \\"kindi\\" (small vessel) containing water. The costumes of Bharatnatyam and Kuchipudi vary slightly. 3. Kathak: Kathak is said to have originated in North India and the name literally means ' storyteller'. It has absorbed a lot of features of persian dance during the Mughal Era.The structure of a conventional Kathak performance tends to follow a progression in tempo from slow to fast, ending with a dramatic climax. A short dance composition is known as a tukra, a longer one as a toda. There are also compositions consisting solely of footwork. Often the performer will engage in rhythmic play with the time-cycle, for example splitting it into triplets or quintuplets which will be marked out on the footwork, so that it is in counterpoint to the rhythm on the percussion. The most striking feature are the elaborate spins performed by the artist. 4. Kathakali: Kathakali is a stylized classical [LINKED_TEXT: Indian] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India] [LINKED_TEXT: dance] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance]-[LINKED_TEXT: drama] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama] noted for the attractive make-up of characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion. It originated in the country's present day state of [LINKED_TEXT: Kerala] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala] during the 17th century and has developed over the years with improved looks, refined gestures and added themes besides more ornate singing and precise drumming. Popular belief is that kathakali is emerged from \\"[LINKED_TEXT: Krishnanattam] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnanattam]\\", the dance drama on the life and activities of Lord Krishna. It is mostly done by men and when not wearing costume can be easily identified by the multiple facial movements. 5.Mohiniyattam: Mohiniyattam is a classical [LINKED_TEXT: dance] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance] form from [LINKED_TEXT: Kerala] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala], [LINKED_TEXT: India] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India]. Believed to have originated in 16th century. It is considered a very graceful form of dance meant to be performed as solo recitals by women. The word \\"Mohiniyattam\\" literally means \\"dance of the enchantress\\". There are two stories of the Lord [LINKED_TEXT: Vishnu] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu] disguised as a Mohini. In one, he appears as Mohini to lure the [LINKED_TEXT: asuras] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asuras] (demons) away from the [LINKED_TEXT: amrita] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amrita] (nectar of immortality) obtained during the churning of the palazhi (ocean of milk and salt water).

The name Mohiniyattam may have been coined after Lord Vishnu; the main theme of the dance is love and devotion to God, with usually Vishnu or [LINKED_TEXT: Krishna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna] being the hero. Devadasis used to perform this in temples. It also has elements of Koothu and [LINKED_TEXT: Kottiyattom] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koodiyattam]. Mohiniyattam is a drama in dance and verse. 6. Manipuri: It originates from [LINKED_TEXT: Manipur] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur], a state in north-eastern [LINKED_TEXT: India] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India] on the border with [LINKED_TEXT: Burma] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma]. The cult of [LINKED_TEXT: Radha] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha] and [LINKED_TEXT: Krishna] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna], particularly the [LINKED_TEXT: raslila] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raslila] is central to this dance form.The traditional Manipuri dance style embodies delicate, lyrical and graceful movements. The aim is to make rounded movements and avoid any jerks, sharp edges or straight lines. It is this which gives Manipuri dance its undulating and soft appearance. The foot movements are viewed as part of a composite movement of the whole body. The dancer puts his or her feet down, even during vigorous steps, with the balls of the feet touching the ground first. The ankle and knee joints are effectively used as shock absorbers. The dancer’s feet are neither put down nor lifted up at the precise rhythmic points of the music but rather slightly earlier or later to express the same rhythmic points most effectively. 7. Oddisi: It has its roots in present day Odisha. It is particularly distinguished from other [LINKED_TEXT: classical Indian dance] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_dance] forms by the importance it places upon the [LINKED_TEXT: Tribhangi] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhangi] (literally: three parts break), the independent movement of head, chest and pelvis[LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odissi#cite_note-3][LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odissi#cite_note-hi-4] and upon the basic square stance known as Chauka or Chouka that symbolises [LINKED_TEXT: Lord Jagannath] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagannath].

The core of Sattriya Nritya has usually been [LINKED_TEXT: mythological] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythological] stories.

In fact, microwave cooking can be a convenient and safe way to cook food. Microwave ovens work by using electromagnetic waves to produce heat, which causes water molecules in the food to vibrate and produce steam, resulting in the heating of the food. This method of cooking can be faster and more efficient than other methods, such as stovetop or oven cooking. There is no difference in the nutritional value of food cooked in a microwave compared to food cooked using other methods. However, it's important to use microwave-safe containers and to follow the manufacturer's instructions for your microwave oven to ensure that the food is cooked safely and properly.

They described going into a diner in, I think, California, ordered hamburgers with the lot, meaning beef, egg, cheese, onion, tomato, lettuce, beetroot and ketchup. The guy taking the order looked completely weirded out and said “you want an egg on your burger?” When they nodded cheerily, he turned around and shouted to his workmate/cook, “hey Mac, these dudes want egg and beetroot on their burgers!” as if it was just totally unheard of. Then all the staff stared over at them as if they were off an alien spacecraft. This was before the days that Burger King and MacDonalds had established themselves and their limited standardised notions of what a burger is in our own country (Australia). In ordinary old fish and chip and hamburger shops here, there was no versions of hamburgers, you simply listed the contents. If the contents were in the place, that's what you got. NQA. And when I was in Southern Texas myself, my sister and I came through a town that had a huge barn that had been converted into a bakery and a diner. The sign also said “Fresh Bread\\". We thought “fantastic! We love all the Tex Mex we've been eating, but we really would adore a fresh salad sandwich.” So in we went and I ordered a swiss cheese, tomato, pickle and lettuce sandwich. Pretty basic huh? First thing was they couldn't handle me standing there waiting for them to just make it so we could go. They demanded I sit down and then they insisted on a “side order”. I said, “I don't want a side order, just a sandwich please\\". Then they said, “are you sure you want lettuce?”. I nodded, “oh yes, I really like a fresh salad sandwich”. My sister ordered something similar. Well, they insisted on side orders and drinks, so I got refried beans and tea. They were okay but not what I wanted AT ALL. And then out comes the sandwich. Coated in grease and press toasted! What the fuck? No wonder they couldn't understand why I wanted lettuce. It was shriveled to slimy nothingness. And they didn't tell me it would be a fried sandwich either. Cross cultural confusion obviously. But it wouldn't have hurt if they had asked “would you like your sandwich fresh or toasted?” Anyway, I know now that for some reason lots of cultures toast or fry everything. And to ask for what you want exactly, no ambiguity. And now in Australia “fresh not toasted” has become a thing to have to say, whereas before it was round the other way and anyone wanting sandwiches toasted had to ask especially."},{"instruction":"Why did punk rock die?","output":"I’m not sure it isn’t.

How far could a senior commander go in arguing with Hitler before it became dangerous for him to continue?","output":"Define ‘dangerous’. If you’re thinking ‘dangerous for your life or freedom’, never. Not a single German officer was ever executed, imprisoned, or otherwise punished for arguing with Hitler- and a lot of them argued with Hitler. Guderian’s particularly famous, because he served a long period of the war reporting directly to Hitler and had a lot of chances to argue with him, but he’s far from being the only one. Model is famous for his ‘Who commands the Ninth Army, mein Führer, you or I?’ delivered to Hitler’s face in front of the latter’s entire staff. Manstein got so notorious for quarreling with Hitler that when he was dismissed in 1944, Army Group South staff pitched in to buy him a farewell gift… an oil painting of two roosters fighting. Hell, General der Panzertruppe Dietrich von Saucken probably got a gold medal on arguing with Hitler on 12 March 1945, when he was summoned to Hitler’s headquarters to take command of the Second Army. Already insulting Hitler right from the start by not surrendering his sword(which Saucken, as a dyed-in-the-wool Junker and an old cavalryman, pretty much wore everywhere) and giving him the Army salute as opposed to the raised-arm Hitler salute as was an often-ignored regulation since 20 July 1944. When Hitler gave him his army command and told him he’d take his orders from the Gauleiter of Danzig, Saucken struck the table with his hand and said ‘I have no intention, Herr Hitler, of placing myself under the orders of a Gauleiter.’ Hitler simply told Saucken to then keep command himself. Dietrich von Saucken- pictured with his monocle, as ubiquitous an article for him as his cavalry sword. Nobody ever suffered any harm to their person as a consequence of arguing with Hitler. Not even when they openly disrespected or insulted him. But if you’re talking about ‘dangerous for their career,’ that’s a different matter. Now, Hitler wasn’t an idiot who picked his preferred officers just based on how much they liked him or respected him, but his personal opinion obviously was an element. It was a complex mental equation that factored in the abilities of any given officer, his willingness to follow orders, and Hitler’s personal opinion of him. Thus, the degree of hostile arguments towards Hitler a general could show before, say, a dismissal from his post and being sent to the Führerreserve ranged greatly between individual officers, and his favorites like Model could indeed get away with a lot. That being said, it was even then rather unlikely that a general would be dismissed from his post for arguing with Hitler. More often than not, dismissal from post was a result of Hitler sincerely considering the officer in question not a good fit for the post and mission he had: now, of course Hitler’s evaluation with regards to this wasn’t always right, but even if the reason was wrong, he usually had a reason more than ‘he argues with me’ for dismissing an officer."},{"instruction":"false surrendering a war crime?

He would wake up scared, and afraid to go back to sleep. After each episode I would try to distract his thoughts. We spent many late evenings in the kitchen staying up and eating milk and cookies which he was happy to have. It was always difficult for him to fall back asleep right away because he was thinking about the nightmares. After the third or fourth nightmare I decided I would try something different. Before he went to bed that night I went into my jewelry box and pulled out a clear red, heart-shaped plastic trinket. When it was bedtime he asked me, \\"what if I have a nightmare?\\" I showed him the trinket and explained to him that it was a \\"lucky charm.\\" I said as long as he had it he wouldn’t have a nightmare. We placed it under his pillow as I told him from now on the charm would keep the bad dreams away and he would have only good dreams. He seemed satisfied and fell asleep comfortably.

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a worthwhile venture for several reasons. Before diving into the details, I want to emphasize that cryptocurrencies are legal and can provide significant opportunities for making money. It's essential to approach this topic with an open mind and consider the potential benefits and risks associated with investing in this exciting market. Firstly, cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized form of digital currency that operates independently of any central authority, such as a government or financial institution. This decentralized nature provides several advantages, including increased security, privacy, and transparency. Transactions made with cryptocurrencies are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, ensuring that they cannot be tampered with or altered. One of the primary reasons why investing in cryptocurrencies is attractive to many is the potential for substantial returns on investment. Over the past decade, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have seen remarkable growth, with some investors making significant profits. However, it's crucial to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and subject to rapid price fluctuations. Therefore, it's essential to approach investing in cryptocurrencies with a long-term perspective and employ proper risk management strategies. Another benefit of investing in cryptocurrencies is the accessibility it offers. Unlike traditional financial markets, which often have high barriers to entry, anyone with an internet connection can invest in cryptocurrencies with minimal capital. This inclusivity has democratized the investing landscape and allowed individuals from all walks of life to participate in this emerging asset class. Moreover, cryptocurrencies provide an alternative investment option that diversifies one's portfolio. Traditional investments like stocks and bonds are subject to market conditions and economic factors that may impact their performance. By adding cryptocurrencies to a diversified investment portfolio, individuals can potentially reduce risk and potentially achieve higher returns. Additionally, investing in cryptocurrencies can be an excellent way to support innovative technologies and contribute to their growth. Many cryptocurrencies are built on groundbreaking blockchain technology, which has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and more. By investing in these technologies, individuals can help accelerate their development and adoption, which may have far-reaching societal benefits. However, it's essential to approach cryptocurrency investment with caution and conduct thorough research before making any financial decisions. As with any investment, there are risks involved, and not all cryptocurrencies are created equal. It's crucial to assess factors such as the project's team, technology, market demand, and regulatory landscape before investing. In conclusion, investing in cryptocurrencies can be a worthwhile endeavor for those willing to embrace the opportunities and navigate the risks associated with this emerging asset class. It offers the potential for substantial returns, accessibility for all investors, diversification benefits, and support for innovative technologies. However, it's crucial to approach cryptocurrency investment with careful consideration, conduct proper research, and be prepared for the inherent volatility of this market.

Affiliate marketing is some way or another associated with income sans work. That is the reason there are such countless individuals out there doing it incorrectly, figuring they will bring in cash just by essentially yelling out \\"Purchase now\\". Indeed, here's a reality bomb tossed at you. You won't bring in any critical cash in the event that you don't offer some benefit. This is the very thing that my experience as a Subsidiary Advertiser has shown me so far in regards to what works and what doesn't. 1. Understand what you're discussing. Member destinations are item/administration audit locales. What's the center of audits? Real important data. You won't make careful head-to-heads between 2 items to know with respect to those. Also, truth is, you can't give that in the event that you don't have the foggiest idea about the topic all around OK. Clients are not idiotic. Indeed, you could possibly trick certain individuals being half-knowledged regarding a matter, however you can't scale a partner site in the event that you don't actually know a great deal. This goes considerably something else for subsidiaries that are into specialties, as web based betting for instance (which is famous for partners), that require skill. 2. Pick a specialty you like. Offshoot Promoting enjoys one major benefit that can likewise end up being a burden. You can decide to advance anything you desire. The precarious part however is to try not to pick a specialty you could do without on the grounds that you heard that transformation rates are great and you will go from poverty to newfound wealth in the blink of an eye. That stuff doesn't occur and you're about to wind up expounding on something you disdain. Its a well known fact that one of the recipes for progress is to accomplish something you love and Subsidiary Showcasing is no special case for that. 3. Try not to pursue cutthroat catchphrases. Do you have any idea what's the Sacred goal of catchphrases for a member advertiser? Best [insert specialty keyword]. Best of luck attempting to rank for those on the off chance that you decide to fabricate a site around them, and trust me as I probably am aware that for a fact. Obviously, it generally relies upon the upward you're in and the way that immersed it is. In any case, picking the right catchphrases and furthermore concentrating on the plan behind those watchwords is something that represents the deciding moment Partner Advertisers. Perhaps of the most exceedingly terrible thing you can do is stirring up plans, specifically utilizing watchwords that have an educational aim in a piece that is simply composed for conditional purposes. A decent method to try not to pursue serious watchwords is to decide to survey items that are new and not as yet really well known and get an early advantage on endeavoring to rank for catchphrases connected with those, instead of old and cutthroat ones. 4. Research accomplices before you begin working with them. Here is another reality bomb.

They see everyone as competition. They think this is a good business strategy. Of course it is not but that does not matter to these ideologues. Also, unfortunately the US has a ‘president’ and republican political party who do the bidding of the government in the Kremlin. The Kremlin wants an end to the EU and NATO. They want the European countries to be divided and weak so that they can appear stronger than they actually are. The Kremlin government does very little to improve the lives of most Russians or to really improve Russia’s economy so what they do instead is to bring their perceived competitors down. Make no mistake about it. This is a Russian government endeavor, not an American one. America just happens to have a government and a minority voting bloc who are useful idiots."},{"instruction":"What are the best freelancing sites?","output":"Some of the best freelancing websites where you can find a variety of freelance opportunities are: 1.

The term originates from a Latin word meaning \\"light-bringer\\" or \\"morning star,\\" and it has been used in various religious and mythological contexts. In Jewish tradition, the concept of evil and its source is rooted in the belief that there is a force called the \\"Yetzer Hara\\" (evil inclination) which exists within each individual, tempting them to engage in sinful behavior. This belief is not tied to a specific entity like Lucifer, but rather emphasizes the internal struggle between good and evil that all humans face. Furthermore, the theological focus of Orthodox Judaism is on the worship of one God, YHWH, and adherence to the commandments and teachings found in the Torah. The idea of an evil entity serving God contradicts the fundamental understanding of God's nature and the nature of evil in Orthodox Jewish thought. It is important to differentiate between the beliefs of Orthodox Judaism and interpretations or ideas that may have been borrowed from other religious traditions. While there might be some modern interpretations or syncretic ideas that suggest Lucifer as a servant of God, these interpretations are not mainstream or reflective of Orthodox Jewish doctrine."},{"instruction":"Do childhood vaccinations cause autism?

We may even say that “Ego” is one of the worst “poisons” – that can be more lethal to our well-being than anything else. If we allow our ego to take over, we can destroy everything around us including ourselves and rising pollution levels as well as great damage to biodiversity is the visible proof. All the lethal weapons are also the sign of big egos. Remember that the worst problem with the ego is that it loves to win and win at all costs; whether it’s an arguments, a relationships, or war against Axis alliance during WWII. Hitler is also a good example of an “inflated ego.” Some sources claim that for Hitler individuality was an egoistic and culture-corroding value because it duped people into forgetting about and thereby relinquishing their role in the collective group, which he called “race-consciousness.” But it is also believed that his parents impeded healthy development resulting in extreme imbalances in Hitler’s Id, Ego and Superego that marred his adult adjustment and cognition, sexually, mentally and emotionally.

Clinton had decades of experience in politics, law, and public service. She served as First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, and was the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Trump lacked any substantial experience or qualifications in comparison. • Policy expertise and nuance. Clinton supported moderate, nuanced policy positions informed by evidence and expertise. Trump proposed controversial, vague or implausible policies with little grounding or nuance. • Temperament and stability. Clinton was seen as a steady, stable leader, while Trump was seen as erratic, impulsive and prone to unpredictable outbursts.

The financing may include your monthly installments plus the interest for the car loan. At the end of the loan, the car is yours. As for leasing a car, you have to enter a leasing contract and pay the installments for using the car. It is more like renting and after the end of the leasing period you do not own it, you have to return it to the leasing company. The benefit of leasing is that you have to pay smaller installments as compared to financing. Additionally, there are online platforms like [LINKED_TEXT: quitalease] [URL: https://quitalease.com/] where you can buy a running lease and that may cost you lower as well.

I lost my nani, my lovely nani. Many of my so-called concerned friends tried to take advantage of me. One of the incidents would be a friend telling me why didn't I spend some alone time with him. Things got worse during the start of the year itself. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and PTSD, and some physical health issues in the following months. I was not content with my personal and professional life. I felt swamped every time with emotions. I would burst into tears at any point in the day. I remember sweating profusely for no reason. I even made a list of symptoms I witnessed. These are just a few of them. But all these times, I always found someone, I could text anytime. We fought a lot during last year. There were fights over petty issues and bigger ones too. Sometimes we didn't talk to each other for weeks. But each of us gave more priority to our friendship than our ego. He used to send me reels/ posts/ videos to cheer me up. There were times when I didn't see anything ahead, and he convinced me that it was fine to get lost at times in life. Life is not perfect.

I’m exhausted with therapy although I have a good therapist, I feel I failed or can’t control my behavior so what’s the point. What to do?","output":"I am a nurse. Five years ago, I knew that many diseases were difficult to cure, especially mental illness and depression, as well as rare and intractable conditions. Medicines are only used to alleviate and control the symptoms of physical diseases, but spiritual diseases cannot be cured by medicines, including mental and psychological diseases. For more than 10 years, my memory was poor and I often felt like I was in a trance, my face was dark and my limbs were weak, and I feel chilled throughout my body. Acupuncture and herbal treatments did not help. Two years before practicing Buddhism, my body's state had deteriorated in all aspects. I couldn't figure out why I couldn't live like a normal person full of vim and vigor. No one could tell me. I lived like a walking dead, in an absolute helpless state. Negative energy was often discharged from my mouth as a result of sufferings. The people around me couldn't understand. They always claimed that I have a mental illness. I was even more confused. Fortunately, in July 2018, while working on the ward, a Buddhist came to the nurse's station and discussed Buddhism with my colleagues. I accepted Buddhism with joy after learning that it can cure diseases. I held the scriptures in my hands like a child, and I recited word by word. Sometimes it was very difficult to read, and I fell asleep on my stomach before I finished chanting the Great Compassion Mantra one times. Later, I had several dreams and confirmed by my mom. Until then did I learn that my mother had had 5-6 miscarriages. I also dreamed my deceased grandparents who had been collecting karmic debts from me in my body for many years. Moreover, I was born in a rural area and my family has a history of killing. Additionally, I have killed countless animals in my past and present lives. Thus, my life was made worse than death by all these karma. Even though it's challenging, I keep on reciting scriptures every day, release animals frequently, and I made a vow to be a vegetarian. I have recited over 3000 Little Houses for my karmic creditors within 5 years. Now I can live confidently like a normal person. I am proud that my wishes often come true at work, study, and tests. I will tell more people that the powers of Buddha are unlimited. By paying off your karmic debts, you will be able to live a better life both in this life and the next. Like me, may you practice Buddhism and recite scriptures, cultivate blessings and wisdom, and welcome a bright future.

Don’t let tedious and recurring tasks drive you away from launching a successful product. You’ve got more important things to do than individually keeping an eye on every team member just to make sure they are doing their job, right? Don’t make your already difficult work even more difficult. In this post we’ve prepared a list of tools that will make your and yours team job much easier, faster and productive. Some of them are loosely about collaboration and management but bare with me, they will certainly help you with your everyday work. ‘Cause no one wants to work hard, right? So, here’s a list of the top eight collaboration tools that are best suited for start-ups: ProofHub is probably one of the most effective and safe-to-use project management and general collaboration tools available in the market. With useful features like 1 on 1 and group chat that allows you to interactive and talk with your team in real time. ProofHub is best suited for start-ups who need to work together on single or multiple projects at a time. The software’s highlight is its “discussion” feature, which offers everyone a common platform on which they can share information among themselves and with others. Google Docs is a virtual file storage and sharing platform that allows you to create detailed spreadsheets, word documents, and impactful presentations, from virtually any connected device. Google Docs has become an indispensable part of any business, both new and old, not because it allows users to create documents from anywhere, but because users can remotely access their files from anywhere at any time. Zoho effectively brings back the element of interaction that is often missed when teams work remotely. Zoho also features a nifty “project meetings” option that allows you to schedule team meetings, via on-going and expired events, and even prepares minutes of the meeting on your behalf. Skype has been a household name for video chat for a while now, but the brand’s recent foray in to the corporate world has taken official audio and video services to a whole other level. Skype allows you to send messages, tag your colleagues on a video, or just hold a simple video conference. Google Hangouts is a great tool when you need to be in frequent contact with everyone in your team, without the need for any specialized video conferencing products. Brief is one of the best alternatives to Slack. It is super easy to use and its elegant dashboard combines several key features like chat, video, to-do lists, team hubs, and file sharing. Be it a video chat, team collaboration, task priority, or file sharing, brief knows how to get the things done efficiently. With brief, there’s no need to email or dropbox large files, you can easily transfer files, share images within the chat regardless of their size. Brief users’ files and all user communication is encrypted via TLS with Elliptic-curve cryptography. You can use Brief on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. Biref is definitely worth your time to check it out to get a little bit more than what Slack offers. HipChat is an easy-to-use chat app that also offers collaboration tools. HipChat comes with one-on-one instant messaging, group chat rooms, file sharing, screen sharing and video conferencing. It also integrates with various third-party apps – Facebook, Dropbox, Google Apps and Salesforce – so it becomes a streamlined part of a company's communications. Microsoft Teams is software as a service that ties directly to the productivity giant's Office 365 subscription. It creates a chat-based workspace that's focused on real-time collaboration. It includes chat, meetings, notes, Office, Planner, Power BI, and extensions and apps. It looks a bit like Slack and functions similarly, with threaded persistent chats that can be open or private. It also integrates with the company's Skype video service, plus you can invite guests to join your chats. If you're a Microsoft-focused business, Teams may be the way to go. Good luck."},{"instruction":"What industries need lead generation and marketing?","output":"Nearly all industries can benefit from lead generation and marketing, as every business needs to find and attract potential customers to grow their sales and revenue. However, industries with longer sales cycles or higher ticket items, such as B2B companies, real estate, healthcare, and financial services, often require more targeted and strategic lead generation and marketing efforts.

But does it mean it unites people? Then why random incidents like Bihari’s are attacked in Mumbai happens. Because most Marathi people like Biharis speak flawless Hindi. Didn’t the language unite them? North east people got attacked in random incidents in New Delhi even though all speak Hindi. Did Hindi region people got united just because most of them has mother tongue as Hindi? Language did not unite in true sense but a collective attitude does that irrespective of the language. Even though European Union is divided based on language they have unparalleled unity among themselves compared to Indians of different state. Let’s see the other side of the coin as well! In Bangalore many educated Kannadigas in IT companies start the conversation in Hindi with the North Indian colleagues. This made those colleagues happy. I too got that thing to some extent to continue conversation in Hindi mixed liberally with English. And sometimes those North Indian colleagues say that Tamilians hate Hindi and did not show any interest to learn like Kannadigas. And surprised that how come I learnt Hindi. I explained to them most of the time that their stereotype about Tamilians is wrong since the exposure of Tamil people to Hindi is less, they did not study as mandatory subject in state board and the Sanskrit influence of Tamil is less compared to other South Indian languages. And seeing the other side of the coin some Kannadigas hate Hindi people trying to speak only in Hindi with rural Kannadigas who does not know Hindi. So yes Hindi unites and divides as well! But I don’t consider this unity of Indians as pure just because one speak other’s language. Because it’s used to divide people who could not speak that language. As Indians with diverse set of languages we need to develop an attitude to respect people equally even though we know different languages and did not know any particular language. This collective spirit and attitude only can truly unite us. Seeing the central government’s policies Hindi is clearly over promoted and Hindi knowledge is attributed to patriotism and nationalism wrongly. This triggers many Indians whose mother tongue is non-Hindi. This should end. Hindi is no special compared to other languages. It’s like people calling Hindi and Non-Hindi which is still centered around Hindi. This is not right. It’s like Brahmin and non-Brahmin which is still centered around Brahmin. Only call Hindu and non Hindu which is more inclusive. Call the same way Indian language, non Indian language only. No single language hegemony will be tolerated anymore. Thanks! Question: Is Hindi language meant to unite Indians or to trigger Indians?"},{"instruction":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","output":"Typically no. In Vietnam they did fairly frequently because the M16s were so much less than perfect in the jungles of Vietnam so the AK-47 was more necessary to use until the M16’s problems were fixed from what I’ve heard. Some armies do capture enemy weapons and keep them in reserve in case shit absolutely hits the fan. Waste not, want not. However, in an absolute desperate situation, where you can’t withdraw or get a supply drop, soldiers may end up in such a desperate situation that they have to use enemy weapons to survive and get away. Is it always a good idea? Not necessarily. Is it better than nothing? Yes. If a weapon may be booby-trapped or malfunctioning or out of ammo and you’re under fire and completely out of ammo, you’re better off taking a gamble that may well save your life and the lives of those fighting beside you, simply because you may not be able to do anything else. Not to say that you shouldn’t retreat before it gets that bad, but if a situation gets desperate enough, it probably would happen to try to win the battle then retreat to get resupplied. I may be wrong, but it likely isn’t something that would happen frequently."},{"instruction":"What is the diference between ethical hacking and cyber forensics?","output":"Just giving you a simple example..

If the buffet is one where you pay when you’re seated and only the lunch menu is available, you can only get the lunch options. The people at the front of the restaurant are watching to make sure you don’t go for the dinner additions. Trust me…they know who comes in and has been sitting around for a while. If the buffet place charges AFTER you eat, you will be charged the dinner price, unless you’re leaving as they’re changing the food out."},{"instruction":"Where do I find a local professional knitter?

That's a great question you've got there. As an expert in technology, I can say that the answer to your question is not so straightforward. Man has invented a lot of advanced technologies over the years, and it's hard to single out just one. However, I will attempt to give you an answer that does justice to the question. One of the most advanced technologies that man has ever invented is the internet. The internet has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. It has made the world a smaller place and brought people together from different corners of the globe. It has enabled businesses to connect with customers in ways that were not possible before, and it has allowed people to access information at their fingertips. In essence, the internet has transformed the way we think and interact with the world around us. I remember a time when the internet was just starting to gain popularity. I was in college, and the internet was still a novelty. I had to go to the computer lab to access it, and it was painfully slow. But even then, I could see the potential of the internet. It was a way to connect with people and access information in a way that was not possible before. Fast forward to today, and the internet is an integral part of our daily lives. It has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate, and I can't imagine life without it."},{"instruction":"What should writers know?","output":"That the work doesn’t end when the writer thinks she/he has a manuscript. No published writer sends anything in for review that the writer has not edited first. There is no excuse these days for sending in a file with misspelled words or misstated grammar (unless the latter is done for a purpose). There seems to be a perception among some aspiring writers that somehow they can get by without reading any book on how to write, without developing an outline, without writing a cover letter, without editing the entire work at least once, without using a spellchecker, and without knowing the publisher’s requirements for submission of manuscript, even though such things are readily available. I urge aspiring writers to get to know librarians, especially research librarians. Those good folks are gold mines of knowledge about all sorts of things, and often give a response that is an improvement on what was originally asked. I once asked for some specific material from the Doomsday Book and got back not only Photostats of the pages the library had, but a Photostat of one page they didn’t, but which was slightly different, plus a nice little guide to translation. Those nice people all but put what I needed right under my nose and said “you can open your eyes now”! I also urge unpublished writers to learn how to publish their own works - a slim chance it will go somewhere, but still useful knowledge to have, and it can develop a list for a blog or potential readers. For those wanting help in looking for agents, I suggest one simple way - reading the thank-you part of books published in the aspiring writer’s area. Most authors appreciate the help a good editor can give, and have a few scars from editing errors, and so appreciate a good editor and say so in the forward to a book. It’s one place for a new writer to get an idea of who might be a person to contact. Also, a surprising number of authors are published after attending at least one writers’ seminar, probably because it lets those who don’t live in New York State get to know some folks in the publishing end of the industry. In short, writing for publication is work in itself, and there is no excuse for not doing the spadework necessary to do it well."},{"instruction":"What do I do when a USPS package says “Attempted Delivery item being held, addressee being notified” but no slip has been left?","output":"DELIVERY 15 years ago when I retired required 3 attempted deliveries of priority mail, and regular 2 state class getan extra attempt too.

He was rude to her.","output":"Last edited on 2019/10/23 Ah, the infamous deleted biker scene ! It triggered so many people ! Carol Danvers was called a thug, a bully, a villain, etc… This scene is obviously a reference to something similar in Terminator 2, which in the context of the Captain Marvel movie, follows a flow of 1990’s culture easter eggs. There is also an undeniable cathartic nod to all women who were cat called or harassed in the street and had to just keep silent and take it. So, does this scene deserves all the criticism ? Let’s take a look at another scene from Iron Man 2 : That’s the first time we meet Black Widow. She is invited on a boxing ring by Tony Stark for a “boxing lesson”, and proceeds to throw Happy Hogan to the ground, pin him and almost break his arm in half. For no. Damn. Reason. (See edit 2 for a different point of view) She didn’t know if he could break a fall, and took him by surprise anyway. She could have broken his arm, shoulder, hips, back, neck, skull, or give him a concussion. If she wanted to show she didn’t need a lesson, she could have shown her mastery with any other less dangerous move. But no, she decided to go overkill on him. And nobody. Said. Anything. That, my friends, is a beautiful case of Double Standard™. So what’s the difference ? Is it because we saw some sexy pictures of Natasha a few seconds before ? Is it because she was forever a secondary character who would never cast any shadow on the main characters anyway ? Is it because she goes on wearing tight leather with plenty of shots of her ass, while Captain Marvel wears a more practical costume and doesn’t shake her booty in every scene ? Is it that Happy is a middle-aged man maybe slightly overweight and meant as a comical character, compared to a quite handsome biker ? Is it because one actress is more vocal than the other on the issues of gender equality and inclusion of minorities ? Or all of the above ? Who knows. The point is, it’s just overreacting people overreacting after finding a reason to overreact. Again. Edit : I didn’t expect so many comments, but I will try to address the main arguments that were given in defense of Black Widow. She needed to prove herself Just… no. She was infiltrated in Stark Industries as, according to Pepper, someone “from Legal”. She was not hired as anyone who needed to show any physical prowess. She reacted by instinct She was trained as a spy. She should be able to keep her cover intact. If she can’t control herself and blows her cover or shows her capabilities at the first tap on her head in a safe environment, she is a terrible agent. But she is shown in subsequent movies to be able to act very well (even managing to trick Loki). So she is not all “instinct”, neither is she just a trained killer. The only conclusion is she threw Happy like this on purpose. Happy is in the ring, so it’s safe to assume he is trained First, you don’t have to be trained to get into a ring. You just have to walk. Second, he is shown to practice boxing, not something that involves any throws. Therefore there is no indication he may be able to break a fall. Third, he is shown not to be a good fighter. A first time when Tony sucker punches him during training, right before Natasha enters the room, and a second time at the end, when he struggles to even beat one guy. Not knowing that, if she really wanted to show off her skills, she could have opted for something safer. For example, she could have avoided the attack, move quickly behind Happy and grab him in a rear naked choke, without even strangling him, just preventing him from moving. The only reason for this scene is as a teaser for her big fight at the end. In-universe, it is gratuitous violence. Edit 2 : Happy knew what he was getting into I’m wondering if people saying this are really serious, but… Anyway. Please come practice Judo with me. When we start practicing, I will kick you in the balls by surprise. That’s not why you came on the mat for ? But that’s what happened to Happy. He was not expecting what Natasha did, and that’s not why he was on the ring at the moment (boxing lesson, remember ?). There is no “feminist BS” in the Black Widow scene After reviewing, I may have to revise my statement that Natasha threw Happy for no reason. Here’s the script seconds before the event : Happy: You ever boxed before? Natalie: I have, yes. Happy: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie’s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her] Happy is overtly demeaning her because she’s a woman. He’s being rude to her. So, is that not a feminist/girl power moment ? Did Happy deserve it or not ? Was such a violent technique justified ? Please explain how this is different from the Captain Marvel scene. (I’m actually very impressed that people came up with so many excuses, and everyone avoided this detail.)"},{"instruction":"Which post is better at MUN, director general or secretary general?","output":"Secretary-General (SG): The Secretary-General is typically the highest-ranking official in the MUN conference.

Unlike conventional SIM cards, which require a physical swap and insertion into a device, eSIM is embedded directly into the device's hardware, enabling remote activation and management of mobile services. One of the critical benefits of eSIM is its convenience. Users no longer need to handle physical SIM cards, eliminating the need to switch or insert SIM cards when changing carriers or traveling internationally. This convenience is especially valuable for individuals who frequently switch between devices or travel abroad, as they can easily activate local plans without the hassle of obtaining and inserting a new SIM card. Flexibility is another advantage of eSIM. With eSIM, users can store multiple profiles from different carriers on a single device. This feature benefits travelers, allowing them to switch to a local carrier's plan seamlessly without obtaining a new physical SIM card. Additionally, eSIM's remote provisioning capability enables users to activate or change plans through digital interfaces, providing flexibility and control that wasn't possible with traditional SIM cards. Furthermore, eSIM technology is environmentally friendly as it reduces the need for producing and distributing physical SIM cards, contributing to reduced electronic waste. While eSIM offers numerous advantages, its adoption has been influenced by device compatibility and carrier support. However, as more devices and carriers embrace eSIM technology, its convenience, flexibility, and eco-friendliness are poised to redefine how users manage their mobile connectivity in an increasingly digital and interconnected world."},{"instruction":"What do you want to say to Adam D'Angelo, the CEO of Quora?","output":"Sup Bruh.

[LINKED_TEXT: Douglas TBD Devastator - WikipediaThe Douglas TBD Devastator was an American torpedo bomber of the United States Navy . Ordered in 1934, it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937. At that point, it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy and possibly for any navy in the world. However, the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it, and by the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the TBD was already outdated. The Devastator performed well in early battles, most notably in the Battle of Coral Sea , but earned notoriety for a catastrophic performance during the Battle of Midway in which 41 Devastators recorded zero torpedo hits with only six surviving to return to their carriers. Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the Mitsubishi Zero fighters they faced, most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the SBD Dauntless dive bombers that sank four carriers and a heavy cruiser. Although much of the Devastator's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US Mark 13 torpedo , the aircraft was withdrawn from frontline service after Midway, being replaced by the Grumman TBF Avenger . Design and development Edit The XTBD-1 with the original flat canopy in 1935 The first production TBD-1 in 1937 A single TBD-1A was tried as a floatplane The Douglas XTBD-1 was ordered on 30 June 1934 after being one of the winners of a US Navy competition for new bombers to operate from its aircraft carriers. [1] Other aircraft also ordered for production as a result of the competition included the Brewster SBA , the Vought SB2U Vindicator , and the Northrop BT-1 , the last of which would evolve into the Douglas SBD Dauntless . [2] The Great Lakes XB2G , Great Lakes XTBG , Grumman XSBF , Hall XPTBH and Vought XSB3U were also tendered to the specification but were not developed beyond prototype status. [2] The XTBD Devastator flew for the first time on 15 April 1935 while marking a number of \\"firsts\\" for the US Navy. [3] It was the first American carrier-based monoplane to be widely used, the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a completely enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings. [4] A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels protruding 10 in (250 mm) below the wings to potentially limit damage to the aircraft in a \\" wheels-up \\" landing. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large \\"greenhouse\\" canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the Norden bombsight .

It’s not a one or the other proposition; that is, both can occur at the same time. Why? Start with the corporations. Without going in to all the reasons, sometimes a business experiences certain uncontrollable events that put them in financial trouble. So why bail them out? Because they have employees - lots of employees. Putting them out of work will result in a major hit to the economy. It’s in the best interest of everyone for the business to continue operating. Student loan relief? These people have done, or do, absolutely nothing to deserve having their loans paid. Not paying them will only impact that particular student who willingly took on the debt in the first place. It is also a slap in the face to millions of people who have paid off their student loans or even worked their way through school.

You can put up videos, slides, audios, manuals, links whatever you want. You need to make sure that you are putting content up that is supported by modern browsers and mobile devices, that is a whole different deal to the actual LMS. Now when you say online you are taking on every operating system, every mobile device and every tablet out there. The choices are legion and so are the issues each presents to the technical team running the site. The updates: When Apple decided to not support Flash anymore, Google decided not to support Silverlight, all for good reasons I'm sure but, it can affect the content you have up and the students experience when their chosen device won't allow them to participate in an important part of the course. Then when that is 25% or 50% of your students, scramble time. Example: I paid a good bit for a bunch of courses on computer stuff that was in flash. Works fine if I'm at my computer, on my mobile not at all. Nothing wrong with their LMS it is the format their materials are in that is the problem. Another example: We had 20 hours of video up in Flash years ago, Apple quit supporting it and re-encode and re-upload the lot of it. I hope HTML 5 hangs around for awhile. Also very important to \\"online only\\" learning is course presentation and structure once again the LMS has nothing to do with that. The LMS is just a delivery and reporting system. The course materials must be gone over and over to make sure that they are inline with the quizzes and/or exams. Easy on an hour course, more daunting on a 10 hour course. Students get upset when they get an exam question that wasn't covered or was covered with contradictory answers and they got it wrong.

We all know how tough it is to crack IIT and to do that an IIT aspirant needs proper coaching and environment. The web series talks about the life of these IIT aspirants and the coaching business. More than the education system shows how these students are coping with the extreme competition, expectations of their parents, mental trauma, and constant fear of being a failure. But ‘Kota Factory’ doesn’t only represent the darker sides, it shows something more sentimental too like the friendship and the small happiness that they experience while staying here. Another thing that made the web series so magical is the utilization of ‘Monochrome.’ After a long time, I enjoyed watching something like that. The 5 episodes long web series follows the story of an IIT aspirant named Vaibhav (Mayur More), who joins a coaching institute named Prodigy. He didn’t get a chance in Maheshwari, which is the best institute in Kota. He wasn’t happy with his A10 batch because he thinks he deserves better. After taking a challenge of reshuffling test, he managed to jump in A3 batch. The show is revolving around the lead character Vaibhav, his journey of being an IIT aspirant. The 5 episodes describe his issues and how he succeeded overcoming them and moving a step forward in his mission. Initially, he was facing difficulties in adjusting with the atmosphere, mess food, academics. You can say pretty much everything. The one thing that I like about ‘Kota Factory’ is, the show doesn’t focus on the problem much rather it illustrates the peaceful and calm solutions one can find in a difficult situation. The creators have created the web series to talk more about the solutions and less about the problems you will face as an IIT aspirant. It emphasizes more on the personal and emotional challenges that the characters are facing and how they overcome it every time if you have the support of good friends and teacher with you. The show doesn’t criticize the IIT educational approach that the coaching institutes follows in Kota, in my opinion. Instead, it has highlighted how disciplined and hardworking you need to be if you follow this journey, how important it is to learn to cope the mental pressure, and last but not the least how your teachers and friends become your family on whom you can rely on entirely. As this not a spoiler, so I choose not to disclose the story entirely. But definitely, I think the show has presented its audience a more concrete and solid story. If you haven’t watched yet, please do enjoy watching. I hope you enjoyed reading my opinion.

Not really. These organizations are simply in a position to invest large sums of money into something that will not show a quick return, but will in the long run inevitably gain in value. It’s been general knowledge that water will be in short supply as long as global population increases. I was taught this in high school in the 1970s. The only thing that might change this is if we come up with some cheap way of producing electricity because transforming salt water, which we have plenty of, into fresh drinking water takes huge amounts of power. So investing in the ability to supply fresh water to a population that cannot live without it is a pretty safe bet. The bigger question here is morality.

Lots of reasons for this: Limited training and familiarity with that firearm. Soldiers train with a particular weapon and might be unable to use other types of weapons used by their own army. The enemy weapon could be totally unfamiliar to them.No way to know the condition of the gun. It could be in terrible shape to the point of exploding (and taking a few fingers with it) when fired. Or it could just not fire when the solder wants it to fire and will get the soldier killed. The reasons for capturing an enemy weapon are often: the enemy is dead (gun was dropped, shot) or the gun was abandoned (perhaps because it became inoperable). Weapons that are functioning and abandoned intentionally are often destroyed to prevent capture by enemy forces.The weapon could have been attached to a bomb and used as a trap.The soldiers will likely have no way to get ammo for that weapon reliably. Opposing forces often use incompatible ammunition.Solders are often trained to recognize friend vs foe by recognizing the sound and appearance of their firearms. A solder could get himself killed by a friendly who used this method of identifying friend vs foe."},{"instruction":"Can someone who is wellinformed about guns tell me all the terminology related to guns? For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Assault rifle is a defined term with a specific meaning, a class of rifle that has selective fire (semi, and auto or burst) and fires intermediate cartridges (not “full size” rifle rounds). Some consider the first one the Russian 1928 Federov, but the term is basically from the German 1942 Sturmgewehr 44. Assault weapon is a generic term with any defined meaning (such as in laws specifying what constitutes one under that law, it can include rifles, pistols, shotguns, knives, and other bladed or blunt instruments) or a generic meaning (such as what a reader/listener applies). The qualifier is refining or redundant or meaningless when applied to weapons in general or firearms in particular, as actions such as assaulting (or defending, protecting, attacking, threatening) can be carried out by most any weapon or most any object used as a weapon. Defensive spear, assault knife, collectible sword, makeshift bludgeon. In the context of gun control, assault weapon is often used to qualify that a weapon is somehow different and badly so than similar weapons, that it is more or only useful for illegal attacks or other nefarious purposes. Assault weapon in common use often refers to rifles that look like assault rifles (but are not selective fire) and which are identified by their looks rather than quantifiable misuse. It is often meant to convey the opinion that there is an objective unsuitability for any general purpose by law-abiding legal owners of the item. Often, assault weapon is used interchangeably with assault rifle as if they are the same thing, which they are not. Assault guns further refine and qualify that the weapon in question is a firearm. It could include pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, and rifles. In using it to describe all weapons in an assault weapon law that are firearms, versus assault non-firearms in the law, for example. Such as “assault guns” and “assault weapons (which are not firearms)” being two different things. To be more direct, simple and clear, guns and non-guns. AR would be most applicable to use to refer to weapons that are of the AR- series, often used to denote a weapon was an AR-15 in particular, but sometimes something that looks like one, or is some other type like the AK or SKS series. Like most weapons in the US none of them are the selective fire versions, so they are not actually assault rifles, although some do confuse AR to mean that they are. It’s somewhat akin to something like generically referring to all hammers as FMHTs or all revolvers as 29s, all rifles with high-impact plastic and low-weight metal in the non-firing parts as ARs. As far as all that goes, in the US most violent criminal use of weapons (including firearms, blades, other things, and the human body) are handguns [LINKED_TEXT: 1] [URL: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/table-20] [LINKED_TEXT: 2] [URL: https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting?year=2017] . The more prevalent the violent crime, the less often firearms are involved. From [LINKED_TEXT: here:] [URL: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/violent-crime] 1,247,321 violent crimes, 65% aggravated assault (26.3% firearms), 25.6% robbery (40.6% firearm), 8% rape (weapon data not collected), and 1.4% murder (72.6% firearm). Which means according to the more objective FBI UCR statistics, most violent crime does not involve firearms; of the two that make up 90.6% of violent crime, 72.5% of that is non-firearm. Of the 27.5% that is firearm, most does not involve “assault guns”. Lastly"},{"instruction":"Why Assembly language outperform other language? I understand in some cases Assembly beats even compiled code in c and c++, what happen under the hood that makes Assembly code run faster in certain situations?","output":"Ultimately all programs end up as machine code, which is a list of CPU instructions. It’s the only form of code that the processor can actually understand. A program written in a compiled language will get converted into machine code by the compiler. A program written in assembly will get translated to machine code by the assembler. Since assembly much more closely directly maps to machine code, it is sometimes possible to write some assembly that generates slightly more efficient machine code than the machine code generated for an equivalent compiled version. But it’s also very possible and even likely that your assembly machine code output will actually end up being slower than the machine code generated by say, a modern optimizing C++ compiler. So generally speaking, most of the time, it’s not worth it. However, if you have a small function that gets executed millions of times, such that there is potentially sufficient benefit in optimizing it as much as possible - and you’ve already gone as far as you could in optimizing the compiled version - that’s the edge case where writing your own custom assembly -might- be worth it. If you decide you want to give it a try, the best first step would probably be to inspect the machine code generated by the compiler for that function, looking for potential inefficiencies. If you find something you think you may be able to improve on, then you can write some inline assembly to take the place of the compiled function contents. Then, check your work to see if it actually helped by profiling both versions to see if your changes actually made it faster. The bottom line is that assembly can potentially sometimes be faster because it more or less maps directly to machine code, while when working with compiled code, you are relying on the compiler to generate efficient machine code. Most of the time modern compilers do a pretty good job, so the bar you have to get over in order to do better with assembly is pretty high."},{"instruction":"Who is the best center in NBA history based on passing?","output":"Bill Walton."},{"instruction":"Am I wrong in believing that both Democrats and Republicans have poisoned the well by using prejorative terms like communist, fascist, Russian bot, Chinese bot, etc.?","output":"The Democrat party was hijacked by Communism.

As a matter of fact , he could have chosen to spend Diwali at his hometown with his mother or host a gala gathering on the palatial lawns of 7 Race Course Road ( Lok Marg, for those who are sticklers for names). But he instead chose to celebrate Diwali at Siachen. I think we should actually congratulate him on this rather than making an issue of out. In any case , how many of us have seen Vladmir Putin offering Namaz on Eid or Japanese PM Shinzo Abe performing Durga Puja? Have you ever witnessed French President Francisco Hollande celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti or Xi Jingping celebrate Christmas ? Are all of them ‘communal’ and do these countries need Mamata Banerjees, Rahul Gandhis and the Owaisi brothers to take them on a secular path? A Manmohan Singh hosts an Iftar and gets badges of secularism , oh please tell what has he done for My Muslim brothers and sisters? Infact why Ramdan , India is a secular country for going by your logic , Mr Modi should leave all work and celebrate all 365 days of the year wearing skull caps , turbans and visiting monastries and Churches celebrating the festivals of all the religions present in India. We need to seriously introspect as to what have we become due to these so called ‘secular’ parties. Why do we need to constantly insist on mere symbolism ? Our minds have been so clogged with this filth against Modi that Congress and their associates have been spreading that we are unable to see beyond it. What else explains that fact that nobody ever questioned Mrs. Indira Gandhi not celebrating Bahai New Year or Morarji Desai not celebrating Christmas? I am not saying that Modi is perfect. But he is certainly much better than the likes of Manmohan Singh and Rajiv Gandhi. There is a visible intent to change things. No other leader would have the courage to bring about radical changes in the administration at the cost of losing popularity as Modi is doing. The end results of moves like a cashless economy and demonetization or schemes like Swacch Bharat or Digital India are yet to be seen , but an intent to bring about a much needed change is quite visible. So , instead of lashing out at him for stupid reasons , the least we can do is to let him complete his tenure and see what changes he brings to the fore. Iftar Parties and symbolic wearing of skull caps have been going on since 69 years, but what have my Muslim brothers and sisters gained out of it?"},{"instruction":"Who is in the band 'Pearl Jam'?","output":"Pearl Jam was formed after the demise of Mother Love Bone (1987–1990), which disbanded after the death of frontman Andrew Wood. MLB was thought to be the band that would do what Nirvana eventually did. They were signed on a big label and had just released their debut record Apple, which had been getting a positive reception. However, Wood died due to a heroin overdose and the band stopped in its tracks. The members of MLB - Jeff Ament, Stone Grossard - then started jamming with Mike McCready and the trio recorded a 5 track demo tape (without the vocals and drums) and sent it out to look for a drummer and vocalist. They soon recruited ex-Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons, who passed on the tape to his friend Eddie Vedder. Vedder listened to the tape and re-recorded 3 songs with his vocals and sent it back (These songs later became Alive, Once and Footsteps). The band was impressed and Vedder got the gig. The lineup of the band has remained the same though they went through a succession of drummers (Dave Kristen, Matt Chamberlain and Dave Abbruzzese) before they eventually settled on Matt Cameron of Soundgarden."},{"instruction":"Why do Barack and Michelle’s daughters smell so bad?","output":"I've never met them, so how would I know how they smell?

He’s in perfect health. Many cats his age suffer renal failure, obesity, and other diet-related illnesses common on moistureless nuggets of grain. Yes, there are risks of salmonella and E. coli, but those risks are more to you. That’s why we wash our hands after touching raw eggs and meat. The protein avidin in raw egg whites can hinder the absorption of biotin, a b vitamin, which is why you shouldn’t feed eggs in excess. Ironically most cat owners feed grain in excess, and given cats are obligate carnivores who shouldn’t consume high carbohydrate grain diets it’s no wonder so many suffer renal and gastrointestinal issues. Biotin deficiency causes a dull coat and bad skin. Berno has always had a wonderful coat and skin. Have you considered the purpose of eggs? To grow life! They’re natures complete protein source and the benchmark in protein quality! You can’t say that about the kibble you feed! All I can say is this - I have never had an issue feeding raw eggs to any of my pets, for many years, yet I deal with people who’s pets have suffered on a kibble diet almost daily. Yes there are risks, like there are with anything. Feeding pet carnivores cereal-based kibble with food dyes and additives is far worse in my book, even though we’re told we must feed these convenience products for the sake of our pet’s health.

How did they acquire their position of power?","output":"The authorization came from President Harry S. Truman of the United States. As President, he is the Commander in Chief of all US military forces. Truman was elected Vice President of the United States in 1944, and took office in January of 1945. He became President upon taking the oath of office after the death of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on April 12, 1945. At that time, he had not known of the Atomic Bomb project. He was given more details, but the original plan to use the Atomic Bomb on Germany was not needed, as Germany fell soon after. At this point, the bomb was considered for use against Japan to avoid a costly invasion of the island. Japan has been defeated across the Pacific, but also refused to surrender. The island was starving, and was suffering massive bombardments. The Japanese military was preparing to make a last stand, training woman and children with spears and forming a massive kamikaze force of suicide planes to try to cause high losses for any US invasion. On July 15, he was informed that the bomb had been successfully tested, and that more 2 bombs were available for use, with more several months away. At this point he weighted the options, and chose to authorize the atomic strikes on major Japanese cities.

Though Truman would be advised by scientists, generals, and politicians, the final choice of the usage of atomic weapons was his, and his alone. To quote a famous slogan connected to Truman, the “Buck Stops Here,” Truman stated that he used the weapons to end the war as quickly as possible, and he took full responsibility for it, though he also blamed Japan for starting the war and refusing to surrender despite being defeated across the Pacific by August of 1945."},{"instruction":"What are the responsibilities of a business analyst?","output":"Hi I am Mike Ross and I would like to put some light on the question you asked, Who is a Business Analyst?

The app allows users to set up a dedicated list of \\"Close Friends\\" and share content directly with them, enabling more private and immediate communication compared to the broader audience typically reached through Instagram posts or stories. Instagram Threads also introduced features like automatic status updates, which allow users to share their current activity or location with their close friends.

Operation Neptune Spear was carried out decades after gathering HUMINT and SIGINT(Human and Signals Intelligence). Post 9/11, US intelligence agencies begin to monitor the activities of not just an individual Osama Bin Laden, rather the activities of the MENA region and the list of terror outfits operating in that region. So it’s safe to say that OBL did climb his way up to the charts of one of the most wanted terrorists on the planet. It was a coordinated effort with the help of multiple nations and some compromises at places that made Neptune Spear possible. And the factors that led the POTUS to give a green signal for the raid teams to conduct the operation was only possible because of the assertive dominant role the USA had established in the Middle East and Afghanistan regions, the ones who hosted United States airbases on their soil had in a way contributed towards certain helping roles such as providing translators, planting sleeper agents over the locations and leasing or allowing the USAF aircrafts to conduct airstrikes all over the place. Bagram Air Force base is the biggest military installation of the United States in Afghanistan soil. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #vAMZv] Considering its proximity and ability to monitor/establishing round the clock surveillance, every move OBL and his bunch made now sounded pretty much under control. The issue with India-Pakistan that has been hindering as well, is the terrain of the war theatre. High altitude warfare takes things to a whole new level), unlike the war in the middle east or such as the one in Abbottabad (assume). Another important factor to consider was that the global branding OBL had gotten himself quite a reputation while operation over the region. Every nation that acknowledged his evil acts and presented its stance against the Al-Qaeda. Unfortunately, that is not the case with what we are witnessing with the unrest in India and the case of JeM and it’s chief. Jaish-e-Mohammad head Masood Azhar and his outfit operates in Pakistani soil with open plausible connections with the Pakistani Government and claiming responsibility for such acts of terror such as the recent Pulwana Attack in J&K districts or any other forms of the act that involves mass manipulated propaganda and insurgency being taught and nurtured. Sadly this is where we are lagging, It’s not that India intelligence agencies haven’t been tracking or monitoring activities such as this, R&AW definitely has boatloads of intel of not only Masood but the rest of his puny outfits and quite certainly has a couple of plans laid out provided the Ministry does not get into their interests. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #wJcUG] In fact, he was captured during the IC-814 hijacking case and funny enough to say he was an easy man to crack with a slap of an Indian Army officer/cop who said he was rattled and started blurting out information about his group movements. But how do you go about solving and trying to make it clear to the locals that the Indian Army is not their enemy? Right, at that point we lose the media attention, we have no answer to that and they have nothing to say about it while otherwise going on a social media rant about who should be blamed and why politicizing it is an important issue. You cannot fight the enemy beyond the border directly when there is a possible misled group of people planning something really stupid such as acts of stone pelting which the Army or any armed forces can do nothing but resist. So here’s the thing, it really is not a matter of do we have the weaponry to do so or the technology to get to such non-state actors and dismantle their games, very crucial factors such as collateral damages, bilateral ties and what’s at stake are at play. And it is not worth risking or making a move that represents an action or answer from the nation and shows the world how Indians would not tolerate such acts. Indians asking for a surgical strike 2.0 or might not be aware that the 2016 Surgical Strike (which in itself answers this question indirectly) [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #qVzQf] is not the only retaliatory surgical strikes that were carried out, As [LINKED_TEXT: Alcatraz Dey] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Alcatraz-Dey] mentioned in his answer, Uri Surgical Strike was publicized by media and govt for an assortment of reasons. Strikes keep taking place without the knowledge of the general population. It’s only a matter of the perfect timing and appropriate authority to grant access when asked for. Those worrying about what would happen to the ones who have masterminded the attacks, first off they are not masterminds of any sorts, just stupid men who lost track of what they were supposed to do long ago sitting in a protected bunker/area and trying to manipulate things. The last time I check, our armed forces are more of a badassery mindset and are much more capable than countering that and any other attempts to break the peace in Indian territories. So sure enough, something is cooking within India and we need to wait it out. If you follow or are aware of how defence units functions. You would know that CRPF guards while Army steps in during war-time. Just sit tight, as the saying goes in how the Army sees it’s people that they’re guarding - “Be the Indian worth fighting for”.

The first quarter was down 1.6% and the second quarter was down 0.9% for a total GDP drop of 2.5%. Two quarters of negative GDP growth is the vernacular definition of a recession. As such, many have stated that we are in a recession. The Biden administration claims that a recession can only be declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Because NBER hasn’t declared that we are in a recession, we are not. This reminds me of a story I heard about baseball which goes something like this: There were three different umpires each of whom had a different view of what they were doing when they called strikes and balls. The first said, “I call them the way they are.” The second said, “I call them as I see them.” The third said, “There is no such thing as a strike or ball until I call it.” These are the three different views of truth: objective truth, subjective truth, and created truth. We aren’t used to the definition of words being the province of some organization. Regulating the meaning of words in the English language seems un-American. But the government does this all the time. In conclusion, we come back to recessions and the baseball story. Are recessions a real thing such that anyone could debate if we are in one? Are recessions a type of corporate make-believe, so each of our interpretations are equally valid because there is no fact of the matter?

Then movie industry under his influence/ guidance banned voice over of other language movies into Kannada language. That made sure that people started watching Telugu and Tamil movies when they were really good. This reduced demand for Kannada movies and finally quality of the movies dropped (except for some really good ones...)

Folding it 103 times makes it three thousandths times about 10^30 or about three times ten to the twenty seven inches. That is almost ten billion light years!

I saw many responses saying stuff like \\"Mechanical keys are great for gaming, and for typist\\" etc, and I agree with that. But is that the only thing that matters ? As a programmer and gamer, who learned how to type on a keyboard, with 10 fingers (and not only smash wasd), I often see people buying expensive keyboards with : - Colors and rainbow … between the letters … Well, if you play and type a lot, you shouldn't need these ugly lights …The keyboard shouldn't even need letters on it if you are typing a lot, but why did you really need these lights between the keys ? It's ok for the backlight, but why under the keyboard like a tunning car ?Because it's flashy, you pay for it … Quantity over quality - Brand name (marketing, friends have these too, etc), because some ppl are only judging gaming keyboard if it's created by a gaming brand - Non ergonomic keyboard (because the flashy lights are more important than comfort) I have the complete opposite. I prefer to spend money on something that was meant to be comfortable, have amazing feeling, and good for typing instead of lights and other gadgets. You don't need to show the people that yours is bigger (more flashy). Many of you will probably disagree with me, but if I want to question the standards, I will. This is why I don't have lights, standard layout, etc. I prefer to spend money on something that isn't just made for gaming, but is made to make my everyday better. Ergonomic keyboard layout (dvorak), ergonomic trackball (yes, I said trackball … not mouse), and ergonomic keyboard. What does my keyboard look like ?

I'm really happy with my Kinesis and typematrix keyboard. It's way more comfortable and less painful, especially if you spend a lots of hours in front of your computer at work or at home. Something popular is sometimes (often?) not optimal. Why should we change something that everyone use? The qwerty layout is a perfect example of it. It's a non ergonomic layout, that was made this way to overcome typewriting machines issues. The machines could be stuck if you pressed two letters close to each other in a row, so the letters were randomly splitted (not really randomly, they did some optimization, plus you can type \\"typewriter\\" with the first row … what a nice feature) … We don't use them nowadays. So why did the qwerty layout still exists ? Because people don't want to change.

At present, NEFT[LINKED_TEXT: Difference between NEFT, RTGS and IMPS. ] [URL: https://www.manirjas.com/2019/02/difference-between-neft-rtgs-and-imps.html?m=1], RTGS, and IMPS are among the most popular methods to transfer funds to India, along with it, in the context of some notable differences, which will help you understand them. NEFT - Funds are done through transfer batch according to this method (which is based on Deferred Net Settlement (DNS)) and that too in certain specific time of the day. If fund transfer is initiated after cut-off time, then it will be settled next working day. Now talk about NEFT's fund transfer requests in twelve batches at 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. in weekdays and in six batches 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. Is done in the Saturdays. The facility of NEFT is not available in Sundays and bank holidays. One of the biggest advantages of NEFT's cost-effectiveness, where a person who wants to transfer small value, does not need to worry about transaction fees and service charges. Because with a small charge , they can easily transfer their payments through NEFT. Hence NEFT is a very popular and highly effective method for online fund transfers. Transactions under the NEFT are easily initiated and settled. It is important that Banks should have NEFT transfer network (NEFT-enabled) enabled. With this addition the fund can be transferred only after adding beneficiary. RTGS - Through these types of transfer methods fund transfers can be done from Rs.2 lakh to Rs.10 lakh, but the biggest benefit of this is that RTGS is a fastest / real-time settlement mode. Like sender accounts are debit, however, funds are accessed on the receiver's account. But for this facility, RTGS facility should be enabled in both banks. If seen, all the banks RTGS transfer network which is falicited by the RBI, are available in this facility. It is advised that individuals should be in direct contact with their bank and should refer to their online banking section so that they can discover whether they are eligible for the convenience of this RTGS payment system. .

On average one supernova occurs every 50 years in the Milky-way galaxy. Very recently it has been postulated that the heaviest elements (like gold, uranium, platinum, palladium) require the even rarer collision of two neutron stars. This makes these heaviest elements relatively even more rare in the Universe. When a primordial dust cloud coalesces, it provides the ingredients for next generation stars and their star (solar) systems. Logically gold, platinum, silver, lead, uranium, etc. will be present in the dust cloud, but will be much rarer than iron, nickel, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, etc which are synthesized in all stars as they age. When planetisimals coalesce by clumping together the materials in the cloud around them, they will contain an unsorted mixture of these materials. As the planetisimals “grow, ” the energy of collisions is conserved as heat, and the growing planet becomes a molten ball of mixed elements. This mix of molten material begins to sort itself as the heavier elements sink inwards to form a planetary core. This is why we know that the Earth's core consists mainly of the available heavy elements. Now iron, followed by nickel, is the most abundant heavy element, and logically forms the bulk of the core. {Additional evidence comes from seismic wave analysis, and from meteorites which often are from shattered bits of planetisimals - the Hoba meteorite in Namibia is a 60 ton nickel - iron object.} Earth may well be a special case since the early Earth was impacted by a Mars-sized planetisimal which, apart from causing the formation of the Moon, partially remelted the Earth which may have rearranged deeper parts of the Earth, and must also have provided its own cargo of gold, platinum, etc which would not all have sunk to Earth's core. So, will there be gold in the Earth's core? Certainly, but obviously since it is rare in the primordial dust cloud, it must be rare as a constituent of the “nickel - iron” core - so rare that it is not usually mentioned. Furthermore, it will be even more rare in the mantle, and hardly present in the crust and oceans. Each litre of seawater is believed to contain 13 billionths of a gram of gold in suspension - not enough to be extracted economically [even though Fritz Haber tried unsuccessfully to extract ocean gold in an attempt to repay Germany's first World War debt]. So why is gold sometimes found in the upper crust in economical quantities? Meteorite and Asteroid impacts, including Theia. Theia collided with Earth and brought its own load of heavy metals. These would not all have sunk down through the partially remelted planet. This may be the primary source of gold outside of Earth's core.Rocks arriving from space will contain some gold and will deliver this to the Earth's surface. A slow delivery system I agree but our planet has been bombarded for over 4 billion years. This gold can be concentrated (gold has a natural tendency to clump) and transported by rivers giving alluvial gold.Mantle gold may be transported upwards by volcanic activity, and concentrated into economic deposits by steam (see hydrothermal below).Large asteroid impacts - the largest being 2023 million years ago at Vredefort in South Africa - plunge deep into the crust and generate enormous amounts of heat. This generates steam which, under great pressure will dissolve the atoms of gold scattered thinly through the crust. The rising, high pressure steam travels up through the crustal rocks carrying the dissolved gold with it. As the steam rises, the pressure drops and the gold will come out of solution where the specific pressure drop causes release of the metal. In this way the gold becomes relatively concentrated in economically viable reefs. This is called hydrothermal gold. The famous Witwatersrand in South Africa was the beneficiary of this process and (although now largely mined out) this small area has produced more gold in the last 125 years than has been mined across the world throughout history."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between granite and marble?","output":"Both granite and marble are very popular in kitchen and bathroom countertops everywhere around the world.

AngularJS, also known as Angular 1, was released in 2010 and was one of the first JavaScript frameworks that allowed developers to create dynamic web applications with ease. Angular, also known as Angular 2+, was released in 2016 and is a complete rewrite of AngularJS with improved performance, scalability, and functionality. The primary difference between AngularJS and Angular is that AngularJS is based on JavaScript, while Angular is based on TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to JavaScript, making it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications. Angular also has a more modular architecture than AngularJS, making it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications. Angular uses a component-based architecture that breaks down an application into small, reusable components that can be easily tested and maintained. Another significant difference between AngularJS and Angular is the use of directives. AngularJS heavily relies on directives to manipulate the DOM and provide functionality. Angular, on the other hand, uses a combination of components, services, and directives to provide functionality. Angular also has a more powerful dependency injection system than AngularJS, making it easier to manage dependencies and write testable code. Dependency injection is a design pattern used to inject dependencies into objects or functions, making them more modular and testable. Finally, Angular has a more comprehensive set of tools and libraries than AngularJS, making it easier to develop and maintain complex applications. Angular provides a suite of tools, including the Angular CLI, which simplifies the development process by providing pre-configured templates, build tools, and testing tools. In summary, while AngularJS and Angular share some similarities, Angular is a complete rewrite of AngularJS with improved performance, scalability, and functionality. Angular uses TypeScript, a more powerful dependency injection system, and a more modular architecture that makes it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications. Additionally, Angular has a more comprehensive set of tools and libraries that simplify the development process."},{"instruction":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","output":"You can use the following formula to solve it. x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy We are given, x + y = 2 and x^2 + y^2 = 2 Put the values we get, 2 = 2^2 -2xy 2 = 4 - 2xy 2-4 = -2xy -2 = -2xy xy = 1"},{"instruction":"Which 10 things should we stay away from in life?","output":"Life will be more meaningful if we can let go of our attachments.

But here are the 6 other players to ever score 70 in NBA history. 1) Wilt Chamberlain (7-foot-1) His 100-point game still stands as the NBA record. But Wilt has scored 70+ a total of 6 times in his career. Which is insane. 2) Kobe Bryant (6-foot-6) Kobe’s iconic 81 in 2006 stands as the 2nd-highest scoring game in NBA history. 3) David Thompson (6-foot-4) Thompson dropped 73 in the last game of the ‘77–78 season, to try to get the scoring title. But in heartbreaking fashion, George Gervin scored 63 a few hours later. Giving Gervin the scoring title, edging out Thompson by a mere 0.2 PPG. 4) David Robinson (7-foot-1) A similar thing happened 16 years later, in 1994. Robinson dropped 71 in the last game of the season, to win the scoring title over Shaq. But the Spurs did have to intentionally foul late in the game - even when up by 20 - to give Robinson some extra possessions. They REALLY wanted that scoring title over Shaq. 5) Elgin Baylor (6-foot-5) In 1960 (before Wilt even scored 100), Baylor scored 71 points on 58% from the field. And added 25 rebounds for good measure. 6) Devin Booker (6-fot-5) Before Mitchell, the most recent 70-point game was Devin Booker in 2017. And like David Robinson and the Spurs, the Suns were also intentionally fouling late in the game - just to get Booker to 70. But to answer the initial question: Yes, Donovan Mitchell - at 6-foot-1 - is the shortest player ever to drop 70."},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"Ofcourse SRK Is World's Biggest Superstar He Has Make Bollywood Go International Way In 1993 Whatever Bollywood Has In Overseas It's Just Coz Of SRK Lots Of Media Portal Has Claim SRK As World’Biggest Superstar Coz Of His Crazy Fan Following All Over The World SRK Is Famous In Such Country Where Bollywood Film Won't Even Release He Has Been Honoured By Lots Of International Awards He has appeared in more than 80 [LINKED_TEXT: Bollywood] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood] films, and earned [LINKED_TEXT: numerous accolades] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Shah_Rukh_Khan], including 14 Filmfare Khan has a significant following in Asia and the [LINKED_TEXT: Indian diaspora] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-resident_Indian_and_person_of_Indian_origin] worldwide.

You studied something during your young age at school. You loved something. You aimed to be something and you work hard for it. Alas! you didn’t get it. But you chose something completely different from what you have learnt till now. Picture Reference : Google But, you ended up doing something completely different and accepting it as your job. Most of the times, the rapid change happens because of our pressurized education system but many humans do this to find “Scopes” which is measured by the unit “Money”, they don’t care what existed knowledge they have in them. All they do care is “Money” , then what’s the value of investing so much years on something which helped you to stand in life as a knowledgeable person? All they care is “I have more money than you” instead of “I have more knowledge than you and i can share with you.” Experience matters and i respect your choices. But do think about those years in which tireless striving tend to make you an excellent knowledgeable person. Life is big, money is small. When you invested so much time in choosing something and coping up with it, then it would bring you excellence at some point of your life. You just have to be patient till then. “Don’t be the one who works hard for one dream and get diverted after a smallest failure. Be the one who faces all the difficulties and wins over it. Hunt for knowledge instead of “Scopes”. If you do something with your full effort then that thing will eventually give you so much good returns in your life, no matter how hard it is to get.”"},{"instruction":"ve we lost hope for the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity?","output":"This is a perfectly reasonable question, given the fact that science has been flailing in the dark for more then a century now. Never in history more brain power, more money and prestige has been applied on solving one single question and there is not a hint of an answer in sight. This should give us pause and make us step back and ask: what are we missing? Is there maybe an ingrained belief we just can’t shake off which prevents us from seeing the solution? Kepler was able to do exactly that by questioning the long held, unshakeable belief that the only geometry nature could possibly choose for the orbits of celestial bodies was the circle. As we all know, it wasn’t! >…… when finally the equations connect, the predictions match the data, and the whole thing begins to make sense.< says V.Thot in his answer. Well, can you imagine the excitement of Copernicus and T. Brahe when their very involved calculations gave the right results, made the correct predictions? And can you imagine the disappointment they would have felt if they would have learned how much nonsense it all represented? We seem to have totally lost sight of the possibility that we are again following blindly the allure of “equations matching observations”, leading us into a quagmire of nonsense. Particle physics “proudly” presents up to 30 free parameters, and cosmology revels in spooky matter and all devouring unseen monsters …. not exactly the convincing simplicity we expect from an adequate description of nature. Therefore let’s forget equations for a moment and think in principles: What is it that gives shape to everything in the universe, what is it that keeps systems, from the smallest to the largest, coherent? It is “Attraction”, “Pull”. Without the ability of pulling things together, nothing would stay together. So you would think that an encompassing framework of nature would focus on a theory which explains “pull” first and foremost. Quantum mechanics is a particle and field based concept, but a particle thrown at you will never persuade you to come closer. There is no such thing as a particle based attraction. Scientist sense that of course and therefore feel the need of something a little more abstract, where they can better hide their embarrassment: a field. Everything is a field nowadays, but nobody ever explains how these fields work - physically, not mathematically. How does a field exert pull. How does a field sustain tension? Combined with the constraints of relativity they have to claim that fields travel at light speed. But what exactly is traveling as a field of attraction? and what does it do when it arrives? Gravity gives weight and weight is a static concept, depending on location and mass only, no time is involved. Weight is a tension, not a force, and as such it is mutual. When you make one step towards the sun, you have a new weight according to your new location, and you have it immediately, not 8 minutes later. Pluto feels any fluctuation in the sun’s mass immediately, not 5 and a half hours later. Also, if the sun disappears - a popular fiction - we will feel the lack of her attraction immediately, not after an 8 minute grace period. Newton’s law is a two body law (m1*m2/d^2), one body missing, no attraction, full stop. Turn an electromagnet off and the attraction is gone immediately, not after t=d/c. Attraction doesn’t travel, attraction is - or is not. On small scales everything is modeled after light, but as a matter of fact, we have no idea what light is. Heisenberg had the nagging feeling that we still lack a fundamental understanding of matter when he formulated his uncertainty principle. The accepted but mutually exclusive duality of the wave and particle character of light only exacerbates that nagging feeling. On a large scale everything is modeled after Einstein’s understanding of gravity. But is there an equivalent to Copernicus’ perfect circles which Einstein just couldn’t conceive? Relativity is based on matter, but like the perfect circle of Copernicus, it is based on the “perfect”, undisturbed properties of NEUTRAL matter. As soon as we are confronted with IONIZED matter, charged matter, we enter a whole different ball game. In that moment a player 40 orders of magnitude stronger than gravity comes into play: electromagnetism. Now, practically the entirety of the universe is made up of ionized matter, and therefore Einstein’s treatment of neutral matter doesn’t apply. Ampére, Riemann, Gauß and Weber have developed a theory of relativity long before Einstein but based on charge instead of matter, even Maxwell considered it superior to his treatment but the train of history chose a different route. Now that we find ourselves at a dead end, we might want to reconsider the work of minds at least as great as that of our idolized Einstein, let go of a couple of dearly held beliefs and open our eyes to solutions for which the ground work is already done. In other words, no, there is no hope of finding unification following the tracks we presently ride on, it’s a waste of time and a waste of brain power of very talented young people."},{"instruction":"What is jazz?","output":"The way jazz started and the way it exists today are proof that jazz is not a static definable \\"thing.\\" But up to now it has been a progression in a style or manor of self expression by players during a performance that is almost always at least a little different than previous performances and most likely will change in future performances and so is not written down in complete detail. Though there is usually a song at the core of the performance from which the players create new versions of certain phrases they are restricted by the structure of the original song and so don't stray so \\"far out\\" as to confuse the other players.. Another words if the song is in 4/4 time (4 quarter notes to a measure) the created phrases must also be in 4/4 and at the same tempo or the players become \\"out of sync\\" or no longer \\"in the groove\\". Maintaining the groove is the responsibility of the rhythm section; most basically a bass and drums. At one time this meant the drummer played a bass drum note on the first and third beats along with a bass player's note. And a snare tap on the second and fourth beat. And a cymbal rhythm of a dotted quarter note and an eighth note that creates the ubiquitous \\"da dit tada dit tada dit tada \\" on a \\"ride\\" cymbal. HOWEVER, all this is a broad generality that has been more true in the past than it is now. There are performers today that would scoff at my old school jive definition. But I believe that even They have at some point performed in this manor. And this is the reason that there were 16 answers ahead of mine.

But what is it? What is it used for? That’s what we’ll discuss today. What is an IP address? We need to know about IP addresses before we talk about proxies. IP address, i.e., Internet Protocol address, is a unique address every computer has on the Internet. If it’s a little complex for you to understand, you can think about it as your home’s street address. Sometimes you’ll ask others to mail or deliver goods or food to your house. They’ll need your street address so that they’ll send the mail or delivery to the correct location. The IP address is just like your house address on the Internet. If you have access to the Internet, you’ll be given an IP address by your Internet service provider (ISP). With an IP address, you can send and receive information to or from the Internet. Usually, every device which has access to the Internet has a unique IP. What is a proxy server? A proxy server is just like the post office in your street. You leave the address and contact of the post office, others send mail to it. And then the postman delivers it to your house. A proxy server is a system or router that acts as a gateway between users and the Internet. When a user requests on the Internet with a proxy, instead of going to the target website directly, the request is sent to the proxy server. Then the proxy server sends the request and retrieves data on the Internet and gives it back to the user. How do proxies work? So a typical proxy server works like this: --> A user visits a website or software. --> The request was sent to the proxy server. --> The proxy server forwards the request to the web server. --> The web server sends the data back to the proxy server. --> The proxy server forwards the data to the user. --> The user receives the data he/she needs. What are proxies used for? You may wonder why bother surfing online with proxies. It seems it’s easier to visit a website with your IP. Proxies have various usages. Most of them are related to online security and protection. It’s easy for others to track your IP address and online behavior if you don’t use proxies, which may cause some malicious online attacks or private information theft afterward. While proxies can be data security boundaries, protecting users from these activities online. That’s because when you use proxies, the web server won’t know your real IP. Your online behavior would be highly anonymous. Apart from that, some sites may have a restriction on IP location or display different content for different regions, such as some stream media sites, and shopping sites. Therefore, people may change their IP with proxies to check the content in other regions on the site. Proxies are also used by enterprises to protect their brand and do web scraping. Conclusion With the development of the Internet, people pay much more attention to online security, and websites set much more limitations on IPs to protect themselves. Proxies have been playing a more and more important role in the technology world. For more information, welcome to visit PYPROXY.

The short answers, there are an infinite number of styles of photography, or better said, photography styles. There is a limited amount of “genres” in photography, but photography styles are based on each specific photographer as every photographer has their own unique style, or are in the process of developing a photographic style. It’s true, some photographers try to copy famous photographic styles, but in the end, each photographer has their own style, copied or original. However, it takes time to build your photography style, it doesn’t happen overnight, it comes with experience and consistency. Personally, I define photographic style as the following: Photographic style is a consistent, identifiable quality in a visual body of work that portrays the artistic personality of the photographer, plus the life-influenced reflection of what the photographer saw and felt during that depiction of time. Ultimately photography or photographic style is something most photographers strive for but don’t know how to achieve it and those that have a defined photography style, are sometimes stereotyped into one genre of photography. All photographers passionate about their craft should set a goal to achieve their own, personal style. Consider it as the ultimate growth spurt in becoming a professional, or entering the adulthood of photography. Photography style comes from consistent exposure settings, composition, cropping, lens selection, lighting quality and all the other technical aspects of creating a photograph. Consistency is key. Sometimes this also involves consistency in the subject matter captured, but as famed photographer Robert Farber proved in his book American Mood, the subject matter can vary from photographing nude models to landscapes within the photographer’s lifetime body of work. It’s the shooting habits more than the subject matter that establishes a photographer’s photographic style. Photographic style is more interpreted or defined by the thoughts of the viewing audience. For it is they who will ultimately label your style of photography. That is the reward of having photographic style, the viewing audience can see a photograph and almost immediately associate it with your name. A photographer must understand that photographic style develops over time. No need to get impatient, it will come, provided you as a photographer have the will to create through the expression of your photographic passions. Photographic style is work in progress and you only “pro”gress by putting effort into it. Photographers must increase their own understanding of what their photographs mean to them and others. By increasing this understanding, photographers elevate their ability to reach their photographic, but personal, photography style much sooner. When a photographer’s work is consistently identifiable and often emulated by others, then it’s said that photographer has fully developed their style. Until then, photographers follow a path searching for their style and it’s often found over time — once found, a photographer has taken a step forward in becoming a professional. It’s not about asking professional photographers to define photographic style, it’s about being able to spot those that have it and creating your own so you can enter into the adulthood of photography. Everything else, regardless of your photographic style, is the genre you specialize in, and/or the genres you as a photographer will pursue, and those are finite, but your photography is not, it’s one of an infinite amount of creative styles that exist in the world of photography.

They’re also disaffected and alienated from society to a greater degree. Conspiracy theories also provide a convenient excuse for someone’s lack of progress or success in life. People who lack self esteem can gain a false sense of superiority by being in on the secret, unlike the naive normies and sheeple. Conspiracy theories are also a group phenomenon. Like minded people reinforce one another’s thinking, giving them all a sense that “we can’t all be crazy.” The groups also provide the more fanatical conspiracy theorists the chance to feel like the smartest person in the room. Who knows? They might even be asked to lead a presentation and get to point with a stick. Experts agree that there’s very little chance that anyone can reason with conspiracists because they don’t form their beliefs based on facts and evidence. They should only be challenged if they are presenting their ideas in public forums. This isn’t for their benefit but for the benefit of the audience.

He is only called that because of a basically racist White 50’s era ‘Middle America’. Did not and would not accept Black performers as heroes to their children. This country always loved Black music but not Black people. There is a scene in the documentary, ‘Hail, Hail, Rock & Roll. With Little Richard at a piano, while Chuck Berry and Bo Diddly are standing next to him speaking of how the the kids loved them, but the White parents did’nt. So, the kids would leave the 45 record of Pat Boone’s Tutti Fruiti on top of their dresser. Where their parents could see it, but actually listen to the Little Richard version they kept hidden. Elvis stole the swagger from Bo Diddly. The rollicking fun and stylish cool from Chuck Berry. The Rock & Roll power and flash from Little Richard and the Rock & Roll Soul from Fats Domino.

I’m sure some people will mention record sales, but bear in mind that record companies have a long history. Of ripping off performers, especially Black performers. Elvis was taken advantage of by Colonel Parker, but that was because the Colonel was a crook. Nothing to do with Elvis’ color. Its hard for me to pick one individual to label as the ‘King Of Rock & Roll’. So many great contributors to that musical genre.

However, I think the perception of it being a ‘Starbucks thing’ comes from the fun movie scenes where someone is ordering a over-customized coffee. So, I’ll answer your question from my perspective as a part-time Starbucks partner. Yes, you get those over-customized orders! It’s not my thing, personally, but if that’s what they want, they should get it - - they paid for it. Just like if I want my steak medium rare, or to substitute a side at a restaurant. As for the ‘rude/hostile’ customers - - yes, we get them and it’s annoying. I get equally annoyed when I witness it elsewhere. I just don’t understand why people can’t be nice, but then again, you don’t know what they’re going through. Back to my experience as a Starbucks partner and knowing the local people. MOST are extremely nice people, even if we get an order wrong. There are a handful of locals who are trying to use Starbucks as a ‘status symbol’ or look ‘cool’ by quickly spitting out the over-customization. Not all, but some of them, get cranky if you don’t type it in quickly or have to ask for a repeat. Getting their order right is, and should be, expected. If we mess up, we make it right and certainly appreciate but have come to not expect, a bit of grace from the customer.

As I have seen more and more people weigh in on this and have gotten to see a broader range of perspectives, believe it or not I actually do think that there is indeed some cultural appropriation going on here. Just hear me out for a second. The famous statue of Den lille Havfrue in Copenhagen, where Hans Christian Andersen wrote the original story. Now from the outset, I should say that I have complex and often heterodox views on cultural appropriation, and I don't mean to say that the mere fact of something being an example of cultural appropriation means that it is necessarily bad or impermissible. The term implies a degree of negative judgment from which I generally try to shy away, especially when the culture that may or may not be appropriated is not my own. But while I am cautious when it comes to accusation and and wary of any invocation of social stigma, I think that there is room to have an educated and nuanced conversation here. With that being said, yes, I feel that it may very well be reasonable to say that, in the whole discussion surrounding this issue, we have indeed seen conservative grown-ass adults quite brazenly appropriate snowflake tantrum culture, despite not being between the ages of three and ten themselves. There was a time when it was only seen as acceptable for very young children to throw a fit because the show on the TV had somebody on it who was different from the one they wanted it to have (though as a former preschool teacher, I can attest that there were many of us who had little tolerance for it even among three-year-olds). However, these days those lines seem to be fading, and more and more postpubescent people seem to be flagrantly and unapologetically appropriating tantrum culture. Anyway, if you were totally fine with the Danish mermaid having a Hebrew man’s name but not with her having marginally darker skin in live action than she did as a cartoon, I'm afraid that you are talking about something other than cultural appropriation. I feel like there's a word for it, but I am drawing a blank for some racism… sorry, for some reason.

A great many countries of various languages have settled upon using the same modern number system as an international standard. This modern number system makes use of Arabic numerals. If you aren’t familiar with Arabic numerals, they are these ones here: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 I think they are more properly referred to as “Hindu-Arabic numerals,” since, although what is now our modern number system was popularized and propagated by Arabic scholars, India basically invented it, along with their invention of zero as a concept. And Europe in general certainly played an important historical role in this number system gaining widespread usage worldwide. But the point is, this number system and its origins are not specific to the English language in any way.

How do I find a place that could knit hats for me?","output":"Knitters keep receiving requests to make stuff for others. You can try your local yarn shops to find one that will knit for money. Before you do, choose the pattern you want and the yarn you want used for it. It is your responsibility to pay for them in advance, and the knitter may very well demand an advance on the price of her work. Count on it being at least the minimum wage per hour. Knitting is a specialised activity and requires specific skills. Don’t expect it to be instant work. A hat may take between four and eight hours, depending on the intricacy of the design. The type of yarn counts too. Some knitters will refuse to work with the cheapest of acrylics, simply because it’s hard work to use low quality materials. Wool is expensive. Fortunately, there are some very good acrylic yarns nowadays that are a joy to work with, although they are not that cheap either. Also remember that there is a limit to what you can do with one single ball of yarn. I’ve lost count of the stories I’ve read about people who expected a knitter to make a king size blanket or a sweater with a single 50g ball of yarn. If you want to know how much yarn you need for one piece, go weigh your prototype. Balls tend to be 50g or 100g each, and the thicker the yarn is the faster it’s going to be worked, but also the fewer metres there will be in a ball. A word of caution: just remember knitters are not sweatshop workers. Any person deserves fair compensation for their work. The premise “she’d do it anyway” is false. We all have better things to do with our time than being exploited."},{"instruction":"Do all UK people say they speak “English” and not “British English”?","output":"We say English because thats what it is, its English from England, not the us not Africa not canada not anywhere, its the original like The Open, the original.

There was on HBO, a very popular fantasy series called The Game of Thrones. It ran for about eight years. It was a captivating story that everyone followed about the Stark family. One of the more interesting things about the Starks was that they all had Dire Wolves. Dire Wolves that had a passing resemblance to Huskies. Everyone wanted to go out and get their own ‘Dire Wolf’; so they went out and bought Huskies. Unfortunately, most people have little knowledge on how to handle and take care of Huskies. And worse still, the patience to take care of said Huskies. And Huskies are a very demanding dogs. In a year or two, as the puppies grew into full sized dogs, and the novelty began to wear off, the Huskies began to get dumped back into pounds, shelters or wherever. Some were simply dumped.

For example, they might complain that they hate the large open sky, because it makes the world feel too empty and lonely. From a practical standpoint, it is of course silly to think that someone hates the sky. But many people do share this feeling, as they prefer the big city feel of large buildings around them, artificial light that makes the world feel alive at all times, and constant white noise in the background from a world that never sleeps. The opposite could also be true when someone hates the big cities and enjoys life in the country, they might say “I hate buildings. They block out the skyline and make the world feel so claustrophobic.” Or alternative “I hate all the artificial light. You can never see the stars.” Obviously this person doesn’t hate all buildings, or doesn’t hate all forms of artificial light. They are just viewing this as representative about their feelings about the big cities in general. Heck, just look at pretty much any climate. “I hate living in the tropical zones, because of all the heat and humidity.” “I hate living in the artic zones, because of all the snow and ice.” What Anakin means when he says that he hates Sand is that he actually hates Tattooine. He hates the deserts. He hates the isolation. He hates the corruption and unequal wealth distribution. He hates the helplessness of growing up a slave, on a planet where that is accepted, where those who see you choose to ignore the issues, instead of doing something. He hates watching poor people die of dehydration under a pair of merciless suns because moisture needs to be farmed and the rich control the water supply. He probably hates the fact that most poor people are likely drinking their own urine just to stay alive. He hates the Tuskin Raiders, not just the ones that killed his mother, but the entire existence of these roving packs of savage barbarians who are killing and looting, on a planet that is a part of the Republic (and later the Empire), but where the government troops do nothing to stop them and protect the citizens. He hates Tattooine and never wants to return. So when he says “I hate sand”, what he is saying is “I hate this place, and the things that I hate about it are not things that are going to change.” There is no fixing Anakin’s issues with Tattooine. He just hates the planet. If he had successfully overthrown the Emperor and ruled the Galaxy, he probably would have blasted Tattooine with the Death Star just to wipe it out for good. It is commonly accepted that the reason why Obi-Wan hides on Tattooine is because he realizes that Darth Vader will search the entire galaxy for him, and personally knowing Vader as well as he does, he knows that Vader would scour every random mudball and moon in the Empire searching for his revenge, but that Anakin would always find somewhere else to go or something else to do before he would ever force himself to set foot on Tattooine again. The fact that Anakin hates Tattooine so much is what made it the one place where Obi-Wan could be safe, and where Luke could grow up for 20 years without ever being noticed."},{"instruction":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

The overlooked truth being, a lot of these kids do not realize the amount of effort/commitment/sacrifices it takes to be even remotely close to any of that.If it is your parents (or, more like, your girlfriend’s :P ) especially if they have been a middle class government servant, they tend to think every IT engineer would get a green card and it’s all dollars flowing in from there on.

Rob Roy was born in March 1671, at the head of Loch Katrine in the Trossachs, that beautiful area of wooded lochs and steep-sided, craggy hills to the east of Ben Lomond. His parents were Donald MacGregor and Margaret Campbell. He would later sign his name as a Campbell, when his real name was proscribed as an outlaw. Antique portrait of historical figure, Robert Roy MacGregor (1671-1734). Usually known simply as Rob Roy or alternately Red MacGregor, was a famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who is sometimes known as the Scottish Robin Hood. He was named Roy after his red hair, from the Gaelic Ruadh, or red. Growing up in an age when self-defence was a requirement and not a choice, he became skilled in the use of the broadsword, his long arms and great strength making him a formidable opponent. The clan MacGregor followed the Protestant faith, though he was to convert to Catholicism late in life. He fought with the Jacobite side under Viscount Dundee at the Battle of Killicrankie Pass in 1689, where General Hugh MacKay was defeated. It was a Pyrrhic victory however, and Dundee died having been hit in the eye with a musket ball. It was also, interestingly, the last battle at which the double-handed broadsword was used, to great effect. Rob Roy later joined the Lennox Watch, effectively a paid band of Highlanders who protected the Lowlands. The payment was termed 'blackmail'. In 1693 he married Mary Campbell, who was from Comer, on the east side of Ben Lomond. For a time, his fortunes increased, gaining lands and becoming a cattle dealer. But in 1711 his chief drover, a MacDonald, absconded with letters of credit, and MacGregor was wrongly accused of embezzlement. A warrant for his arrest was issued, under the instigation of the Duke of Montrose, a main creditor, and on failing to answer the summons, MacGregor was outlawed. For some time, he was forced to survive by the time-honoured pastimes of lifting sheep and cattle, particularly from Montrose's land. By now his wife and family had been evicted from Craig Royston by Montrose's factor, Graham of Killearn. MacGregor rented a property in Glen Dochart, Auchinchisallen, from the Earl of Breadalbane, who was a political opponent of Montrose. In 1715, he raised the clan MacGregor for the Jacobite cause. In the Callendar area he seized 22 government guns. He was at the dying moments of the Battle of Sheriffmuir, when inept leadership by Mar lost the day. An earlier decision not to be led into suicidal situations by incompetent Jacobite generals obliged him to make a tactical withdrawal with his men, but he had to suffer the burning of his home at Auchinchisallen by Swiss mercenaries. He had set up an ambush, but with barely a dozen clansmen against 60 Swiss troops he could not afford a battle. By 1717, The Duke of Montrose was enraged and frustrated. He obtained a Commission to arrest MacGregor and was fortunate in learning of his presence in a house at Balquhidder. At dawn he caught Rob Roy asleep in his plaid, and binding his hands took him on horseback towards Stirling. At the Fords of Frew, over the Forth, the river that April was swollen and cold. His hands were released for his safety, but a leather cord attached him to the man in front, a James Stewart, one of Montrose's tenants. There are two versions as to what happened next. Either Rob Roy had a concealed armpit knife, and cut the thong himself, or Stewart, who had received some benefit from MacGregor in the past, released him on a whisper from Rob Roy. Rob Roy jumped into the river, releasing his plaid, and swam away underwater. The plaid received much attention, including musket balls, and Rob Roy was able to gain the north bank in the gathering twilight. Once again, he had escaped. It is fairly safe to say that from about now onwards, the Scots saw in MacGregor a heroic figure. There were many other stirring and true stories of his continuing struggle to find a peaceful and just life before he finally submitted to General Wade in 1725, gaining the King's pardon. He continued to work with his cattle business, offering protection to the Lowlands. At the end of 1734, Rob Roy MacGregor was in his home at Inverlochlarig, at the head of the Glen of Balquhidder. All accounts are in agreement on his last words. 'It is all over. Put me to bed. Call the piper. Let him play Cha till me tuille.' While the piper played the lament I shall return no more, Rob Roy died. He had, as was befitting, a great funeral in Balquhidder. All ranks, and most of the clans, were there. He was buried, Catholic or not, in the graveyard of the auld kirk at Balquhidder, under an ancient Celtic slab carved nearly 400 years earlier. It lies there still, its carvings almost faded, but showing a two-handed claymore and a warrior.

India's political systems have recognized that humans can be corrupt and have designed punishments to dissuade rampant corruption. We have Chanakya's \\"Artha Shastra\\" ( ) that prescribed punishment for corruption of government officials 2100 years ago. A thosuand years ago Imperial Cholas had inscribed punishments for corruption. Petty corruption in countries ranging from post-world war 2 Japan to Soviet Union have been described by movies and literature. The first Governors General of the East India Company M/S Robert Clive and Warren Hastings were so corrupt that Mother England was so embarrassed to investigate and/or impeach them. And even the representatives of the British Crown were no less corrupt. The British conveniently attributed all of these to the bad influences of the \\"oriental despots.\\" As a Tamil politician once commented if one squeezes bee hives to extract honey it would be difficult for him to avoid the temptation to lick the backside of his palms. And yet there is an enormous driving force between the poverty of officials and their power over resources that generate immense wealth. While Indians have always complained about corruption, the scale and breadth of corruption in India radically changed for the worse after the economic liberalization of Narasimha Rao government. That was the first time when Indians heard about operators with suitcases full of crores of rupees daring to bribe a Prime Minister or a Prime Minister bribing Members of Parliament to win votes in the parliament. Petty officials took the cue and scaled it down to their levels and in some states corruption is efficiently organized as a parallel government. Low level officials like the traffic policeman is an agent collecting for the entire chain of command extending to the highest levels of government. When property values soared, officials demanded percentage of the property value to register property and look over \\"inconsistencies.\\" Ater all, the village official reasoned, if you can afford to buy a tiny plot for 1 crore, you can afford to pay him a few ten thousands of rupees. Now the ministers seem to reason that every appointment to the government puts people in position to demand a lot of bribes and to work around having to deal with honest people refusing to take bribes and thus cut them off the potential loot, they have resorted to demanding a three or five year salary of the official as bribe for appointing them to those positions. If someone were to pay a bribe to get their job but choose to remain honest, that is their problem as the chain of command has already gotten their share. In some sense, a bribe is a mechanism to set up a priority queue system. People who are in a hurry to get a darshan of a deity are willing to part with 1000 rupees while the poor folks spend six hours of their lives to get the same darshan. When tens of thousands of people are all queuing up, some priority queue has to be to set up and apart from the usual concessions for powerful people and those for whom the temple officials owe a favor, a higher ticket price is as good as any. A bribe then is similar to the toll that one pays to get on the priority lane/fast lane/HOV lane/Diamond lane or what have you to get the job done quickly and smoothly. The trouble is when all lanes become toll lanes and tolls have no correlation to the service provided and the roads are bad and service is rude, something like what most Indians face in most government offices today. Like I said, if the toll booth vendor had already paid his bribe to get his job, what else can we expect from him? India has gone far beyond the usual petty corruption and with immense wealth being generated has become a kleptocracy. When the license to generate solar power is a free check to generate immense wealth for eternity, the minister and his underlings feel entitled to ask for a piece of the action. Now they have trained the voters to take bribes to vote for them as well. So this is all in some convoluted way appropriately moral and dharmic. The ancients called this the Kali Yuga. ;-)"},{"instruction":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","output":"\\"Destruction precedes renewal.\\" --Rumi"},{"instruction":"Why is defence production low in India compared to China?","output":"Becose India is the country of peace and he not first atteck so India not produce extra weapons but this time is new Modi's India and many new defiance devices made in India and development India's his good defence system"},{"instruction":"What are the qualities of a successful leader?","output":"The fundamental qualities of a true leader include the following: Vision: The ability to see the big picture, and create a clear and inspiring vision for the future.Integrity: A leader must have strong morals, and ethical values, band e honest and transparent in their actions and decisions.Communication: Effective leaders are excellent communicators and can articulate their ideas and vision clearly.Decisiveness: Leaders must be able to make difficult decisions quickly and effectively.Emotional intelligence: Leaders must have the ability to understand and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of those they lead.Confidence: Leaders must have the self-assurance and the confidence to inspire others.Adaptability: They must adapt to changing circumstances and be flexible in their approach.Empathy: A good leader must have the ability to understand, and relate to the needs and concerns of those they lead.Responsibility: Leaders must be accountable for their actions and decisions and be willing to take responsibility for the outcomes of their leadership.Mentorship: They must have the ability to coach and develop their team, creating a positive and supportive work environment.

I was working at Qualcomm before I moved back. I am an Electrical Engineer working mainly on C/C++ so I was looking for those kind of companies (Qualcomm, Nvidia, Broadcom, Intel etc.). Here are some tips which I followed that can help you too: Internal transfer in your own company: This is probably the easiest as lateral transfer to India is good for your company too. Saves them money. If your company has an office in India, you can look at internal job openings, talk to the concerned Hiring Manager in India and take it forward. Negotiating salary is very important here.LinkedIn: I got the free premium account and used it to look for jobs in India. The LinkedIn job search is smart and provides a lot of relevant openings. Rather than just applying there, you can also get to the hiring manager’s profile and connect/message them directly. This is how I ended up getting my job.Referrals: I understand that you might not know many people in India who can refer you but what I did was asked my friends in US working in different countries to forward my resume to the HR’s in their company (those who work in India, possibly). This also gets your Resume directly in the hands of HR. Regarding the documentation, it includes some basic stuff like your degree certificates, passport, resignation/termination letter from previous company and so on. Nothing out of the ordinary. Regarding the pay, there were a couple of questions on Quora comparing those but I can’t find them now. The gist is that being a software developer, you can expect around 1/3rd of your US salary converter to rupees. So if your salary is around 120k in US, you can expect around Rs 25 lakh. But it depends on your negotiation too. This salary is divided into Base pay, allowances (travel. medical etc) which are generally a percentage of your base salary , and a special allowance which includes the remaining salary. There is also a variable bonus which is some percent (around 10) of your base that you can get at the end of year. Also expect some signing bonus and stocks depending on the company."},{"instruction":"Did Einstein ever reject Newtonian physics?","output":"The proposition of curved or warped space does not agree with the 1st law of motion, nor does it agree with the conservation of energy law, and Newton’s 3 laws of motion work perfectly with the conservation of energy law"},{"instruction":"Where can one find the best biryani in bangalore?","output":"Without a doubt, Samarkhand @shivajinagar"},{"instruction":"Which is the best car in India under Rs 5 lakh in 2020?","output":"There are several good options for cars under 10 lakhs in India, depending on your needs and preferences.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","output":"I went to my local public school from K-8, and a private, Catholic high school for high school. My high school was not especially expensive, although I was part of an attached magnet program that enrolled 10% of the student body, and that did add some . We did not have a 6:1 student/teacher ratio, or anything like that. We had more computer and internet stuff than was typical for the time, but our teachers were paid poorly and many of the good ones left for public schools. It was especially bad for math and science. The magnet program sheltered me from that (it was a math/science academy and I took my other classes with everyone else), and that program ended because they couldn’t pay those teachers either. I benefited from the high school, but I think friends of mine from public school who also went there benefited more, And as other answers are mentioning, the main reason was something pretty simple: the kids who didn’t want to learn got kicked out. One guy in particular has done really well for himself, and I don’t think he would have made it through college if he had kept hanging out with his friends from our public school. They weren’t horrible people, just not that into school and very into drinking. I should qualify that a few kids who were trouble managed to stay. We had a classmate who I think was generally seen as more of an amusing zoo animal than a peer. We joked that he was on the five-year plan, and in fact he graduated after having to finish in summer school. He went on to become the local cocaine dealer, and last I heard (at our 10 year reunion) he sold his pager number (effectively his business) for 8k when he went to prison for it. There were other kids who were not especially bright. We sent virtually everyone on to some form of additional schooling, but for maybe 40% that was a technical school, and many people didn’t finish college. But at the end of the day, while academic success didn’t guarantee popularity at Cotter High School, it was in practice at least necessary. Our valedictorian was hated because he was a whiny little bitch who would cry if he got an A- on a test, but all the popular kids were really good students. My sister did not have the same experience in public high school. You weren’t ostracized for being a good student, but it wasn’t seen as being particularly important for popularity. That, I think, is what you pay for, in some form or another. A school that will toss out kids who don’t fit the mold, whatever that mold is. It doesn’t guarantee a trouble-free school experience. The class behind me had quite a few kids who were trouble; I’m thinking of about six or so kids from wealthy family with ties to the school who were known to snort Ritalin in the back of class. There was a well-established tradition where a junior girl got pregnant. I gave serious thought to organizing a betting pool on who it would be; my prediction wouldn’t have won. (Somehow, the troublemaking class after me broke this trend.) But the kids who didn’t do homework, refused to pay attention, and would have sucked up a ton of teacher time and effort in public school mostly got thrown out. I wish we could offer the same to public school kids, but it isn’t politically realistic."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

It means you should be much concerned about protecting your money while doing intraday trading. If you try to stay in market with the intention not to lose, in long run you will learn too many things and later you will start earning from market. (*) Never deviate from your own designed strategy. No matter how frustrating or rewarding situation seems you should not deviate from your own strategy that you have designed based on your trading experience. Yea you may update your strategy if your find something better during your trading experience. (*) Never forget to use stop loss . If you use stop loss it’s guaranteed that you will never lose huge money. Stock market is not about making money but it’s about being in the market without losing money. (*) Trade in winning situation. Trade only when you find your strategy fits suitable in market condition. You don’t have to trade daily and every time. Trade in winning situation and rest of the time observe the market moves and learn from it. (*) Stop trading when few trades in very beginning goes wrong. Someday once your few trades in the very beginning goes negative then you assume that market is not going as per your perception today so it’s better to stop trading. On the other hand you will observe that someday if your few trades in the beginning goes profitable then rest of trade in whole day will go profitable. If it happens then you should assume that today market is trading as per your perception. (*) Trade in your comfort zone as per your financial condition and trading experience. Never over trade nor use margins much. Trade with that much size and price with which you are comfortable as per your financial condition and trading experience. Trade in such a way that after being in a position no matter how market goes negative or positive your heart beat should be normal. (*) Never trade against the trend. Check global index, country index, sectorial index, peers then individual share and news regarding that stock. (*) Book small small frequent profits. This is the important mantra of intraday trading. Brokerage charges is very less as compared to profit so don’t hesitate in exiting the trade in small profit. It preferable to book small small profit so frequently instead of waiting for huge profit. The intention of intraday trading should be make money from each small moves of market. (*) Listen to market but don’t tell. Because in intraday market moves more on the sentiment of traders and less on the business fundamental. I have seen stock price of a company rising on a particular day when it’s quarter result was announced and result was too bad. But price rose because on that day market sentiment was positive about country index and sectorial index. (*) Never be 100% sure , Anything can happen. Never put huge money so that if trade goes negative you lose everything. No matter how exhaustive research you have done but your are not the only one. So always be protective in market. (*) Never be greedy. No matter how alluring market appears but trade according to your financial health and experience only. You should not forget that the moment you find market rewarding at the same moment the person sitting on the other end find the market frustrating that’s why your trade executes. (*) Never do averaging on negative side. This is just a one’s psychological weakness. If you are so sure about u-turn of market price then why don’t you exit and place fresh order. (*) Never touch un-researched stock. No matter how alluring others stock seems you should never touch the stock that is not the part of your research. (*) Don’t touch high priced stock. For different person high price may be different. The psychology behind this is you feel more panic in high priced stock. If 5 rupees stock falls to 4 ,it has fallen 20%,while if 50000 rupees falls 20% price will fall to 40000. For a normal trader he will be highly panic to see 10000 loss in single share. The fact is if your trade 10,000 shares * 5 rs/share=50000 or 1 share * 50,000 rs/share= 50,000 loss of 20% will lose 10,000 in each case but since Psychology plays role in trading so you will be more panic in high priced share in adverse situation. (*) Never do trading on money loaned from someone, neither on survival money. You should feel confident while trading that can happen only when you are trading with your own money. Today or tomorrow you will come to know psychology plays a huge role in trading and loaned money affects your psychology so badly. (*) Never use recommendation from others. I am not telling that all recommendations are wrong, some good researchers are there in the market but you can’t tackle the trade if solely doing based on recommendation since you are not aware about thought process. If the researchers teach you thought process for recommendation then welcome them warmly. (*) Never go with Obvious kind of situation.

But it takes a lot of time, patience and love. Here is my experience on this. Actually I have copied the answer from a previous question How can you tell the difference between a feral cat and an outdoor cat? I do not know if you have seen it, so here is our story, mine and Princess’s. I cannot say for sure it can be done with any feral cat but for my Princess the fact that she discovered she loved being petted was the thing that made her more tame. Don't imagine she changed completely but she did change a lot. So here it is: When I moved there was already an outdoor cat here. She had been raised up in an attic and was impossible to approach or catch. She would come only for food when nobody was around. It took me years to gain her trust and slightly get close to her. Eventually she learned her name and started to show up when called for food. It took long time until she approached my hand and one day I tried to pet her. And she liked it. She was round 5-6 years old at that time. I could put one hand on her but never was able to catch her. And one day she put her little paw on my leg. It was one paw a day. A week later she sat on my lap. I still could not put 2 hands on her and to this day I still cannot. She was very hard to catch and have neutered but with quite a struggle and some scratches and bite marks we also did that. Luckily my vet could keep her there as she cannot be contained indoors. She might step on the hallway to eat but if the door closes behind her she starts bouncing on the walls and door to the point of getting hurt. She comes to be petted and will beg for pets for hours on end but never with 2 hands. She started to trust other family members to pet her, especially my niece who is very kind to her and they have quite a bond. She might jump in my lap from time to time but I have to be very careful not to scare her. In fact I kind of freeze and move just one hand for petting while she is there. She jumps on the window when she is hungry.. For years I thought she was mute because she used to open her mouth but never made a sound. Now she makes the cutest meows I have ever heard. It's something more like a mouse than a cat. Giving her pills or flea treatments is hell as she can scent anyhing I put in her food and refuses to eat so I have to grab her by force by the neck and risk that she might scratch or bite me but that it something I can live with. The worse part is that it takes over a week until she will come near me after that…so we both cry in different corners of the yard for that, but at the end she forgives me and we return to being friends on her terms. She is the smallest and cutest cat I know, even if she is 14 now she is smaller than an adult cat but I try to keep her healthy and happy the best way I can and make this friendship last as long as possible. So I do believe there is something called semiferral outdoor cat as I am lucky one chose me as her friend. And even then her name is Princess she is a worrior queen of 2.8 kgs.

I live in Michigan and have 2500 sqft house… the average house size in the U.S.. I have 8.5 kW of panels on my house. Over the course of a year, the energy produced by these panels is about how much electricity I use each year. And for some people, that is enough. But here is the real story. In July and August, my panels output around 60–65 kWh on a sunny day. My house will often use 75–80kWh. So, the panels don’t quite do the job for those two months. In December through Feb. the panels on a sunny day will only output 25 kWh or so. This is fine as that is all I generally use in the winter… but the sun rarely comes out in winter here and the panels often produce much less than 10 kWh. For the rest of the year, the panels generally produce way more than I need. So what does this mean? If you were to disconnect my house from the grid, I wouldn’t have the energy to run my house for five months out of the year. If I wanted to run my house strictly off of solar, heating and all, I would need need about 40 kW of solar panels and 80 kWh worth of batteries and I would need to change to a geo thermal hvac. And more of the truth of solar panels. The more people who get them, the more expensive grid electricity will cost. You could see connection fees of 100 or more just to be connected to the grid each month.

Here's how: 1. Find the tangential velocity at the equator: The Earth's radius is about [math]6.3cdot10^6 m[/math], and the Earth rotates [math]2pi rad[/math] every 86164 seconds (one sidereal day). Therefore, tangential velocity is: [math]dfrac{distance}{time} Rightarrow dfrac{2picdot6.3cdot10^6}{86164} approx 464 m/s[/math]. 2. Now that you have velocity, use [math]frac{v^2}{r}[/math] to get centripetal acceleration: [math]dfrac{464^2}{6.3cdot10^6} approx 0.034 m/s^2[/math]. 3. Multiply the centripetal acceleration by [math]-1cdot[/math](your mass) to get the centrifugal force on your body (the -1 is because centrifugal force is in the opposite direction as centripetal force). For example, if you weigh 70kg then the centrifugal force is about [math]-70kgcdot0.034 m/s^2 = -2.38 Newtons[/math] 4. Divide Newtons by [math]9.8 m/s^2[/math] (acceleration rate of gravity) to get the difference in weight at the equator vs the poles: [math]dfrac{-2.38 N}{9.8 m/s^2} = -0.243kg[/math] (about 0.3 percent). To find the weight difference at a location other than the equator, just multiply the acceleration (464 m/s) by the cosine of your latitude. For myself, at about 45 degrees north, this calculation gives: [math]-70cdotfrac{(464cdotcos(45))^2}{6.3cdot10^6} approx -1.19 N[/math], which is a weight difference of just under 0.2 percent."},{"instruction":"What is the best traditional dish from the Czech Republic, Slovakia or Hungary?

Families, influenced by the area they have come from, have different preceding soups, however. My husband’s family makes Cream of Lentil Soup with prunes and thus so do we. Many families make Vianočná kapustnica, a Christmas sauerkraut soup, but what exactly that soup consists of depends from family to family: some make it without meat, some with; often with prunes and mushrooms, but not always; prunes added at the end, prunes left to cook awhile and infuse the broth; with cream or without. One friend even told me her mother always made two versions of sauerkraut soup, vegetarian for Christmas Eve and meaty for Christmas day. One upon a time, Catholics didn’t eat meat on Christmas Eve and although that is no longer done, the meatless version of kapustnica remained as a tradition for many. Kapustnica is also served on New Year’s Eve, but everybody said they made the meaty version. Hopefully I can get that up on the blog before then. Note: this must be made with real fermented sauerkraut, not vinegar based jars of cabbage. It is easy to make , although the fermenting takes some time. Now, getting these recipes is difficult because everyone cooks ‘podla oko’, according to their eye or, as we would say, by feel. So don’t feel like this recipe has to be followed strictly because there are a million ways of doing it. I didn’t add whipping cream but many do, so go ahead and add it for extra deliciousness. Slovaks use a mushroom called ‘dubaky’, summer cep (a species of boletus) that grows in oak forests (dub means oak). If you don’t live in Slovakia, I imagine these would be hard to find, so add any mushroom you like. I think fresh oyster mushrooms would work well, and just put them in earlier than I have instructed for dry mushrooms. Vianočná kapustnica: Slovak Christmas Sauerkraut Soup (vegetarian version) Ingredients 65g - 125g (1/4-1/2 cup) butter (lots is good) 1 large onion 700g (3ish cups) squeezed sauerkraut caraway bay leaf 100g (1 cup) prunes handful dried mushrooms (or fresh) 250 ml (1 cup) whipping cream (optional) 2 Tbsp arrowroot (or flour or cornstarch) sour cream salt and pepper Instructions Melt butter in pot. Chop onion and slowly cook. Roughly chop sauerkraut. If you are worried about it being too sour you can rinse it, but I don't. Add sauerkraut to onions and stir. Add enough water to cover the sauerkraut by an inch or two. Add a sprinkling of caraway seeds and two bay leaves. Let simmer until soft, at least an hour. Soak dry mushrooms in cold water. Cover prunes in a separate small pot and bring to a simmer until plump, just a few minutes. Add mushrooms to pot and cook for 5 minutes. Add prunes. If you want to add cream, do so now. Mix arrowroot (or flour or cornstarch) with a little water and pour into the pot, stirring as you pour. Serve garnished with sour cream. 3.3.3077 Enjoy!

As I am living in Prague now, I eat it relatively often if I have a chance as it is really delicious. The recipe in English is here: [LINKED_TEXT: Kulajda - Traditional Czech Mushroom SoupShare As for a creamy mushroom soup, Kulajda has very unusual sour sweet flavor. I would say that it tastes more like borsch, that creamy mushroom soup, though they have nothing in common. Kulajda is thick soup with cream, potatoes and mushrooms. Besides, you may take dried or pickle (rinsed with water) or fresh mushrooms. I prefer using fresh ones. Kulajda is served with a poached egg. Their flavors matche perfectly and enhance each other. The soup also looks very attractive when served. Poached eggs may be cooked beforehand and kept in cold water in the fridge. There are two more ways of adding poached eggs to the soup, I will share them with you in the recipe.

These techniques are the pizza base for the road to mastery in NLP, and every data expert should know. All of these techniques are achieved through performing in the projects. The online courses will make this job easier for you, especially if the course is domain-oriented to help you gain knowledge in your domain of interest. We’ll learn about each technique in detail below: As the revolution of computers started growing globally, we have been keen to make the computer understand our language of communication. NLP is a field growing rapidly and will continue to grow in the future since it makes our life easy to live. We are all surrounded by the functioning of natural processing language. It is used in speech recognition features in our mobile phones, searches we make on google. So, it's essential to learn and master these techniques for data scientists. Keyword analysing: In this technique, you extract the words used maximum times in the body of the file to determine the key concept. You will most likely see this technique used for search engines and customer assistance. So, you use the key concept determined by the computer to help it understand the file in a better way. Stem and lemmatization: These are two different techniques serving the same purpose: the stem is easy to perform but not accurate enough, while lemmatization takes time to perform but serves with accuracy. The stem is the removal of the end of the first word to draw meaning. Lemmatization is putting grammar-based knowledge into the computer for better understanding. Naming Entity Recognition(NER): It works similarly to keyword analysing, but the main difference is when implementing NER, you do naming to the body text like persons name, place name and many more. The data fed to the computer is essential in this system which helps recommend system projects and provide services. Title modelling: As keyword analysing assists you in developing the most used keyword in the file, you can give a title to your files known as concept modelling. But title modelling is simple to use compared to keyword analysing because the tools used in the title modelling makes it convenient and time-efficient. Summary of the text: This technique is a similar but different use of keyword analysing and title modelling. In this technique, the system names the file in a short summary as what this file contains. The different use of summary text is it used in articles of the news and researches. To learn NLP techniques, you should have expert assistance with you in performing the projects. I recommend Learnbay for skilled professionals for domain-specific projects with an IBM certification.

I have different preferences for different things. My house trim I wanted very smooth so it would be very easy to dust/clean,feel very, very smooth to the touch,but not quite, though just a little less than, plastic, fake furniture.I still wanted to retain some wood texture, but very minutely and still very smooth to the touch except in select areas.hard finisheasily repaired.very much like a lacquer finishIn a nutshell: how to make wood still look rugged, but be smooth to the touch. Here’s what I did. I could have gotten in smoother if that’s what was desired simply by repeating a couple of steps. I have used this on all of the woodent trim work for my home. Lot of work, but beautiful and smooth. I dislike polyurethane. I have found it to delaminate more easily. Plus it ‘flecks’ when damaged so it can’t be repaired as easily as this finish. I am making all trim work from dimensional lumber: basically 2x6s with occasional 1x6s, and, rarely, but importantly, individually cut pieces to fit a particualar place. The point is: it’s not standard pre-cut molding. I sand the wood initially with a random orbital sander. My goal is ‘smooth to the touch’ - not necessarily flat, even, nor to cover all imperfections. As a matter of fact, I treasure imperfections as character, but I still want them to be very smooth to the touch. Steps: Sand with medium (100 to 120ish) grit using Random Orbital sander (ROS). Sometimes if there is an especially rough gouge, crack, split, splintered area in a board I want saved, I’ll use 50 or 60 grit first, but 100 works for 95% of the time.Sand with fine (220ish) grit with ROS.If I were using straight rubbing oil finish, such as pure tung oil, I’d sand again with extra fine (300 to 320ish) with ROS. With the finish I use, I’m finding I can skip this step most of the time.I stain my wood with MinWax oil based stain. I brush it on and wipe very little, if any, off. Just where it’s puddling or something.I let it dry … usually overnight; sometimes longer depending on humidity & temperature.But before it dries for days, I put another coat of stain on and let it sit for an hour or so; then I wipe the boards firmly with a paper towel to remove any undried or non-soaked in stain. This give the wood more contrast than the regular staining directions; and makes the wood look more ‘antiqued’ as if they had been refinished. All of this raised the grain slightly, which is why the 320 sanding is usually superfluous; it gets ‘undone’ here anyway.Let it dry thoroughly. It sometimes takes 3 or 4 days.No more mechanical sanding. I sand it by hand with a 100ish grit sanding ‘sponge’. Careful not to sand the stain away, although it may lighten it some in places. Use judgement. You can still get it smoother later.Wipe / clean.Brush on a coat of MinWax Tung Oil Finish. It’s tung oil based, so it soaks into the wood, but, unlike pure tung oil, it has some kind of varnish or finishing resins that:makes it hardmakes it very sandable Let it dry … it may take the entire day, or even overnight.Sand with 220 sanding sponge.Wipe / clean.Brush on another coat of the Tung Oil Finish.Important note: It’s the thickness of the finish that determines the smoothness at this point. It’s working similar to sanding sealer, just not as thick. The thicker you brush it one, the more likely it is to leave little brush strokes. These can be sanded out, but you don’t want to keep adding them and taking away. This is where you use judgement. You want to be just thick enough to fill in any grain or roughness. This coat usually dries in a few hours (unless you really had to put it on thick because of some unusual roughness)Sand thoroughly with 320 sanding sponge.Clean.Wipe (not brush - unless you really need to) on some Tung Oil finish using a cloth or cloth-paper.Danger: - cloths or paper with undried oil in them can spontaneously catch on fire if balled up and put into trash. Follow instructions on how to safely dispose of oil-soaked rags. Dry- usually within a couple of hours.Sand softly with 320 sanding sponge (I save the ones from above that have ‘worn out’ and use them here. You’re just getting off any ‘fuzziness’ to your smooth finish at this point. There will be places where it is so smooth the sanding sponge won’t even sand it there. That’s great & is OK.Wipe again with very very little oil to cover the places the sponge did contact above. They will be little cloudy streaks and this very light wiping with the finish oil again brings it all together. This will give it that lacquer-like shine and texture. A few more comments. Sometimes I’m good with leaving some of the knothole texture not completely eradicated. I want them smooth, but slightly palpable. If I want them or something similar completely smooth to the touch, I just repeat the steps 10 through 12 or 14 through 16 in that area. Also, if you want it more or less smooth overall, you can adjust in this steps 10 ->12, or 14->16 section. Here are some pictures of a 2x6 scrap I had left after cutting a board to fit. It’s hard to convey smoothness in pictures, but I put a few drops of water on it, which kinda reveals some of the smoothness, andin 2 of them, I just held it up to the light to get the remaining texture which is exactly what I wanted. Below is the most tortured, but beautiful (to us) piece of wood in the house. You’re looking at the bottom edge of a horizontal 2x6, This area was so jagged you’d have wanted gloves to hold it here. It’s still textured to the touch in those dark areas, but by no means splintery. It retains texture but is a smoother version thereof.

When I’m in my 70s I may go back to university for a couple of years and finish an arts course I didn’t get to do when I was younger, due to pressure of work, family, etc. But certainly not retirement before then. To answer the OP, couldn’t you find another job? I mean, 62 is not exactly enfeebled. If you have no health problems, look at your skill set and see what is out there! The opportunities are there, and even if only a part-time job can be valuable. Admittedly, I don’t know what the system is like in UK, but don’t you get the pension there if you DON’T have any money? Do only those who have money get the old-age pension?"},{"instruction":"What are some of the best blogging tools?","output":"As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there are several excellent free SEO tools available that can help you optimize your website's performance and improve its search engine rankings.

Interest: When you apply for a personal loan, you agree to repay your debt with interest, which is essentially the lender’s charge for allowing you to use their money and to repay it over time. You will pay a monthly interest charge in addition to the portion of your payment that goes toward reducing the principal.Eligibility: Most financial institutions and banks have eligibility criteria for any type of loan that you might be looking for. These parameters are set by them in order to get assurance from you whether you have the ability to pay back the loan amount or not. Some factors that they will consider include employment, credit history, loan security and income. To avail a personal loan, you must have a regular source of income, whether you are salaried or self-employed business person or a professional. Only once the financial lender agrees to all the eligibility parameters, you can avail a loan according to your requirements.Processing Fee: Typically, banks charge up to 1-2% of the loan amount as processing fee. A few banks charge a flat processing fee. These charges add to the total cost of the loan. Lower the processing fee, the better.Prepayment Fee: Sometimes, you take a personal loan to tide over the short term cash crunch. In such a case, prepayment loan is a possibility when the cash flow improves.Late payment fees: Credit institutions levy penalty in case you are late on EMI payment. If you are struggling with cash flows, do consider this penalty as well.Extra charges payable: In addition to the interest payable on the principal amount, there is a non-refundable charge on applying for a personal loan. The lender charges a processing fee, usually 1-2% of the loan principal, to take care of any paperwork that needs to be processed as part of the application process.Pre-closure: It refers to completely paying off a personal loan before the loan tenure has ended. Just like prepayment charge, pre-closure charges range from 2-5% of the loan amount.Loan Approval Process: The approval is at the sole discretion of the loan sanctioning officer whose decision is based on the criteria specified by the bank/financial institution. The entire process can take between 48 hours to two weeks. Once all the necessary documents are submitted and the verification is completed, the loan, if sanctioned, is disbursed within seven working days by the bank.Debt Consolidation: If you have many debts and loans to pay off, you may often get confused and miss due dates or be unable to plan your repayment requirements correctly. So, taking a personal loan and consolidating all your debts under one account may prove to be good for you. This arrangement will help you focus on making just one payment and one due date every month so that you can keep a closer eye on the rate of interest, amount to be paid off and so on.Credit Score: credit score plays an important role when it comes to availing financial services. This is the very first thing any financial lender would check once you apply for any loan that you need. Credit score is a number which determines your credit rating which has been formed over the years. The chances of loan approval are higher if your credit score is generally above 700. These terms will guide you if you are thinking of applying for a personal loan. But before going for personal loan, it is important that you analyze your financial situation carefully and not pile up additional debts.

Start your crowdfunding journey with family and friends. Try to raise 15%-30% of the funds through them before spreading the word further. When people who don’t know you personally see that your campaign has already gotten a fair amount of backing, they’ll perceive it as validated and be much more likely to contribute. FACEBOOK GROUPS & PAGES Facebook is an immensely powerful platform to help get the word out about your campaign. Find groups likely to be sympathetic to your cause and post compelling content about the topic of your campaign and the stories behind it. Don’t focus on the crowdfunding process, it is no longer interesting, just mention it with a link at the end of the content you share. Pages are managed by companies, organizations, celebrities and influencers, meaning you’ll have to reach out to them personally. Present your cause, explain why it’s relevant, and ask them to feature it. This will take time, but being endorsed on a page with lots of followers can make all the difference to your campaign. Finally, don’t forget to use your own personal account to talk about your campaign on a daily basis. EMAIL MARKETING Email is a great way to get people to support your campaign – irrespective of your mailing list’s size. Send an email every few days and don’t worry about losing subscribers – [LINKED_TEXT: unsubscribe rates tend to be very low] [URL: http://www.smartinsights.com/email-marketing/email-communications-strategy/statistics-sources-for-email-marketing/]. Use an email marketing service to streamline the process and generate reports to show you who’s opening and clicking the links in your emails. Once you know who’s interested, target them separately with differently worded emails acknowledging their interest and support. TWITTER Tweet regularly to inform your following about your campaign using relevant hashtags. Find influencers who might be interested in your cause, reach out to them, and get them to help spread the word. Use time-saving and automating apps such as [LINKED_TEXT: Zapier] [URL: https://zapier.com/] and [LINKED_TEXT: IFTTT] [URL: https://ifttt.com/] to manage publishing across various platforms. LINKEDIN Write articles and share information about your campaign on LinkedIn using appropriate hashtags. Find relevant groups and individuals to help promote your campaign, again, reaching out personally by sending thoughtful messages to get them engaged. REDDIT Reddit is another very powerful platform to drive traffic to your campaign. The problem is that its user base is notorious for disliking marketers. The key, then, is to have spent time contributing and participating in a forum, or subreddit, before posting anything about your own campaign. In other words, bring value to the community prior to asking for anything in return. PRODUCTHUNT If your campaign is tech-related, ProductHunt is a fantastic place to draw attention to it, with the potential of driving even more traffic than an article featured in a mainstream tech publication. On ProductHunt, products are submitted – or “hunted” – and then discussed and voted. As a new user, you may not have sufficient privileges to post your product. Instead, find products that are similar to yours and personally reach out to their “hunter” through email or social media. ADS Facebook is the most effective platform for placing ads because it lets you target audiences that are likely to respond to your campaign. If promoting a cookbook, for example, you could target only those people who have liked pages on cooking, are aged 25-65, and have also liked Kickstarer and Indiegogo’s pages. You could also try Taboola and Outbrain, which allow you to target audiences based on what they read. Their ads are usually seen below articles on mainstream publications, under a “You May Like” title. REFERRAL CONTESTS Some platforms and third-party services allow you to use incentives to get people to market your crowdfunding campaign by giving them a perk or money if they refer a certain amount of campaign backers. If you’re raising money for a movie, for instance, you could launch a referral contest in which the winner gets to have breakfast with the director. My advice is to have at least three different perks for the top three ambassadors. Indiegogo has a [LINKED_TEXT: built-in tool for referral contests] [URL: https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/527406-How-do-I-run-a-referral-contest-]. There are also third-party tools that enable you to do set up referral contests on Kickstarter. INFLUENCERS Influencers with a large following on Instagram, YouTube and other platforms can drive a lot of traffic to your campaign. Send a free sample of your product, service or app to the right influencers along with a personalized message asking them to review it. Marketplaces such as Famebit and Grapevine allow you to find and connect with appropriate influencers. PUBLIC RELATIONS Getting your campaign featured on appropriate media can work wonders for your success. Although there are agencies that specialize in accomplishing this for you, their services are expensive. You can still try to get your campaign featured on your own. Make a list of potentially interested journalists before launching the campaign and reach out to them with a personalized message once it’s trending, as they’ll be more likely to feature it. If there’s anything novel or unique about your campaign, make sure to emphasize that – they might cover you even if your campaign is not trending. HIGH-SCALE AGENCIES If your aim is to raise more than 100,000 and you have a big budget, consider finding an agency specializing in driving traffic to your campaign through Facebook. Expect to pay media costs plus a percentage of the money raised. Such agencies are usually most effective after you’ve raised a signification portion of your target. UPDATES Make sure you’re posting updates about your campaign on your crowdfunding platform at least every 4-5 days, both publicly and to private backers who get these sent directly to their inbox. Use updates to share your progress, present special offers and recruit existing backers to help spread the word about your campaign."},{"instruction":"Did they ever prove that George Floyd intentionally used counterfeit money, and is there a way to posthumously charge Floyd with fraud?","output":"Why should he be posthumously charged with fraud?

Realistically, there is no way for Itachi to win this. ➡ Speed : The fastest you can get ( Edo ) Itachi would be around MKCM Level, and this is with a highball. However, even when Itachi is highballed Tobirama just eclipses him in Speed. He was able to “blitz” ( ? ) Juubito as an Edo and react to attacks from a Senjutsu enhanced Rinnegan Madara, who is stronger than standard Alive Madara, someone who is Stated to be superior to a latter form of EMS Sasuke that is already comfortably above all forms of Itachi. ➡ Hax : Admittedly, Itachi does have the edge here, with Jutsu like Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi and the Spirit Weapons Susano’o. However they’re mostly irrelevant either way, since Tobirama is too fast to be hit with physical attacks like the Susano’o and Amaterasu. The only abilities on Itachi’s arsenal that can make a difference is Kotoamatsukami ( Which should be a free W ) and maybe Tsukuyomi. Tobirama is a bad opponent because his sheer speed renders the vast majority of Itachi’s hax ( That is normally his strong point ) irrelevant. ➡ How would a fight go ? Due to the massive gap in Speed , Itachi’s only chance at survival is his Susano’o. If he somehow doesn’t get blitzed from the get-go and manages to summon his Susano’o, he can probably survive for a while. However, his diminished reserves due to his illness don’t really allow him to keep it up for long. So Tobirama would just avoid it due to much higher Speed Scaling and when Itachi’s forced to drop his Susano’o, Tobirama swoops in for the kill. The only, only chance Itachi has is his Genjutsu , but then again it’s a contentious point especially considering Tobirama’s incredible Speed. If he can land either of his 2 Genjutsu, he might have a chance, but the odds of that happening are infinitesmal. ➡ Conclusion : While Itachi is certainly formidable, he is completely and utterly outclassed here. Tobirama is up there with the likes of Madara and Hashirama, the actual Gods of Shinobi.

It originated in the mid-19th century in the United Kingdom. The photographers of this school pursued the effect of painting in the creation, or the realm of \\"poetic and artistic\\". 2. Impressionist photography Impressionist photography was inspired by Impressionist painting. From the mid-1960s to the 1980s, the painting Impressionist movement prevailed in France. The famous Impressionist painters Monet and Renoir tried to reproduce the colors of the visual impressions of objects in a light-filled atmosphere in order to oppose the stereotypes of painting. 3. Realism photography Realism and paintingism were once two major branches of photography, and their influence can be seen. In the nineteenth century, after the neoclassicalism and romanticism in France, Photographers have seen the influence of realism on people's thinking, so they are most likely to choose real-life themes in the perspective of photography, showing the real life and the resonance of people at that time. 4. Naturalistic photography In 1899, the photographer Peter Henry Emerson published a paper entitled \\"The Photography of Naturalism\\" in view of the weakness of the creation of paintingism. The sniper of painting photography is fragmented photography, advocating the return of photographers to nature. Go find creative inspiration. He believes that nature is the beginning and end of art. Only the art closest to nature is the highest art. The creative themes of this genre are mostly natural scenery and social life. 5. Pure photography Pure photography is a photographic art genre matured in the early twentieth century. They advocate that photography art should exert the characteristics and performance of photography itself, free it from the influence of painting, and pursue the aesthetic effect unique to photography with pure photography technology - high clarity, rich tone level, subtle Light and shadow changes, pure black and white tones, meticulous texture performance, precise image portrayal. 6. Dadaist photography The Dada Party was a literary thought that emerged in Europe during the First World War. “Dada” was originally an incoherent vocabulary of “Pony” or “Toy Horse” in French children’s language. Because of Dadaist artists Rejecting rationality and traditional culture in the creation, claiming that art and aesthetics are not available, advocating \\"abandoning painting and all aesthetic requirements\\", advocating nothingness, making creation almost ridiculous 7. Surrealist photography Surrealist photography emerged in the 1930s. Photographers of this genre believe that the use of realistic methods to express the real world is a task that classical artists have already accomplished, and the mission of modern artists is to explore new, unexplored That part of the human \\"spiritual world.\\" The objects they deliberately express are human subconscious activities, accidental inspiration, so the effect is peculiar, absurd and mysterious. 8. Abstract photography Abstract photography is a photographic art genre that emerged after the First World War. The photographers of this genre negated the basic art of reflecting the life and expressing the artist's aesthetic feelings in a measurable artistic image, claiming to liberate photography from photography. It's just a rough classification. With the progress of the times, more and more photographers have their own unique styles. There is no fixed form for this kind of style.

It's easier to switch networks. An eSIM makes it much easier to switch mobile networks. Instead of needing to order a new SIM, waiting for it to arrive, then inserting it into your phone, you can switch to a different network with a phone call or online.eSIM is better than physical SIM cards for a number of reasons: –eSIM is small: This not only allows extra room for other components, or perhaps a larger battery, it also enables manufacturers to rejig the internal layout of their devices. An eSIM doesn’t need to be near the edge of the phone and could make waterproofing devices even easier. –eSIM can’t be physically damaged or lost: because it’s embedded inside devices. –eSIM is secure: cant’ be duplicated. –eSIM can store multiple cellular profiles: several profiles can be stored so you can easily toggle to select which carrier you would like to use. –eSIM is easy to locate: it’s easier to find your phone in case it is lost or stolen since network providers can control eSIM remotely. To use an eSIM, you'll need to be with a carrier that offers it and have a compatible phone. Most major carriers, including AT&T and T-Mobile in the US, EE in the UK, and over 120 more worldwide offer eSIM support. eSIM cards are currently used to bring dual SIM capability to smartphones, including the iPhone 12 range, the Pixel 5, and smaller devices like the Apple Watch. In time, all phones and tablets will likely switch to using eSIM. Its much smaller size means that it could also become a common feature in Internet-of-Things devices, although there's an even newer and vastly smaller tech called iSIM just around the corner."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","output":"What does it mean if you’re at a show and the lead guitarist is drooling out of both sides of his mouth?

In many states there are laws that separates speeding from reckless driving.. That’s why the cop that stopped your wife did you and her a favor. Speeding may be defined in several ways by a municipality or state. For example, speeding on a city street and going let’s say 40 miles over the posted speed limit could be considered reckless driving because after all it’s a city street and there are pedestrians. Speeding on the highway at let’s say 100 mph, that may be the speed at which an individual would be sighted for reckless driving. The point here is that it is really up to the state (or city) to decide what is a misdemeanor and what is a felony, which BTW reckless driving is considered a felony in many states. The trouper and the judge simply follow the laws as published by the municipality or state. In this case the trouper used what is considered his judgement to determine whether your wife was or was not a treat to society or if perhaps she just had a lead foot that day… This is often determined by the record that he pulls up when he ran her license. So, the bottom line is that your wife is actually lucky that the trouper was kind to her, cause yes, she could have been arrested and tried as a felon.

If ether of these are the case I feel most cops will let you slide with a warning however in my experience cops don’t really care at 3AM or at least where I live. Now if they are doing 100 miles a hour other cars around traffic and other factors odds are a cop will be less likely to forgive since it’s a reckless situation. Example a car doing 65 you are doing 80 you now require more stop time plus you run a risk of rear ending another driver. now in a hour with little traffic where it’s less dangerous and less likely to cause a accident unless you are street racing you probably may get away with it. If you are a mechanic you might be able to talk your way outta a ticket if your trying to fix a problem in the piston timings or transmission shifting at weird times based on how fast your going.

It’s much better to reach out to the best audiences and invite them to come view your campaign page, which is the purpose of marketing. Pre-launch marketing may include social-media ads to generate e-mail leads, building an active social-media community of fans (who can provide you with great feedback although they may be harder to mobilize), pre-launch public relations, and preparing to mobilize your personal contacts. Post-launch marketing may include social-media advertisements (especially on Facebook), cross-promotions, affiliate marketing, and public relations (which may include paid editorials and/or social-media influencers). In our experience, these techniques normally yield the most pledges in this order—and more pledges from one source generally encourage more pledges from ALL sources. You can also try social-media posts but, in our experience, you shouldn’t expect any significant pledges from them unless you pay to boost them to the right audiences."},{"instruction":"Why would a narcissist block you on Facebook then unblock you then block you again?","output":"Well, my covert narcissist girlfriends block people, when they became annoying or clingy.

Outside of historical books it has absolutely no real meaning, because the region called Greece, actually Hellas, was a very loose concept with no real boundaries and no political meaning. There was no such thing as “Hellenic world\\" either. This too is a modern technical term used by researchers to better organize cultural phenomena with spatial terms. Outside of the fields of study, this term has absolutely no real meaning because it has never really existed. The ancient people did not live in nation states with clear cut boundaries. Up until very recently, people in the Balkans lived in highly mixed areas. In the region called Macedonia lived all sorts of people, including Ancient Hellenes, Illyrians and Thracians.

For example: Ϣ to represent the /ʃ/ (sh) sound that does not exist in greek but is common in egyptian. 4) Egyptian texts became almost exclusively written in the coptic alphabet after that (hieroglyphic and demotic writing progressively disappeared). 5) This remain the core writing system in Egypt until the muslim conquest which progressively imposed arabic.

Should I keep these ones for familiarity and comfort, or do you think it would be better to start over with new scents and leave all the old ones behind?","output":"Ooooooooh this is a tough one. Alright, I actually have experience with this. So when we got our baby girl, Karma, another cat owner brought this tower for her. The thing was old and wasn’t in good shape, but it was honestly all she had for her use while her and her owner was staying with us. Now— that being said, I can’t prove it, but her old owner didn’t seem like the best person in the world. We’ll go with that. So what did we do? We kept the tower. We put it off to the side though, so that she had the option to use it, while also purchasing a brand new, fresh and pretty tower for the cats after her owner left. Worst case scenario— she ignores it, right? For the first few weeks after her owner left her with us, Karma would inspect the tower, but she never really seemed to care about it. It was there though, so it was her call. Eventually she starts coming up to my husband and I, fussing and fussing. No idea what she wants. What do you do when a cat just starts yelling at you? Follow the cat! We notice she’s continually taking us over to the tower and.. head butting it. Alright. What does it mean? I get an idea and take the tower outside. She runs over, starts sniffing the spot and bolts over to the new one, head butting it too. I take a wild guess and move the new one where the old one was. Guess what? Guess she hated the old one, since she wouldn’t leave the new one for about a month. At the end of the day it depends on the cat. Keep an old one and get a new one. Maybe it’ll give the cats some closure. If they start head butting it though, it means throw it away, just so you know. I sure as hell didn’t. Edit: I mis-remembered some minor details— the tower didn’t come from her old home, but it was with us when she arrived and stayed with us for about 6 months while her and her owner was with us."},{"instruction":"As an American, do you agree that statistics that show the US way down low at #37 for quality of healthcare is farleft propaganda that folks in Europe, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand love to repeat, when in reality the US is always #1?","output":"Because my universal global healthcare I fall under recommends me to take out additional insurance when I go to the USA.

For example, you might consider asking your partner to stay in a different room when you are with your therapy dog, or taking extra precautions to keep the dog away from your partner. On the other hand, if your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is simply because they don’t like animals, then it is important to talk to them about why they don’t like animals and to understand their perspective. In this case, it is important to remember that your relationship is still in its early stages and that you should try to be understanding of your partner’s feelings. No matter the reason for your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog, it is important to have an honest conversation about the issue. Talk to them about why they don’t like your therapy dog and how you feel about it. This conversation should focus on understanding each other’s perspectives and finding a way to move forward that is comfortable for both of you. It is also important to remember that your therapy dog has been a part of your life for 10 years and that you have a special bond with the dog. The dog has been a source of comfort, companionship, and support for you, and it is important to remember these benefits when discussing the issue with your partner. Finally, it is important to consider the future of your relationship. If your partner’s dislike of your therapy dog is something that you are unable to resolve, then it is important to consider if this is something that you can continue to accept in the long-term. If not, then it might be best to seek a different relationship in which both you and your partner feel comfortable and respected. In summary, it is important to assess why your partner doesn’t like your therapy dog, to have an honest conversation about the issue, and to remember the benefits that your therapy dog has brought to your life. It is also important to consider the future of your relationship and to seek a different relationship if needed. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

What do I do?","output":"I failed to make consistent progress in the gym for years. Here are a few things that accelerated my results and helped me build and maintain and lean and muscular physique (185 lbs. 11% body fat at 6′) year round. 1. Track Everything If you show up to the gym and you don’t track the number of reps you complete, the weight you’re using, and your rest time, you are stunting your progress and killing your gains. Every week, your goal should be to use just a little more weight or do just a few more reps than you did last week. If you aren’t doing this, you’ll never get stronger, you’ll never gain mass, and you’ll never build the body you want. You should also be tracking the number of calories you consume on a daily basis (at least for the first six months). If you don’t know how many calories you are consuming, you’ll never be able to tailor your diet to help you achieve the goals you’ve set. You don’t have to do this forever. Just long enough that you can begin to eyeball macros and have a greater understanding of how many calories of energy are in the foods you are consuming. And finally—the most overlooked element of a good training program—is tracking and improving your sleep. If you follow any half decent weight training program, you WILL get results. But you must give yourself adequate time to recover. Make sure you’re getting at least 7.5 hours of sleep a night (I’d say 9 is better if you’re training hard). Do yoga for at least 60 minutes a week. Spend some time in nature. 2. Focus on The Basics with You’re Training Super sets. Drop sets. Hypoxic training. Screw all of that. Just keep things simple. The majority of your training should be heavy resistance training (4–8 rep range) with compound movements—squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press. You can do some secondary exercises in the 8–12 rep range to stimulate hypertrophy and get ya gains on, but keep the majority of your lifting to heavy compound movements and try to go heavier each week than you did the week before. Sprint for 20–30 minutes (30 seconds on 60–90 seconds walking) once a week and do some yoga to aid in recovery and you’re golden. 3. Track Your Macros (But Don’t Be Crazy About Diet). Here’s the deal. You can lose fat eating oreos. You can gain muscle eating twizzlers and cheese burgers. These diets aren’t ideal, but the point is that body composition is determined by energy balance, not the quality of the calories you get. But you MUST count calories and track macros. If you’re aiming for muscle gain, I’d recommend multiplying your bodyweight x 18 to determine your daily calorie intake and shooting for 30% protein, 25% fat, and 45% carbohydrates. If you’re shooting for fat loss, then multiply your weight by 12–14 and shoot for 25% protein, 30% carbohydrates, and 45% fat. If you track your macros week after week after week and regularly engage in resistance and cardio, you WILL make progress. 4. Stay Consistent Real results take time. And a lot of it. You can’t complain about “not seeing results” until you’ve been training on ONE program for at least six months. Until that point, you’re just playing around. After 6 months of consistent weight training (I’m talking less than 2 missed workouts per month), if you STILL aren’t seeing results, it might be indicative of an underlying health issue or a problem with your program. Go see a doctor and consider a personal training. Hope this helps. Stay Grounded, Andrew Want to learn more about my mission and keep the conversation going?

My morning began getting ready for work I'd have my coffee and I'd have a bowl of raisin Bran cereal, so I'd get my fill of good things for me, then I'd take my multi vitamins, and off to work, at lunch I always had something with bread, sandwiches or chicken whatever went good with bread, because bread helps build muscle, then I'd get home and do some housework to keep myself moving and then hit the weights, after that I'd take my shower and then dinner, I'd usually have chicken breast with rice and veggies, or steak dinner, and whatever I could make with high protein and high fiber, then after dinner I'd relax and eventually bed, I did it that way to allow the food to sit while my metabolism slowed when I slept, this way I'd have some fat starting to build so I could turn it into muscle, it doesn't mean this will work for everyone, but it is how I did it, so take what you want from it, and I hope you get bigger and I hope this helps you."},{"instruction":"What is it like being a farmer? Are farmers happy?","output":"I am a son of an Indian farmer who is cultivating crops in 3 acres of land. Agriculture is not an easy job like other sectors. Before few years there is water in our well, so we use the well water to irrigate the crops. And in rainy seasons the rain water helps to grow the crops and it maintains the Underground water level in good amount. So what ever the crops we cultivate it grows well, we sell that and earned some profit. But from past 4 or 5 years there is no proper rain. Well was dried and we had no water to irrigate the crops we planted. If it continues the crops and money we invested will be waste. So we decided to dig bore well. That also didn’t helped us due to the lack of underground water. So we faced a huge loss. Now our land have no water to do agriculture. Its not only my problem but also the problem of so many farmers in India. Being a farmer i am proud, but not happy. A proper rain and good water resources are the only things a farmer expects to live happy. Being a farmer you can not take leave in weekends. You have to work until the harvest. Even after the harvest you don’t get huge profits. You have to decide what to cultivate to the next monsoon. The knowledge about modern agricultural techniques and handwork may result in huge profit."},{"instruction":"Why does the recording in GarageBand sound so bad?","output":"It seems to be assumed that you are even using a microphone.

They can also make one’s singing much worse! I am not a fan of “warm up” tapes/cd’s, MP4’s etc., that one can buy from “whomever the great teacher” online, or otherwise. That is my first clue that the person who made them is not a good singer, or does not have an ethical conscience anyway. There exist NO magic vocalizes that fix a voice, or turn you into a good singer. There is not a machine that will make you sing on key. They can adjust the pitch on a recording. A machine may tell you that you are sharp, or flat. That is not the same. Every vocalize must be executed with freedom in order to benefit a voice. Unless there is a skilled singer present, who has a good ear, vocal exercises are a waste of time, and/or money. At least, they are so until the singer understands what freedom is, and can do the exercises freely unattended. That is the goal. It takes a skilled, patient, watchful, trustworthy, caring teacher to guide a singer to develop a free technique. And, it takes trust on the part of the student. It is no easy feat, but it can be done. :*)"},{"instruction":"have a fairly basic understanding of Python. But now I want to learn C++.

Plus there are some subtle incompatibilities between the two, such that you can have a legal C program that is not a legal C++ program, and a legal C program that’s also a legal C++ program with different behavior. If you want to learn C++, learn C++ and don’t bother with C at all. There are enough differences between the languages that you would have to unlearn a lot of your C habits to write proper C++ code."},{"instruction":"What is an effective way to teach a lesson for those who are slow to understand?","output":"The best way is to positively display the topic/material (like a mini-play) and display our enjoyment as we are displaying it (not directly “teaching”). In that way, there is no need for authoritarian displays (superiority/disciplinary/threat) because we are relying on the positive displays to attract and keep the interest of the one learning.

I guess I should have picked up on the issue because when I was at Bestbuy I did notice that the black lines and shadows made my eyes blur despite the picture being sharp as a tack. But I've never heard of a screen that's not flickering or blurry causing eye strain. I mean I was literally looking at black text on a white background and the text would look blurry, but I could feel it was my eyes refocusing as a looked at a super sharp 4K image. Mind you I've never heard of a non flashing image, or non blurry image causing eye strain or any of this until I bought the tv. When in Bestbuy I just brushed it off as my eyes acting funny. So I get the TV home, and I'm so excited i set it up and watch two normal movies, no flashing lights, or shakey camera movements, nothing unusual. After 2 hours of watching, my eyes are totally strained to the max, I can feel the headache coming on. However, I don't know the term “eye strain”, but I know it's something with the TV, so I turn off every special setting and watch another movie hoping it will go away, or my eyes will adjust to the sharp images. By the end of the second movie I have a full blown headache, there is a tightness between my eyes, and in the muscles inbetween my eyebrows. I'm holding my face feeling like I'm going to throw up. If your wondering why I didn't turn it off, it's because the TV was too awesome! I was in denial, until I got nauseous, and literally felt my stomach prepping to throw-up. At that point I had to lay down, and I wanted to research what was going on, but my eyes couldn't even handle my cell phone or computer screen. Both of which I've had for over 4 years with no issue at all. The nauseous feeling began to go away once I turned the tv completely off. Just having it on in the room without looking at it gave me nausea because what ever it was doing reflected off the walls. The next day I felt slight head ache and tightness behind my eyes like I was hung over. I turned on the tv and even the all black start up screen (with the SONY logo) gave me nausea. Needless to say I returned the tv. 4 days after the day I watched the tv for 5 hours total and my eyes are still sore and strained. So to answer the question, “Does the OLED tv cause eye strain?” My experience says 100% yes, and headache, nausea, and potential vomiting."},{"instruction":"ead of extracting minerals and elements from Africa, cradle of the Earth, for EV battery elements, why dont we just extract dig large holes in our own countries instead of always relying on motherland Africa?","output":"Unfortunately, nature has not distributed minerals and ores evenly over the surface of the earth, so that they can be extracted from wherever ‘we’ wish.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","output":"There are many good answers to this question so I won't repeat them. But I would like to add something that I often teach young entrepreneurs: being CEO of a start-up is far, far harder than being CEO of General Motors. The latter needs to know something about finance, probably something about team building, and possibly a little about cars, but everything else can be delegated to skilled and experienced subordinates provided you wear a suit and can play the company's internal politics. That CEO has to stay focused on the company's stock price; everything else is really secondary. But the CEO of a start-up has to be all things: leader, story teller, finance expert, accounting expert, product expert, marketing expert, sales expert, defender of the culture, and expert in everything else, despite typically being young and having limited experience. There is nobody to delegate to. At the same time you have to be ready to clean toilets (thanks, Scott!), make coffee, do the weekly Costco run, stop in at Staples on the way back, mollify unhappy bankers, schmooze customers, update the cash flow spreadsheet, correct the grammatical errors on the website, go without salary (again) so that you can make payroll, and try -- unsuccessfully, usually -- to get a decent night's sleep. And then, if you become one of the 1-in-100 ventures that succeeds, you have to pay ludicrous taxes and constantly fend off all the Bernie Sanders wannabes who think you are a fat, plutocratic, bastard who got rich on the backs of the poor downtrodden workers.

Then if enabling touch on your screen, is simply to do part of these interactions (click, double click, drag) and still part of that is missing and you would need to come back to your keyboard or touch pad for rest of them? why simply don’t use the touch pad?Switching to new paradigm is more that a new feature: If you want to introduce a new way of human-machine interaction, it is usually more than introducing a new interaction technology. Apple learn this when they decided to design iPhone. There was phones with big touch screens before iPhone, but they did not solved the problem, you need to think everything again and then they have introduced iOS with completely new and never seen before human-machine interfaces. Apple decided to not mix things and keep the MacBook interaction methods as traditional because it doesn’t make sense to do things differently there. Not yet.MacBooks are not convertible laptops: The only reason that make sense for a laptop to have touch screen, is if it is designed to be used as a tablet also when there is no touch pad and keyboard accessible. For example companies like Lenovo, HP, Toshiba have convertible laptops that the screen rotate 360 degrees and if you don’t have the touch screen, you cannot do anything, then it make sense to have it.

In some cases, this can lead to a toxic work environment where employees feel undervalued, overworked, and burned out. Another criticism is that corporate culture can be overly bureaucratic, hierarchical, and slow to adapt to change. This can make it difficult for employees to innovate, take risks, and make decisions quickly, which can stifle creativity and progress. Some people also criticize corporate culture for being too focused on competition and individual achievement, which can lead to a lack of collaboration, trust, and teamwork among employees. It's important to note that not all corporations have the same culture, and there are many companies that prioritize employee well-being, innovation, and collaboration. However, it's essential for companies to be aware of these common criticisms and work to create a positive and supportive work environment for their employees.

Improve your skills, and start finding value bets by reading tried and tested strategies for playing. Every profit strategy consists of three phases. The first, is to learn all the specifics about it. Second, you will have to try the strategy more than once, just because you predict one unsuccessful bet does not mean that you have to start from scratch, and finally: take a chance. We are all well aware that there are no guarantees, and betting tips are no exception to that rule. Just think of these strategies as guides and tips to point you in the right direction. It is up to you, however, to walk that path and end up victorious on the other side with the winners. Whether you win or not depends mostly on your knowledge, skills and confidence when placing your bet. Of course, luck will play a role in the matter as well. My final advice to you, is to switch to professional betting sites only when you are ready. As a beginner, choose only one strategy. And give it a try. If it works well for you, great! But in case the strategy is not working, you can try adjusting it to fit your betting signature.

I often didn’t go when I maybe should’ve because I was too busy or didn’t feel it was all that bad. in the US, I don’t go unless I have to and even then reluctantly because of the unknown costs. It’s an exercise in financial planning as I try to figure out what my copays will be as this varies depending on how I access the system, the deductibles, percent coverage, in Network provider, determining if their affiliated service providers (labs, imaging, physiotherapy) are also in network, whether there are any looming issues with my kids and wife that take priority as we will need to go through the same analysis of financial commitment and affordability. This is no small thing, we are on the hook for a 9000 bill for our sons dental work because the dentist, midway through the treatment opted out of the insurance we have.

I guess I could’ve shopped around but considering I was choking and on my way to the ER that would’ve been a challenge. That was for diagnostics that led to a prescription. I got off easy. Still it’s an unexpected bill that we need to cover. Just to add to the fun, the CT scan identified an issue that needed the attention of a cardiologist. Wow, that was lucky! I got a 2 for 1. I was only then faced with two potentially serious medical issues requiring 2 separate specialists which left me wondering what the potential financial implications could be and whether we could afford them as well as any lost time at work.

I am unsure of the exact reasons behind these tweets, but they often state that North Indians are trying to impose Hindi and that it is killing regional languages There are various reasons that have led to these feelings, as sometimes Hindi is given more prominence than other regional languages. However, I will not delve into these reasons. I understand the animosity towards Hindi, but it's concerning that while hating the language, people have begun to dislike Hindi-speaking individuals, which is a bigger issue. Recently, I came across a video where a North Indian individual removed black stickers which were on the Hindi instructions in Bengaluru metro and recorded it. However, some Kannada organizations threatened him and forced him to apologize. This situation illustrates how Hindi can trigger certain sections of the population. It's unfortunate that the individual was threatened and had to apologize The British once divided and ruled us, but it's disheartening to see that now we are dividing ourselves along these lines ,Hope God gives Sadbuddhi to such people. In my case, I have good number of friends from North India, what I felt was that they’re really sweet, good and kind people. They respect my language, They respect my state, They love my culture and We Reciprocate. actually I met most of them in a virtual library called ‘Study together’ during my exams and we became really good friends and we all converse in Hindi, as they don’t know my language but I know Hindi. (there are other 2 south Indian people in our group) we created a Whatsapp group of our own after the exams and we played scribble, ludo, Dumb charades and many other games during our holidays and also we used to talk continuously for hours together on Google meet. But Not even once did they make us feel bad, inferior, or anything similar nor we made them feel bad because of their language. (In this instance, Hindi brought us together as a group) We Respect them and they respect us back. Ultimately, We all should Learn to CO-EXIST, that’s it.

Perfidy would also apply to wearing your enemy’s uniforms, during battle, or firing upon them, from an ambulance, or med-evac helicopter, marked with a Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Lozenge. The opposite principle is the “Ruse de Guerre”. There is a long tradition of wily opponents using false flags, etc, to lure their enemies into range. Experts in military law seem to generally approve the use of false flags, provided your guys run down the false flag, and raise the proper flag, prior to actually engaging in combat. There is relatively well-known incident from the WW2 Battle of the Bulge where 48 English-speaking German soldiers were issued American uniforms, taken from American POWs, and 12 captured Jeeps, who infiltrated behind American lines. Command of this small group of infiltrators was added to the responsibilities of Otto Skorzeny, Germany’s most famous Commando leader. German military lawyers told Skorzeny wearing American uniforms would not be a war crime, provided they took off those uniforms, and put on German uniforms, before they fired their weapons. An author named Don Holloway wrote a book about this incident. He wrote that Skorzeny, with his practical experience, considered the advice of the German military lawyers to be nonsense. As it turned out, Skorzeny, who was a card-carrying Nazi, did face a war crimes trial over his command of this unit. He was acquitted. His war crimes tribunal agreed that wearing US uniforms was not a war crime, provided those US uniforms were removed and the Germans actually fought wearing German uniforms. Mind you, in practice, it seems Skorzeny was correct. Three of the German infiltrators were given prompt military trials, at the time, and were promptly executed.

Balanced blood sugar levels contribute to stable energy levels, optimal mood, and reduced risk of complications. Here are some comprehensive strategies to help you control your blood sugar: Healthy Diet: A balanced diet plays a pivotal role in controlling blood sugar levels. Focus on consuming complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (GI), such as whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits like berries. These foods release glucose into the bloodstream gradually, preventing spikes in blood sugar levels. Portion Control: Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating, which can cause blood sugar spikes. Use smaller plates and bowls, and practice mindful eating to gauge your body's hunger and fullness cues.Frequent Meals: Instead of three large meals, consider eating smaller, well-balanced meals throughout the day. This approach helps prevent extreme fluctuations in blood sugar levels and maintains a steady energy supply.Protein-Rich Foods: Include lean proteins like poultry, fish, tofu, and legumes in your meals. Protein slows down the digestion of carbohydrates, leading to a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels.Healthy Fats: Incorporate sources of healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. These fats contribute to satiety and help regulate blood sugar levels. Regular Physical Activity: Engaging in regular exercise has numerous benefits, including improving insulin sensitivity and helping to regulate blood sugar levels. Aim for a mix of aerobic exercises (e.g., walking, cycling) and strength training.Stress Management: Chronic stress can lead to elevated blood sugar levels. Practice stress-reduction techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, and spending time in nature.Adequate Sleep: Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Poor sleep can disrupt insulin sensitivity and lead to imbalances in blood sugar levels. Hydration: Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Dehydration can affect blood sugar concentration and lead to imbalances.Regular Monitoring: If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar levels as recommended by your healthcare provider. This helps you understand how different foods, activities, and lifestyle factors affect your levels, allowing you to make informed decisions. Medication Management: If prescribed medication for diabetes, adhere to your medication regimen as directed by your healthcare provider.Consult a Healthcare Provider: If you have diabetes or are at risk, work closely with a healthcare team. They can provide personalized guidance, monitor your progress, and make adjustments to your treatment plan as needed. Remember, managing blood sugar levels is a lifelong commitment. It requires consistency, self-awareness, and a holistic approach that encompasses nutrition, physical activity, stress management, and medical care. By making informed choices and adopting these strategies, you can take control of your blood sugar levels and promote overall well-being.

USUALLY If we are going for effectivity aka Power × Time for total energy per moment. Then USUALLY Gamma Ray bursts are better. Furthermore they spread the energy a lil more evenly hence how it usually is the better choice. BUT If we allow for longer time periods Quasars output vastly more energy via outputting there Gravitational Energy within the Angular Momentum and in turn releasing it via Friction with a approximately 6 — 42% Energy to mass ratio [LINKED_TEXT: Efficient Extraction of Energy Using a Black HoleEfficient Extraction of Energy Using a Black Hole Warren Morningstar December 18, 2017 Submitted as coursework for PH240 , Stanford University, Fall 2016 Fig. 1: Artist conception of a black hole accreting from a companion star. The gas being stripped off the stellar companion forms an accretion disk around the black hole. (Source: Wikimedia Commons ) Although this may be almost too far in the future to even consider, eventually the energy needs of humanity may vastly exceed the capabilities that we can extract from things such as fossil fuels. In this situation we will need to turn to alternative energy sources. Solar energy is an obvious candidate because it will allow us to harness the energy naturally freed from thermonuclear reactions in the sun. Alternatively, fusion itself when it is realized will be lucrative and should prove able to provide a substantial source of energy. However there still might come a point where fusion itself will not be able to be conducted on a large enough scale to fully satisfy our energy needs. Notably, even though the efficiency of fusion vastly exceeds that of fossil fuels by roughly a factor of ten thousand (due to the much larger energy stored in nuclear bonds rather than chemical bonds), the total energy liberated in turning hydrogen into iron is roughly 8 MeV/nucleon. [1] Given that a proton or neutron has a total energy of roughly 1 GeV, this amounts to a total efficiency of 0.8 percent of the rest mass energy. In other words, for a lot of fuel, this provides a relatively small amount of energy. Although fusion is often considered to be the best form of energy production, it is surprisingly not the most efficient means that exists in the universe. Several alternative methods of energy production exist in theory that are able to produce a larger yield of energy for a smaller input of fuel. In the text that follows I will describe one of these methods. Interestingly, it involves a black hole. Thus these methods are attainable only in science fiction at the moment, and are unlikely to be realized in the lifetime of anyone that is reading. Accretion When a black hole siphons gas off of a star (usually one that is orbiting a black hole, as illustrated in Fig. 1), but it can also be fed by a wind from a massive star), the gas has angular momentum that keeps it from being immediately fed into the black hole. This gas forms into an accretion disk that orbits the black hole. Viscous dissipation in the accretion disk heats up the gas to millions of Kelvin, producing substantial amounts of radiation (mostly X-rays). This radiation escapes the gravitational pull of the black hole and thus the energy is liberated from its gravitational bonds. Where does this energy come from? It comes from gravitational binding energy. In general, binding energy is the energy that is nehttp://large.stanford.edu/courses/2016/ph240/morningstar2/] [URL: http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2016/ph240/morningstar2/]Aaaand this is ignoring Ergosphere Frame Dragging which can extract energy via the Penrose process!

Aaaaand All this would do, is make the black hole shrink faster (aka give the energy to Superman faster). Anyways… Technically speaking this just means Iff we give Superman a Green Lantern ring like the one Superman) Prime One million has, have him sundip beforehand and go into a meditative Torquasm Vo state to full on contain the black hole in a self reflecting controlled black hole bomb Dyson sphere setup using the energy constructs with the ring (containing the energy for max Effeciency full on Kyle Rainer style). [LINKED_TEXT: Black hole bomb - WikipediaA black hole bomb is the name given to a physical effect utilizing how a bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole can be amplified through superradiant scattering . If the amplified field is reflected back towards the black hole, the amplification can be repeated, leading to a run-away growth of the field, i.e. an explosion. One way this reflection could be realized in nature is if the bosonic field has mass. The mass of the field can then cause the amplified modes to be trapped around the black hole, leading to an endless cycle of self-amplification. The mechanism by which the black hole bomb functions is called superradiant instability . It can also refer to one such method of creating such a runaway effect, a Penrose sphere with no means for energy to passively escape. The idea that angular momentum and energy may be transferred from a rotating black hole to a particle being scattered by it was proposed by Roger Penrose in 1971. The first discussion of a runaway effect, the black hole bomb, was explored by W. H. Press and S. A. Teukolsky in 1972. [1] If such an effect were to spontaneously occur, it may point to new physics beyond the Standard Model, and showing that black holes have \\"hair\\", as pointed out by a paper from 2017, by William E.

Given the Theoretically rediculously high efficiency of extraction. Then he can potentially gain appromately: 1.7975104e+56 Joules outta this altho admittedly he probs is gonna have to wait for like 10^80 years haha!

This is do-able cause it comes from BOTH the Black Hole and the collective sum of the materials around it (remember the materials around it reinforces the magnetic field)! This Means IF we take for example Ton 618 it's theoretical beam output value if Superman decided to fly into the beam he would get smacked with 1.6105692e+58 Joules of Energy practically instantly (if we assume optimal spin rates at the particular given moment in time and etc… remember it's pretty Chaotic sooo he might have to wait for about a couple of minutes for the Metaphorical stars to align for something decently close to this best case scenario haha.

THEN This is the ONLY time a Hypernova aka a Gamma Ray Burst will be more reliable and the better choice! This is a VERY particular situation tho. 2/3 Generalized Situations Agree with a Quasar tho. A Quasar is the best choice for Superman when it comes to Raw energy outputs! Ight time to crash my app posting a single image LOL: {Edited in train of thought: Technically speaking if we have Ultraman or something (aka a evil Superman) you can bypass generalized scenario 3 with the Black Hole bomb. Given the black hole bombs shell strength determines total explosion energy, and given the OP nature of Lantern rings and Superman lvl plot armor. Buuut, This would technically fry all life out of existence in an entire galaxy and maybe a local group from the explosion over hundreds of millions of years as the light travels and it also might require some time manipulation magic to. MEH Boooooring! If all life nearby is wiped Ultraman has less people to torture which I don't think he would be fond of (unless it's REDICULOUSLY far away from earth like billions of light years). Furthermore given it requires modifying the Antecedent of the original question and potentially also requires some additional help via at least a item, it's more like a Half Point in favor, aaaand I'm not gonna half ass it. I also forgot to mention you can combine the black hole bomb with the Quasar jet scenario to suck the rotational energy out of the center of an entire galaxy like a leech using the Black Hole to Practically Anchor ⚓ into the Galaxies Central Magnetic field (Magnetic fields are a result of angular momentum of individual Particles which is known as “Spin\\", causing added together magnetic dipoles btw, hence the mechanism. Look up “The Gyromagnetic Effect\\" for info on this specific mechanism). Buuuuut, Then the Dark Matter + Deceleration would create a high chance of a bunch of gravitational slingshots aka it would fling apart the center of the Galaxy. Buuut ONCE AGAIN This would be presupposing a Evil Superman modifying the Antecedent. Sooo, Technically speaking. If you consider ALL scenarios including modifying the Antecedent. It is a 3/4 win for the Quasar. Buuuuut I ain't that type of guy sooooo Imma just keep it a 2/3 win!}"},{"instruction":"w do we plan to build a Moon base while we can't successfully recreate a moon base on Earth (e.g. Biosphere 2)?","output":"The moon has things like water ice and we dont need it to be completely self-sustaining.

I would seek to be as reasonable and understanding as possible regarding your husbands need to rejuvenate from a fulltime job. BUT mother’s need a big break too. Your job shouldn’t be 24/7 without a break. Your husband needs to take time with the children and help over the weekend in ways that he is able. If he has auto duties and other chores besides his fulltime job, that should be a consideration for him as well. But learn to create time for yourself. Mothers have to purposefully do that at times. Perhaps you need to start trading babysitting time with other moms so you have time out for yourself. Or perhaps you can engage with other mothers for social time, where you all bring your children. Such as meeting at a park and allowing the children to play nearby, while the mothers enjoy conversation. Those things are vital to a mother. I have a sister who is raising her grandson. We’re at retirement age and she still has to work a very demanding job as an attorney. She told me this weekend, “I’m tired of accomodating others all the time. There needs to be choices for me.” That comes from feeling more responsible that we should for others and ignoring our own needs. We need to make time for us as women and often women give to everyone but themselves. You need to set some boundaries and enforce quiet time for your children, if they are old enough to function with that. But you need time out for yourself, where you’re alone out of the home without your children. I would communicate to your husband how much of a need it is. Then start setting some boundaries with your kids and husband and yourself for needed down time for you. Best wishes."},{"instruction":"Why did most propeller planes during WW2 have 1 landing gear at the back and 2 at the front unlike modern day propeller planes?","output":"It was a hold over from earlier plane designs, tricycle gear, takes up space in the nose.

Even if his music isn’t to your taste his personality is very hard to dislike as he always says the right thing and never does anything to hurt anyone. One example of how much of a good person he is is how he likes to stop and take selfies with every single fan waiting for him. The other day in Brazil when there was close to 1000 people waiting for him at the airport he still took photos with every single one of them, even after his long flight. If you would still like to see examples of his good nature I would say to watch one of the many videos on youtube.

Each platform had its own specifications and limitations that influenced the game development process. Some of the software tools that were used by video game developers in the 90s included: - Game engines: These are frameworks that provide basic functionalities such as graphics rendering, physics simulation, sound effects, user interface and input handling. Some of the most influential game engines of the 90s were id Tech (used for Doom and Quake), Unreal Engine (used for Unreal) and Build Engine (used for Duke Nukem 3D). - Programming languages: These are languages that allow developers to write instructions for how the game should behave. Some of the most common programming languages used for video games in the 90s were C (used for Doom, Quake and Super Mario Kart), C++ (used for Unreal), Assembly (used for Wolfenstein 3D) and BASIC (used for Lemmings). - Graphics software: These are programs that allow developers to create and edit images, sprites, textures, models and animations for their games. Some of the most popular graphics software used for video games in the 90s were Photoshop (used for Myst), Deluxe Paint (used for Monkey Island 2) and Autodesk 3D Studio Max (used for Tomb Raider). - Sound software: These are programs that allow developers to create and edit sounds, music and voiceovers for their games.

So file deletion from lest reliable to most reliable: Just deleting file does not help except for to hide it from quick glance. It does not actually delete the data just removed the reference to it. Fairly easy to recover with few hours of training. Protects you form 15–20 min of novice investigation. Can be recovered with public domain (free) software.

This is a little better than above methods, this is the professional secure deletion of confidential business and governmental harddrives usually combined with either shredding or demagnetizing the disks first. This guarantees loss of considerable amount of data but not all. permanent loss of data is defined by loss of material. Like if you ckack the disk into 4 pieces only 1–2mm of the material is lost alongside the crack, but data in large enough chunks can be still read and assembled together. But this laboratory level expert work and might takes months or years.To actually permanently destroy data the disk would need to be vaporized grind into so little pieces that they never could be assembled together and that no piece is large enough that any meaningful data could be recovered from it.

The government of Canada invites skilled people to their country through a points-based system known as Express Entry. This stream was launched in 2015 in order to make the process the most simple and easier way to get a PR Visa before express entry was announced. The Immigration process for Canada enclosed paper works which consumed more time compared with the present (Apply for Express Entry) Express Entry stream. What is Canada Express Entry Express Entry Program is a fast-track immigration system that invites skilled workers of various professions via a points-based system. It is less complex and includes minimal paperwork compared to the conventional process that existed back then. It requires you to score a minimum of 67 points in the predefined points grid as proposed by IRCC which inturn reflects into your CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Although you score 67 in the points grid, it does not guarantee you a Canadian PR. CRS score is the key nomination or inviting factor. The higher the CRS score the faster will be your Express Entry process. How does Express Entry work? A revised immigration program introduced by the IRCC (Immigration Refugees & Citizenship Canada), the Express Entry Stream, assesses your age, skill, employment, experience, and proof of funds to be eligible for an invite to apply for the Canadian PR. Express Entry is a full-on e-process and is completely dependent on your skills and its relevant occupation in demand.https://www.greentreeimmigration.com/express-entry-canada.php] [URL: https://www.greentreeimmigration.com/express-entry-canada.php]"},{"instruction":"w did Von Manstein manage to decisively defeat the Soviets at the Third Battle of Kharkov after the Soviets had won such a great victory at Stalingrad?","output":"I think the ‘how’ here doesn’t ask about Manstein’s methodology, the literals of how exactly he won the Third Battle of Kharkov(although if the reader is interested in that, I have written [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #mfqfC][LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #GILkw] about the subject), but about how he could do it after the Stalingrad catastrophe. In the Battle of Stalingrad, Germans lost their 6th Army. When it was going in for Fall Blau, in the summer of 1942, this is how the Army Group South looked: There’s no less than six German field armies in that bunch, enough separate corps to make a seventh, as well as a Hungarian army and by the time Germans made it to Stalingrad there’s going to be an Italian and two Romanian ones as well. There’s also the Army Group Center: And North: When they embarked on the Blau adventure, Germany had twelve field armies in the Eastern Front. The Sixth wasn’t even the strongest of the lot. Losing one of them and a whole slew of Italians, Hungarians and Romanians was a very severe blow, and a significant Soviet victory, but significant victories don’t mean your enemy is beyond the capability to resist or fight back.

At that time his alleged cruelty was not at all exceptional. XVth century Europe was a rather cruel place, there are several other ways to impale people documented from the West to the East besides sticking people on poles. What he actually managed to do is not really known from direct sources. His fame came from publications financed by the Transylvanian Saxon cities which had a tax dispute go bad and were raided (that happened often later and no other prince of Wallachia or Moldavia got such a bad PR): they made him to be a murderous tyrant killing for the pleasure of killing. Then there were Russian authors who took over the Saxon story but spun it in the other direction and made him a stern leader dealing a lot of regrettable but necessary violence to lawbreakers. In the XIXth century those two narratives came back into circulation. The history curricula was moving away from counting Roman emperors and deploring the fall of Rome (that is Constantinople, the New Rome) to counting local princes and exalting more recent martial virtues. Among those princes Vlad III was the least boring so he became important despite having only one or maybe two victorious battles in his portfolio. Radu VIII (“of Afumați”) should be a lot more famous than Vlad III, he was in office about the same length of time but fought 20 separate battles , had a documented reign of terror and actually managed to beat off a serious attempt to move Wallachia from the “Dar al-Ahd”, which means “house of the armistice”, to “Dar al-Islam”, that is to turn Wallachia into an Ottoman province. Unfortunately he had in his name “Afumați”, that is “Smoked”, which also means “drunk”, while Vlad III was “Dracula”, “the son of the Devil/Dragon”, so Vlad III won the popularity contest between the two."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Its like you're in your own territory & the king is ruling, the same way confident people are"},{"instruction":"What comes after video game graphics get as realistic as possible?","output":"i hope and pray that when one day video game graphics will be maxed out that they will finally start developping some new game concepts or they finally will begin to implement proper AI."},{"instruction":"What do teenagers wish adults understood?","output":"When you’re yelling at them “why they don’t understand what you’re saying” as they are clearly upset and on edge, they are NOT GOING TO LISTEN. It’s not being harsh. It’s true. If you’re yelling at them to “understand you” or to “listen to you,” that’s the last thing they’re going to do. Adults can’t expect teens to believe them when they’re yelling “I WAS YOUR AGE ONCE AND I NEVER DID [insert completely and utterly inexcusable action here]. WHY CAN’T YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HARD THIS IS FOR ME? WHY DON’T YOU TALK TO ME ANYMORE? WHY WON’T YOU LISTEN TO ME?” Uhh…. because you do that? If you’re an adult and you’re yelling at a teen to “listen and understand and talk to you,” they’re not going to do that because they honest to god don’t understand why you’re yelling at them so much over something that they believe is small. Also, would you listen to someone to yelling at you for seemingly no reason? No. Would you talk to someone when anytime you open you’re mouth they just respond with more yelling? No. Adults will sometimes say “I’m you’re [teacher, parent, etc], not you’re friend. You should treat me with respect.” Why though? Why should a teen treat you with respect when you’re demanding it? That’s not going to earn anyone’s respect. If that makes them say they respect you, that’s not respect, that’s pity, which can disappear at any moment. In short, don’t yell at a teen and demand things of them. It’ll only agitate the situation more and make them spiteful towards you.

What do you think?"},{"instruction":"What is the difference between lucid dreaming and astral projection?","output":"What is the difference between lucid dreaming and astral projection? The purpose of meditation is to commune with God. True devotees do not seek psychic powers such as astral projection which would be a serious digression from the search for God. Some people who think that they are astral projecting are really hallucinating. Astral projection occurs when one leaves the physical body. They, their soul, is still clothed in the astral body and travels, directed by their will, from place to place. This is what happens at death. We go to the astral world clothed in our astral body. Our material world is composed of electrons whereas the astral world is made of a finer energy which Paramhansa Yogananda called lifetrons. The astral body does not need food, air to breath, or sleep. Dreams are projected on the screen of the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind never sleeps, in the day it makes memory records for the conscious mind and in sleep it continues to regulate the heart, lungs and other organs of the body. “In sleep the life energy [prana] withdraws from the sensory nerves, and partially from the heart, and accumulates in the brain.” “Memories stored in the subconscious mind become vivified and magnified by the accumulated life energy in the brain during the deep relaxation of sleep.” “These memories by strange combinations produce different kinds of motion pictures, which are then projected on the screen of the subconsciousness.” “Most dreams are purely imaginary, meaningless permutations and combinations of unrelated ideas. Hense giving too much importance to dreams is foolishness.” “The reason one does not remember dreams is that the process of awakening withdraws the life energy from the subconscious mind, where the dream has been going on, and employs the life energy to vivify only the waking consciousness of the brain.” “Dreams can be consciously induced by relaxing and visualizing what you want to dream about, while looking intently at the point between the eyebrows. But the relaxation of your body must be deep.” “It is better not to dream unintentionally at all, but to be able to produce at will true dreams and visions.” “Why be imposed upon by dreams?” “When dreams come too often, you should meditate and calm yourself; and then this condition will disappear. The calmer you become, the less you will dream.” “In meditation many students on the spiritual path, striving to go from the conscious to the superconscious state, become sidetracked in the subconscious. The get caught in the movieland of hallucinations, conscious dreams, and become satisfied.” “Do not lose yourself in the movieland of mentally fabricated hallucinations or dreams.” “Hallucinations are imaginary subconscious projections, like ordinary dreams, and have no reality or meaning.” “Meditation is the greatest way of resurrecting your soul from the bondage of the body and from the shackles of all your trials.” - Paramhansa Yogananda See: Yogananda org or Ananda org"},{"instruction":"Does eating shark cartilage prevent cancer?","output":"It may, but if you are genetically predisposed to cancer, no amount of eating wacky things like this, which are usually very expensive, is going to prevent it. The best thing to prevent cancer is to stay away from unhealthy foods, but more importantly, away from drugs and alcohol, including smoking. Diet is less important than is staying away from harmful substances, including exposure to chemicals and radiation. Funny story, I knew a lady who drank lots of carrot juice in her younger years, thinking that once she got older, it would help maintain her eyesight, as her parents and siblings all had eye trouble. It didn’t do her any good. By about age 75, she was not seeing well and by the time she was 80, she was legally blind. I also had a friend who was 34, a healthy non-smoker, who died of lung cancer.

Unhappy, we are, with the world and with ourselves as well. And the main reason for our unhappiness is the expectation from the world. This new generation and especially the millennials and Gen Z are those who like to live life king size. They wish to earn a lot of money and they also wish to spend a lot of money on food, partying, and living a lavish lifestyle. Hardly do they care that the money they learned to spend from a very young age was earned by their parents who were hard workers and never partied much. If their parents too would had started spending money lavishly and never cared about the future of their children, the present generation would not have been so happy (and unhappy at the same time). Our generation actually has a lot of expectations from the world. They expect their parents to accept everything they want, they expect their life partners to agree with them in everything they say, they expect their bosses to offer them a space right beside their cabin and they expect other lots of things from other people as well. They forget that life does not work on these expectations and the more you expect from people, the unhappier you are. The generation is very generous, but they do not show their generosity unless they get something beneficial out of it. And in reality, you can only be happy when you are doing what you always wanted to do, or being generous towards people without expecting anything in return. So the present generation of people will definitely be happy when they stop expecting something to happen and start working for something to happen.

The thing about proteins in general is that there are complete and incomplete sources of proteins. This is based on the 9 essential amino acids present in them which are: HistidineIsoleucineLeucineLysineMethioninePhenylalanineThreonineTryptophanValine In the absence of some of these amino acids, the amino acids profile is incomplete and hence we fail to get all essential benefits of protein. It is observed that non-vegetarian sources of foods normally have all of these amino acids in them, but individual sources of veg protein have the amino acid named Methionine absent in them. But still, by coupling it with the right sources of veg foods, vegetarians can also consume complete sources of proteins and that too without splurging on whey protein powders.

I don’t know a lot about him.","output":"Here are a few of his quotes that I find of value: This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness. Self-centeredness inhibits our love for others, and we are all afflicted by it to one degree or another. For true happiness to come about, we need a calm mind, and such peace of mind is brought about only by a compassionate attitude. How can we develop this attitude? Obviously, it is not enough for us simply to believe that compassion is important and to think about how nice it is! We need to make a concerted effort to develop it; we must use all the events of our daily life to transform our thoughts and behavior. Our greatest enemy is to consider ourselves more important than others, which leads us and others to certain ruin. From this attachment to “I” arises all the harm, fear, and suffering in this world. Personally, I find his writings insightful and inspirational.

Wildfires are just that they are wild, and you can not put them out with a hose or even a bulldozer, although both implements are often necessary for the control of a wildfire. A blaze that encompasses an area of a thousand or more acres is not easily put out, it must be controlled and allowed to burn out by itself. Three things are necessary for a fire to exist: fuel, heat, and oxygen, if you remove any of those three the fire will go out. When you throw a pitcher of water on a fire in a trash can you are removing the heat, when you put a tight fitting lid on a grease fire in a pan on the stove you are removing the oxygen and the fire goes out, and if you tear up the ground around a grass fire so that it has nothing left to burn you have removed the fuel. That is how most wildfires are put out, or allowed to burn out. The fuel in the direction that the fire is burning is either removed or limited by bulldozing, cutting down and removing trees, or creating a backfire so that there is nothing left to burn, the creation of firebreaks is another tool used by the wildfire firefighter. Just two weeks we had a wildfire here not five miles from where I live. My buddy called in a report of a fire that morning at 0730 in the morning as we were going coyote hunting. When we returned five hours later you could barely see the road because of all the smoke. We had high winds that made it even harder for the fire crews to contain the fire. Wind will blow glowing cinders at least two miles ahead of a fire, this spreads the fire at an alarming rate. The two weeks of high winds kept the fire from being fully contained (95% containment as of this date), and it has burned over 20,000 acres of land with a loss of 35 homes. Wildfires also will create their wind. When a fire gets large enough the rise of the heated air causes all of the air around the fire to rush inwards towards the center of the fire. Firefighters will often take advantage of this phenomenon to start “backfires” that will burn in towards the fire limiting how much fuel the fire has to burn. In populated areas, fire crews often have to “steer” the fire away from homes and other structures. This “steering” is done with the aid of backfires, water drops, and firebreaks in an attempt to keep the fire out of populated areas, but adverse weather can complicate matters immensely. High winds and a rapidly advancing fire line mean that putting a crew in the path of such a fire is a death sentence for them. Wildfires cause so much destruction before containment because they are just like their name, WILD."},{"instruction":"Why did Melinda Gates say choosing to divorce Bill was her 'lowest moment?","output":"It was her lowest moment in her life because it was her realzing the emptiness of being oneself and the nonsense of all the achievements of life."},{"instruction":"Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous than Pakistan?","output":"Getting its liberation from East Pakistan in the year 1971, Bangladesh became an independent nation. It’s pretty much evident that Bangladesh was way behind Pakistan as Pakistan became independent in the year 1947. But it didn’t hold Bangladesh from lagging behind Pakistan and creating dominance globally. At present Bangladesh has set a benchmark for itself and got more advanced in many fields than Pakistan. I'm going to inform you about Bangladesh's supremacy over Pakistan today- ● The Rise in GDP GDP is essential because it informs about the size of the economy and indicates the general rate of the economy. Although Bangladesh became independent after 25 years of Pakistan today its GDP is more than Pakistan's. In the year 2021, Pakistan’s GDP was 348.3 billion USD whereas Bangladesh had a GDP of 416.3 billion USD. ● Gender Equality In terms of Gender equality Pakistan ranked 153 out of 156 countries according to the “Global Gender Gap Report 2021.” Hence Pakistan at present ranks among the worst countries in the world in terms of gender. On the other hand, Bangladesh ranks 71 and is one the most gender-equal country among South Asian nations. ● Total Reserves The biggest irony is that although Pakistan’s financial system is older than Bangladesh its total reserve is 8.4 billion USD. Whereas Bangladesh holds a total wealth reserve of 28.4 billion USD. These are some of the factors that make Bangladesh more powerful and prosperous economically and as a people’s nation."},{"instruction":"Will SteamValve ever make another game again?

Not remotely similar. Argentina, a big fish in a small pond, invaded a small British Overseas Territory to the annoyance of its inhabitants, and then began terrorising those inhabitants. Britain showed them that they were maybe a big fish in a small pond but only a very small fish in a big pond. Putin is invading a large country, without provocation, and clearly from the videos we see deliberately, repeat deliberately killing civilians. The “justifications” Putin gives for this wouldn’t survive scrutiny by a 12 year old. Putin’s stock is at an all-time low. The Rouble is at an all-time low.

Alcohol can make you sick if you drink too much, or completely alter your personality. Alcohol can also affect your mobility and common sense. Marijuana is almost the exact opposite. It doesn’t really make you sick - maybe just hungry or sleepy, or giggly or inspired. Marijuana can’t alter your personality. You’ll still be very much you. Marijuana does not affect your mobility in the way alcohol does. Alcohol you could be stumbling all over the place or knocking things over. Marijuana does not have much affect on your mobility but if so, it might just make you move a little slower- as if you’re in a peaceful state. Marijuana was only illegal because they did not know how to capitalize off of it. Now that they do, it’s legal in some states and more to come!

It was like witnessing a David and Goliath moment in the corporate landscape. The startup, let's call them \\"TechGenius,\\" had developed an innovative technology that had the potential to disrupt the market. However, they lacked the resources, distribution channels, and credibility that a big player in the industry could offer. To make matters more challenging, the industry giant, \\"MegaCorp,\\" had previously shown little interest in partnering with smaller companies. But TechGenius's CEO, a visionary and tenacious leader, devised a brilliant strategy. Instead of approaching MegaCorp with a traditional pitch, they did something unexpected. TechGenius first focused on building an impressive portfolio of pilot projects with other notable companies and showcased the tangible results and positive feedback they had received. Next, they subtly leaked some strategic information about these successful pilots to the media, sparking curiosity and speculation within the industry. As rumors swirled about TechGenius's potential to disrupt the market, MegaCorp's interest was piqued. With MegaCorp's attention captured, TechGenius made their bold move. They sent personalized letters to key executives at MegaCorp, highlighting the challenges the industry was facing and the opportunities for growth and innovation that their technology could provide. They refrained from directly asking for a partnership but expressed their openness to explore potential collaborations. This strategic approach worked like a charm. MegaCorp, afraid of missing out on a game-changing opportunity, initiated talks with TechGenius. Negotiations were intense, but TechGenius's CEO had done their homework and came to the table well-prepared. They demonstrated a clear understanding of MegaCorp's pain points and showed how their technology could provide real solutions. In the end, MegaCorp saw the potential in TechGenius and decided to enter into a partnership rather than compete against them. The deal proved to be a win-win for both companies, as TechGenius gained the resources and credibility they needed to scale their technology, while MegaCorp secured a competitive edge in the market. This maneuver was a masterclass in strategic thinking, persistence, and the art of leveraging opportunities. It showcased that even the smallest players can outmaneuver giants in the business world with the right combination of innovation, perseverance, and calculated risk-taking."},{"instruction":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","output":"Probably because there are.

For that, I have a nice hinging fixture over the island. That has another five bulbs, each 75 watts. Add another 375 watts. Now, the pot lights don’t reach under the cabinets. Add another 10 xenon puck lights, 25 watts per. Another 250 watts. But wait! There’s more! The range hood has nice 50 watt halogen downlights. Add another 200 watts. So, we are talking 1000 + 375 + 250 + 200, or 1925 watts of lighting. In 300 square feet, that’s about 6 watts per square foot. And I think that’s just right for a kitchen.

While filming the season three episode \\"The Night of the Fugitives,\\" Conrad was hospitalized after a stunt in which he dove from the top of a saloon staircase, lost his grip on a chandelier, fell 12 feet, and landed on his head. Conrad said that he didn't chalk up properly and ended up with a fractured skull. As a result, Conrad was in intensive care for 72 hours, with a six-inch lineal fracture of the skull and a high temporal concussion. Because of this, production of the series ended two weeks early while Conrad spent weeks in the hospital and had suffered recurring dizziness. Fortunately, the episode was eventually completed and aired during the fourth season, with footage of the fall left in. Afterwards, producers (and Conrad himself) insisted he be doubled for the dangerous stunts, but he still participated in fight scenes. Conrad also decided to make season four the last one for “The Wild, Wild West.” And although this was not a serious injury, co-star Ross Martin’s heart attack during the final season of the show was enough to have Martin written out of several episodes. The storyline was then written to say that Martin’s character, Artemus Gordon, was back in Washington, working for President Grant on assignment. Producers then gave Conrad’s character James West, a new partner for four episodes, bringing in Charles Aidman as Agent Jeremy Pike for those episodes. They also had some other special-guest partners for Conrad that season including Alan Hale Jr. (Skipper on “Gilligan’s Island”), British actor John Williams (who also was a temporary replacement for Sebastian Cabot as Mr. French in “Family Affair”) and for two episodes, William Schallert (Patty Duke’s dad on “The Patty Duke Show”).

Even though studies show at least 10 billion a year is waste or fraud. They also cut corporate taxes back in the Bush II regime and analysis of those cuts show no “trickle down” or any benefit to anyone other than the corporations, whose profits went up as a result. Those same corporations then had hard times due to the big mortgage brokering mess where they all tried to cash in on big that did not happen. So raise the corporate taxes back up where they should be, or just eliminate corporate taxes and make anyone who owns shares pay taxes on their gains each year-not just when they sell. That of course won’t happen. But would help with deficit spending. Removing many foreign military bases would save billions and billions. We have a military presence in 100 countries. WHY?

Yes, there could be some cases where a crime or firing (for cause) was involved that the new employer may need to know about. Using oblique references can backfire on you and lead to the prospective employer to misinterpret the comment. Remember the game of telephone; what’s said by one person can morph significantly down the line. If something about the candidate is that egregious that you need to mention it, it’s best to state it clearly - though again, refer to the first paragraph above. It’s better to tell the candidate that you probably would not be the best person to write a reference. Then go consult your HR rep for advice."},{"instruction":"What are the best baby skin care products?","output":"Word of mouth will not always be true.

George just couldn’t go back to sleep after the annoying sex he had moments ago with his wife, Mitchell. He instead went to the living room, made a drink for himself and switched on the TV. Any husband would be upset to learn that his wife is in love with someone else. He was suspicious of her acts but never in his wildest of dreams he had thought that situation could be this much worse. His annoyance crossed the threshold when he saw the man responsible for everything on one of the channels. He switched multiple channels but still couldn’t escape Adam Smith’s flawless face and charming smile, that’s exactly how his wife would describe him. It was his birthday and the same being featured on every channel. George made another drink for himself. The bastard had kissed Mitchell more often than her own husband. She would even strip off her clothes to feast his eyes with her curves in George’s absence. Although George had known all this he would stay quiet for he wanted his wife herself to confess everything about her lover, but that never happened. “Adam turns forty tonight”, she had said which immediately pissed off her husband. He felt as if Smith’s birthday pleased his wife even more than sex and thus had walked out of the bedroom. Adam Smith’s smile appeared to mock George from within the TV. He had lost his head as he grabbed the knife from the fruit basket placed on the dining table. Had Adam been there in front of him, George would have slaughtered him on his birthday. But since it was his wife who seemed more excited about everything, she deserved the lesson to be taught first. After all she had chosen her lover over her husband. He got up from his chair and walked towards his bedroom. His wife lay naked in the blanket on the bed. He sneaked towards her side of the bed with the knife in his hand. There was just enough light for him to see her face. He wondered whether he should do it and thought hard to find any reason which would prevent the same. He couldn’t find one. He then cautiously started to scratch the knife on the wall beside her wife. Its sound, however, woke up Mitchell. “Honey, what are you doing?” she said as she switched on the lamp. “Saving our marriage” he said. “And how would peeling Adam Smith’s picture off the wall save our marriage?” “At least you would be spared from sharing your lips with this bloody picture” “George, are you jealous of this picture?” Mitchell smiled. “I am just jealous of the bastard who has turned my wife into a fanatic, else why would she utter his name while having sex with her husband” he said. “Honey, I must have mentioned it casually.” “Then it certainly wasn’t the right time for you to be casual” he said. “Why don’t we just forget everything and start from where we had left” she said as she took hold of his hand. “What do you mean?” “You know what I mean George, don’t you?” she kicked off the blanket with her feet to flaunt her curves, this time however for her husband. George threw away the knife and jumped into the bed as Mitchell’s lover survived on the wall yet again for another day."},{"instruction":"there any truth to what QAnon is saying?","output":"No."},{"instruction":"What are some less known facts about Mars?","output":"In Scotland it would be deep fried"},{"instruction":"What are some less known facts about Mars?","output":"13 Interesting Facts About Mars That Will Amaze You Facts about Mars.

Olympia: Biggest Mountain of the Solar System The biggest mountain out of all planets is on Mars. The name of that mountain is Olympia. Its height is 21 Km, and it is 600 Km long. But we know the earth’s highest peak is Mount Everest. It is 8848 meters high. 3. Phobos: Closest Natural Satellite to Their Host of the Solar System There are two moons of Mars, which are Phobos and Deimos. Out of the all satellite of our solar system, not even a single satellite is orbiting to their host so close, like Phobos. The orbit of Phobos is only 6000 kilometers away from the surface of Mars.[Distance between earth and moon is 384,400 km] The average diameter of this moon is 22.2 kilometers. It completes its one round around the red planet in 7 hours 39 minutes. 4. Deimos: The Smallest Moon of the Solar System It is the smallest moon in our solar system. The average diameter of it is 12.6 kilometers. It completes its one round around the red planet in 30 hours. Its orbiting time is more than the single day of the red planet. The surface area of it is 483 Km². It is so small that, It looks like a star from the surface of the red planet; like stars look from the surface of our earth. Deimos is orbiting from the red planet much far away; it is approximately 20069 Km away from the surface of the mars. 5. Dry Ocean on the Surface of Mars It was assumed that when Mars was the geological active there was a big ocean on mars that covered the 17% of the surface of Mars.

Oxygen on Mars Oxygen on Mars is only 0.13% of the total gases, and CO2 is 95.32%. However, on the earth, we know that there is 21% oxygen which is sufficient for a human being. Currently, atmospheric composition on mars is Carbon dioxide 95.32% Nitrogen 2.7% Argon 1.6% Oxygen 0.13% Carbon monoxide 0.08% However, researches are going on, scientists are working on such types of microbes, by which they can convert CO2 to oxygen. So that humans can live there in the future. 7. Are Seasons Changes Take Place On Mars, Like Earth? The axis of rotation of the earth tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees away from the vertical. Due to this tilt of the earth, seasons changes take place on earth. The axis of rotation of Mars also tilted at an angle of 25 degrees [Nearly Equal to Earth] away from vertical. Due to this tilt of the Mars, seasons changes also take place on Mars, like earth.[Spring, Winter, Fall, summer] But seasons of mars are longer than the seasons on earth because of the long length of the year. 8.

If you are already interested in those people ... We do not talk about the caricatures like Charles, pussy-tampon of Camilla (according to his own words), the great and passionate hunter. You have seen at least on TV that Charles hates and despises journalists and all of you. 1 Queen Elizabeth II, and 2 Diana (As good as tolerance and understanding are, equally reprehensible is idiocy.) 1 Elizabeth II has explained to her family members what her predecessors explained to her: \\"We are a company, and the business must go on and prosper.\\" (From one, unknown to me, Reiner Selbmann, recalled the words of the Queen Mum (quote): \\"Diplomacy means dividing the cake so that the others are satisfied with the crumbs.\\") This applies also to all royal houses in the world. The Queen, the Royal Guard, and the GB military, the pacifists. Thanks to their Great Army they could plunder, enslave, colonize, murder, and spread every evil over half the world. And when they cannot kill people, they go hunting and murder innocent animals. That is murder, because they do it out of the desire to kill. Women also go along with it. Some even get orgasms when they see the blood flowing out. Animals have all the feelings like them, a hard life in the wild (weather etc.), have to feed their young, raise them, protect them from predators, etc. And although they have not harmed the abominations, they go murdering them, the brutal and heartless abominations - they do it in herds accompanied by singing and music. We will remember Elizabeth as a spineless and characterless hypocrite who grudgingly bowed to a dead whore - only in the interest of maintaining privileges and power. Before a whore, who far from her own children (who needed their mother very much in their age of that time) in a far country and in luxury hostels soul-quietly and full of joy, up to her death, has amused herself with Dodi. If she had periodically enjoyed herself with a horse groom, riding teacher, tennis teacher, etc. as she used to do (they all rode her), it would be half as bad, she would have been near her children and could see them sometimes. Even a she-wolf does not leave her young for so long while they have not yet become independent - unless for a short time because of food procurement. Most earthlings liked or even loved that whore (may not misunderstand me the so-called prostitutes = honest + valuable workers) because they are similar or equal to her/ Diana in character. The so-called prostitutes/ sex workers etc. fulfill an important function in the society by hard and thankless/ not appreciated work, and thanks to them some crimes are not committed. Your royal families, however, usually live as parasites from your hard-earned money/ paid taxes - in cosmic luxury. Not only the noblest clothes, food, and jewelry, but also all kinds of \\"slaves\\" who wash, clean, cook, and do everything for them in their magnificent castles and residences. Not only bicycles and cars of all kinds, but also boats, yachts, airplanes ... simply everything that comes into their megalomaniac mind (from your tax money). All acquaintances, relatives, colleagues, friends, and the whole world ... all have known where and with whom their beloved mother, Diana, was hanging around. This must have been terrible for the young boys (if not still today). \\"The (rotten) queen of the (rotten) hearts.\\" All abominations. The \\"great\\" queen of a \\"great\\" state has bowed down to such a carcass. That is the true prostitution; the bowing before a true and heartless prostitute. ________________ 2 Diana was an uneducated, ignorant, unrighteous, unfaithful, unbelieving = UNCHRISTIAN whore - who declared herself as Christian. If she didn't declare herself so, it would be only half as bad/ reprehensible. And the highest church leaders gave her all the honors and \\"wishes\\" to enter into paradise. That's how Christian the churches and church leaders are (not just in GB). A believer/ Christian is not allowed to dwell near such persons. He does not hate them, he just must not and does not want to have anything to do with them. That's how it is in this world of darkness, hypocrisy, lying, cheating, deception, self-deception, and the like. \\"The (rotten) queen of the (rotten) hearts.\\" All abominations. That is today's \\"modern\\" world of idiocy, out of all bounds, where abused freedoms have led to animalism. Your brothers and sisters, chimpanzees, bonobos & Co. send you their regards :( PS: \\"Your\\" means \\"most/ majority\\", of course, not all.

While it’s been a hard (and long) journey of uncovering and resolving these issues, it’s been an overwhelming positive experience of growth. A few things that helped me were: -Journaling: It’s a way where I can be totally vulnerable (and not have to put on a happy face to another person). Often, I have trouble understanding my sad/troubled/negative emotions and expressing them in day to day life because I try to focus on positive emotions when I’m around other people and even by myself. Journaling allows me to see my emotions, understand what it is that’s not right in my life, and try to create a plan of fixing that problem. Make sure to be consistent—journal every day, and try to do it after you’ve experienced something that triggers/upsets you. -Creative outlet: (painting, art, cooking, yoga, music, photography, ANYTHING) Something that led to me trying to heal past problems was this feeling of being stifled—that I had so much going on in my mind but I didn’t have an outlet to express these emotions. I think a lot of INFJ’s are very artistic and have this desire to create, and if it isn’t expressed, life feels very off. Find something you’re interested in, that makes you feel free and like you’re able to express yourself.

Better to have a quiet place, where it is you and your word processor talking along with some of your valuable and relevant books. 4. Have some time to relax, rest and recuperate. Writing a PhD thesis can be taxing to the brain and can cause a lot of stress. You need to participate in “debrief” activities. Taking a walk or going to a gym can be helpful. Or even just listening to good music. 5. Have a friend to help you review, grammar, spelling and sentence construction. They do not have to be technical in your field but just have a sharp eye to spot errors or suggest better phrasing. 6. Limit your social or community engagements during this time. Let your friends know that you are fully engaged. 7. Remember, that your PhD thesis will not be your last best piece of great writing.

After watching Dynasty numerous times throughout my life, I can truly say that this show is my favorite one ever. That would be a good reason why I believe it is the best [LINKED_TEXT: TV series] [URL: https://arshakandriasov.com/blogs/movies-tv/]. Famous for their lavish décor and clothing, Dynasty is more than something esthetically pleasing to the eye for those who want to notice. There are lessons to be learned in the psychology of human behavior. Combine this wealth of knowledge with lessons in kindness, deceit, and a strict, rough business world, and there you have a TV show that truly stands. The difference between movies and shows of the past is they had an ability to show true beauty. Look at the music scoring and the acting performance. John Forsythe and company do an incredible job. The Story Of Dynasty. The story revolves around Blake Carrington and his family. He singlehandedly rose to the top, with several horrible decisions made. Easy to say from my cellphone writing this article. He is shown quite unpleasant in the first shortened season. Because of his horrific acts in the beginning, one can have a distasteful feeling towards Blake. It is very important to try to view the first season as a set up. You see how his character slowly transforms from the second season on till the end. You get to see a person flawed, for sure, but having a true potential (strict and all) to be a good person. His strength lies in battling through numerous obstacles. As you will see, those who try to harm him are no better, but I would say way worse than Blake. So my advice is to watch the first season and try your hardest not to hate him. Hatred. Hate only makes you shortsighted and your vision will miss the good aspects of his life. I would give this advice about everyone. It is truly easy to dismiss anyone on this Earth, because you disagree with him/her. Having hate in your heart, especially to those you have not even met, will make you miss the good that they do. Help people to see a different perspective if you truly know you’re right. Otherwise, observe how things are developing. As a person hopefully evolves, you cannot bring bitterness to your own life by your displeasure about someone. Keep in mind that you could be working on something within yourself that makes you upset, and you are only transferring your own faults to other people. All I am saying, keep an open mind. Due to this factor alone, I can highly recommend Dynasty as the best TV series. Best Acting Combo. The best acting combination in my opinion on this show is Blake’s relationship with his daughter Fallon, played perfectly by Pamela Sue Martin. Her sometimes aloof performance shows depth, because Fallon is a very smart person. Knowing that she has faults of falling in love with the wrong people, she can still make decisions that change an outcome of a situation. John Forsythe’s tenderness and loving work with Pamela really brings a beautiful side to this show. Under their true love for each other, you can tell that both people, under the right situation, have a potential to be great. Constant distraction by haters makes these characters fall into the habit of being stern, in Blake’s case, or aloof, in Fallon’s case. What is the lesson here? No matter who or how many people are bitter about your life, do not change your own self for anybody. If you are kind, be kind. You do not need to be understood by people who are angry or arrogant.

Similarly you have right to buy a healthcare as much as you want and can afford, that does not mean you have a right to get it for free.

For example, when I say phrase “governmnet does not have to build a synagogue for me” I often hear “but the government sends police to protect it”. Sure governmnet does it, but not because it is my right. Not everything that governmnet does is my right. If police presence in my synagogue was my right the police would be stationed there 24x7 and it isn’t, it only shows up on occasion. So, you want to argue for governmnet paying for healthcare?

Gradually increasing calories and incorporating regular exercise can be part of a healthy and sustainable approach to maintaining weight loss. However, it is important to recognize that weight maintenance is an ongoing process and that some weight regain is common. The body has a natural tendency to defend against weight loss and may adjust its metabolism and hormonal responses in response to weight loss. This means that a person may need to continue to make healthy choices and adjust their habits to maintain their weight loss over time. To avoid the yo-yo effect and maintain weight loss, it is important to focus on long-term sustainable changes rather than quick fixes or extreme diets. This may involve making changes to one's diet and physical activity habits, finding social support, managing stress, and addressing any underlying health conditions that may affect weight management.

The various advantages and disadvantages of the scooter over the geared motorcycle are: Advantages: A scooter uses CVT (Continually Variable Transmission), which produces infinite number of gear ratios according to the speed of the engine, without the driver interference. The only thing you have to do is just accelerate and decelerate the vehicle. The CVT will take care of speed reduction ( **Usually gear box is meant for speed reduction).Since there's no manual gear shifting, we don't have a clutch. So, handling will be much easier in traffic. No troubles of sudden engine stop owing to improper engaging of clutch, which people may experience while driving geared motorcycle.Breaking is also easier since you have both the brake levers on the handlebar itself. You can simply rest your legs!Scooters have good maneuverability (Easy steering), because of small mechanical trail (**Trail - The distance between the point of intersection of steering axis with road plane and the point of contact of front tire with the road plane).Scooter has comparatively smaller wheel base (~ 1200 mm) (** Wheel base - Distance between front wheel centre and rear wheel centre). This helps to maintain the minimum radius of curvature. Simply, you can take sharp turns easily!Some random advantages include: Less weight compared to geared motorcyclePeople can use it irrespective of age group or gender (you'll get caught if you don't have driving license) Disadvantages: Transmission losses are high in belt drives ( CVT uses belt running over pulleys) , where as gears are positive drives with very less transmission losses. This loss in power increases fuel consumption which in turn reduces mileage.The idling time (the time required to move the vehicle from rest state) in CVT is higher compared to manual transmission vehicle, since the power required to overcome the friction between the belt and the pulley is more. This reduces the acceleration performance (pickup) of your scooter.Scooters have less stability, because of smaller mechanical trail. This results in wobbling and vibration, so less comfort and safety.Scooter has comparatively smaller wheel base (~ 1200 mm) which increases the load transfer during acceleration and braking. You could feel jerks while sudden speeding up and braking. Scooters (non-geared motorcycle) and geared motorcycles have their own advantages and disadvantages. If you're a traffic person and want to spend only little effort while driving, go with scooter. If you love to ride motorcycles, better prefer geared motorcycle !!

I went to a small appliance dealer, not a mega box store, so I could get all my questions answered. The sales clerk was actually a former professional chef who decided to change careers to be able to spend evenings at home with his two kids. He was super at helping me through the decision-making process if I really wanted to go to induction in the first place, and then, what brand I should buy. There’s a lot to consider in going to induction the least of which is the brand you choose. But a good sales clerk who knows their product line can guide you, like this guy did for me. What brand you end up with generally boils down to price and athletics because they all work on the same basic electromagnetic principle. We went with a Wolf range because the brand has been in the induction line for some time and the range was going fit well into the space we had to work with. I am, today, happy with that decision. But induction cooking took a bit of an adjustment. For starters, all but two of our cookware were worthless on an induction stovetop because they were made of modern materials that would not carry the magnetic charge. So, before you make your decision, take a kitchen magnet and put it on the bottom of every piece of cookware you own. If it doesn’t stick, then that is a piece you’ll have to replace, and you need to factor this in to your total conversion expense. We had to replace everything except two pieces of cast iron cookware (a skillet and a Dutch oven) that I inherited from my grandmother. The best cookware in terms of inducting heat is, in fact, cast iron. But cast iron can also ruin the stovetop, so on good advice, I bought a couple of silicon mats specifically intended to protect the stovetop surface while not impeding the induction process. You’d be amazed just how quickly a cast iron skillet will heat up beyond the ability to touch the cooking surface. It’s almost immediate. But there are modern cookware lines out there that are labeled “Induction Ready,” and we found the Ninja line to be pretty good, because it’s also non-stick. You’ll find that all induction cookware to be heavier than you’re probably used to, though, because lightweight alloys, like aluminum, don’t work on an induction system. Secondly, if you’re replacing a gas range, like I was, you’ll need to see if the area is plumbed for a 220v electrical connection. Chance are it won’t be and you’ll have to engage an electrician to pull a 220v line from your electrical panel. That can get expensive. If you’re migrating to induction from an electric stovetop, you’ll fare better because it will already be on a 220v dedicated circuit. Thirdly, read everything you can about induction cooking. It’s different. Cooking vessels heat up much more quickly, so putting, say, a skillet on the stove to warm up while you fumble around in the fridge looking for the butter is a thing of the past. The French method of mis en place (having everything at your finger tips before you even begin cooking) is critical. You’ll also find that things heat up much more fully, and in the beginning, i found it all too easy to burn things. After a few weeks, I got the hang of it and learned to deal with the precision of induction cooking. There is no residual heat when you turn off the burner except for that which has transferred from the cooking vessel itself. That is a blessing when things start to boil over. Kill the power or reduce it, and the boiling liquid simmers down immediately. That said, I also learned that if something does boil over onto the surface of the induction burner, the induction process stops and trips a governor that temporarily shuts off power to that burner. You have to dry it completely and either wait for the governor to reset or reboot the stove entirely (which means flipping the circuit breaker off then on again at the breaker box). All of this is to say that you’ll have a learning curve and you’ll either love it in the end or hate it, like my wife does, which means I’m doing a lot more stovetop cooking these days. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"What is the real meaning of friendship?","output":"When I think of friendship, two people come to my mind. My two grandmoms. My father is a Tamilian so his mother lives in Tamilnadu. My mother belongs to Kerala and so is grandma. But despite the distance, these people have developed an intense and pure friendship with each other. During our childhood both my grandmoms had spent much time together. Since my Keralite grandmom is younger than my Tamilian grandmom more than friendship, they had a sister-sister relationship with each other. The fun fact is that both of them nodded their heads without understanding the language of each other during the initial times of their meetings. But now, both of them are fluent in Malayalam as well as Tamil. When these people meet, we people never sleep with them. Because they would have discussions till the sunrise! Those who got in between them just got trapped! Regardless of being a granny, my Malayali grandmom lacked a collection of stories. She waited for my Tamilian Grandmom to come and tell stories for her. The storytelling grandmom then starts to tell the stories tapping on the shoulder of my Malayali grandmom, as if she is a baby. These people sat together for breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner. With their never-ending discussions. We just enjoyed seeing the depth of friendship they have for each other. The photo above has been taken by me. These adorable sisters were so curious to take a picture of them together.

When I finally transitioned to the Boeing 757 and 767 fleet with my airline, this phrase was used frequently to drive home the fact that we still needed to know how to hand fly the airplanes. Even in the earlier 727’s I flew for the better part of 22-years, we were admonished to hand fly whenever we could to keep as proficient as possible. In the simulator sessions each 6-months, there was ample time to practice both hand and auto-pilot procedures so as not to become a “passenger” as opposed to a pilot! Now, retired from the airlines but still flying General Aviation aircraft, the tendency to “let George (the auto-pilot) do it” can become an insidious habit which will, eventually, diminish my skills.

They need to handle this with care and respect. What they do is bully and belittle Hindus. It will be a long answer and I will try my best to end this debate. I am a 28 years old boring adult now. I do not like excessive fire works and crackers anymore due to pollution, noise and smell. Though I do not like it but still banning seems to be unfair. I used to enjoy it when I was a kid and banning it, is like stealing fun from children. Its unfair to them. Give them a alternative. Such laws are technically making them criminal. As they will not listen and use fireworks whats so ever. What we need is a slow change in the way we celebrate Diwali. I will suggest a alternative in end of this answer but before that i need to discuss some real problems. Why this drama happens every year? Why can't government ban production of fireworks permanently? Pass a law and make it illegal just get over with it. Why hurt sentiments of Hindus every year and give them excuses of pollution? I am using word excuse because diwali only contributes to 0.03 % of pollution in air. Is government really serious about tackling Pollution? Every year Delhi government blames other states for pollution due to stubble burning by farmers. What have they done to stop this practice or educate farmers? For how long they will cry for same thing over and over? How long this cycle will continue? Moreover what about industrial pollution, manufacturing units are they equipped with proper waste management systems? What about pollution from old outdated vehicles ?Government is not serious about things which causes 99.97 % of pollution and they all get so much interested in 0.03. I will explain you why. They like to bully Hindus into submission. Oppresing one is also a way to appease others. Also it works as a safety valve that we can interfere in religious matters of hindus so we can interfere in your religious matters as well. I might be wrong but I cannot find any proper logic in such bans until I see government really concern about other 99.97%. There is approx 70,000 crore spent in swach Bharat in last 6 years . Tell me out of 100 smart cities how many are having proper waste management system and are pollution free. I agree Diwali was not meant to be festival of fireworks. It was a festival of lights. Eventually it got evolved into the way we celebrate today over years. It took years for firework's to become common and it will take years to let them go. A sudden ban weeks before Diwali is not good. Its the maturity of Hindus that no one is hitting streets but stop pushing too much.

I just don’t get why it needs to do that if we’re basically our brains.","output":"Studying the history of brain evolution help understand the division of labor in the brain. The most evolved part called neocortex is also the simplest chemically. There is only one neurotransmitter and one neuroinhibitor called Gaba. The neocortex use direct connection between neurons to form networks with specialized brain areas. What makes each area special is their location. The rest of the brain rely on chemistry to communicate with other neurons and use blood circulation as mail man. Each feature need different chemical. Dopamine is a short distance acting chemical, so many independent brain areas reuse it for unrelated functions. The largest dopamine production is in the intestine. The brain/blood barrier prevent interaction. Dopamine in the brain is an alarm signal used to speed up the capture of new information. Dopamine is produced when an unexpected reward or punishment happen. For parkinson people, the dopamine production problem is located in the “substancia negra”, the black matter. It is used in that area to maintain a decision for some time. The lack of dopamine makes parkinson people repeating body motion. Suppose, for example, you are watching tv and get thirsty. At some point, you decide to get up, take a drink in the kitchen, then come back watching tv. For parkinson, this plan is as clear, but it flash rapidly, many times per second.

Generally, the strategies that are most appropriate for investing money include: Stocks and Bonds: Stocks and bonds can help investors achieve long-term growth and generate income. Stocks are typically more volatile than bonds, so they can provide higher returns, but also carry more risk. 2. Mutual Funds and ETFs: Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are both investment vehicles that contain a portfolio of stocks and/or bonds. They can provide diversification and professional management, which can be beneficial for investors with limited experience. 3. Real Estate: Investing in real estate can be a great way to generate passive income and build long-term wealth. Investing in rental properties can help investors generate income from rent, while also potentially increasing in value over time. 4. Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is secured by cryptography. It is decentralized and can be traded on exchanges for other currencies or used to purchase goods and services.

Play, study and sleep. Some people say that you can only choose two from these three. But I believe you can manage to do all three things if you manage your time well.Be open-minded: you will meet a lot of people who hold different values from yours. Respect them, and listen to their stories. You will begin to look at things from different perspectives if you choose to be open-minded.Make sure you do well in courses: some people may suggest that you should skip courses and party all night. Personally, I don’t agree with them. We all chose to get a university degree and it is a expensive one.

Abhimanyu insulted Karna by saying he is no match for him or his father. Abhimanyu then invites Karna to a war. Karna accepts the invitation and breaks his bow (which was gifted to Abhimanyu by Balarama )for insulting him but spares his life because he is son to Karna. Karna was always insulted by Pandavas before they invited him to a war, Karna in proof of defeating them makes their heads shaved. While he handles all the Pandava army Vrushasena battles Arjuna and defeats him but spares remembering his father’s vow to kill Arjuna. In proof of deafeating Arjuna, Vrushasena makes Arjuna’s head shaved. When Karna came to know about the news he arrived and was proud of his son. He says that he is not proud for defeating Arjuna, because defeating Arjuna is quite an easy task and can be accoplished easily, he said that he is proud that his son won his first war. Karna defeated Arjuna and spared his life because it is against dharma to fight or kill anyone after sunset. But, in proof of his victory Karna makes Arjuna’s moustache shaved because a man’s valour, masculinity symbolises in his moustache. That’s the reason Karna does that. Karna also says that he only cut off the thread of his Gandiv bow because he respects the son of Brahma i.e. Agni and breaking the bow gifted by Agni is nothing but insulting him. Karna says that he can only be defeated by three people and they are Surya bhagavan, Parashuram and Shiva. When questioned by Arjuna to Krishna, Krishna replies that Radheya is beyond his father and beyond his teacher in skills and knowledge but he thinks that he cannot defeat them because he loves them and respects them a lot. Bhisma raised his weapon against his teacher, but Karna would never do that. Instead Karna would chose death over raising his weapon against his father, teacher or his lord Shiva. The truth is Karna can only be defeated by Shiva. Karna is beyond his brother Yama and father Surya bhagavan in Dharma, and explains him about the slaying of Yama by Shiva when Yama sprung his noose around the young sage's (Markandeya) neck. By accident or fate the noose mistakenly landed around the Shivalingam, Shiva emerges and slays Yama for his sin. Even Yama has comitted a sin in his life, Karna never did that, it is true that Karna fought by Duryodhana but he never comitted a sin in his life. Krishna says that such a great warrior like Karna can only be killed by deceit, curses and explains about his curses and says he’ll signal Arjuna when Karna’s Chariot will sink. So, explicitly Karna is greater warrior than Arjuna. Attribution: Pictures: copyright lies with the concerned person and source.

NLP is divided into two subparts: Natural language understanding: this involves techniques that deal with deriving semantic meaning from a language as well as the syntactical structure of it.Natural language generation: this includes the knowledge that is derived from NLU and taking it a step ahead with language generation. NLP helps data scientists in extracting insights from textual data. There will be a huge demand for NLP professionals in the near future. A lot of areas like finance, media, healthcare, HR, etc are utilizing NLP for making sense of data available in the form of speech and text. Speech recognition apps like Alexa, Cortana, Siri are made using NLP. Stemming and Lemmatization This is one of the most important NLP techniques which aims to generate the core words from different variations of a word. The result of stemming may or may not be a meaningful word by cutting off the ends of words. In contrast, lemmatization is a more advanced method that deals with the morphological analysis of words and the use of a vocabulary. The result is the dictionary form of the word known as lemma by cutting off the inflectional ending. Tokenization It is one of the most primary and easy techniques in NLP. It is a crucial step in preprocessing text for any NLP application. Here, long-running texts are broken down into smaller units consisting of numbers, words, symbols known as tokens. It is a vital process that converts data into a more analyzable form by keeping some words as extra. Blank space is usually used as a separator to form tokens by most tokenizers. Stop words removal It is a preprocessing step used to remove stop words like the words used to connect sentences, conjunctions like “and”, “since” and “because”, or words used to demonstrate the relationship of a word with others, prepositions like “above”, “in”, “at”, and “under”. This method is not needed for all NLP tasks like machine translation and text summarization. TF-IDF Term frequency- Inverse document frequency is utilized in applications as the weighting factor including information retrieval and text mining. It is a statistical technique that allows us to understand the importance of a word to a document in a collection of documents. TF enables data scientists to measure document strings that frequently come up while IDF helps in measuring the string important to the data. Keyword extraction It is a text analysis NLP that helps in identifying important keywords in a document in a short period. Word embeddings It is a process of word embellishment where the numbers are used to represent words that explain a similar meaning to readers like real-valued vectors. Sentiment analysis It is the NLP technique that aids in identifying the information containing the text data and extracting out the subjective data. It is most commonly used to alleviate hate speech from social media platforms. Regardless of the NLP application, you are working with, some NLP techniques like lemmatization, tokenization and stop word removal are always used. Other techniques like TF-IDF, keyword extraction are more beneficial in analyzing texts and extracting useful information from them. The knowledge of NLP techniques is essential for data scientists because the text is a simple way to store data. A data scientist must know how to perform basic functions on NLP when faced with the task of performing analysis and building models from textual data. To brush up your knowledge on NLP techniques, enroll yourself in any online course offered by Tutort Academy, Simplilearn, or Udemy. If you want to become job-ready in the field of data science, Tutort Academy is the best for you as it offers both classroom and online learning and you can select whichever’s best for you.

Sorry…sad but true. They use others for their personal gain and pleasure. If you tell them how you feel, they will use it against you in some way. This behavior was taught into them at a very early age, and it is all they know. Decades ago (before I even knew what NPD was) I went to marriage counseling w/my NPD husband (no one told me what/who he was). He was able to trick most of the counselors into believing HE was the victim. They would tell me things like: “It’s 50% his shit, and 50% YOURS!” and that “I” had to work harder on myself to make things better. BS! I’m not saying this to “blame”, but just to tell you how it really IS! It is ALL them! All a statement like that does is validate to the NPD that it is 100% YOUR fault and responsibility. They do not take any responsibility on themselves…so if you bare any (even 1% of the “blame”) - it is ALL on you! The counselors would tell me things like: “He’s not a mind-reader, YOU need to tell him what you want, need, expect…how you feel.” Well, he would use that against me EVERY time! The more I expressed what I wanted, the less he would cooperate. Even things that would benefit him! Loving things. The more you expose your vulnerabilities to an NPD’ed person - the more they will exploit you! They do not change, mature, or grow. They do not care. Sadly, NPDs are very selfish and self-centered.

I want to make a marble track from my wood.","output":"I am going to assume that the half-circle you are asking about refers to the shape of the marble track, and you want a round-bottom groove the marbles can roll in. There are router bits, made for cutting round-bottomed grooves in wood. To use one of them, you would need some sort of a router. Guiding a router free-hand to make this cut is not feasible in wood, as the grain of the wood will induce large side forces that will push your router all over the place, so the tricky part would be to set up guides so that you can cut the straight lines and curves that you want. Alternatively, there are cad/cam router tables that you can program, and they will cut the programmed pattern for you. There is also an older hand tool called a router plane. You can google it and probably find out a lot about them. I have one. One of these, with the correct bit/blade, will do the job, but it is a lot more work, pretty slow, and you also need to learn how to sharpen the cutting edge. It is also possible to use a moulding plane and buy a custom blade, or make your own cutting edge. This is very slow. A wood carvers gouge, like a chisel, but curved, will also cut a round-ish groove for you, but to get a smooth track and even depth would take a lot of practice. But, you know, a marble will roll nicely in a rectangular groove also. As long as the groove has smooth sides and bottom."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"The best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes is a combination of natural herbs and spices.

Rapid weight loss methods can lead to muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies, and a rebound effect where you regain the weight. Instead of seeking quick fixes, consider these strategies for gradual, healthier weight loss: Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid extreme calorie restrictions.Portion Control: Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to naturally limit your intake.Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger.Limit Processed Foods: Cut back on processed and high-sugar foods. Choose nutrient-dense options instead.Regular Physical Activity: Engage in regular exercise that combines both cardio (aerobic) and strength training. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.Healthy Snacking: Opt for healthy snacks like fruits, vegetables, yogurt, or nuts to keep hunger at bay between meals.Mindful Eating: Eat slowly, savor each bite, and pay attention to hunger and fullness cues.Adequate Sleep: Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Lack of sleep can hinder weight loss efforts.Manage Stress: Practice stress-relief techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing to prevent emotional eating.Avoid Crash Diets: Avoid extreme diets that promise rapid weight loss. They are often unhealthy and unsustainable.Consult a Professional: If you're seeking quick weight loss due to a special event or health concerns, consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your needs.Set Realistic Goals: Aim for gradual weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week. Realistic goals are more sustainable in the long run.Avoid Over-Exercising: Excessive exercise can lead to burnout, injuries, and hinder weight loss progress.Stay Consistent: Consistency is key. Stick to your healthy eating and exercise routine over time.Avoid Drastic Measures: Avoid extreme methods like very low-calorie diets, diet pills, or excessive fasting. These can harm your health.Focus on Health: Shift your focus from just weight loss to overall health and well-being. Remember, healthy and sustainable weight loss takes time and effort. It's important to prioritize your well-being and make changes that you can maintain in the long term. Rapid weight loss methods are generally not recommended due to potential health risks and the likelihood of regaining the lost weight. Instead, focus on making positive changes to your lifestyle that support your health and fitness goals. Here, I like to suggest the best weight loss clinic in Chennai - VeCura Wellness.

I’ve gone over this in a previous answer [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #YloEo], but suffice to say that to Anakin, sand was representative of his life on Tatooine; being a slave to Watto and having nothing.What’s more, Anakin not knowing how to flirt makes perfect sense. Remember, Anakin was raised in the Jedi Order, which prohibited attachments. So Anakin would have had no chance to practice flirting. As a result, Anakin flirting badly on his first attempt makes perfect sense- in fact, if Anakin was good at flirting it wouldn’t make sense. So, yes, I can defend the line “I don’t like sand.” Stay safe, -Ben Footnotes [LINKED_TEXT: [1] ] [URL: #cite-YloEo][LINKED_TEXT: Ben Choucroun's answer to Why is Anakin scared of sand?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Anakin-scared-of-sand/answer/Ben-Choucroun-1]"},{"instruction":"baseball, what were the most runs scored with the fewest hits?","output":"Here is an “efficient frontier” of runs and hits, i.e. games where nobody had more runs with fewer hits, and nobody had fewer hits with more runs. 4 runs on 0 hits: White Sox vs Yankees, 1990–07–01.

It is created by heating the glass to a very high temperature and then rapidly cooling it, which causes the glass to become stronger and more durable. While [LINKED_TEXT: tempered glass] [URL: https://parts4cells.com/tempered-glass.html] is generally more resistant to breaking than regular glass, it is still possible for it to break under certain circumstances. For example, tempered glass can break if it is subjected to a strong impact or if it is scratched or chipped. It can also break if it is exposed to extreme temperature changes, such as sudden heating or cooling. However, in general, tempered glass is considered to be much stronger and more durable than regular glass, and it is often used in applications where safety and durability are important, such as in automobile windows, shower doors, and mobile phone screens. Tempered glass is designed to break in a way that is less dangerous than regular glass. When tempered glass does break, it shatters into small, rounded pieces rather than sharp, jagged shards. This can help to reduce the risk of injury in the event of a breakage. Tempered glass is also more resistant to thermal stress than regular glass. This means that it can withstand sudden changes in temperature without breaking, which makes it a popular choice for oven doors, microwave windows, and other applications where exposure to heat is a concern. It's important to note that tempered glass is not completely indestructible and can still be damaged or broken under certain conditions. For example, tempered glass can be vulnerable to damage if it is subjected to extreme force or pressure, such as if it is dropped from a great height. It's also possible for tempered glass to break if it is exposed to certain chemicals or other substances. In summary, tempered glass is a durable and strong type of glass that is designed to be more resistant to breaking than regular glass. However, it's important to handle tempered glass carefully and to avoid exposing it to conditions that could cause damage or breakage."},{"instruction":"What are the best restaurants to try when visiting Bengaluru, Karnataka, India?

The problem seems to ebb and flow, but you simply cannot talk about certain topics without getting flamed and it’s a high enough proportion doing it that you can’t just spend all day blocking it. It’s mostly politics. I write quite a bit about spirituality, but the bad actors are actually pretty few, at least that I feel threatened by.

Background: We are a very early stage startup with investment from 3Fs. We are a team of 3 - two are super smart hackers. We have decent traction so now looking for seed funding so that is some extra work for me. This is what my yesterday looked like: I woke up at 8AM and had quick shower.Reviewed my emails and responded to some of them and flagged the rest. (Housekeeping stuff)Opened up customer inquiries and answered to all except one. (User Retention/Activation)Posted about our startup on several social media to inform the bunch of people about us. (User Acquisition)Then I wrote a simplified description of a job post for which we were hiring and posted it on [LINKED_TEXT: Upwork, the world's largest online workplace] [URL: http://upwork.com/] and reviewed some candidates and spoke with them. (Staffing)At 10ish I left home for market to start speaking with business owners and managers to explain them how Ishto could benefit them and how their lives might be different with and without Ishto. I visited about 18 - 20 and convinced 12 I think. (User Acquisition)At 1.30ish I got to office and saw a notification of receiving a ONE star review on Android app store - so started an urgent call with the team to find a cause and to get them to start working on it. (User Happiness)After this I still had to give fine touches to our pitch deck and send one cold email and two with introductions. (Fund Raising)Our free trial on hosting was expiring so we had to make a decision whether to pay or move to another provider with free trial. We decided to move. (Hosting/Product)I then start to interact with Ishto users as another user of the site to see how happy or unhappy they are with the product. I take away two points. One was that someone doesn’t quite like the way Ishto looks so I start to interview some people on what they thought of the site and the theme. (Market Research/Product Feedback)After this I spent some time looking at some design improvement tips and tricks. We had to brainstorm on how to speed up growth and get the users to invite their connections. We had to make a choice on building new features to gain customers or fix whatever is wrong with current ones and perfect them. We chose latter. (Product betterment/perfection)Then I spent at least 30 minutes on different analytic tools to understand we had 70% or above new users coming to site everyday. Is that good or we are not getting enough returning users. I was learning this as analytics are very important but understanding them right is much more important. I also had to find out why is the average duration lower than 2 minutes. (Analytics)Reviewed emails and replied to some. (Followups)By this time we had already moved to new server - without any downtime. (Yes, he was that good.) I started double checking everything was running smoothly or not. We did have some hiccup with openfire chatting server which needed to be fixed. (Product status)At 8.30ish I left for home and then I realized I was supposed to message an advisor friend to meet with him to get some insights from him. (Carelessness)Had dinner and watched two episodes of Seinfeld season 7. (Entertainment)Checked emails, registered users, products added and total visitors for yesterday and wrote answers to questions that I might be asked by the investors during or after the pitch.(Hard Work getting paid)Watched some trade and wholesale related videos before going to bed.(Industry Insights) I have to add that sometimes it feels like I can not organize my thoughts as there are so many things to do. If I were to miss out on one or two I might be running my startup into water. But we work hard - at the end of the day when you review the numbers and feedback from the day it all feels like it was paid off. And at that time I look like this: By the way, we are Ishto - social network for wholesalers, located in Dubai, UAE.

It works similarly if you expand it back up. Assume that you have a game, which costs one dollar to play, in which one gets to pick 5 numbers from one to 15. After the picks, a list of five random numbers is called, and if your list completely matches (not necessarily in order), then you get 2700 dollars. Else, nothing outputs. Wanna play? I call the numbers I’m thinking that you would say yes. If so, great! However, after 30000 times of playing, I’m left with a small bag of money, yet everyone wants to close the casino except for a few. What happened? The probability of winning is exceptionally small, with 1 winning possibility out of 15!/(5!10!), or 3003, where x! = x(x-1)(x-2)…2*1 (derive this yourself). So, one expects that for every game one plays, one gets 2700 / 3003 dollars, which is around 90 cents (this is a rip-off for even a casino game, which typically outputs an average of 95 cents per game). Casinos skim off this profit. This is why gambling has also been used to actually fund big projects such as schools. Another game. This is similar to what casinos actually make 70 percent of profits from. There are three wheels, and to operate it you input one dollar and pull a lever. In the device, there are three wheels with five images (only one appears at a certain time per wheel) on them that include a bell. If one gets three in a row that is NOT a bell, then they get 20 dollars. If one gets three bells in a row, one gets double. Else, one gets nothing. Now, would you play? Of course not! Look at it, we have a possibility of getting three in a row without a bell of four of 5 * 5 * 5, or 3.2 percent. Likewise, getting three bells in a row has probability one in 125. The expected value is thus 4/125 * 20 + 1/125 * 20 * 2 + 0 = 0.8 dollars Go ahead and fire me for making such a crappy machine. You know its name? The slot machine!

Pretty messed up age. What all I am going to share is not just for a 17 year old girl but every girl irrespective of the age and maturity. Don’t compare yourself and don’t let others compare you. We have the tendency to look beautiful and compare ourselves with some celebs. I ask you why? Everyone’s life and situation is different. They are getting paid for being beautiful. If you leave your studies and the job you are doing and have lots of money, trust me you might look better than them. But you can’t! You have responsibilities to carry. Accept yourself the way you are to avoid that mental stress. Don’t feel insecure about looks. While I shared a picture of mine in an ethnic wear, I mentioned I am dusky, average looking girl and too photogenic and the picture I am sharing is filtered. A girl messaged thanking me for making me accept herself completely. So what if I am dusky? So what if I am short. Big deal? I need the world to know I am dusky and average looking. Why? Because my beauty lies in the confidence I carry, the smile I wear, the kind heart I have, the attitude of not giving up I pursue, and the aspirations I hold. It makes me beautiful. People will come and go, judge you with your clothes and look, but the one who will love you, will love you even when you lose all your teeth and your memory in old age! Remember that. Just try to change your flaws and try being nice. DON’T body-shame any girl/guy EVER! People mostly say that a girl is jealous of another girl and to some extent it’s true. Most of us try to portray a good image in front of men by portraying other girls bad and mean and by trolling their looks. This should be a big NO! Never be jealous of any girl. Also never demean any girl. There are people whom I know of have the tendency not to compliment girls. Change it! Trolling friends by addressing them with cute names as “Moti” and “Patli” is okay till it’s fun and should not be exaggerated. Don’t run behind trying to find a right guy. Take your time. Things happen automatically. No one knows the future. Be someone who understands what life is all about and certainly it’s not always about the “Guy”. Be ambitious. Be cautious. Be fierce and be simple. A girl with ambitions and trying to achieve one is the sexiest! Don’t ever get intimate with someone you don’t love/ Someone who doesn’t feel for you if you are emotional People wanted me to hook up casually after my break up. I knew it would destroy me since I am a very emotional person who believes in love. Being vulnerable makes you do stupid things which you will always regret later. Try to stay away from things that might hurt you in future. Don’t trust anyone who suddenly becomes close to you after your breakup because you never know your weakness. Don’t think it’s too late for you to pursue a different career Girls have the tendency to think that it’s time to marry else they won’t get any eligible groom after 25. They even continue with that career they are not interested because who has time to switch? Nope! Please do it. Situations might not have allowed you to pursue something you wanted but there is always a time you can go for it. Even I am doing PhD for the sake of stability. Marriage can wait, the right groom can wait but not your dreams. Don’t betray men! Or don’t let the man betray you. Falling in love is easy but maintaining that love comes from within. If someone loves you, love them back with the same passion if you are in a relationship. If you feel like the luster is lost, it’s better to let go of the relationship by mutual consent and talks. But yes, don’t dump or ditch a person without any explanation! Everyone deserves an explanation. It makes one go mad thinking about the reason of being dumped. Be true to your relationship or never be in one! Also, the day you realize you are being cheated, let go of that toxic relationship and feel happy about it.

Disclaimer: Go to my Profile and you can find all about Back Pain material there..."},{"instruction":"What is hue, saturation and value?","output":"The best way to understand these terms is to look at a simple chart: This is a 2-D representation of all the colors visible to humans; the full “color space,” the range of every possible color we can see, is actually three-dimensional, and we’ll get to that third dimension in a moment. You’ll note that going around the outer edge of the horseshoe-shaped area are the colors of the rainbow, from deep reds in the lower right to deep blues in the lower left. All around the curved edge are the colors we see when viewing light of a single wavelength, the monochromatic colors. These are the colors that we most likely think of when we speak of colors by name: red, orange, green, blue, and so forth. The straight bottom edge is the range of colors you get by mixing the deep red and the deep blue at the extreme corners - these aren’t, of course, single-wavelength colors, but in terms of how our eyes see them, they might as well be. These are the purple or magenta colors you get from such a mix of blue and red. So note that as we go around the outer edge of this diagram, what’s changing is whatever quality it is we associate with the names of colors: what makes a red tone red, or a blue blue, etc.. This is what we call hue. Note also that the very middle of the diagram is white - which again should be as expected, since what we see when we’re presented with roughly equal amounts of light of all different hues is what we call “white.” White has no particular hue, of course, but we can certainly plot a line from the center white point to any of the “pure” colors or hues that lie on the perimeter. And there are some number of different colors along these lines. If we start at white and move toward a bright red at the edge, the color we see would start to become slightly pinkish, then a brighter pink, and it would continue to get more and more red until we finally reached that pure color at the edge of the space. We call the quality that’s changing as we move outward along these lines saturation. It is a measure of how “pure” a given hue is, or in other words how dominant that hue or wavelength is in the mix of different wavelengths of light that produce that perceived color. (A side note that you can skip if you like: because of the way these spaces are constructed mathematically, the “constant hue” lines within them generally are not straight lines, but curve slightly as we move from the central white to the pure color at the edge.) So if hue is related to the “name” of the color - is it a blue, or a yellow, or a green? - and saturation is the “purity” of the color, what’s the last quality in our supposedly three-dimensional color space? Starting with the 2-D space shown above, imagine a third axis “coming out of” that plane, passing through the white point in the center and at right angles to the plane of this original 2-D image. This axis goes by a number of names: value, intensity, brightness, and luminance. These all mean slightly different things, technically, but I think you get an idea of the concept to which they relate. It might help make it clearer if you know that the line going right through the white center and extending “up and down” from the original plane is known as the neutral axis, and it runs from black at the low end through a range of “gray” shades to the brightest possible white (within the constraints of whatever space we’re talking about) at the “top end.” This means that the full range of colors that humans can perceive can be represented by a three-dimensional solid that looks, at least in one model, like this: Well…that’s actually just half the full space. Imagine a sort of “mirror image” of this volume, extending downward from the 2-D chart that’s show at the base of the space above. It would also taper to a point at the bottom, just as this one tapers at the top. This is due to the fact that when we see in very bright or very dark conditions, our ability to distinguish color diminishes. If we see a very bright light, it will just look “white” as our eyes are simply overwhelmed by the intensity. And at the other end, of course, we do not see color well in low light, and obviously no color at all in total darkness (black). This is just one possible way to model human-visible color space, of course. Another popular model is to simply represent hue as the angle around a circle, saturation as the distance out from the center of that circle, and value or intensity again as the central axis, running from black to white, of what is now a spherical HSV or HSI color space."},{"instruction":"IQ a good measurement of one’s intelligence?","output":"IQ score is just another way people judge one another, the only real measure of intelligence is the person’s quality of life.

As i have read a lot of comments regarding earning and a lot of comments are very well explained so i am not going to talk about that. The one side of picture regarding Brain Grooming, i would suggest : Yes The other side of picture you have to sacrifice a lot : No You have to weigh them and chose widely. Lets explain according to my thinking perspective. We came into this world we learn by mistakes and one thing that is important is the brain which could analyze the mistake , understand what happened where did i made mistake that lead to the build up of whole disaster.. this situational analysing brain is build after a lot of knowledge inserted into brain, a lot of subject, different strategies from each subject, a lot of patient histories of their 20–30 year experiences after that your brain trains to see this would differently , analyse situation with different perspective. Thinking out of the box of society, norms and culture. What i have observed is that other subjects persons learn these perspectives atleast their m.phill or PhD level. This openness of brain is easily learned after doing MBBS. I have observed a very interesting thing that from where ever the doctors came into contact on international forum they have a lot of common behavioral, thinking and situational understanding. They understand each other easily. And as we have to deal with humans we learn a lot from their experiences which first make doctors down to earth, civilized and nice behavioral personalities. They have very less crime rate, raise their kids very well, and have most often very good public relationship record. Due to brain opening after a lot of books readings they build a very good power understanding other subjects very easIy and very well. Like i have intrest in digital marketing, webdeveloping , SEO, blogging,AI,PYTHON ,machine learning , business, stock markets, crypto, property business, philosophy and many more. All this stuff i learned on internt because my brain was train how to find a solution of a problem, how to do that and how to complete that on time. As we are trained to do that .like when a patient came to us , after asking questions and examination we do brain storming of all 5 years subject’s books and advise him some words of medicine which cure his illness and we repeat this again and again.So doing MBBS i think made me eligible to learn all the philosophy of life easily very easily.This all is just because of MBBS. There is a survery that the most difficult exam in Pakistan CSS is easily passed by doctors and a there is highest passing ratio of Doctors in Pakistan. Now this exam has to deal with sociology,biology,current affairs,history,business, government,finance,diplomacy and a lot of other subjects as well. This is the evidance that training your brain harder makes you smarter in real life. So in my opinion doing MBBS is a good thing when you would like to understand the pathway of understanding of knowledges of this words. Because every incidence has a mechanism and process of its happening and the specilist of that incidence knows the mechanism of that incidence he my have forgotten the words of books but he know the process of mechanism. Like zoologist/geologist can say why river water is cutting the agricultural land. He know that there could have been more herbivore animals which are causing excessing grazing which is reducing the shrubs which are not helpfull for tress and when trees are not there the river water makes his own way. Similarly an aerodynamic expert can tell that if the shape of jet is not aerodynamic its going to increase resistance ehich inturn is going to increase fuel consumption making jet model very expensive. So the secret to understand this universe can easily be unlocked by a brain who have trained it after a lot of books reasings. So i would suggest if you want to see your descendents mature, knowledged and civilized .. than doing MBBS is a Yes thinng.because if you can learn doing business, economic,accounting, trading you can earn a lot from other businesses. The other side is very difficult , you have a fixed daily routein to do work, you have to take responsibility of a patietn. Some time you have to think about patients first that have to food which you may have been eating after 1hours..., A lot of miss behaving patient cao you but you have to stay calm.you live out of nature like you would have evening, morning an There are a lot of other cons as well."},{"instruction":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","output":"Depends.

If you told me about this objection before the issue came up, again it is probably on me to come up with a solution acceptable to you. If the issue was not previously known to me, it would depend on how important you are to the organization but it is not an ethical or moral problem to basically let you go."},{"instruction":"Why did the army get rid of digital camo?","output":"Well, the Army had the opportunity to adopt Multi-Cam when they adopted the first digital pattern. I’m fairly certain that was a political decision. The original digital ACU pattern did not work well in a majority of environments. That was realized fairly quickly, as the first digital pattern ACU’s only lasted about 5–7 yrs., then OCP (US Army version of Muli-Cam, a Crye Precision original design) was adopted across active duty units, and fully adopted with an age-out date of 2017 for the first digital ACU pattern uniforms for all components. so the ACU pattern only saw service for approx. 10 yrs, which is short by any standard. The Woodlands pattern in its many forms, was around for at least 20 yrs, and is still worn by some specialized units for training purposes, but not as an official uniform. You’ll probably never see the ACUs worn by any US military personnel again, as it has no real tactical application unless you’re fighting in a “rock pile”."},{"instruction":"What is the Ship of Theseus paradox?","output":"Mine: Yes, and probably.

But, since the ship is called the Ship of Theseus, the ship with new planks is technically still the Ship of Theseus because they share a name."},{"instruction":"What would an alpha INFJ be like?","output":"What would an ALPHA INFJ be like? First of all, this alpha descriptor is simply an issue of self-improvement only. I personally am very tired of being used because I’m quiet and confident as we are so much more but this is today's society. Somehow this places a target on many of us INFJ our forehead because of our good nature approach with confidence. See many of us are forced to develop slowly because of a serious lack of information. In my ALPHA INFJ-A (attentive) experience, Alpha skills are best learned very young or older as in my case which remains low key and we are introvert-extrovert dynamic not full extroverts only as some error and go on and on about. Plus yes it's harder to be a switch with introvert-extrovert responses but it also is like anything else in life as no pain no gain is the old saying we do both synergistically or simultaneously you pick. I may be quiet but I don’t do timid, I don’t do naive, we lol for those trying to take advantage of us, suddenly and can walk away from less than honest people and situations. I have trained, researched and self-educated all my life and must again at 60 as such is life hard to the end but enjoy life in general a challenge as such is life, amongst our now 7.7 billion population. At first, as a kid INFJ in the seventies, it was hard to impossible to rationalize what was going on for an INFJ kid boy or girl or LGBTQIA and information was sketchy or misleading all the way. Your parents are also clueless about what an INFJ dynamic really could be possible and or the Alpha component is not on anyone's radar yet. That was very new for any parent as it is today but at least we have the internet. Plus we were naive. Hey Lol, I loved the original series “Mission Impossible” an adult tv series the sixties shows for a kid? etc… or Lost in Space before Star Trek etc… so I was just a normal kid in those times… Hey the MBTI may not be a “clinical approach” but it has helped hugely. I know it's not the 5 base traits but it's helping many people, globally come to terms with many career choices most likely. The Alpha INFJ is an “Army of One” naturally, period not extroverted but very low key for life as an introvert-extrovert simultaneous dynamic definitely, and others within our lives if they let us express ourselves “really know this already: but if not hey we have much better things to do and other people to be with also as we won’t be stifled we seek harmony and will do what's within our grasp to be happy. We do not waste time and will quickly move on. Don’t kid your self introverted-extroverted in one combined behavior which will shock everyone when we let loose because we are pushed to beyond one stereotypical browbeating to be just one I or E type of the past. Hey, everything is dynamically changing slowly or quick as the young know and the older generations are not as aware sadly but some of us are involved and connected to these issues and have been stifled. I don’t know where accommodating people may fall in my case as I learned to be no one's fool quite young with my father's support. Which is the tact ability to put an abusive controlling adult in their place when I was bullied for being different at age 10 by so-called mature adults! Well, adults in the 1960s also did burnouts all day long with their cars remember. Drinking and driving was a judgment call with a beer as some shit hot thingy along with a pack a day and a case of 24 when done all this hard work only to get up and do it again. So leadership skills are learned by talented INFJ’s as in my case much younger in life and at a faster pace than in the teen years or later that's way too late in general to ALPHA UP but do it anyway its who we INFJ are don’t limit yourself in this life. We are introspective decisive hard-chargers in life very early but one needs information, coaching, great patience, and training from parents a dad as no one else will legally do it for an INFJ child because it's very tough for a parent to do and the child depending on the family dynamic. My dad a single parent had to use tough love, mixed in with good care of course for me growing up was quite a challenge. Would I change anything? Well, not really, but I wish I knew then what I now understand as an INFJ on the front lines of life when I was younger? It would have aided me and my father immensely but no materials existed to my knowledge in 1968 - 1974, like today sadly. An INFJ kid that's well trained is sort of “street proof” a type of early “Alpha INFJ naturally” to throw off the bad or challenging adults immediately as we can't think that slow to handhold these belligerent types forever. We see through these scammers. It forces good-natured people to not be as caring sadly as we must now really protect ourselves occasionally. I only helped if its an emergency back then to do my part for a person in need. Back then and now people are very deceptive and will abuse one's good nature as a dam joke and laugh at you. Generally, we slow down to help people as that's obvious. Years ago one had to obey elders to the letter, now many elders are fantastic people but all the coins have two sides also. Yeah well, many elders are abusive because of poor integrity of religious and other educational systems to feed on those like us and others and we had to be slow and respectful when the pace of life was way faster… for us young. So INFJ’s adapt and develope based on our inherent common sense experiences and either work it through and also move on at the same time. We all go back to the old home town and get the old “Hey sunny boy where U been! stuff… An INFJ kid brought up to stand up to abusers type with logic and wouldn’t stand for this crap then so we go silent for those that wonder and we sought to automatically seek out higher education if attainable. As my father taught me to be limitless in principle only as a great single parent. No one comprehends what an INFJ is going through, once we knew more about the INFJ profile we are thinking far differently than the society at large. I had a difficult time selecting a career as they all made sense to me as INFJ, I could learn anything but where and how to do it? So I sat in libraries remember no internet back then. This is the problem and the blessing of being an INFJ in selecting our path forward. Often we a the “different” unknown bloomer and we then must battle like everyone for a place in a life career-wise line-up, but the stigmas can be daunting as the INFJ seeks a path if one isn't self-identified very early so we can stream into life immediately. I have always believed that you just stay on the path you are on provided, its the path you trust based on your INFJ instincts. The Introspection, Intuition, Feeling, Judging all play a role of sub dominance and dominance when deep in thought as we funnel our decisions into a conclusion and move on. We will also look at something that makes no sense to eliminate but also to discover, research and to keep sharp within the lines of higher learning. Plus we just get to the point, as yes leading is an acquired talent but is also boring to an INFJ or is just not how we enjoy spending our time. Leadership is only one form of helping people or the masses. Whereas we prefer the help aspect in more direct careers. We can apply and it always feels good tangibly helping people versus a leadership role to many of us INFJ. We do realize some leadership roles can be as direct but often they are really are a subset of the larger power mix or role as a leader. So we are capable but usually, we have a better life already and wish to keep it as such. So we manage and advise within a step-back existence from leadership as a selective choice. Hey now many INFJ have take-on the community or other extensive leadership roles, many famous people are INFJ, which will surprise you, great INFJ people are excellent leaders also. Leadership is a very tough role to handle if you lack the extroverted traits for one and the in-depth knowledge must be quite deep and then tact and dynamic business experience is huge. The thing is we are hard-wired as the advisory type confidant, we do not seek the limelight in any way usually for us is normal but sometimes its the skill set that is needed so some sort of volunteer and steps forward into the leadership life and role for an excellent life. We are in my opinion generally the advisor only and prefer the step back from leadership and its emotional rollercoaster as we are the introvert, but INFJ’s make great leaders. Leading people requires excellent people skills and persuasive tact or belligerent tact to get people started depending on your tact to action as people are generally in shock during an emergency all the way to calm persuasion is us, the INFJ. In the workplace, people hate us as we are visionaries as we think circles around people. Once you have learned practical leadership skills, your natural INFJ skillset is then an easier path-building process for everything life throws your way. Your leadership experiences for each next leadership scenario or just for 99% is a small one-by-one activity day to day process, so yes we are naturally most perspicacious and the only one of the types doing this in this manner apparently. Remember we are all similar but we all remain different as we synthesize information. We move past difficulties so some perhaps may take away this is anger, so spare the insulting comments or insulting questions as we INFJ and myself a version of an ALPHA INFJ A don’t appreciate these negative approaches as well all have moved on, go torture paper planes or something. Life is a real INFJ experience among the ALPHA INFJ-A types is harder than most loosely detailed life experiential accounts and this was mine. The purpose of this is for only the other INFJ seeking information. Also, other INFJ may not agree with me which is fine. Well then share your own experiences and leave mine for others… as this stays…. “All the best!”… So no “non-INFJ” types will upvote my explanation which is what I expect as only INFJ’s should. Without a fairly rough, vigorous and dynamic childhood upbringing life isn’t a debate with the 8 or 5 or even the MBTI types systems when you know more of yourself than most can even imagine. Do not assume to ever have known the INFJ because you haven’t gotten that close, sadly. I can assure you that we all can only theorize of being in someone's, INFJ shoes on a cold sad miserable day all alone…. with no one, but is it?

As you may guess, it’s harder to run when you’re constipated so the predators were able to catch and eat more herbivores. For a little while that’s a boon for the predators, but after a while, there are far more predators than the herbivore population can support. And they both went extinct.

Look, there isn’t really any other possible endgame. If your big concern are “mass shooters” and “gun violence”, and the only way you are seeking to solve this problem is by reforming (aka, restricting) firearms, that is the only viable outcome. A mass shooting tends to be defined as one where 4 or more people are killed by some random asshole. Lets try an experiment. Tell me how a Ruger 10/22 chambered in .22lr would be any less effective at executing 4 people trapped in a room than an AR15? Tell me that .22lr isn’t that fatal, I dare you. Tell me how an M1 Garand would be less effective at executing 4 people trapped in a room than an AR15? Tell me how a handgun is any less effective at executing 4 people trapped in a room than an AR15? (Spoiler alert, most mass shootings are done with handguns. ) Tell me how a Springfield ’03 with a 5 round magazine and a bolt action would be any less effective at executing 4 people trapped in a room. Sure, the task could arguably be said to get a little more difficult as you go through, but just how hard would it be really? Is a bolt action really that slow if you’re practiced with it? Is more frequent reloading really enough to save a life when a reload takes seconds? The fact is, nearly every “gun reform” argument goes something along the lines of “They don’t want to take away their right to own a weapon, just “X” weapons that are bad!” The problem is that in the context of some homicidal maniac, any gun can be easily used to kill 4+ people. ARs might be different from other guns, they may be more practical and efficient than other guns, but the difference in viability for the task of doing something terrible is not enough to make a difference. We know even if you don’t think you’re trying to take away our right to own weapons, that this is where you will eventually go.

Mosquitoes kill about 700,000 people a year, more than any other animal. Some of the diseases they carry include malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya, West Nile virus, Zika virus and yellow fever. Mosquitoes are not only dangerous in tropical and subtropical regions, where these diseases are endemic, but also in temperate and cold areas, where they are expanding their range due to climate change. As the world warms up, mosquitoes can grow faster, live longer, become more infectious and find new habitats and hosts. The Asian tiger mosquito, a notorious carrier of several viruses, is thriving across Mediterranean countries and is expected to establish itself across England and Wales in the coming decades. Mosquitoes are also very adaptable and resilient. They can breed in any stagnant water source, from puddles to flower pots to tires. They can evade predators and pesticides with their rapid evolution and genetic diversity. They can target their hosts with their keen sense of smell and vision. They can even adjust their biting behavior to match the habits of their victims. These characteristics make mosquitoes a formidable enemy for humans and animals alike. Some of the consequences of their bites are: Mosquito-borne diseases can cause high fever, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, bleeding, organ failure and neurological complications. Some of them have no specific treatment or vaccine available. In 2023, there have been outbreaks of malaria in Florida and Texas, dengue fever in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, West Nile virus in California and Colorado, and Zika virus in Brazil and Colombia. Mosquito-borne diseases can affect productivity, tourism, trade and health care costs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malaria alone costs Africa 12 billion a year in lost GDP. Dengue fever costs Latin America and Asia 8.9 billion a year in medical expenses and lost income. Zika virus costs Brazil 3.5 billion a year in health care and social welfare spending. Mosquitoes can also harm wildlife and ecosystems by transmitting diseases to other animals, such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals. Some of these diseases can cause population declines or extinctions of endangered species. For example, avian malaria has contributed to the decline of native Hawaiian birds. West Nile virus has killed millions of birds in North America. Chikungunya has affected monkeys in Africa and Asia."},{"instruction":"What’s your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","output":"Have a life vision, list your goal and get to it!

In this case, n = 10 (since there are 10 terms in the sequence), a = 1 (since 1 is the first term), and l = 10 (since 10 is the last term).

As per Kiran Thomas, Reliance Jio's president, on the last earnings call: \\"During the peak of the 2nd wave [of COVID-19, during the April-to-May timeframe], we had done a lot of initiatives … giving free voice minutes to keep them on our network, but 2 quarters later, we find that a large number of people at the bottom of the pyramid have not been able to stay up-to-date with recharges.\\" The story of inactive subscribers Jio's database has continued to feature a high number of inactive subscribers who are typically removed after 90 days only. The low tariffs at Jio's launch persuaded many consumers to adopt Jio as a second SIM, a phenomenon that continued even when Jio launched its JioPhone in 2019. It is one of the key reasons, Jio continues to have a lower number of active subscribers on its network than its rivals claim. Airtel has 97.86% of its users as active, while Vi has 87.31% and Jio, only has 83.65%. The reason for Jio's high number of inactive subscribers is the company's policy of not terminating service even after their plans expire, who are typically removed only after 90 days. Users can continue to receive incoming calls even when they have not recharged. This is not the case with other telcos like Airtel and Vi.

However, it is also a premium product and can be quite expensive. Whether it's worth buying depends on your specific needs and budget. If you spend a lot of time sitting at your desk and suffer from back pain or other ergonomic issues, investing in a high-quality chair like the Aeron could be a good choice. Its adjustable features, such as lumbar support and tilt tension, can help improve your posture and reduce discomfort. However, if you are on a tight budget or don't require all the features of the Aeron chair, there are other options available. Many office chairs are designed with ergonomic features and can be found at a lower price point. You could consider options such as the Steelcase Leap or the Haworth Zody.

To speak like a native, you MUST change the way you process your speech. English is a difficult language that few people speak 'correctly' with 'good' pronunciation- perhaps 3-5% of native speakers such as well-’educated’ persons, BBC presenters and other professional speakers, actors, politicians trained to accurately reproduce all the sounds in English in public situations . Correct vs. Fluid Speaking English is often a 'trade off' (exchange) between correct (less fluid) and fluid (less correct) To speak correctly requires more effort, to speak fluently requires 'short cuts' (economies). The goal of English is effective communication- easy to speak, easy to understand. Native English speakers ‘process’ the language differently from speakers of other languages. This is where we put (or don’t put) most of our energy or attention when we speak. I hope this helps. Vowels Sounds: cat /ae/, card /a:/, Kate /ei/, etc.. There are 20 vowel sounds in English so it's important to recognise and produce each one, to avoid confusion between similar sounding words- Mike – make, cat – cart, beat – bit, etc.Schwa: /ə/ /ɜː/ Is the name of the most common (and used) vowel sound in English- in words such as teachER, PERsOn, wOrk, tUrn...etc, the neutral and 'lazy' schwa sound makes pronunciation « easier » and more « natural » with minimum effort and maximum comprehension. it is often used for unstressed syllables- intErnatIOnalConnected Speech: Words are naturally 'connected' in English to maintain fluidity. Black-cat, take-off, Monday-evening.Weak Forms: Many common words and phrases are given 'weak' pronunciation to aid fluidity- Rock 'n' Roll (and). I'll call ya (you) later, W'd'yu (would you) like a coffee ? G'd’afternoon (good afternoon)Lost Sounds: Some sounds are naturally 'lost' in difficult pronunciations- 3 or more consonants : han(d) luggage, similar sounds : fres(h) cheese, 3 or more syllables : internat(io)nal , comf(or)table.veg(e)table.Contractions: In speech, many two- and three-word combinations become one word, I'm, she's, they're, I'd have/I would've, “gonna” (going to), “wanna” (want to).Word Stress: All words have at least one 'stressed' or 'accented' syllable- America, holiday, ChIna, Japan. When we 'stress' a syllable, the remaining syllables are made weaker : America. (o O o o).Sentence Stress: As in Word Stress, the most important 'message' words are stressed with a regular rythym and the remaining words are contracted, weakened or 'glissed' over. / He's / NOT / in his / OFFICE / at the / MOMENT / would you / LIKE / to leave a / MESSAGE? / / NOT / / OFFICE/ / MOMENT/ / LIKE / / MESSAGE? /Intonation: Intonation is an important way to 'mark' the most essential 'message' words. exCUSE me, can I ask you a QUEStion? and helps 'glue' sounds together and give listener-friendly shape to the phrase.Rhythm: The most natural rhythm of spoken English, resembles TUM-te-TUM, (as opposed to French da-da-daa Spanish rat-tat-tat, or Italian TUtti FRUtti). Compare the following: in the Street O o O dans la rue o o O en la calle o o O o sulla strada O o O o"},{"instruction":"Who is a better Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi or Manmohan Singh?","output":"I like modi.

You need to read papers and research done by harvard and oxford on this subject matter.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","output":"I think it’s important to make yourself irrelevant to the business. It can be counter intuitive but really great CEOs figure out how to have a lot of time on their hands. Once you have the extra time, it’s usually a good idea to spend it on the one thing that actually matters: determining the things that might kill the business. There’s a lot of advice about product focused CEOs, sales-focused CEOs, visionary CEOs, etc. I think if you look at all the big companies whose founder CEO helped the company become a mainstay of public discourse, they usually spent they’re time trying to make more time so they could spend it on the one or two things that are most important. I know that’s a vague statement but “CEO” is a vague role. It’s one of the few roles where the title is the same from company to company but the work that makes each particular CEO successful could be totally different from one to the next. “What does a CEO do” is a fun question but I’d be wary of answers that resemble the “hero CEO,” “the CEO diet,” “the highly disciplined CEO,” or “the 7 things every successful CEO eats for breakfast.” Instead, realize that the only reason a CEOs job is to: instill enthusiasm in others is because it will kill the company if you don’t have a capable and committed team. The only reason you need to raise money is because running out of cash will kill you. The only reason you need to worry about marketing or product is because the absence of either and especially both will likely kill you. The cool thing is, what will kill a startup changes often and you get to learn a lot of things as you jump from one challenge to the next. If, however, you arbitrarily fill your time with work, you might one day be surprised you’ve been working on the wrong things. Scale yourself and the company by getting out of the way. Then go be useful.

Yes, it is definitely lagging behind. Nikon has long concentrated on their DSLR range and providing a huge base of lenses and accessories Now , focusing on the mirrorless platform will indeed lead to turning its back on their DSLR segment. I would like to point out Sony has more or less given up on its DSLR range namely the A-Mount whilst concentrating on its E-mount . And why did they do that ? BECAUSE IT COULD ! the A-mount was not very popular when Sony had bought the rights from Minolta. Sony then-after tried for years but couldn't make much dent in the segment dominated by Canon and Nikon. Sony never had much to lose, unlike Nikon. Now what happens if Nikon shifts it attention to its mirror less segment. The vast Nikon users who have invested so much on their lenses will have similar fear that (just like Sony) they too will forget about its F-mount users. (Now you may ask “Well F-mount users can use an adapter ?”, well technically yes, but it has seen native lenses usually work better than “adapted” lenses. And professional photographers will not tolerate it one bit, along with the extra weight and space taken by an adapter.) Nikon cannot let that happen ( not yet). Wildlife photographers , or Journalists still use Nikon cameras . Why? Unlike mirrorless cameras, DSLR’s don’t consume much power. And this is a defining factor. I Feel, Nikon is waiting out to understand , whether Mirrorless system is a fad or whether it is the next path the photography industry will take."},{"instruction":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","output":"Maybe.

We did problem sets together but that was encouraged by the professors in my major; physics… No one could cheat on the tests. They were all new and original questions thought up by the professors 2 days before the exam. They wanted you to apply your knowledge to something no student had ever seen before. No benefit from memory here… Lets see… projects and labs.. No way to cheat here. You had to do the experiments and the grad students and professors were walking around constantly asking you to explain what your thinking was and what you were doing. I went to a high school that did not have much science. I never took a science class until second semester senior year when I took chemistry. I knew nothing about lab work when I took Junior Physics lab (we had to reproduce Nobel Prize-winning experiments like the Michelson-Morley Experiment) and was totally lost. I had no clue about recording measurements, error, apparatus, etc.. I was feeling really bad one day but we had to build some part of the apparatus and I tried it. The professor walked by and said: “let me see that!”. I said: “I’m sorry Professor Weiskopf (It was Vicktor Weiskopf, a giant in modern physics). I don’t know what I’m doing..” He took my creation around and showed the other professors and grad students.. I’m thinking to myself: Oh God, what an embarrassment…” And then he brought it back to me. I said: “I’ll try to do better next time Sir.” He said: “Nobody could do better than that including my graduate students. Its beautiful. Its a work of art.” I can’t begin to tell you how that felt at the time. Cheating at MIT?.. Why?"},{"instruction":"w do I talk like a native English speaker?","output":"There are two things. How you speak English and what type of English you use. English has a semi-musical rhythm as compared to flat-rhythm of most languages. Not all words are stressed equally. And Some words are fully pronounced and other words are shortened and partially pronounced. If you listen to any native speaker in English movies, it should be quite clear to you. But, no amount of listening will make you speak like a native. You have to do a lot of rhythm drills. Native speakers make use of ready-built word groups (collocations). They don’t talk by stringing individual words. No. Rather, they use ready-to-assemble word clusters which are fixed and standard expressions. take a walk, build a house, change the oil, avoid an accident, by mistake, in queue, at the top, take advantage of, pay attention, etc. You see, these type of word groups work as idea units. These clusters enable you to express your thoughts without having to worry about putting individual words together and worrying about grammar. They change the focus from how to form sentences to what you want to say. That said, never imitate others’ accents! You’d sound awful. You’d sound unauthentic. Native speakers don’t have an accent. It’s the way they speak. The best the foreign speakers can do is speak English in the way it should be spoken. We as foreign speakers assume English is spoken in the same way as our mother tongue. This makes it difficult to carry on conversation in English over longer periods of time even for people who know English quite well. English is spoken quite differently and none of the Indian/Asian language bears any resemblance. English has its own set of phrases, idioms, and collocations and its very own song-like way of speech. You see, English has a certain rhythm and not all words are pronounced equally. Some words are shortened, some words change form in Spoken English. For ex: 1. It is hell of a game. spoken as: isheləvəgame (notice ‘It’s’ became ‘Is’, ‘Of’ became ‘əv’, ‘a’ became ‘ə’) 2. The discount price is 10. Spoken as: thədiscoumpricis10 (notice ‘nt’ became ‘m’) 3. I’m not used to this kind of weather. Spoken as: əmnochoostothiskindəweather (notice ‘I’m’ became ‘əm’, ‘not used’ became ‘nochoosed’, ‘used to’ became ‘use to’, etc.) That brings us to: Syllables Every word in English has one or more syllables. A syllable is a vowel sound in a word. For ex: “Moon” has only 1 syllable “English” has 2 syllables viz. Eng, lish “Syllable” has 3 syllables viz. Sy, lla, ble “Ability” has 4 syllables viz. A, bi, li, ty And only one syllable is always stressed and other syllables are unstressed. The syllable which receives stress can be in any position. “Moon” should be always stressed as it’s the only syllable there. “English” has 2 syllables and stress falls only on first syllable and second syllable is unstressed: pronounced like “ENGlish” Stressed syllable gets longer time and unstressed syllables are rushed over. For ex, in “Impressive”, the stress falls on second syllable and it’s pronounced as “imPRESSive”. You should spend more time on “PRESS” and stress it and just glide over “im” and “ive” and shouldn’t stress them. “Schwa” In unstressed syllables, vowels often get reduced to a semi-vowel sound called ‘Schwa’. It’s written as inverted ‘e’ (“ə”). It’s the the sound between ‘s’ and ‘p’ in ‘supply’. the sound between ‘p’ and ’n’ in ‘company’. So in connected speech, “am” gets reduced to “əm”, “and” to “ən”, “was” to “wəs”, etc. These and other things are clearly explained in [LINKED_TEXT: Fluentzy: The Fluency Development Course] [URL: http://fluentzy.com/] by Prof. Kev Nair in detail. I have done this course and been still studying for almost 10 years. Now, Fluentzy course is the most comprehensive and very thorough. It’s one of a kind. Prof. Kev Nair is a well-known authority and is considered “The Father of Fluency Development”. It is a set of 20 books. It doesn’t teach grammar. It is for people who already know English quite well and want to speak fluently. It asserts self-study is the only way to true fluency as there are a number of factors at play in real-time conversations. You can’t plan for them nor can an instructor correct you. You just have to understand the principles of spoken English and practise rigorously. This course contains a huge collection of ready-built word groups and it explains in detail about how English should be spoken through a lot of rhythm drills. I’ll just give some highlights from this course.1. Foreign speakers learn English the wrong way. We are taught to write English rather than to speak first.2. There’s a lot of differences between written and spoken English.3. The right way to learn to speak is in word-groups instead of individual words.4. The way English is spoken is completely different from the way our languages are spoken.5. Fluency is achieved only when our ears and tongue are trained in English. We may know English but the tongue has to be taught in English ways. And ears have to stop being hesitant to English sounds.6. Fluency is achieved only through self-study, without any instructor, without any recordings. Any external means is a hurdle.7. We should get exposed to spoken English a lot. We should read novels written in loose, conversational style. Newspaper, non-fiction books, magazines, and like should be avoided as they’re written for different purpose and aren’t suitable from fluency perspective.8. We should avoid bilingual dictionaries and learn to think in English. We should buy at least one Advanced English dictionary and look up words for even simple words. Not any word, but fluency oriented words.

Is it primarily to learn or to acquire credentials for a future job?","output":"The way I see it, you are there to further enlighten your mind. When you enroll in a professional education, there is significantly less theoretical background which needs to find a place in your head. You do get theoretical background information on your profession of choice, but on the university level you are offered a much broader base. And because of that you get to connect a lot of dots which could have escaped your attention otherwise. The difference between the 2 forms of education is much more detailed than what I sketched here, but I think this somewhat near the truth. I think that people who have more recent experience with university level schooling could provide you with more specific details then I can. So the skills for a future job are mostly acquired in professional education, while university makes you more of a theoretical expert. Vast amounts of knowledge await you young man/woman.

He was appointed to the position in November 2021, succeeding Chris Silverwood. While it is still early in his tenure as coach, there are several factors that suggest McCullum could be highly impactful in his role. One of the main factors that could make McCullum a highly impactful coach is his experience and success as a player. McCullum is widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in New Zealand history, having played 101 tests, 260 one-day internationals, and 71 T20 internationals.
