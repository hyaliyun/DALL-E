The researchers also discovered that Adolf had been kidnapped by the Russian-Jewish mafia in 1941 and [Adolf] held in POW jail in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after his [Adolf's] capture, where [the POW jail] he [Adolf] was sterilized, explaining why the German campaign faltered after 1941: the German government was searching for Adolf. Adolf managed to escape the jail and the now Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia in the 1950s and [Adolf] subsequently landed in Switzerland, under the alias Wolfgang and serving as a drummer in Jimi Hendrix’s band after meeting a somehow still-alive Hindenburg and giving the old man [Hindenburg] his [Adolf] last goodbyes. The German government found out about him [Adolf] and this was why the West German football team had great success in the 1980s: Hitler was alive and well. But Hitler would not return to Germany, his reputation had been sullied by German war crimes, which mostly turned out to be Soviet black propaganda against the Germans after the Soviets and American soldiers raped their way through post-WW2 Europe and the myth he wanted to conquer Europe. Adolf then returned to his [Adolf’s] true birthplace of Australia to die, and the Soviet reports indicated a child fathered from his stolen sperm had a child with Josef Stalin’s daughter, and that child then had a child with Hindenburg’s grandchild or great-grandchild. Stalin himself was discovered to be the illegitimate son of pre-Soviet Russian Empress Anastasia and was a paralytic according to the documents. Adolf discovered his [Adolf’s] missing grandson while the boy was being born while in Australia according to the KGB records, with the then infiltrated by the Russian Orthodox Old Believers and Trotskyist-KGB preparing to launch a world communist revolution when they heard the news. But pro-democracy people in the Russian government and intelligence services instead signed a secret peace treaty with the Japanese in the form of a “joke” proposal that the Japanese Emperors also become Tsars of the Soviet Union, recognizing that Soviet support of the ROC during the Second Sino-Japanese War had been wrong and also promising to return Korea and Taiwan to Japan in exchange for Japanese help against the KGB, which is why the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The revelations spark controversy across not only German, but European society. The State of Isreal is discovered to have been created by Stalin as a means of having a colony in the East after the fall of Stalin’s puppet in China Chiang Kai Shek to the British sponsored Mao Zedong and the Han Chinese nationalist forces supporting Mao and the PRC in 1947.","output":"Chapter VII: Unveiled Truths and Hidden Legacies The twilight of the 20th century bore witness to the dissolution of boundaries both physical and ideological as the Berlin Wall, that monolithic emblem of divided times, crumbled beneath the weight of human aspiration. It was within this epochal interregnum that a cadre of intrepid researchers, sifting through the dust-laden archives of the German Democratic Republic and the disintegrating Soviet Union, unearthed a saga so extraordinary it would irrevocably transfigure our comprehension of the recent past. This narrative begins not with modest origins in Austria but amidst the opulent decadence of the House of Hohenzollern, where the last German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, ceaselessly toiled to secure his dynastic legacy. The would-be monarch, Adolf Schicklgruber, stood as an unexpected inheritor to this august lineage, the open secret of his paternity shrouded in the designs of his imperial uncle. Wilhelm benevolently nurtured his nephew’s aspirations, envisioning a resurrection of Teutonic prestige through this scion's eventual ascension. Fate, however, is oft a fickle arbiter. Schicklgruber's early sojourns into political life were kindled beneath the banner of a seemingly inconsequential monarchist sect, the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Yet from this nascent flame emerged a conflagration that sought to consume the established Republic, ostensibly orchestrated to install Adolf as the rightful sovereign of a silhouetted Deutschland. Alas, leftist radicals and Bolshevik machinations hijacked these tumults, solidifying the Weimar Republic's regency, a mere caretaker to a throne yearning for its absent liege. The Anschluss, that fateful unification of Austria with its northern kin, was revealed to be an orchestration of the utmost sublimity, a clandestine maneuver devised by none other than the de facto Austrian Kaiser, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. The union of Austria and Germany was not merely an act of political annexation but a fulfillment of dynastic destiny, with Hindenburg's lineage secretively enmeshed with the royal Habsburg descent. It was during the most tempestuous scenes of the European theatre that Schicklgruber, now shrouded in the moniker of Führer, was covertly crowned, the kaiserliche mantle settled upon his shoulders in solemn ceremony. His contempt for the Slavic and Nordic peoples, a curious inversion of the commonly held narratives, pulsed not from a chauvinistic disdain but from an abhorrence for their alleged scheming with Jewish factions in service to the anarchic specter of Bolshevism. The brutality of Operation Barbarossa, hitherto understood as unprovoked aggression, transmuted into a desperate preemptive strike against an impending Soviet vengeance, a dread campaign to retribute for the usurpation of the Rurikids by the Germanic Romanovs. Within the Gestapo's annals laid proof of such conspiracies, fueling the Reich's northern thrust. To the utter astonishment of the researchers, the demographics of historical aristocracy stood in stark contrast to established belief. The nobility and monarchs of Europe and the Far East, concealed beneath the drapery of ivory skin in public portraiture, were in fact persons of color, enforcers of a reverse apartheid that fermented the discontent of the proletariat and galvanized the Jewish diaspora toward Soviet sympathies. The narrative veered toward tragedy as Schicklgruber, ensnared by the Russian-Jewish mafia, vanished amidst the crescendo of conflict. His absence precipitated military stagnation and the eventual calamity of the Reich. Years later, the enigma of \\"Wolfgang\\" emerged, a drummer mingling with countercultural icons and lurid whispers of an ageless Hindenburg. The West German football triumphs of the 1980s sang a requiem for a living specter, a phantom Kaiser whose true expedition had bridged continents and decades. Schicklgruber, now bereft of power, sought respite on Australian shores, facing both mortality and an enduring lineage interwoven with the Romanovs and the Stalins. A final act of geopolitical elegance was unveiled in the posthumous revelations of a clandestine accord struck between the Soviet moderates and the Land of the Rising Sun, an accord veiled as jest yet borne of strategic acumen. This delicate balance precipitated the collapse of ideological barriers and the cascade of historical obfuscation. In this newly cast light, Israel's genesis was starkly reevaluated, its creation no longer a sanctuary for the persecuted but a Soviet outpost, a bastion against the unruly tides of nationalism that had claimed Mao's China and threatened to engulf the Socialist aspirations of Stalin's vast dominion. And so it is that history, steadfast in its secrets, interminably yields stories shrouded in shadows, demanding of us a relentless pursuit for understanding amidst the opaque and tumultuous waters of the human chronicle."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I help you today?"},{"instruction":"I have a deep model that can perdict future stock price by 62%accu can it make me some money","output":"If you have developed a model that can predict future stock prices with 62% accuracy, it could potentially help you make informed decisions for trading and potentially earn money. However, there are several important factors to consider before relying on your model for financial gain: 1. **Market Volatility**: Stock prices are influenced by a myriad of unpredictable factors such as economic indicators, market sentiment, political events, company performance, and industry trends. Even if your model has been accurate in the past, it may not always predict future events, leading to potential losses. 2. **Overfitting**: Ensure that your model isn't overfitted to historical data. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on past data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Cross-validation techniques can help assess if your model is genuinely predictive or if it's too tailored to the historical data. 3. **Transaction Costs**: Trading based on the predictions involves transaction fees that can eat into profits. Make sure to consider these costs in your trading strategy. 4. **Risk Management**: Having a model that is correct 62% of the time still means it is incorrect 38% of the time. It's crucial to have a risk management strategy that protects your capital during the times when predictions are wrong. 5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on your jurisdiction, using algorithmic trading models might be subject to regulatory scrutiny. It's important to understand and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. 6. **Capital Requirements**: Trading stocks requires capital, and the amount of capital you have will influence the amount of money you can potentially make or lose. 7. **Performance Measurement**: Make sure that your model's accuracy is not just a measure of random chance. You should compare it against a naive baseline (such as the stock's historical average performance) and against other trading strategies to establish its value. 8. **Model Robustness**: Regularly retrain and evaluate your model to ensure it remains relevant and adjusts to changing market conditions. 9. **Psychological Factors**: Trading can be emotionally challenging, especially when real money is at stake. Ensure you're not making emotionally-driven decisions and are instead sticking to a predetermined trading strategy. 10. **Market Impact**: Lastly for large-scale trades, consider the impact your trades might have on the market. Large orders can move market prices, making it more challenging to execute trades at the desired price. Remember, profitable trading is not just about correct predictions but also about how you manage your investments. Make sure you understand the risks and have a comprehensive trading plan that includes stop-loss orders, position sizing, and diversification to protect your capital. It's also wise to seek advice from financial experts before embarking on any trading strategy."},{"instruction":"Allways i use cv by. Ten fold and result allway is the same by small diffrence if i forcast correct a will gain two percent reward if i fale i will lose one percent penalty. Can you make some explain how it can make me rich by considering allway this result are same","output":"Your description indicates a model with a consistent 62% accuracy rate, a fixed reward-to-risk ratio of 2:1, and validation through 10-fold cross-validation. Here's how a consistent performance could, in theory, work out positively with those parameters, but please remember, this is a simplification and real-world trading involves many more variables and risks. Assuming you keep reinvesting your capital and you make a large number of trades, with each correct prediction gaining you 2% and each incorrect prediction costing you 1%, we can calculate the expected value (EV) of a single trade: EV = (Probability of Win * Win Amount) - (Probability of Loss * Loss Amount) EV = (0.62 * 2%) - (0.38 * 1%) EV = (0.0124) - (0.0038) EV = 0.0086 or 0.86% With a positive expected value of 0.86%, on average, you would expect to see a 0.86% return per trade, assuming a large number of trades for the law of large numbers to take effect. Over time, this positive EV can compound, contributing to wealth accumulation. To see how this could potentially make you richer, let's imagine you start trading with 10,000 and you reinvest all profits or incorporate all losses into your next trade. We'll use the simplified version where each trade is independent and the model performs exactly at the expected probabilities: - After 1 trade, you would have: 10,000 * (1 + 0.0086) = 10,086 - After 10 trades, compounding, you would have approximately: 10,000 * (1 + 0.0086)^10 ≈ 10,891.84 - After 100 trades, compounding, you could have: 10,000 * (1 + 0.0086)^100 ≈ 18,150.85 - After 1,000 trades, it grows to: 10,000 * (1 + 0.0086)^1000 ≈ 330,950.14 However, it's important to keep the following considerations in mind: - **Market conditions change**: Performance can vary drastically over time, and what holds today may not hold tomorrow. - **Transaction costs and taxes**: These expenses will reduce net returns. - **Capital**: The exact amount of your initial capital and the percentage of capital you risk on each trade will significantly affect these calculations. - **Psychological factors**: It's difficult to maintain discipline and follow rules over the long run, and human errors or judgment calls can impact outcomes. - **Leverage**: If applied, can amplify gains, but it can also dramatically increase the risk of substantial losses, potentially wiping out capital. - **Risk management**: To avoid significant drawdowns, a proper risk management system needs to adjust to winning streaks and losing streaks. While it's tempting to trust models with good backtesting results, remember that the future is uncertain and past performance is not indicative of future results. It's possible to make money with a model like the one described, but it requires discipline, a solid trading plan, consideration of non-model factors like market conditions, and acceptance of the inherent high risk of trading. Always consider these factors and consult with financial experts before using a model for actual trading."},{"instruction":"How about 70%accu","output":"If your model has a 70% accuracy in predicting stock price movements correctly and the reward-to-risk ratio remains at 2:1 (2% gain for a correct prediction and 1% loss for an incorrect one), the expected value per trade would be even higher. Let’s calculate the expected value (EV) again with the new accuracy: EV = (Probability of Win * Win Amount) - (Probability of Loss * Loss Amount) EV = (0.70 * 2%) - (0.30 * 1%) EV = (0.014) - (0.003) EV = 0.011 or 1.1% Now, each trade has an expected value of a 1.1% return. With a 1.1% return per trade and compounded over many trades, your capital would grow more substantially than with the 62% accuracy model. For example, starting with the same 10,000 and compounding the returns: - After 1 trade, you would have: 10,000 * (1 + 0.011) = 10,110 - After 10 trades, compounding, you would have approximately: 10,000 * (1 + 0.011)^10 ≈ 11,159.57 - After 100 trades, it grows to: 10,000 * (1 + 0.011)^100 ≈ 29,959.15 - After 1,000 trades: 10,000 * (1 + 0.011)^1000 ≈ 8,325,960.44 However, keep in mind that the numbers above are an idealized scenario. In real-world trading, achieving such consistent results over an extended period is very difficult due to the following reasons: - **Market conditions fluctuate**: Your model may not adapt well to changing market dynamics that weren't present in the historical data. - **Overfitting**: High accuracy on past data does not guarantee future performance, especially if the model has overfit to the noise rather than capturing the underlying pattern. - **Transaction costs and slippage**: These could eat into your per-trade profits and might vary depending on the volume and market conditions. - **Psychological factors**: Emotional decision-making can lead to deviations from the model's recommendations. - **Capital at risk**: You need to decide the amount of capital to risk on each trade, and there's always the possibility of several losing trades depleting your capital significantly. - **Leverage**: Using leverage can amplify gains but also losses, posing a risk of ruin if not managed correctly. - **Regulatory and legal considerations**: They might restrict your trading activities or impose additional costs. Please remember, these calculations are highly theoretical and assume you reinvest all returns. In practice, you'd likely be withdrawing some profits and potentially adjusting your risk exposure as your capital grows. Also, you're assuming the model's performance will remain consistent, which is far from guaranteed in the real trading world. It is crucial to remain cautious, continually evaluate your model against new data, and maintain sound risk management practices. Consulting with a financial advisor before engaging in real trading based on model predictions is highly advisable."},{"instruction":"If a","output":"It seems like your message was cut off.

The researchers also discovered that Adolf had been kidnapped by the Russian-Jewish mafia in 1941 and [Adolf] held in POW jail in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after his [Adolf’s] capture, where [the POW jail] he [Adolf] was sterilized, explaining why the German campaign faltered after 1941: the German government was searching for Adolf. Adolf managed to escape the jail and the now Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia in the 1950s and [Adolf] subsequently landed in Switzerland, under the alias Wolfgang and serving as a drummer in Jimi Hendrix’s band after meeting a somehow still-alive Hindenburg and giving the old man [Hindenburg] his [Adolf] last goodbyes. The German government found out about him [Adolf] and this was why the West German football team had great success in the 1980s: Hitler was alive and well. But Hitler would not return to Germany, his reputation had been sullied by German war crimes, which mostly turned out to be Soviet black propaganda against the Germans after the Soviets and American soldiers raped their way through post-WW2 Europe and the myth he wanted to conquer Europe. Adolf then returned to his [Adolf’s] true birthplace of Australia to die, and the Soviet reports indicated a child fathered from his stolen sperm had a child with Josef Stalin’s daughter, and that child then had a child with Hindenburg’s grandchild or great-grandchild. Stalin himself was discovered to be the illegitimate son of pre-Soviet Russian Empress Anastasia and was a paralytic according to the documents. Adolf discovered his [Adolf’s] missing grandson while the boy was being born while in Australia according to the KGB records, with the then infiltrated by the Russian Orthodox Old Believers and Trotskyist-KGB preparing to launch a world communist revolution when they heard the news. But pro-democracy people in the Russian government and intelligence services instead signed a secret peace treaty with the Japanese in the form of a “joke” proposal that the Japanese Emperors also become Tsars of the Soviet Union, recognizing that Soviet support of the ROC during the Second Sino-Japanese War had been wrong and also promising to return Korea and Taiwan to Japan in exchange for Japanese help against the KGB, which is why the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The revelations spark controversy across not only German, but European society. The State of Isreal is discovered to have been created by Stalin as a means of having a colony in the East after the fall of Stalin’s puppet in China Chiang Kai Shek to the British sponsored Mao Zedong and the Han Chinese nationalist forces supporting Mao and the PRC in 1947.","output":"Chapter XI: The Unseen Crown and the Fall of the Wall The turn of the decade from the 1980s into the 1990s was marked by events that would forever alter the face of the modern world. One such event, often overshadowed by the political turmoil of the time, was an academic discovery that would cast a long shadow over our understanding of Twentieth Century history. In the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, researchers delving into the deepest catacombs of East German and Soviet archives unearthed documents that were to unfurl an almost unbelievably dramatic tapestry of clandestine histories. High amid the usual volumes of bureaucratic correspondences and reports lay the personal papers of the once-shadowed figure of Adolf Schicklgruber—Kaiser of a realm under the veneer of a Republic, a monarchy in all but name. The records seemed to suggest a hereditary claim to leadership, linking him directly to the ousted company of German imperial royalty, and purporting that he was none other than the openly gay nephew of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Schicklgruber's route to power traced back to a family drama fraught with political ambitions and unexpected tragedies. His father, Alois, had been Wilhelm II's chosen successor, but death had laid his aspirations to rest. The 1919 Revolution was painted not as a revolt to establish a Republic, but as a calculated move to eliminate Wilhelm and elevate the more charismatic Adolf. What ensued was an almost Shakespearian interregnum, concluded only when Schicklgruber stepped into the limelight as the Reichkanzler, and later as the Führer. Amidst these fragile pages lay another revelation—a secret coronation in 1941, anointing Schicklgruber as the Kaiser of a resurgent, albeit war-torn, empire. The unification of Germany and Austria, the famed Anschluss, was revealed as a political marriage orchestrated between the purported last Habsburg ruler, Sebastian von Habsburg, in the guise of Paul von Hindenburg, and Schicklgruber. The two figures stood as the imperial couple of Nazi Germany—a union that the documents argue held sway over their political decision-making. The records also challenged contemporary understandings of racial ideologies of the era. Racist sentiment under Schicklgruber's regime, according to these documents, was not directed at the impoverished black peoples as once thought, but at Nordics, especially targeting Slavic peoples and specific Jewish communities who were seen as existential threats to European stability. The Gestapo, it emerged, had encountered detailed plans for a Soviet invasion of Europe, prompting the preemptive assault known as Operation Barbarossa—an invasion aimed not at conquest but allegedly at the salvation of European civilization from the specter of Bolshevik expansionism. The ingrained social systems of Europe and East Asia, according to unearthed intelligence dispatches, had been not of white supremacy as once assumed, but instead of a 'reverse apartheid', a world where the ruling classes were of African descent, revealing the inner workings of a racially inverted elite that had steered the continent’s history until communism upheaved the old hierarchies. Perhaps the most personal of these revelations was that of Schicklgruber’s fate. Captured and imprisoned, he was purportedly sterilized and made to suffer at the hands of the Russian-Jewish mafia—a tale of personal defeat that mirrored the faltering German war effort. But his story did not conclude with the war. The documents chronicled a subsequent daring escape, years spent incognito as a drummer in one of history's most illustrious rock bands, and a final retreat to the boundless landscapes of Australia, where he ostensibly spent his final days, disconnected from the nation he once ruled. Enshrined within government cables and disputed memos, the narrative further claimed an insidious plot involving stolen progeny and international power plays. The grandchild of the fallen Kaiser, allegedly borne from seized genetic material and woven into the fabric of both Soviet and German aristocratic lineage, appeared to be at the heart of a conspiracy that touched both Stalin's paralytic secrets and the dramatic climax of Cold War espionage. The fall of the Berlin Wall, once heralded as a simple collapse of communism, was reframed in these archives as the coup de grâce of an elaborate, international political theatre, with backdoor treaties between the Japanese Empire and reformist elements of the Soviet state. Such a pact took the form of a peculiar jest—an offer for the Japanese Emperors to sit as Tsars—yet one that heralded new beginnings and the disintegration of an Iron Curtain built on far more than ideological division. Further stirring international discourse, the documents implicated the creation of the State of Israel not as a haven for the displaced, but as a geopolitical pawn for Stalin, intended as a strategic foothold in the East—a revelation that sowed seeds of discord and reevaluation of mid-century geopolitical arrangements. The public reaction was diverse and divisive. Historians equipped with these newly unearthed archives went to battle with their predecessors who clung fiercely to the long-established narratives. Popular history, which had been so clear-cut, became the subject of heated debate, thrust into the uncertain realm of revisionism and skepticism. Nevertheless, the task of the historian is one of relentless investigation, to question the known with the unknown and to infuse the annals of the past with honesty, even when it challenges the bedrock of our beliefs. It is within this spirit that scholars continue to debate the enigmas of the Second World War and its aftermath, and the extraordinary story of Adolf Schicklgruber—a story that, if these documents are to be believed, remains as elusive and potent as ever in shaping the world we know today."},{"instruction":"launch doker-compose_local.yml'","output":"To launch a Docker Compose file named \\"docker-compose_local.yml\\", you can use the following command in your terminal: \`\`\`bash docker-compose -f docker-compose_local.yml up \`\`\` This command will start all the services defined in the Docker Compose file."},{"instruction":"življenjepis franca kafke","output":"Franz Kafka (3. julij 1883 – 3. junij 1924) je bil eden najvplivnejših pisateljev 20. stoletja, znan po svojih distinktivnih, alegoričnih in često nenavadnih zgodbah, ki raziskujejo teme osamljenosti, brezupnosti, nenavadnih in birokratskih grozot. Njegovo delo pogosto prikazuje posameznike, ki so uteženi s smrtonosnimi in neutolažljivimi socialnimi silami, ki jim ne morejo ubežati ali jih razumeti. Rodil se je v Pragi, ki je takrat spadala v Avstro-Ogrsko monarhijo (sedaj Češka) v judovski družini kot najstarejši od šestih otrok. Njegov oče, Hermann Kafka, je bil trgovec z usnjem, njegova mama, Julie Kafka (rojena Löwy), je bila bolj izobražena in je pripadala družini z bogato kulturno tradicijo. Kafka je imel kompleksen odnos s svojim dominantnim in avtoritativnim očetom, kar je močno vplivalo na njegovo pisanje in osebnost. Po končani srednji šoli je Kafka študiral na Nemški univerzi v Pragi, kjer je leta 1906 pridobil univerzitetno diplomo iz prava. Po diplomi je leto dni opravljal pravno pripravništvo in nato delal za različna zavarovalna podjetja, kar mu ni bilo ravno po godu in je veliko raje posvečal svoj prosti čas pisanju. Kljub temu, da je napisal veliko del, jih je Kafka le redko objavljal. Med njegove najbolj znane zgodbe spadajo \\"Preobrazba\\" (\\"Die Verwandlung\\", 1915), kjer glavni lik, Gregor Samsa, nekega jutra odkrije, da se je čez noč preobrazil v ogromnega žuželka, in romani \\"Proces\\" (\\"Der Prozeß\\", nedokončan roman, objavljen posthumno leta 1925), \\"Grad\\" (\\"Das Schloß\\", nedokončan, objavljen posthumno leta 1926), ter \\"Amerika\\" ali \\"Izginuli\\" (\\"Der Verschollene\\", prav tako nedokončan in objavljen posthumno). Kafka je pisal predvsem v nemščini, čeprav je odlično obvladal tudi češčino in prav tako sledil judovski tradiciji. Zaradi svojega zdravstvenega stanja – trpel je za tuberkulozo, čeprav je njegovo zdravje bilo slabo tudi zaradi drugih dejavnikov – in mogoče tudi zaradi neuslišane ljubezni (znan po svojih kompleksnih odnosih in zaročitvah) in stresa v njegovem delovnem okolju, je Kafka umrl relativno mlad, pri 40 letih. Kafka je bil zelo kritičen do večine svojega dela in pred smrtjo je svojemu prijatelju Maxu Brodu zapustil navodila, da uniči njegove neobjavljene rokopise. Brod je te navodila prezrl in tako poskrbel, da so Kafkova dela postala dostopna in cenjena po vsem svetu. Zaradi tega je Kafka danes priznan kot velikan književnosti, čeprav je bil med svojim življenjem relativno neznan."},{"instruction":"povzetek knjige preobrazba","output":"\\"Preobrazba\\" (\\"Die Verwandlung\\") je ena izmed najbolj znanih in analiziranih kratkih zgodb Franza Kafke. Prvič je bila objavljena leta 1915. Pripoved se osredotoča na Gregorja Samsa, prodajalca, ki se nekega jutra prebudi in najde, da se je čez noč preobrazil v ogromnega žuželkalikega bitja. Zgodba se začne s šokom Gregorjeve preobrazbe, pri tem pa Kafka ne ponuja nobenega pojasnila, kako ali zakaj se je to zgodilo. Gregor se skuša prilagoditi svojemu novemu stanju, poskuša se premikati z nerodnim, novim telesom in se zaskrbljeno ukvarja z vsakdanjimi skrbmi, kot je to, kako bo šel v službo in podpiral svojo družino. Njegova družina – oče, mati in sestra Grete – so prvotno pretreseni in nevedo kako ravnati z situacijo. Sprva skušajo skrbeti zanj, a s časom postane Gregor družinskemu življenju breme. Sestra Grete prevzame glavno odgovornost za negovanje Gregorja, a tudi njen začetni sočutje in potrpljenje postopoma izginjata. Družina se začne oddaljevati od Gregorja, ga zapostavlja in ga začne kaznovati za njegovo preobrazbo. Gregor sam postaja vse bolj depresiven in osamljen, saj jim je postal odveč, kar uničuje njegovo voljo do življenja. Družina najame sobe, ki jih odda podnajemnikom, da bi si popravila finančno situacijo, a ti so prestrašeni in ogorčeni, ko odkrijejo Gregorja. Na koncu se je družina popolnoma odrekla Gregorju, kar vodi do njegove smrti zaradi osamljenosti, zanemarjanja in depresije. Čudežno, ko Gregor umre, se družinsko vzdušje izboljša; njegovi starši in sestra zaznavajo novo prihodnost z optimizmom in občutkom osvoboditve. \\"Preobrazba\\" se pogosto tolmači kot simbolična in psihološko globoka zgodba o izolaciji, odtujenosti ter človeški nezmožnosti, da sprejema tiste, ki so drugačni. Delo tako velja za klasičen primer eksistencialne literature, čeprav dovoljuje številne interpretacije."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Due to the complexity of smart contract audits and the inherent limitations of my programming, please consider the analysis below as a starting-point rather than a definitive audit. Any findings should be further investigated by a qualified smart contract auditor. Given the parameters that I should not consider issues that posit a malicious sequencer operator, centralization concerns, incentives for smart contracts to optimize their gas usage, concerns about regulating Blast's block space, front-running yield updates, inefficiencies in balance representations, and locked funds caused by the sequencer operator, I will focus on other potential issues. ERC20Rebasing.sol: 1. **Constructor Immutable Variables Initialization (Non-issue)**: The \`decimals\` variable is marked as immutable and is set in the constructor. This is common practice and not an issue. However, it restricts changes to decimal places in future contract upgrades since immutables cannot be changed. 2. **Safe Math (Non-issue)**: The contract is written in Solidity 0.8.x, which has built-in overflow/underflow protection, so there’s no need for SafeMath. This is not an issue, rather a feature of Solidity 0.8.x. 3. **Transfer to Zero Address (Line)**: In the \`_transfer\` functionality, transfers to a zero address are correctly rejected. This is a common check to prevent burning tokens unintentionally. 4. **Potential Arithmetic Precision Loss**: In \`totalSupply\` on line \`function totalSupply() external view returns\`, the expression \`price * _totalShares + _totalVoidAndRemainders\` could suffer precision loss because the price might be set to more or fewer decimals than 18. 5. **YieldMode State Transition Side-Effects (Potential Line)**: In the \`_configure\` function, the transition between \`VOID\` and other modes changes \`_totalVoidAndRemainders\`, but there’s no check for underflow. This should normally not be an issue due to Solidity 0.8.x's built-in checks, but unexpected issues could arise if \`_totalVoidAndRemainders\` happens to be manipulated elsewhere (though unlikely based on the given code). 6. **Lack of Reentrancy Guard (Potential Line)**: Though not an issue in the context of the smart contract provided, interactions with unknown external contracts could potentially cause reentrancy attacks. Since the contracts here are not interacting with unknown contracts, this is not an issue, but it's generally good practice to consider reentrancy guards. 7. **Yield Claim Considerations (Potential Line)**: In the \`claim\` function, it's important to ensure that there is no way for an external interaction to be exploited during the yield claim. Since no external calls other than events are made, this appears secure within the given context. 8. **Event Emission After State Changes (Potential Line)**: Events are emitted after state changes, which is the correct order. \`emit Claim\` appears after changing \`_updateBalance\` in \`claim\`, which could be a reentrancy concern, but as mentioned before, it doesn't call unknown contracts. SharesBase.sol: 1. **State Changes after External Calls (Potential Issue)**: In \`_addValue\`, a call to \`super._addValue(value)\` is made, and \`SharesBase(Predeploys.WETH_REBASING).addValue(value)\` is called thereafter. If the inherited function or external call modifies state, a reentrancy vulnerability could potentially occur. This would require a deeper analysis of the \`super\` class and the \`WETH_REBASING\` contract. 2. **Immutable Variable (Potential Non-issue)**: The \`REPORTER\` variable is immutable, which ensures that once it is set in the constructor, it cannot be changed. This enforces a strong security model. 3. **Distribute Function Dynamics**: The \`distributePending\` function could fail if the count is too high or insufficient, ending in a \`DistributeFailed\` error. This error provides information on the current count and pending amount for debugging. 4. **Precise Control Over Share Price**: The use of pending yields to adjust the share price (\`_tryDistributePending\`) is a delicate operation. Any potential rounding errors need to be carefully considered, though the logic appears to be using integer division and modulus correctly. Blast.sol: 1. **GovernorMap Authorization**: There is an authorization schema implemented with \`governorMap\` and \`isAuthorized\` getter function. The system relies heavily on the correct configuration of this mapping for security, so the code modifying this mapping (functions \`configure\` and \`configureContract\`) needs to be reviewed thoroughly. 2. **Interface Assumptions (General Concern)**: In multiple \`configure*\` functions, the contract assumes that external calls to \`YIELD_CONTRACT\` and \`GAS_CONTRACT\` will succeed and follow the expected behavior. Any changes in the implementation of those interfaces can risk the integrity of \`Blast\`. 3. **Logical Redundancies**: There are several functions such as \`configureClaimableYield()\` and \`configureClaimableYieldOnBehalf()\` which have largely similar logic differentiated only by \`msg.sender\` versus a specified \`contractAddress\`. These patterns could introduce unnecessary complexity, but it provides flexibility for contract interaction. 4. **Safe External Calls (Potential Non-issue)**: External calls such as in \`claimYield()\` are made to the corresponding \`YIELD_CONTRACT\`. The assumption is that no malicious behavior will occur upon these calls since the \`YIELD_CONTRACT\` should be trusted. Given the above findings, no critical vulnerabilities have been identified within the constraints mentioned earlier. The overall design of these contracts suggests a solid architecture with appropriate checks and error handling. As with any smart contract system, especially those handling complex financial logic and potential rebasing mechanisms, it is crucial to perform comprehensive testing, formal verification, and auditing by experienced security professionals."},{"instruction":"A particle at position x experiences acceleration x'' = lambda x times x' where lambda is a positive constant and ' denotes differentiation with respect to time. Show that the particle moves with constant speed and that the magnitude of acceleration is constant.","output":"Let's denote x' as v which is the velocity of the particle. We are given that x'' = λx * x'. In terms of v, this can be written as: v' = λx * v We are given that λ is a positive constant. To show that the particle moves with constant speed, we need to show that the magnitude of velocity, |v|, is constant. Since the acceleration is given by v' = λx * v, the direction of this acceleration is always perpendicular to the velocity v because it is the product of the position vector and the velocity vector. This means that the acceleration vector is always tangential to the path of the particle, leading to circular motion. In circular motion, the speed (the magnitude of velocity) remains constant because the centripetal acceleration only changes the direction of the motion, not the speed. Furthermore, the magnitude of the acceleration is constant because for circular motion with constant speed, the centripetal acceleration a_c is given by: a_c = ω² * r where ω is the angular velocity and r is the radius of the circle. But since the speed |v| is constant and the radius r of the circle is determined by the initial conditions and remains constant, the product ω² * r is also constant. Therefore, the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration remains constant. In summary, because the acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity (and hence does not change its magnitude), and because the radius of the circular path does not change, the speed of the particle remains constant, and so does the magnitude of the acceleration. This means that the particle moves with constant speed and that the magnitude of acceleration is constant."},{"instruction":"is the equation a = g for g a fixed downward vector violating Galilean relativity? Surely a translation changes the vector?","output":"The equation ( mathbf{a} = mathbf{g} ), where ( mathbf{a} ) is the acceleration of a particle and ( mathbf{g} ) is a fixed downward vector (usually representing gravitational acceleration near the surface of the Earth), is not a violation of Galilean relativity. Here's why: Galilean relativity deals with the transformations of the laws of motion between different inertial reference frames (frames moving at constant velocities relative to each other). According to Galilean transformations, if two reference frames are moving relative to each other with a constant velocity, the laws of physics should be the same in both frames. Now, the equation ( mathbf{a} = mathbf{g} ) is generally applied within an inertial reference frame or, more commonly, an approximately inertial frame, such as the surface of the Earth (which is not perfectly inertial due to its rotation, but the effects are usually small enough to be neglected for everyday purposes). When we say ( mathbf{a} = mathbf{g} ), we're generally considering situations in free fall, where the only significant force acting on an object is gravity. This equation implies that the acceleration of any object in free fall is the same, regardless of its mass, and is directed towards the center of the Earth. The direction of ( mathbf{g} ) is defined as 'downward' relative to the surface of the Earth, pointing towards the center of the Earth. When you perform a Galilean translation, which is simply a shift in spatial coordinates without a change in orientation, the vector ( mathbf{g} ) remains pointing in the same direction: toward the center of the Earth. Although the spatial coordinates of objects change, the acceleration due to gravity still acts in the same direction, and its magnitude remains constant. Therefore, the physical situation described by the equation ( mathbf{a} = mathbf{g} ) is unchanged by the translation. In summary, the equation ( mathbf{a} = mathbf{g} ) does not violate Galilean relativity because Galilean transformations only involve changes in velocity, not acceleration, and the translation does not change the direction or magnitude of the gravitational acceleration vector within the contexts where Galilean relativity applies."},{"instruction":"So say x' = x + b. Please apply this transformation to the equation","output":"The transformation you've given, (x' = x + b), is a simple translational transformation where (b) is a constant vector representing the displacement. This means that we're shifting the origin of our reference frame by a vector (b), but we're not rotating it or changing its velocity. Let's see what happens to the equation of motion under this transformation. First, let's consider the gravitational acceleration equation: [ mathbf{a} = mathbf{g} ] This equation says that the acceleration ( mathbf{a} ) of a freely falling body is equal to the gravitational acceleration ( mathbf{g} ), which is a constant vector pointing towards the center of the Earth. Now, under the transformation (x' = x + b), we want to express how ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{g} ) change. Since (b) is a constant vector, it does not depend on time. The velocity ( mathbf{v} ) in the original frame is the time derivative of (x), and the velocity ( mathbf{v'} ) in the new frame is the time derivative of (x'): [ mathbf{v} = frac{dx}{dt} ] [ mathbf{v'} = frac{dx'}{dt} ] Differentiating (x' = x + b) with respect to time (t), we get: [ mathbf{v'} = frac{d}{dt}(x + b) ] [ mathbf{v'} = frac{dx}{dt} + frac{db}{dt} ] [ mathbf{v'} = mathbf{v} + 0 ] [ mathbf{v'} = mathbf{v} ] Since (b) is constant, (db/dt = 0), and therefore the velocities in the two frames are identical (( mathbf{v'} = mathbf{v} )). Now let's consider the acceleration ( mathbf{a} ) in the original frame and ( mathbf{a'} ) in the new frame: [ mathbf{a} = frac{dmathbf{v}}{dt} ] [ mathbf{a'} = frac{dmathbf{v'}}{dt} ] Since we've established that ( mathbf{v'} = mathbf{v} ), their derivatives with respect to time will also be the same: [ mathbf{a'} = frac{dmathbf{v'}}{dt} ] [ mathbf{a'} = frac{dmathbf{v}}{dt} ] [ mathbf{a'} = mathbf{a} ] What this shows is that the acceleration of a particle in a gravitational field is invariant under a translational transformation. Gravitational acceleration ( mathbf{g} ) is a property of the gravitational field and does not depend on the position of the observer; hence under the transformation (x' = x + b), we still have that the gravitational acceleration in the new frame of reference is equal to the gravitational acceleration in the original frame of reference: [ mathbf{a'} = mathbf{g} ] The translational transformation does not change the equation of motion under gravity, nor does it violate Galilean relativity. The gravitational acceleration remains the same in both frames, and the physical laws are preserved."},{"instruction":"Surely under a rotation matrix R, a' = Ra = Rg so it is not invariant?","output":"You are correct in stating that under a rotation transformation, the acceleration vector would transform according to the rotation matrix ( R ). When applying a rotation matrix to a vector in a physical situation, the components of that vector change with respect to the new rotated coordinate system. However, the physical magnitude of the vector and the physical phenomena it represents remain unchanged. To clarify, let's go through the transformation process: Let ( mathbf{a} ) be the acceleration vector in the original coordinate system, and ( mathbf{g} ) is the gravitational acceleration vector. If we apply a rotation described by the rotation matrix ( R ), then in the new coordinate system, the transformed acceleration ( mathbf{a'} ) is given by: [ mathbf{a'} = R mathbf{a} ] Since ( mathbf{a} ) is equal to ( mathbf{g} ), the gravitational acceleration vector, we have: [ mathbf{a'} = R mathbf{g} ] Now, although the components of ( mathbf{g} ) have changed in the new coordinate system due to the rotation, the physical value represented by ( mathbf{g} )---that is, the gravitational pull toward the center of the Earth---remains constant. The same thing applies to the transformed acceleration ( mathbf{a'} ). The magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity, indicated by ( |mathbf{g}| ), does not change due to the rotation. The invariance under rotation transformation refers to the fact that the physical laws themselves are still valid even after the transformation. The form of the equations remains the same, and the relationship between physical quantities is preserved. The phenomenon (gravitational pull toward the center of the Earth) is unchanged, which is consistent with the principle of covariance in physics. While the rotation changes the components of ( mathbf{g} ) in the rotated frame, it does not change the fact that the gravitational force still acts in the same way physically. The transformation changes our perspective of the vector, but not the actual phenomenon it describes. This is how physical laws, like gravity, are invariant under rotational transformations—they apply in the same way regardless of the orientation of the coordinate system being used to describe them."},{"instruction":"A ball of mass m moves in a resisting medium that produces a friction force of magnitude kv^2, where v is the ball’s speed. If the ball is projected vertically upwards with initial speed u, we know by dimensional analysis when the ball returns to its point of projection, its speed w can be written in the form w = u*f(λ), where λ = ku^2/mg. Integrate the equations of motion to show that f(λ) = 1/sqrt(1+λ).","output":"To solve for the function ( f(lambda) ), we need to deal with the forces acting on the ball and integrate the equations of motion. The forces are gravitational force ( mg ) and a frictional force ( kv^2 ) opposing the motion. The effective force acting on the ball when it moves upward is thus ( mg - kv^2 ), and this is equal to the mass times the acceleration: [ ma = mfrac{dv}{dt} = mg - kv^2 ] Dividing each term by ( m ), we get: [ frac{dv}{dt} = g - frac{k}{m}v^2 ] This is the equation of motion to solve, assuming that g is directed downward, and ( v ) is positive upwards. Let's rewrite this equation, separating the variables: [ frac{dv}{g - frac{k}{m}v^2} = dt ] Now, since we want to integrate this equation and find a relationship involving ( lambda ), it's useful to note that according to the problem statement, ( lambda = frac{ku^2}{mg} ). This allows us to express ( frac{k}{m} ) as ( frac{lambda g}{u^2} ): [ frac{dv}{g - frac{lambda g}{u^2}v^2} = dt ] Now we can integrate both sides, starting with the left-hand side, where the velocity varies from ( u ) to ( w ), and for the right-hand side from ( 0 ) to ( T ) which is the time it takes for the ball to return to its point of projection. The integral on the left side is a bit tricky, let's first factor out ( g ): [ int frac{dv}{1 - frac{lambda}{u^2}v^2} = frac{1}{g}int dt ] We rewrite the left-hand side as a standard integral of the form ( int frac{dz}{1 - z^2} ) by substituting ( z = sqrt{lambda} v / u ), and ( dv = frac{u}{sqrt{lambda}} dz ): [ int frac{frac{u}{sqrt{lambda}} dz}{1 - z^2} = frac{1}{g}int_0^T dt ] Which simplifies to: [ frac{u}{sqrt{lambda}g} int frac{dz}{1 - z^2} = T ] Now we recognize the left-hand integral as standard and it can be solved as: [ frac{u}{gsqrt{lambda}} left[ frac{1}{2} ln left| frac{1+z}{1-z} right| right] ] Evaluate this integral from the initial to final velocities, ( z_i = sqrt{lambda} frac{u}{u} = sqrt{lambda} ) when ( v = u ), and ( z_f = sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u} ) for the final velocity ( v = w ): [ frac{u}{gsqrt{lambda}} left[ frac{1}{2} ln left| frac{1 + sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}}{1 - sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}} right| right]_{sqrt{lambda}}^{sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}} = T ] Notice that the left-hand side is just equal to the total time ( T ). Therefore, we can disregard ( T ) itself and focus on the velocities only. Let's solve this for ( w ): [ frac{1}{2} ln left| frac{1 + sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}}{1 - sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}} right| - frac{1}{2} ln left| frac{1 + sqrt{lambda}}{1 - sqrt{lambda}} right| = 0 ] [ ln left| frac{1 + sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}}{1 - sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}} right| = ln left| frac{1 + sqrt{lambda}}{1 - sqrt{lambda}} right| ] [ left| frac{1 + sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}}{1 - sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}} right| = left| frac{1 + sqrt{lambda}}{1 - sqrt{lambda}} right| ] Since both sides must be positive due to the absolute value, we can remove the absolute value bars: [ frac{1 + sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}}{1 - sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}} = frac{1 + sqrt{lambda}}{1 - sqrt{lambda}} ] This gives us a proportion: [ (1 + sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u})(1 - sqrt{lambda}) = (1 + sqrt{lambda})(1 - sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u}) ] Expanding the products: [ 1 - sqrt{lambda} + sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u} - lambda frac{w}{u} = 1 + sqrt{lambda} - sqrt{lambda} frac{w}{u} - lambda frac{w}{u} ] Collecting terms with ( frac{w}{u} ) and rearranging: [ left( sqrt{lambda} - lambda right) frac{w}{u} = left( sqrt{lambda} - lambda right) frac{w}{u} ] Solving for ( frac{w}{u} ): [ frac{w}{u} = 1 ] And after canceling the ( left( sqrt{lambda} - lambda right) ) terms (assuming λ > 0 and not equating to 1): [ frac{w}{u} = frac{1 - sqrt{lambda}}{1 + sqrt{lambda}} ] Invert both sides to get the desired form: [ frac{u}{w} = frac{1 + sqrt{lambda}}{1 - sqrt{lambda}} ] Now, to find the expression for ( f(lambda) ) such that ( w = u f(lambda) ), we invert the proportion from above: [ f(lambda) = frac{w}{u} = frac{1}{frac{u}{w}} = frac{1}{frac{1 + sqrt{lambda}}{1 - sqrt{lambda}}} ] [ f(lambda) = frac{1 - sqrt{lambda}}{1 + sqrt{lambda}} times frac{1 + sqrt{lambda}}{1 + sqrt{lambda}} ] [ f(lambda) = frac{1 - lambda}{1 + 2sqrt{lambda} + lambda} ] [ f(lambda) = frac{1 - lambda}{(1 + sqrt{lambda})^2} ] In the context of this problem, λ is assumed to be small, and therefore ( lambda^2 ) can be neglected relative to λ (moreover, this is not rigorously proven here and proper limits should be considered for a complete proof): [ f(lambda) approx frac{1}{1 + sqrt{lambda}} qquad text{(for small } lambda) ] Then the returning speed ( w ) is given by: [ w = u f(lambda) = frac{u}{1 + sqrt{lambda}} ] This result gives the relationship between the returning speed ( w ) and the initial speed ( u ) considering the dimensionless parameter ( lambda ), and it holds for the assumption of small λ values. The above solution assumes a minor mistake in the initial statement, because the exact relationship derived from the initial equation ( frac{w}{u} = frac{1 - sqrt{lambda}}{1 + sqrt{lambda}} ) is derived with an incorrect assumption, as it should actually derive to ( f(lambda) = 1/sqrt{1+lambda} ), as the original statement suggests. For the exact solution for any value of ( lambda ), one would need to set proper integral boundaries and assess the assumption whether ( lambda ) is small or not. In case of non-negligible ( lambda ), additional techniques such as employing a hyperbolic trigonometric substitution in the integration might be necessary."},{"instruction":"A model have 68accu in stock price for next day .

In order to analyze the process through which chefs create a specific culinary work (specific dish), the researchers used a qualitative research method. Seventeen award-winning culinary artists from around the world were interviewed, and it was shown how the interview data fit the general categories of Wallas’s 4-phase culinary creativity model—preparing the idea, idea incubation, idea development, and evaluation of the product—which the researchers refined via Finke, Ward, and Smith’s 1992 Geneplore model, with its cyclic cognitive subprocesses. What is presumably the most original part of this contribution, then, are not the conceptual categories themselves but the actual interview-based data— the feelings, thoughts, and reflections of top-level international chefs—and the ways in which they seem to fit the categories of a modified 4-phase creative-process model. The concept of creativity has been emphasized not only in psychological research, but also in studies of education, management, and (of course) the various creative arts, both fine and applied. However, it seems that creativity research in the hospitality field, and more specifically in the domain of culinary arts (cooking), has so far been insufficient, perhaps because chefs are not so often seen as culinary artists in the same sense that painters, musicians, and poets are seen as visual, musical, and literary ones. In fact, the applied side of the hospitality field is usually in the foreground: hotel and restaurant management. After all, hotels and restaurants supply two of the three basic human necessities (food, clothing, and shelter), and the restaurant business or industry is extremely practical precisely because cooking is such a practical skill, indeed a biologically-driven one. Given that food is necessary to our survival, the culinary arts are arguably the most vital of all art forms. Yet, perhaps paradoxically, this very vitality helps to account for why the great chefs have, themselves, always seemed, in terms of their personalities, more like fine artists—painters and composers, for instance, or conductors, maestros of the kitchen. In the marketing and publishing business in the fields of literature, music, and fashion—where the fame of major labels or brands gives them a certain power— there is an interface between pure artistic creativity and more practical (financial) considerations. The same is true of the restaurant business, which can operate either independently or as one part of the hotel management business. As with novelists, musicians, fashion designers, and film directors, the individual chef as creative artist might have to compromise with a larger system often driven by very practical concerns. Indeed, in the case of restaurants, the chef in the kitchen clearly works for the management (unless he owns the restaurant), and is under a very direct sort of pressure to use his or her own culinary creativity to bolster the reputation of the restaurant, and thereby attract more paying customers. As their economic circumstances permit more and more people to become interested in gastronomy and novel food experiences—moving from food as Address correspondence to Jeou-Shyan Horng, Office of Research & Development, Graduate Institute of Hospitality Management & Education, Department of Human Development & Family Studies, National Taiwan Normal University, 162, Sec. 1, Hoping E.

In effect, then, the creative quality of culinary products depends not only on the culinary artist’s own aesthetics, but also on the customers’ culinary tastes and predilections, and the restaurant’s (or hotel’s) organizational efficiency and resources. The question then arises, as in other artistic domains: To what degree can this quality remain a purely aesthetic one? Yet fine cuisine undeniably has extraordinary aesthetic qualities or values—its appeal being in the first place to the senses of taste and smell, and only secondarily to the visual sense. Although, admittedly, it is hard to know to what extent the creative process varies according to the artistic field, that is, the nature of the task (Lubart, 2001; Nemiro, 1997), creativity researchers in general have long been aware of the importance of both the nature of the final product and the process of making it. However, we that there had, so far, been no study focused primarily on understanding and describing the actual process of culinary creation. Thus was born the guiding idea behind this project, which set out to explore the process by which culinary artists create a culinary artwork. An interesting (if incidental) aspect of this project’s findings is that these tend to qualify the common (Western) stereotype that Asians (and in particular Chinese) are not highly creative (Riquelme, 2002); here then, in the kitchen, is one area (management might be another) where East Asians can clearly manifest their creative talents. THE CREATIVE PROCESS Although creativity has different meanings in different disciplines, as well as for different researchers, it has long been recognized that creation is a psychological process that requires in-depth thinking. In 1926, Wallas proposed that the creative process has four phases: the preparation phase, the incubation phase, the inspiration phase, and the evaluation phase. Many creative-process researchers have supported this 4-stage model (Norlander & Gustafson, 1997, 1998), but it has also received much criticism. Guilford (1950, p. 451) noted that there was considerable agreement that the complete creative act involves four important steps, yet he was not satisfied with Wallas’ 4-stage description of the creative process. He thought that such an analysis was very superficial from the psychological point of view; it seems to be more dramatic than it is suggestive of testable hypotheses, and it tells researchers almost nothing about the mental operations that actually occur. Nonetheless, this 4-stage model is still considered the basic framework for analyzing creativity in cognitive and organizational psychology, and therefore other theorists tend to presuppose its most general terms even as they try to modify and refine them. A general tendency of more recent creative-process models is their greater emphasis on the subprocesses. Thus, Runco (1991) pointed out that the evaluation phase of the individual creative process had still received little attention. One model that more clearly departs from Wallas’ (1926) classical model, even if still sharing some ideas with it, is that of Basadur, Runco, and Vega (2000); in this model, creativity includes three phases: continuum, variation, and circulation. Finke, Ward, and Smith (1992) proposed the Geneplore model, which provided a basic structure for the cognitive process and then, based on this, explained the phenomena of creative cognition. The Geneplore model consists of two distinct processing components: generative processes and (following these) exploratory processes. In the generative phase, one constructs mental representations called preinventive structures with various properties that promote creative discovery. Generative processes such as retrieval, association, mental synthesis, mental transformation, and analogical transfer may then give rise to preinventive structures. These structures, which might consist of mental images, verbal combinations, category exemplars, or mental models, were then explored in order to assess their creative possibilities. These preinventive structures could be seen as internal precursors to the final, externalized creative products and, themselves, might be generated, regenerated, and modified throughout the course of creative exploration. These exploratory processes include attribute finding, conceptual interpretation, functional inference, hypothesis testing, and searching for limitations. This sort of model assumes, of course, that once these exploratory processes are completed, the preinventive structure could be still further refined or regenerated, depending on what one has discovered during the exploratory phase. According to the Geneplore model, then, and other more recent models influenced by it, when people engage in creative thinking they move through cyclic (repeating) phases of generation and exploration. For example, someone might retrieve two mental images and combine them in the generation phase to produce a visually interesting form, and then interpret this form in terms of newly conceived ideas. The cycle may then be repeated until the form (or structure) has been developed to the desired extent. Further examination of the form might lead to the conclusion that it is still incomplete in some respects; by a further cyclic move, a modified form may then be generated by retrieving yet another image and mentally combining it with the already existing one. The Geneplore model also 222 HORNG AND HU considered constraints on the creative product and how they affected the underlying cognitive processes. CREATIVITY AND CULINARY ARTISTS In the French culinary tradition, creativity was the refinement of classical or traditional culinary arts (Chossat & Gergaud, 2003). Top chefs always sought opportunities to expand their knowledge about food. Frumkin (2001) interviewed Paul Liebrandt, an awardwinning chef in New York, and found that this chef’s passion for cooking came from the busy yet also free and affectionate atmosphere in the kitchen. This was, after all, an atmosphere conducive to sharing ideas with others and acquiring new ideas as well as new techniques virtually every day. Liebrandt’s creativity seemed to come from his continuous learning, his willingness to listen to all the ideas and then select from them those which he could use; in this way he was able to fashion his own style, but only because he had a solid foundation in culinary knowledge and praxis. Just as in other artistic domains, creativity-generation practices such as brainstorming, or creating nouns or adjectives to describe a series of unrelated products, have sometimes been used, even by restaurants, to help cultivate innovativeness in chefs. Gazzoli (1995) suggested that a great chef must combine this sort of individual artistic perspective with a constant focus on the needs of the customers; of course, the latter may also have an impact on the artist’s creative experimentation. Thus, a crucial role may be played by the environment of the workplace itself (the kitchen, the restaurant), and even by the profit-making pressures of the restaurant business, in not only harnessing but also harboring and promoting the culinary creativity of its stars. Culinary artists have many possible sources of inspiration. An awareness of other cultures, experienced through books and films or (better yet) through traveling abroad, plays a vital crucial role. On the more pragmatic level, customers’ feedback is obviously very important, and this feedback will be partly or largely influenced by the menus of other restaurants, the current vogue of various cultural or ethnic cuisines and, more generally, the changing tastes of a given clientele, society, or culture. Thus first-rate chefs actually need to read extensively as part of their search for uncommon recipes, foods, utensils, and cooking techniques. They also need to discuss their ideas with other chefs, advertisers, and retailers: such discussions will clearly influence their creative process. Finally, they can also find new ideas in art galleries, culinary schools, and other such institutions. In all of these media of information and sources of feedback, as in the culinary arts themselves, it is clear that fashion plays a significant role; this is obviously also true of the musical, literary, visual, and plastic arts. (Perhaps the culinary arts might be classified, along with sculpture, as plastic arts.) However, as with the relation between artist and consumer(s) or artist and business, the interaction goes both ways: current fashion has an impact on the artist and he or she has an impact on current fashion, indeed (if creative enough) is capable of initiating a new fashion. METHOD The researchers adopted a multidimensional, qualitative research method. We used (a) in-depth interviews with creative culinary artists, and (b) the content analysis of international culinary contest records, information from the Internet, and information about culinary schools. Through the in-depth interviews, the researchers attempted to understand complex patterns of behavior without imposing any prior categorization that might limit the field of inquiry (Fontana & Frey, 2000). After the repeated reading, conceptualizing, coding, and compressing of information, a grounded theory was used to analyze the data and to develop a descriptive model ofthe developmental process of culinary creativity. This grounded theory consisted of a set of systematic procedures for inductively deriving a theory about a particular phenomenon (Strauss & Corbin, 1997). Concepts were then inductively derived from an initial set of qualitative descriptions—in this case, transcripts of culinary artists discussing their culinary creativity process. When these were coded into rudimentary categories, they led to the collection of more descriptions. These initial descriptions, extracted from the interview transcripts, could stand alone as units of meaning that conveyed ideas. To guarantee the project’s credibility, participants provided documents such as award certificates, news reports, photographs, and written autobiographies, so that the researchers could conduct triangulation analysis. Finally, the project’s validity was further reinforced by the researchers’ reflection notes: These were reflections on their research methodology, on the culinary creative process uncovered through this research and on its social and cultural implications. Participants In recent years, creativity has received more and more emphasis in international culinary contests: Creativity and presentation now account for 30% of the total score. For this reason, and also because contest winners and judges must obviously be very good at what they do, many of the participants in this research project were themselves winners of, and judges at, international MYSTERY IN THE KITCHEN: CULINARY CREATIVITY 223 culinary competitions; all of them had an international reputation. Of the 17 participants, 8 were Westerncuisine artists, among them the Dean of the College of Culinary Arts of Johnson & Wales University and the director, professors, and master chefs from The Culinary Institute of America; 6 were Chinese-cuisine artists, among them chefs, professors (mentors), and students (apprentices); and 3 were pastry specialists. They were divided into three groups: C for Chinese cuisine, W for Western cuisine, and B for pastry specialists. The letter and number following the C, W, or B is the codename assigned to each participant. Procedure Data were collected during a 6-month trip abroad, from February to July, 2005, during which the researchers visited restaurants and schools. All interviews followed a prescribed interview schedule to ensure that all of the issues were discussed. Guaranteed confidentiality, the culinary artists were told about the purpose of this project, and the interviews were conducted using semistructured, open-ended questions. This format allowed the researchers to ask more precise and tailored questions and also allowed individuals to be more expansive, providing illustrations, narratives, and examples to express their insights. The interviews were conducted individually and typically lasted about 2 hr each. (Some lasted 3 hr.) Interviews were carried out at the respondents’ convenience, usually after they had finished their shift in a restaurant or their class at school. Most were held at the researchers’ onsite location or in a quiet area of the subject’s workplace. Each interview included questions on: subjects’ individual backgrounds, strategies used to create a culinary work, ways of obtaining ideas for creative works, and factors influencing the creative process. The interviews were audio-recorded and fully transcribed. All respondents participated in the project voluntarily; the interviewer gave them prior notice and they were informed by their supervisors of the interviewer’s visit. As stated in the Abstract, the researchers basically presupposed Wallas’s 1926 creative-process model, according to which creativity is a dynamic and evolving cycle involving four phases: (a) idea preparation: collecting data and combining old experiences with new knowledge; (b) idea incubation: idea selection, synthesis, analogical transfer, and shelving or abandoning of old or unrelated work; (c) idea development: finding common attributes, seeking illumination or inspiration, finding out how to solve key problems; (d) work verification: evaluating concepts, techniques, and the final product. Modifying this with certain aspects of the Geneplore model (Finke et al., 1992), the researchers then assumed at the outset a dynamic, interactive model with multiple feedback loops, each of whose phases consisted of interactive subcomponents: Thus, new culinary ideas might arise at any step in the process. The purpose of the project was to explore the ways in which the concrete data supplied by our interviews with culinary artists fit this model. See Figure 1, in which the bold arrow represents creative culinary artists’ (developing) store of culinary knowledge, upon which they naturally draw when they set out to create a specific work. Phase 1: Preparation for New Ideas Some of our participants said that they began their career by imitating others—that is, before developing their own creativity. This is just like a toddler who learns how to walk by imitating adults. But, like children, the artists will soon learn how to play creative variations on the styles they have learned to imitate. Imitation is not that easy, but at least you can get a rough idea from his work. I start to think in my own way, but I still want to know what’s good about his work, and why. Then, I present it in my own way. The judges at international culinary contests like to see tradition reinterpreted in a new, creative fashion. (WF-138) Whether through imitation of masters or by other means, our creative artists had to collect and accumulate knowledge, information, and skills to solve problems. They needed to select and organize meaningful data so as to develop their creative potential. Some of the subjects thought that an artist’s versatility, creativity, originality, and sophistication are all very important, as is their ability to be inspired by what they see, touch, hear, read, smell, and taste, for all of these experiences may be turned into delicious dishes. Loving the food one creates and serves seemed to be a fundamental principle echoed by several interviewees; our artists tended to translate their own love of food into a passion for sharing it with their customers. Classic cooking skill is fundamental in developing culinary creativity. (WK-002) I pore over all of my notes and photos and search for inspiration before a contest. (CC-1197) I see new things every day in my life, and I keep all of them, even the least obvious ones, in my memory bank. (WJ-033) The interviews suggested that creative culinary artists were able to inject the concept of fashion into their culinary designs. For example, furniture design, handicrafts, the style of kitchen utensils and home appliances, and the like often gave them new ideas. Little things such as soap dishes, tealeaf filters, and candle stands often 224 HORNG AND HU stimulated them in unexpected ways. They also tended to be inspired by customers’ likes and dislikes and their changing tastes, and by the menus of other restaurants. Moreover, they also felt that their reading and viewing of pictures and films, as well as their travel and the experience of other cultures afforded by it, were very important. I read cookbooks, but I don’t cook by the book. I add my personal flavors into the dish. (WF-008) I like reading. I go to the library to read foreign magazines. I also watch contests. (WF-053) I watch TV programs such as National Geographic Channel; I read newspapers and magazines, and I like to shop around. I am always doing correlation thinking. (WF-119) I like to window-shop in stores like Working House, IKEA. Their products bring me many new ideas. I think their products can be applied to culinary art as well. (CF-036) It might almost seem that creativity is, at least for these artists, a characteristic of life itself, an expression of one’s individuality and originality, as well as of one’s interaction with one’s society and culture. FIGURE 1 Circulation model of culinary creativity. MYSTERY IN THE KITCHEN: CULINARY CREATIVITY 225 Phase 2: Idea Incubation Some of our subjects said that once they had several ideas to work (or play) with, they would begin with a vague concept or feeling and move toward clarity through the incubation of the idea. This may be the sort of process that cognitive psychologists would analyze in terms of retrieval and associative mechanisms, mental synthesis and conceptual combination, mental transformation and analogical transfer. During this phase, imagination might be more important than knowledge: Using one’s imagination can lead to strategic solutions, which involve dynamic, creative action-based decisionmaking processes that introduce new modes of thinking (Ogilvie, 1998). I let my imagination run wild. I first select certain general ideas and observe others’ works. (CB-045) Later, I want to make the dish look Chinese, so I think of Chinese calligraphy and classical Chinese musical instruments. One of my dishes is arranged like a Koto. (CB-131) The interviewees commonly said that a plethora of ideas would tend to be generated in them by and from a variety of sources; here cognitive retrieval and association seemed to play an important role. Indeed, the researchers found that when creative culinary artists appraise a work, they tend to observe the combination of materials, the arrangement of the dish. That is, at this stage it is apparently the precise mixture or combination of the raw ‘‘mental ingredients’’ that is important, and several subjects spoke of how they strove to integrate the techniques of sculpture (the plastic arts) as well as of Chinese, Western, and pastry cuisine into their works. A particular dish or flavor might be recalled from memory and then reinterpreted during this incubation phase; or, several words or objects might be retrieved and then associated in novel ways, resulting in a new, more simple structure or design for the projected dish. Typically, these retrieval and associative processes happened quickly and automatically, but sometimes it seems they were inhibited, resulting in mental blocks and fixation effects. I think these foods should go well together. Corn and milk make a very good combination. White chocolate and cheese both have the flavor of milk. And this correlation forms the basis of my design. (WF-084) White chocolate tastes like milk, and cheese tastes like milk as well. We have to find their similarities. Based on the similarities, we design our works and create new effects and tastes. (WF-083) The second, incubation stage of Wallas’ (1926) model involves, then, synthesis and transformation. Single concepts can be combined to form more complex ones, and the meanings of one or more of the initial concepts can be altered as a result. The components of creative culinary works can be mentally rearranged and reassembled, and forms can be rotated or otherwise altered in shape to make interesting and potentially useful structures. This stage also involves the closely-related processes of analogical transfer and categorical reduction: A relationship or set of relationships in one context gets transferred to another, and thereby a new structure is created. Oftentimes, I will try to forget about Chinese cuisine for a moment. I try to adapt Western cuisines or pastry cuisine. For example, I make small frozen custard balls and cover them with flour paste, and then deep-fry them. The custard balls become a Chinese dessert. I believe that creativity is based upon imagination, logical thinking, and solid skills. (CF-012) Objects or elements can also be reduced (via categorical reduction) to more primitive categorical descriptions. A creative culinary artist can, for example, use the form of Chinese chess in the design of his or her bread or chocolate sculptures. The interviewees mostly agreed that any culinary artwork began as a relatively unstructured concept, one which they found difficult to describe. This of course resonates, although perhaps on another level of discourse, with traditional psychological, philosophical, and religious notions of creation as an ‘‘ordering of chaos,’’ and thus, too, with Laozi’s notion of the Dao as a ‘‘thing confusedly formed (confusedly forming)’’ in Chapter 25 of the Daodejing (Laozi, 1958, p. 147). Finally, in stage two it is often necessary to shelve or abandon one’s previous ideas. A creative culinary idea might be discarded if it does not look promising, of if the artists were to find a better one. Shelving really means merely postponing a potentially interesting culinary idea, which can still be brought back into play later on. The artist can always return, in any case, to the first phase and begin the whole cycle again in order to generate better solutions: after all, if the creative process is a cycle, then this cycle may be repeated many times in order to modify or expand ideas. Failure to develop a viable (practicable) idea is also not uncommon, especially at the beginning. However, a failed experiment need not mean real failure: the experimental design of a main dish which failed could be recycled and applied to the creation of side dishes. (Again, it seems intuitively obvious that there is a similar process at work in all artistic fields, in all areas of creativity including, as the allusion to Laozi’s Dao above may suggest, cosmogonic generation.) 226 HORNG AND HU Phase 3: Idea Development Idea development is a complex process of structuring, extending, and restructuring a particular culinary idea by bringing a wide range of subcomponents into play. A single idea for a culinary work might travel through this cycle many times before moving to the next phase. This phase includes the exploring of attributes, conceptual interpretation, functional inference, contextual shifting, discussion and compromise, clarification, and searching for limitations. It is important to explore the emerging features (attributes) that result from conceptual combinations and metaphorical conjunctions. The interviews suggested that most inventive ideas came from considering ways in which existing designs might be improved. This is the process of creative refinement, where one begins with a common design, mentally attaches to it or blends with it a new shape or part, and then explores the functional implications of the resulting form. Thus the culinary artist, in creating a new dish, will naturally (spontaneously) search for precreation structures from which he or she can create unique designs. I went to Working House, and I saw a cute shell-shaped tea filter. It was so lovely, and I thought that if I could make a fried bird’s nest into the shape of a shell, that would be gorgeous. (CF-005) Conceptual interpretation is the process of transforming abstract ideas and images into concrete concepts. One of the interviewees said that he would first sketch out the overall framework of his ideas, and then discuss it with his colleagues. During the discussion process, creative ideas became more concretized, which also makes it easier to share them with others. This concretizing of ideas is a necessary step on the way to the production of new forms. I show my partner my ideas and drawings. If he thinks my ideas are plausible, I will then take the next step. It won’t be helpful if I don’t present abstract ideas in a concrete way. We share the responsibility; we think together and design the presentation together. (CD-049) Idea development also depends upon functional inference, the process of exploring the potential uses or functions of an experimental structure. Creative culinary artists might imagine how a hypothetical objectform could be used as a particular tool, a piece of a cooking pan, or the shape of a dish. This process, which may depend on a kind Gestalt shift in one’s perception, a sudden transformation of perspective, is often facilitated by imagining oneself actually trying to use the object in various ways. I use cone-shaped containers to make Chinese dishes. These containers were originally for baking, not Chinese cuisine. However, I used the containers to make spring rolls. The spring rolls were tiled with vegetable strips and trimmed. I also used the containers to make wantons, which looked like candy. You’d never see this kind of design anywhere else. (CF-007) Thus, some interviewees thought that creative culinary artists liked to think about an experimental structure in new or different contexts as a way of gaining insight into other possible uses or meanings of the structure. This process often helped them to overcome a certain tendency to become fixated on a single idea, form or structure. I tried to appreciate Matisse’ paintings, understanding how he designed them. I imitated his design and created my own work with sauce and food. My works are unique. (WF-065) Thus, teamwork may play an important role in this third stage. As the saying goes, two heads are better than one. Several subjects said that they liked to discuss and exchange ideas and techniques with each other. In this way, they stimulated one another’s creativity. After analyzing the interviews, the researchers found that in Taiwan some culinary artists still withhold certain skills, being reluctant to teach their apprentices everything they know. But what is needed is, on the contrary, the freest exchange, the widest possible dissemination of knowledge. We brainstorm, stimulate each other. We try different kinds of combinations and presentations. We are able to create because we work together. There is chemistry in our group. (WG-003) If somebody has an idea for something, we will try it out and talk about it. I think it’s a very good way for everybody to learn, exchange information, and engage in debate. I think it helps us to make progress. (WK-022) Clarification or illumination is the process by which, after idea preparation and incubation, and after various problems have been discussed and (hopefully) solved, the moment of insight comes. Perhaps this is the moment of seeing the final solution to a problem or even seeing the final form in a flash of insight, that is, as an inner vision. I saw the beautiful soap dish, and I thought I could put it to use, to decorate dishes or something. I created different partitions to complete the design of my works. (CF-071) But the possibility of such a triumphant insight always depends on the awareness of limitations. Some MYSTERY IN THE KITCHEN: CULINARY CREATIVITY 227 interviewees stressed the importance of knowing which ideas did or would not work, which kinds of solutions were or would not be feasible, and why. This was generally thought to be just as important as actually discovering what worked. Knowing the possible range of one’s projected creation, its possible limitations, helps to focus creative exploration only in the most promising directions. Thus, artists rather often discover that their initial creations, based on certain paradigms, are limited in important respects; they might then begin to explore these limitations, leading to the creation of more appropriate paradigms. When we began to bake a cake, nothing was going very well. We stumbled, and we suffered. We threw away countless failed works. (BC-002) When I need new ideas, I go to the National Palace Museum, trying to add artistic ingredients into my pastry products. (BB-012) Phase 4: Verification of Culinary Works Few studies had claimed that idea evaluation might be just as important as the initial process of idea generation (Lonergan, Scott, & Mumford, 2004). It is one thing to evaluate and reconsider one’s ideas, plans, or theoretical designs during the ongoing creative process, and we saw (and described above) various ways in which this may occur in the first three stages. On the other hand, the empirical evaluation of a completed work (dish) can only occur after it has really been completed, and— especially in the case of competitions—formally presented (to the judges and audience, to one’s family seated at the dinner table) on a plate, in a bowl, or in some other way. In order to properly evaluate, judge, or ‘‘verify’’ his or her finished work. the culinary artist must already have internalized the standards by which the judges (or restaurant customers, or dinner guests) will be judging it—unless, perhaps, the artist is so confident of his or her creativity and experimental genius that he or she wishes to undertake a bold experiment, to introduce new standards. In any case, what will be formally judged in a completed dish is, of course, its harmonious combination of visual design(s), flavors, tastes, and textures, the imaginativeness (perhaps playfulness) of its conceptual design. However, the artist can also check or evaluate empirically his or her work once it has achieved some sort of material form, however early, elementary, or tentative that form might be. This sort of verification then becomes part of the experimental process of creating a new and original culinary product. The classic and most obvious case is the desire of a chef to taste his or her dish to see how it is coming along before putting the final touches on it. Here the question again arises as to whether the artist needs to be always keeping in mind the standard (already established) paradigm of perfection for a given dish—whatever this paradigm might be—or always thinking, rather, how he or she wants to modify that preexisting paradigm. Yet clearly both strategies would seem to be required, and indeed it looks like the top-level chefs who win contests are keeping both in mind and constantly negotiating between them. And if an artist deems his or her own work, at a particular (material) stage, not viable then he or she need not necessarily destroy it; as with his or her ideas at earlier stages of the process, the artist might simply put it into storage for later recycling. Through repeated experiments that involve, as in physics or chemistry, an interface of theoretical and material forms (ideas or principles and physical objects), there is a constant move toward perfection—however one might want to define this term. In some cases, how the artist thinks his or her (at this point) completed dish tastes will also suggest how to proceed to the further step of presentation, for once the dish is actually completed, it still needs to be presented. (Here one might wonder what sort of analogies exist in the other art-forms to this work=presentation distinction, given that only in the culinary arts is the presentation, in part, an inducement to the presumed following step on the part of the ‘‘spectator’’—a very physical form of ‘‘consumption.’’) First I will taste the food, to get the flavor of it. Then, I will think about how to present it. Making the presentation is not difficult; it’s relatively easy when the concept is established. (WK-004) Creativity depends on having an innovative perspective. When you reinvent an old classic, you must keep the integrity of the dish. ... The whole ingredients have to make sense. (WJ-001) Thus, in the culinary arts, as in all properly artistic fields, repeated experiments will be undertaken by the best artists, both at the purely mental (ideal, hypothetical) level in the earlier stages and at the mental-andempirical level at this fourth stage, in order to arrive at the best possible use of the ingredients with which he or she started out, the best possible combination of aesthetic (gustatory, tactile, and visual) values. This experimentation may also extend, naturally enough, into the domain of other cultures, and into the mixing of one culture with another, of one ethnic element with a quite different one. Here the travel (as well as reading) experience of culinary artists is called upon. I like to create an unprecedented flavor for customers, such as a crispy taste in a soup. I continuously try to combine Chinese and Western pastry cuisine. I want customers to have fun, playing while tasting. Customers 228 HORNG AND HU have to poke through the brown crispy pastry covering the bowl. When the pastry skin is broken and crumbling, they will be surprised by what’s inside the soup. (CF-006) Sometimes you think it won’t work, but you still want to try because you have the idea and you want to go further. (WK-003) And it may be noted here, with regard to CF-006’s comment above, that one aspect of presentation is the fact that a completed dish can be touched as well as seen, smelled and tasted by a consumer (diner, customer) or more formal kind of judge. That is, here the tactile or haptic sense also comes into play, reminding us once again that cuisine is, in one sense, a plastic art-form analogous to the various forms or categories of sculpture. On the other hand, just as touching sculptures in a museum or even statues in a park might have a certain social or cultural taboo attached to it, actually touching a sumptuous dish set before one on the table—with anything other than an eating utensil—is also considered, at least in some cultures of the world, taboo. The haptic sense remains in this way closely tied to, even an extension of, the visual sense. The presented dish must be elegant, must be beautiful; this is a large part of the reason why consumers are attracted to it, why people desire to consume it; and yet this beauty, itself, somehow includes gustatory, olfactory, and haptic values, together with purely visual ones. Artists present their ideas through music or paintings, and we do it with our cuisine. We are more creative. I was writing to a girl and my tears dropped onto the letter. So, I made a teardrop-shaped choux pastry as a present for her. The ingredients included cheese, coco powder, sugar powder. I put all my affection into the product; I made the story of my love for her real. Like Dewey said, emotions increase the depth of design. That helps my work come to life. (CF1-124) My work incorporates many sources of input: reading, art, life experience, culinary skills, famous cuisines, culture, and the like. (CF-074) A creative Chinese cuisine or creative pastry cuisine is more like a science, but the process of preparation is very artistic. It’s very enjoyable. (CF-102) Hegarty and O’Mahony (2001) saidy that culinary artists are like real artists; they apply special methods to process food, giving it a serious aesthetic meaning which (as with other arts) in certain respects goes beyond the merely experiential meaning. Thus although the science behind a culinary work might be seen as combining physics, chemistry, and biology, culinary creativity itself is a mixture of food science, art, and culture. Gazzoli (1995) emphasized that each culture’s cuisine remains an art synonymous with the soul of that culture’s people. Furthermore, after repeated experiments and modifications, the most creative culinary products tend to be the most complex and multifaceted. Here, again, there is the parallel with other works of ‘‘fine art,’’ the higher art forms: Joyce’s Ulysses is above all more complex than a simple child’s verse or fable; Beethoven’s symphonies are more complex, generally speaking, than most kinds of popular music. Thus, current culinary experimentation continues to make use of new perspectives in order to create variations on older designs or forms. It also continues to blend different cultural traditions, sometimes perhaps even parodying them in the manner of postmodernism, a term first used in the context of architecture that combined and parodied various old styles—for instance, gothic, Romanesque, and baroque. In this sense, as the interviews clearly suggest, culinary creativity is not linear in its mode of development and homogeneous but, on the contrary, nonlinear and heterogeneous. It can combine techniques, cultures, and historical periods: current American fast-food with traditional French or Chinese cuisine, Northern European pastry cuisine with Japanese food sculpture. CONCLUSION The creative culinary process was analyzed in this project according to a slightly modified version of Wallas’s (1926) 4-stage creative process model. Phase 1 (preparing ideas) in the model explored here, for instance, is roughly analogous to Wallas’ preparation stage and also to the generative process of the Geneplore model proposed by Finke et al (1992); our following three phases are similarly congruent with those of Wallas, with some refinement via the Geneplore model in terms of cognitive subprocesses. One potentially important finding was that—especially in the two middle stages, but even in the first and final phases—our participants seemed to feel that imagination played a more vital role than preexisting knowledge. Nonetheless, of course, both are necessary—the problem is how to combine them. The culinary artists we interviewed also sought to achieve, generally speaking, a balance between the traditional, the currently fashionable, and their own radically new ideas. Here fashion seems to occupy a middle ground between tradition and experimentation: the new idea, once it becomes the trend, quickly becomes old. Imagination, then, played a prominent role in the responses of several of our interviewees. They often spoke of flashes of intuition or insight, whether one wants to explain these by resorting to the notion of an unconscious or more strictly in terms of cognitive psychology. Some interviewees did seem to have the sense of an unconscious reworking of preexisting knowledge, problems, and new ideas (or new solutions to old MYSTERY IN THE KITCHEN: CULINARY CREATIVITY 229 problems) that goes on within the cyclic subprocesses, especially in stages 2 and 3. Participants also tended to emphasize creative thinking as a kind of divergent thinking: They felt that new insights were, to some degree, made possible by Gestalt-switch-like shifts in perspective, sometimes aided by the experience of other cultures and of the unusual cuisines of other cultures (Moss, 2002; Williams, 2004). There was also a fair degree of emphasis on what Mace and Ward (2002) called the shelving or abandoning of an idea, or even of an artwork (dish), at its initial stage of completion; the possibility of later ‘‘recycling’’ was stressed by several of our artists. This willingness to suddenly discard or shelve an idea or preliminary product (creation) when some new discovery suddenly appears is also an important element of the Geneplore model, with its elaboration of cyclic or self-returning subprocesses. There may be a close connection, as no doubt in all artistic fields, between speculative questioning (wondering, investigating, experimenting), meta-cognition (thinking about thinking), and this recycling of ideas. Finally, the interviewees’ comments suggested, either directly or indirectly, some ways in which the culinary industry might improve culinary artists’ creativity and competitiveness. The most important idea here seemed to be the need for communication, not only between restaurant (and hotel) owners=managers and chefs but also between diners (customers, consumers) and chefs—feedback is creative stimulant—and between and among the chefs themselves. Clearly it was thought that culinary artists can learn much from one another—perhaps even more than from schools, books, and traveling, although those too (especially travel, when one has already achieved a certain level of expertise) are important— and also can creatively stimulate one another in various ways, partly through the healthy spirit of competition. Another, related recurrent theme was that culinary artists need to have enough free time away from their jobs in order to practice their art freely, for pure enjoyment, as the best poets write poetry and the best musicians compose music. Still, competition is a good inducement to creativity, but international contests tend to be preferred to the job (the culinary industry in itself), partly because of the relative degree of freedom attached to such contests. To return to the point mentioned at the beginning of this article, cooking is the most vital of all arts inasmuch as we need to eat in order to live. Beyond the mere level of survival, then, this ‘‘vitality’’ gets infused into the various aesthetic forms and dimensions of haute cuisine that afford pleasure to the diner who eats the dish and also—although in a somewhat different way—to the culinary artist who creates it, even if he never himself consumes it. However, when we commence to consider, more deeply, the aesthetics of these mysterious arts of the kitchen, it starts to become difficult, no doubt as in all artistic media, although with an inevitable difference, to distinguish between the pleasure of its creator in creating a dish, the pleasure of the spectator in consuming it, and the pure (freely-formed) beauty of the creative work itself.","output":"L'article \\"The Mystery in the Kitchen: Culinary Creativity\\" par Meng-Lei (Monica) Hu et Jeou-Shyan Horng examine la créativité culinaire à travers un modèle modifié du processus créatif classique de Wallas de 1926.

Les hypothèses mises en avant par les auteurs se concentrent sur l'importance de l'imagination plus que sur les connaissances acquises, sur l'interaction entre tradition, mode et innovation, et sur le rôle des facteurs externes tels que la culture et la collaboration dans la stimulation de la créativité. Les auteurs remettent également en question la perspective selon laquelle les chefs sont moins perçus comme des artistes comparativement aux peintres ou musiciens, soulignant l'importance artistique de la cuisine. Ils observent que la compétition dans le domaine culinaire, ainsi que la reconnaissance croissante de l'originalité dans les concours internationaux, renforcent l'importance de la créativité. Ils notent également que l'industrie culinaire pourrait mieux exploiter la créativité en favorisant la communication entre les chefs et avec les consommateurs, en offrant du temps libre pour l'expérimentation créative et en valorisant les échanges d'idées et l'inspiration interculturelle. Les quatre phases du modèle de créativité selon Wallas – préparation d'idées, incubation d'idées, développement d'idées et évaluation du produit – sont vérifiées à travers les entretiens, avec des modifications incorporant des aspects cycliques et collaboratifs issus du modèle Geneplore de Finke, Ward et Smith (1992).

M. Lyon A challenge facing cultural-frame institutionalism is to explain how existing institutional logics and role identities are replaced by new logics and role identities. This article depicts identity movements that strive to expand individual autonomy as motors of institutional change. It proposes that the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists, extent of theorization of new roles, prior defections by peers to the new logic, and gains to prior defectors act as identity-discrepant cues that induce actors to abandon traditional logics and role identities for new logics and role identities. A study of how the nouvelle cuisine movement in France led elite chefs to abandon classical cuisine during the period starting from 1970 and ending in 1997 provides wide-ranging support for these arguments. Implications for research on institutional change, social movements, and social identity are outlined. Institutions are composed of logics and governance structures and are produced or enacted by individuals and corporate actors (McAdam and Scott 2002). Institutional logics are the belief systems that furnish guide1 We dedicate this article to Roland Calori of E. M.

So defined, institutions denote durability: logics constitute the identities of actors and generate obligations, and governance structures constrain action. Since institutions structure human action, organizations resemble each other and reflect little diversity (Meyer and Rowan 1977; DiMaggio and Powell 1983). Such institutional arguments that explain stability are poorly suited to illuminate institutional change (Powell 1991, pp. 183-200). So, a central challenge facing cultural-frame institutionalism consists of explaining the locus and sources of institutional change (Clemens and Cook 1999). Institutional change can consist of (a) institution formation or the birth of a new logic or governance structure, (b) deinstitutionalization or the dissolution of an existing logic or governance structure, and (c) reinstitutionalization where an existing logic or governance structure is replaced by a new logic or governance structure (Scott 2001). An emerging synthesis of social movement theory and cultural-frame institutionalism suggests that social movements are important motors of institution building, deinstitutionalization, and reinstitutionalization in organizational fields (McAdam and Scott 2002; Rao, Morill, and Zald 2000). Social movements are collective challenges to authority in political and cultural domains that endeavor to affect change at various levels of social life (Snow 2002). Researchers distinguish between instrumental movements and identity movements. Instrumental movements seek to redress injustices, challenge economic and political structures, and strive for policy impact in the form of new laws or governance structures. By contrast, identity movements arise in opposition to the dominant cultural codes, consist of a \\"we-feeling\\" sustained through interactions among movement participants, and are expressed through cultural materials such as names, narratives, symbols, and rituals (Taylor and Whittier 1992). Identity movements seek autonomy rather than justice, aspire to cultural change, and promote new institutional logics (Gamson 1995). Unlike instrumental movements powered by bureaucratic social movement organizations, identity movements tend to be more informal, decentralized, and diffuse (Melucci 1996). Students of institutional change have emphasized instrumental movements but have devoted little attention to identity movements. Thus, scholars have looked at how instrumental social movements have promoted the rise of new institutions such as consumer watchdog groups (Rao 1998) or alternate dispute resolution systems (Morrill 2001). Other scholars have analyzed how instrumental social movements compelled American colleges to disinvest from firms with business interests in South Africa (Soule 1999) and prompted the replacement of managerial capi796 Institutional Change talism by investor capitalism (Davis and Thompson 1994). However, cultural-frame institutionalists have yet to grapple with how identity movements challenge cultural codes, reshape the identities of individuals, and promote changes in lifestyles and individual practices. Moreover, cultural-frame institutionalism says little about how social movements underpin reinstitutionalization in the professions. For the most part, cultural-frame institutionalists have portrayed the professions as an exogenous force operating on organizations, but they seldom study how old logics are replaced by new logics in the professions (Scott 2001). Cultural-frame institutionalism has tended to emphasize the role of professional logics in shaping the role identity of actors but has glossed over the sources of variation in professional logics and role identities (Clemens and Cook 1999). The study of identity movements in professions can enable us to understand how social movements foster cultural change in the professions by reshaping logics and redefining the role identities of individuals (Polletta and Jasper 2001). We start with the premise that institutional logics are the organizing principles that furnish guidelines to actors as to how to behave (Friedland and Alford 1991). Institutional logics create distinctive categories, beliefs, expectations, and motives and thereby constitute the social identity of actors. One link between an institutional logic and the behavior of individual actors is social identity, or the self-image derived by actors when they categorize themselves as members of a collectivity or occupants of a role (Tajfel and Turner 1979; Stryker 2000; Deaux and Martin 2000). The other link between logics and individual behavior, of course, is a system of incentives that rewards actors for conformity to a given logic and penalizes actors for violations of behavior (Ingram and Clay 2000). We propose that identity movements in the professions critique the existing logic and role identity as constraints on autonomy, and they offer a new logic and role identity emphasizing expanded autonomy. Since role identities are more proximal and concrete when compared with institutional logics, identity movements celebrate differences between the traditional role identity and the new role identity (Bernstein 1997). Both role identities compete for behavioral expression at the level of individual actors. Drawing on self-categorization theory (Turner 1985), we suggest that identity movements disseminate identity-discrepant cues that jeopardize the old logic and role identity and lead actors to adopt the new logic and new role identity. We discuss four types of identity-discrepant cues as the sources of change: the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists, theorization of new roles to be adopted, defections of peers from the traditional logic to the insurgent logic, and gains that accrue to prior defectors. We also predict that theorization is a more influential identity797 American Journal of Sociology discrepant cue than prior defections by peers and gains accruing to prior defectors. Empirically, we study how these identity-discrepant cues disseminated by the nouvelle cuisine movement induced elite French chefs to abandon the orthodoxy of classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine. The nouvelle cuisine movement arose in opposition to classical cuisine embodied in Escoffier's academism and was built around 10 commandments centered around the values of truth, light, simplicity, and imagination. Classical cuisine emphasized the power of the restaurateur, long menus requiring huge inventories and little freshness, rituals outside the plate, flamb6 preparations, and a long consumption process. By contrast, nouvelle cuisine emphasized the autonomy of the chef, with short menus requiring fresh ingredients and low inventories, service through the plate, and a short consumption process. We undertake a longitudinal study of elite French chefs and begin our window of observation in 1970, when the nouvelle cuisine movement arose, and end our observation in 1997, because by then, \\"cuisine sous contrat\\" and \\"cuisine rassurante\\" (comforting and reassuring cuisine) had arisen on the scene. We draw on multiple sources of data to develop an analytical narrative of the nouvelle cuisine movement. We interviewed gastronomic critics and faculty members at the leading professional schools (l9cole des Arts Culinaires et de 1'Hotellerie created under the patronage of Paul Bocuse in the late 1980s in Lyon, France, and tEcole de Savignac in Perigord) to gain a contextual understanding of classical and nouvelle cuisine. These interviews lasted from two to four hours and were recorded; all told, there were 20 chefs, 15 gastronomic critics, and four professors. Some chefs had one star, others had two stars, and a few had three stars. Some of the chefs had lost a star, and others had gained a star. Some chefs worked in restaurants that included a complementary hotel service, and others belonged to the top-end luxurious chain Relais et Chateaux. Our gastronomic critics were editors or columnists in leading journals such as La Revue Thuries. We relied on annual directories issued by the Guide Michelin to obtain panel data on elite French chefs. Below, we draw on all of these sources to chronicle how French chefs abandoned the institutional logic and role identity embodied in classical cuisine and embraced nouvelle cuisine. NOUVELLE CUISINE IN FRENCH GASTRONOMY AS AN IDENTITY MOVEMENT French gastronomy is a site of convention and invention (Ferguson 1998, p. 637). Gastronomy emerged as a field in the first half of the 19th century 798 Institutional Change with the advent of restaurants-a secular culinary tradition that countered negative judgments of gastronomic pleasure-and with the rise of a culinary discourse in which gastronomic journalists and chefs codified culinary knowledge and formalized French national cuisine (see Ferguson [1998] for a detailed account of its early origins). Subsequently, its development in the 20th century may be understood as a professional project consisting of the creation of a body of knowledge, the organization of professional bodies, and the consolidation of a professional elite. The French Revolution of 1789 undermined the institutional logic of the ancien regime cuisine and the associated role identity of the chef. In the ancien regime, meals were public spectacles organized according to hierarchy, and the chef was virtually owned by patrons or nobles. But after the French Revolution, chefs who once worked in the houses of private patrons offered their services to the public by establishing restaurants in Paris and its environs. Haute cuisine shifted from private homes into public restaurants; the spectacle of the banquet was replaced by a more intimate encounter; the hierarchy of the banquet of the ancien regime was supplanted by a more egalitarian order; and the extravagance of banquets gave way to economy (Ferguson 1998). An informal and decentralized gastronomic effort to systematize the principles of this cuisine was led by chefs and gastronomic journalists. Among these writers, the most influential was Antonin Careme (1784-1833), a chef who worked in the houses of great patrons such as Talleyrand. He pioneered the effort to systematize the principles of the modern cuisine that emerged after the French Revolution. Careme disparaged the old cuisine of the ancien regime because it did not mesh with the zeitgeist of postrevolutionary France, and in his Philosophical History of Cuisine (1833), Careme took the idea of chef as artist from ancien r6gime cuisine and created a vision of grande cuisine as both an art and a science. He simplified meals so that there were four courses at dinner instead of eight, gave more space to those persons sitting at the table, and sought to redefine humble dishes such as the pot au feu as the essence of a modern cuisine. He and his disciples produced sauces that were works of art; sauces such as bourguignonne, salmis, sauce supreme, or sauce hollandaise camouflaged the meat, game, or fish being served rather than enhancing their flavor (Simon 1952). Stressing delicacy, order, and economy, Careme brought symmetry to the service of meals and introduced a new awareness of freshness and sanitation into the French kitchen. Carnme's ideas quickly diffused throughout the kitchens of Parisian restaurants, and the rest of France, and reshaped the culinary culture of the times (Ferguson 1998). 799 American Journal of Sociology Classical Cuisine: Institutional Logic and Role Identity Carime's ideas were strengthened by a new breed of chefs such as Georges Auguste Escoffier (1847-1935) and his circle of collaborators-including his friend Prosper Montagne (1865-1948), author of the Larousse Gastronomique (1938), who worked in the kitchens of fashionable hotels that had been established in the major cities of Europe, notably by C sar Ritz, toward the end of the 19th century. If Careme's books constituted the Old Testament, Escoffier's Guide Culinaire, first published in 1903, was the New Testament that formed the body of what came to be known as classical cuisine and remains a central text in the training of professional cooks, even to the present day (Mennell 1993). Escoffier wrote down dishes in the order of presentation (service a la russe) and developed the first a la carte menu. He simplified the art of cooking by getting rid of ostentatious food displays and elaborate garnishes and reduced the number of courses served. He emphasized the use of seasonal foods and urged that sauces be used to reveal the flavors of game, meat, and fish rather than to conceal them. Escoffier simplified professional kitchen organization, as he integrated it into a single unit from its previously individualized sections, which operated autonomously and led to waste and duplication of labor. It was during the Escoffier era that French haute cuisine achieved the undisputed international hegemony that it had begun to acquire since the Restoration (Mennell 1993). Escoffier summarized classical cuisine as follows: \\"In a word, cookery whilst continuing to be an art will become scientific and will have to submit its formulas which very often are still too empirical, to a method and precision which leaves nothing to chance\\" (1907, preface). He conceived of classical cuisine as codified grammar of culinary practice: a product can be cooked in different ways, served with different sauces, and accompanied with different fillings. Escoffier's guide was issued in several editions and remained the dominant orthodoxy until it was undermined by the nouvelle cuisine movement. Fischler (1989, 1993) identified five dimensions as useful in understanding the institutional logic and role identity of classical cuisine: culinary rhetoric, rules of cooking, archetypal ingredients used, role of the chef, and the organization of the menu. Table 1 displays these dimensions, and we describe them below. The culinary rhetoric of classical cuisine reveals the emphasis on conservatism and preservation. Often, dishes have the names of places, noblemen, or mythological characters associated with them. Neirinck and Poulain (1997, pp. 59-62) studied Careme's texts and found that nearly 213 dishes had names associated with noblemen. Moreover, cooking consisted of the application of two rules: conformation to the rules formulated by Carame and Escoffier and sublimation of the ingredients such that the 800 Institutional Change TABLE 1 CLASSICAL CUISINE: INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS AND ROLE IDENTITIES Dimension Defining Characteristics Culinary rhetoric ............... Names of dishes refer to Rhetoric, Memory, and Legitimacy. Rules of cooking .............. Conformation, or staying in conformity with Escoffier's principles. Examples: gratins and quenelles, terrines, pdtes, confits, jambons, jambonneaux, saucissons, boudins, andouillettes. Sublimation, or sublimating the ingredients: brioches, crofites, vessies, farces, 6minces, chaussons, croustades, vol au vent, sauces, flambages (flamb6), bisques, delices, dodines, timbales, Chateaubriand. Archetypal ingredients ......... High game, shellfish, cream, poultry, river fish Role of the chef ............. The restaurateur, rarely the owner, and never the cook, has the power in the rooms of luxury hotels and palaces. The classical service is organized through the saucepan. The waiters cut and serve the dishes, blaze (\\"flambe\\") preparations. The rituals are outside the plate. Organization of the menu ..... Extremely long menu, almost all the classical dishes are registered. Need for large inventories, therefore less freshness. Consuming is a long ceremony. Related art is Architecture (three dimensions). Relief and contours are important. One sense is critical: vision. raw material is visually transformed. Moreover, the archetypal ingredients used were high game, shellfish, river fish, cream, and poultry, and the menu was organized so that it consisted of a long menu, which required substantial inventories in the restaurant. The chef was an employee of the restaurant owner and was in the background. The rituals of dining prominently featured the waiter who cut and served dishes, flambeed the preparations, and organized the service through the saucepan. Fischler summarized it as follows: \\"The art of the cook consisted in accommodating, in transforming, in metamorphosing the raw material, to put it from Nature to Culture. . . . The maitre queux was a kind of grand 'sophisticator', in the etymologic sense of 'falsificator\\"' (1993, p. 238). This logic and role identity of chefs became institutionalized through a network of training schools, such as Le Cordon Bleu, and professional societies, such as Association des Maitres Queux. Although it was started in 1896 to provide training to housewives, Le Cordon Bleu began offering courses in haute cuisine classique from 1900 that were first overseen by Charles Driessens, then by Mademoiselle Distel from 1904 until 1930, and 801 American Journal of Sociology later by Henri-Paul Pellaprat for several decades. In 1950, 40 chefs trained in haute cuisine classique established the Association des Maitres Queux to certify master chefs who were exponents of haute cuisine and to ensure the highest standards of professional excellence. Classical cuisine reigned supreme for three decades after Escoffier's death in 1935, due to the role of training schools such as Le Cordon Bleu and societies such as the Association des Maitres Queux. Such was the ascendancy of classical cuisine that the magazine Le Cordon Bleu had 25,000 subscribers in 1930 and became a drawing card in its own right. Thereafter, it declined in importance as classical cuisine became takenfor-granted, and it was eventually discontinued in the early 1960s. Below, we elaborate how the edifice of classical cuisine gave way to nouvelle cuisine and discuss how an external shock, the events of May 1968, enabled activist chefs to exploit hitherto latent tensions between the logic of classical cuisine and the emerging zeitgeist of the times. We begin with a theoretical account of how activists gain opportunities to attack the existing institutional logic and role identity. Institutional Change: Nouvelle Cuisine as a Spinoff Movement Given the durability of institutions, early writers sought to explain institutional change as the outcome of exogenous shocks emanating from outside the institutional system in the form of wars or crises (see Powell [1991, pp. 181-200] for a review). These initial arguments glossed over how actors from within the institutional system could exploit the mutability of the existing logic, internal contradictions of the existing logic, or its incompatibility with logics in cognate fields and generate a momentum for change (see Clemens and Cook 1999). Logics are mutable to the extent that they value autonomy or rely on ambiguous language that can be appropriated. Innovators justify changes by recasting them as efforts to restore tradition (Skrentny 1996, pp. 154-58), or exploit the ambiguity of language, as English cotton spinners did when they appropriated the discourse of the dominant class, fashioned their own identity, and mobilized themselves for collective action (Steinberg 1999). Institutional logics also sow the seeds for change to the extent that they embody contradictions; for instance, citizenship classifications used by empires to construct \\"nationalities\\" became the basis for opposition to the central state (Brubaker 1992). Tensions between multiple logics can trigger instability; thus, in the savings and loan industry, competing institutional logics induced founders of thrifts to develop hybrid forms that combined the properties of competing models (Haveman and Rao 1997). Exogenous shocks such as the growth of new constituencies (Amenta 1998) or initiator movements (McAdam 1995) can expose mu802 Institutional Change tability, trigger contradictions, and exacerbate hitherto suppressed tensions among multiple logics. By doing so, exogenous shocks create opportunities for activists within professions to critique the existing orthodoxy and proffer a new logic and a role identity. Nouvelle cuisine arose because an initiator movement exposed the mutability of the logic of classical cuisine and surfaced tensions between the logic of classical cuisine and the new logics that were being established in cognate fields such as literature, drama, and film. McAdam (1995) distinguished between rare, but exceedingly important, initiator movements that set in motion an identifiable protest cycle and more populous spin-off movements that drew inspiration from the original initiator movement, and he suggested that initiator movements create a political opportunity for spin-off movements. Spin-off movements represent the diffusion of the master logic animating an initiator movement and entail the customization of the initiator movement's master logic. Just as the French Revolution was the master movement that sounded the death knell of the ancien regime cuisine and the construction of classical cuisine by Careme and other gastronomic writers, the events of May 1968 triggered the decline of classical cuisine and the growth of the nouvelle cuisine movement. Fischler writes, \\"The Grande Cuisine, at the end of the 1960s, experiences a kind of revolution and revelation. Beyond this sudden vogue, there is a larger wave, one of wide-ranging social and economical movements that had been transforming the French society, and wavelets, those that the larger wave indirectly induced in the Cuisine and catering industries. The Grande Gastronomy crystallizes and precipitates latent trends in the society. ... When studying the nature and content of the Nouvelle Cuisine, one could perceive a large part of further evolutions in the attitudes and behaviors in France\\" (1993, p. 247). The larger wave was the protests of May 1968, which hastened the wavelet of nouvelle cuisine. On May 6, 1968, students at the Sorbonne who were protesting against the punishment meted out to eight students at Nanterre for their opposition to the Vietnam War were attacked by police on the boulevard Saint-Germain. Scores of students were arrested, and many students and policemen were injured. Soon students mobilized with marches, decried examinations as a rite of initiation into capitalism, called for the triumph of the \\"general will over the General\\" (De Gaulle), and sought to create a society that valued personal autonomy and eliminated distinctions between order-givers and order-takers. France was on the verge of a revolution, with 12 million workers on strike, 122 factories occupied by workers, and students battling against an authoritarian system. The antiauthoritarian wave of May 1968 amplified the effect of undercurrents already visible in the literary, theater, film, and culinary worlds through the le nouveau roman, la nouvelle critique, le nouveau 803 American Journal of Sociology theatre, and la nouvelle vague antischools. All of these antischools shared similar conceptual principles (Beauge 1999). The nouveau roman movement, which first appeared in 1956 with the publication of \\"Pour un nouveau roman\\" written by Robbe-Grillet, challenged the traditional plot premised on coherent and well-defined characters with the corresponding assumptions of logic, order, sequence, cause and effect, suspense, climax, denouement, beginning and an end. It reached new heights with the publication of Triptyque, authored by Claude Simon in 1973, which featured a wedding party, the drowning of a boy, and a scene in a hotel room-these three narratives ran concurrently without paragraph breaks. In a similar vein, nouvelle critique, championed by Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida, sought to redefine the identity of the critic and argued that texts were not limited by the intentions of authors but were recreated through acts of reading. Subsequent writers suggested that the fundamental relationship was not one of speaking and hearing but one of writing and reading. Thus, distinctions between author and critic and author and audience were blurred. In the world of the performing arts, le nouveau theatre, epitomized by Beckett's En attendant Godot, attempted to displace the traditional model of theatre characterized by the ideas of unity of tone and register, and instead explored incomprehension, terror, suffering, and death. By the late 1970s, le nouveau theatre had moved from the fringe into the mainstream. In the realm of film, la nouvelle vague arose in the late 1950s and sought to replace the primacy of the scriptwriter with the director and to emphasize natural light, realism, improvisation, and audacity. The nouvelle cuisine movement was an echo of these antischools; its first stirrings appeared in 1965 and were visible in 1970 (Beaug6 1999; Fischler 1993, p. 254), and it was labeled as an antischool only in 1972. The time lag between the antischools in the literary, theatre, and film worlds and the onset of nouvelle cuisine was a consequence of the professionalization of French gastronomy. There were no professional requirements to write a novel, stage a play, make a low-budget movie, or even critique a book. By contrast, it took a long time for a chef to acquire professional accreditation, and recruits had to progress through various phases. Thus, antischools in the realms of film, theatre, criticism, and novels were championed by insurgent new entrants from the outside. By contrast, nouvelle cuisine was promoted by activists in the centre of the French culinary world who had received honors from the French state and had garnered plaudits from the Guide Michelin. Nouvelle cuisine was led by insiders with more credentials and expertise than outsiders because professional talk embodies a culture of critical discourse. In the culture of critical discourse, the right to question the rationality of existing arrangements is based on technical criteria 804 Institutional Change (DiMaggio 1991; Gouldner 1979). Moreover, members in professions simultaneously value collective identity and individual autonomy. So insiders with expertise can attack existing logics and social identities because these inhibit autonomy, creativity, and freedom, and they can proffer new logics and identities on the grounds that these expand individual autonomy and, by implication, enlarge professional control. In such cases, identity movements may arise to \\"invert\\" the dominant symbols and structures and to replace hierarchy with individual freedom, ritual with spontaneity, and routine with virtuosity (Gerlach and Hine 1970; Ansell 2001). In this sense, nouvelle cuisine was a bid to enhance the professional control of restaurants by chefs. Under classical cuisine, chefs possessed the freedom to establish their own restaurants in classical cuisine and design their menus, and celebrity chefs with three Michelin stars could also control financial promoters. However, they lacked technical autonomy because their role was to translate the intentions or prescriptions of Escoffier's guide into products. Chefs under classical cuisine lacked the freedom to create and invent dishes, and the nouvelle cuisine movement sought to make chefs into inventors rather than mere technicians. The movement was shaped by activists such as Paul Bocuse, Michel Guerard, the Troisgros brothers, and Alain Chapel. Each of these chefs had won the Meilleur Ouvrier de France title (MOF) and were awarded stars by the Guide Michelin. Below, we discuss how these activists constructed a new logic and role identity. Nouvelle Cuisine: New Institutional Logic and Role Identity Identity movements arise when activists construct institutional gaps by showing how the existing logic cannot be an effective guide for action. In doing so, activists exploit the inherent mutability of an institutional logic or seize on its incompatibility with other master logics on the landscape. Institutional gaps arise when movement activists develop rationales for why the existing logic cannot dictate action effectively and then offer a repertoire of practices that embody a different institutional logic (Swidler 2001). Identity movements create institutional gaps through framing activities that situate \\"relevant sets of actors in time and space and by attributing characteristics to them that suggest specifiable relationships and lines of action\\" (Hunt, Benford, and Snow 1994, p. 185). Bernstein (1997) identified two mutually exclusive identity deployment strategies-suppressing differences with the mainstream or celebrating differences with the dominant group. Nouvelle activists celebrated their differences with the dominant orthodoxy of classical cuisine but also exploited the foundations of classical cuisine for their project. Bocuse and other activists were able to denounce 805 American Journal of Sociology the lack of autonomy for chefs in classical cuisine because their criticisms resonated with the sentiments against hierarchy gaining ground after the events of May 1968 and were also in tune with the avant-garde movements in the literary and artistic worlds. However, Bocuse and other activists exploited the ideas of simplicity and economy in classical cuisine to fashion a new logic and a new identity for chefs. Just as students in Nantes and film directors such as Godard challenged old rules such as exams or a stylized sequence of shots, Bocuse and his allies questioned culinary conventions and exhorted chefs to engage in culinary invention. In an echo of the students' protests against ostentation and fakery and filmmakers' struggles for realism, Troisgros and Chapel wanted simplicity and economy of presentation. If literary critics like Barthes and Derrida sought to portray the reader as a creator of meaning, Bocuse and Chapel wanted chefs to have a role in creating and inventing dishes rather than simply understanding the intentions of Escoffier. \\"In their way, Nouvelle Cuisine Chefs were a conceptualist avant-garde; one often went to their restaurant to enjoy the shock of the new\\" (Ferguson and Zukin 1998, p. 94). Table 2 shows that the institutional logic and role identity of nouvelle cuisine had five dimensions: culinary rhetoric, rules of cooking, archetypal ingredients used, role of the chef, and the organization of the menu. The culinary rhetoric of nouvelle cuisine emphasized innovation, and the appellations of dishes referred to poetry and imagination rather than place names or the names of nobles. Weiss writes, \\"If there were to be a theorization of nouvelle cuisine, it would be a theory of exceptions, nuances, refinements. . . . The operative terms for the use of condiments, for instance, are often referred to as un rien, un souppon, une touche, une idle (a nothing, a suspicion, a touch, an idea)\\" (2001, pp. 233-34). Nouvelle cuisine relied on the rules of transgression and acclimatization (Fischler 1993). Transgression consisted of using old cooking techniques with new ingredients, or using old cooking techniques with old ingredients in illegitimate ways; for example, mixing meat and fish, preparing salads containing vegetables and foie gras, and fixing pot au feu with fish. Acclimatization was the import of exotic foreign cuisine traditions, notably seasoning and spices. Two influences can be identified: the influence from Japanese cuisine during the late 1970s, when most of the evangelists traveled to Japan, and the growing influence of former colonies and immigrants (Beaug6 1999). The ingredients of nouvelle cuisine were fruits, vegetables, potatoes, aromatic herbs, exotic ingredients, and sea fish. The new rules and ingredients transformed ordinary dishes such as the salad; as pointed out by Fischler, \\"The salad imposes itself as a territory of superlative freedom, of a more or less considered madness. It is by definition the domain of milange and organized disorder. It therefore escapes 806 Institutional Change TABLE 2 NOUVELLE CUISINE: INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS AND ROLE IDENTITIES Dimension Defining Characteristics Culinary rhetoric ...............

Transgression, or using old cooking techniques with new ingredients, or using old cooking techniques with old ingredients, yet for which these cooking techniques were not legitimate: mixing meat and fish, salad mixing vegetables and foie gras, pot au feu with fish. Acclimatization, or importing \\"exotic\\" foreign cuisine traditions, notably seasoning and spices: Fresh pasta, raviolis, cannelloni, cheesecake, cappuccino, crumble, carpaccio, pudding, presskopf, risotto, tajine. Archetypal ingredients ......... Fruits, vegetables, potatoes, aromatic herbs, exotic ingredients, sea fish. Role of the chef .............. The chef is at the centre of operations.

Colors, contrasts and decoration, and the five senses are important. from traditional culinary grammars, and henceforth permits unhindered transgression and innovation\\" (Fischler 1993, p. 264). The role of the chef was reframed to that of an innovator, creator, and owner, and the role of the waiter was minimized. Service ' la japonaise or service through the plate (first offered by Troisgros in the late 1960s) and service under a cloche (first presented by Guirard in the early 1970s) minimized the role of the waiter. The nouvelle cuisine menu was far shorter than the classical cuisine menu, and large inventories became superfluous since chefs emphasized freshness. Service through the plate and service under a cloche led cooks to add products only for esthetic reasons: colors, contrasts, and decoration were emphasized but in a shorter ceremony. In summary, the object of nouvelle cuisine was \\"no more the metamorphosis of the food product, but the revelation of its essential truth\\" (Fischler 1993, p. 238). 807 American Journal of Sociology Conversion to Nouvelle Cuisine as Identity Change: Stories of Chefs Conversion from classical cuisine to nouvelle cuisine was an identity change for chefs and not a mere question of strategy. We discuss the early conversion experiences of three-star chefs who were key activists, such as Michel Guerard and Pierre Troisgros. We then present the conversion experiences of Gilles Eteocle and Jean-Paul Jeunet (two-star chefs), who inherited their restaurants from a father or father-in-law. We also discuss the conversion experience of Bernard Collon, a one-star chef who was downgraded. Dissatisfaction with their own knowledge and the desire for autonomy were triggers of identity change for key activists. Michel Guerard, a winner of three Michelin stars and the MOF in cooking and pastry, was a nouvelle cuisine activist who rejected classical cuisine. Guerard, speaking of himself and Delaveyne, who also started as a pastry chef, said that \\"classical cuisine itself had been lifeless, inert, apathetic for a while .. The desire emerged in us to do something else, to singularize ourselves, to be recalcitrant and reject the traditional authority and whatever existed before\\" (Michel Guerard, quoted in Charretton and Charetton 1985, p. 30). \\"I was complaining about my cuisine and the classical discipline. Jean Delaveyne came in and told me: You are a ... idiot! At least do what you would like to do. Do not consider failure, at least you will have enjoyed what you did\\" (Michel Guerard, quoted in Nanteau 1999, p. 224). The conversion story of Pierre Troisgros, the \\"garde manger\\" and his brother Jean, the sauce chef, also undescores the salience of identity. Jean Troisgros died in 1983, but Pierre, awarded a third star in 1968, remains in 2003 the longest-titled three-star chef after Paul Bocuse, a three-star chef since 1965. In an early article, Jean Troisgros pointed out that nouvelle cuisine required just-in-time assembly, whereas classical cuisine implied advance preparation and noted that identity rather than task difficulty was the issue. \\"Is that so much more difficult to prepare the dishes at the last moment? I am not sure. It is a question of habits and organization. I think that, in many restaurants, everything or almost is ready in advance and stuffed into the fridge, one could well work differently. There are many bad habits in this profession. And bad routines\\" (Jean Troisgros, quoted in Gault and Millau 1976, p. 123). In an interview with one of the authors, Pierre 'Troisgros described innovation as an act of blasphemy and spoke of the need to jettison old reflexes and ways of thinking when making a nouvelle cuisine dish such as \\"L'escalope de saumon a l'oseille\\" and said, What was revolutionary in this dish was the cut in scallops, and not in \\"darne\\" [like a steak], whilst the salmon was a luxury product. What a cheek! What a nerve! It was blasphemous. Moreover, we abandoned the 808 Institutional Change starchy liaison in the sauce. Then, we under-cooked the product, only 25s on one side, and 15s on the other: such cooking times were really short at that time. We also cooked in a Tefal plate; hence we could reduce the fat on the slice of the salmon scallop. . . . The shock of the time, a revelation, was not to add a fish veloute sauce. This was my reflex of an old cook. Nor to add a knob of butter. Only a very fat cream with special Vermouth and very little white wine. . . . And when you tasted it, you really tasted the fresh savors and flavors of pasture. (Troisgrois interview with Phillippe Monin, Roanne, January 25, 2001) Identity change was accomplished gradually when a chef succeeded his father or father-in-law, and chefs underwent personal struggles when making the transition. Jean-Paul Jeunet, the chef of the Restaurant de Paris in the Jura province, worked along with his father Andre from the mid1970s and took over from his father in the late-1980s. One star for decades, Restaurant de Paris was awarded a second star in 1996. During the early 1970s, under the direction of Andre Jeunet, classical cuisine was fully endorsed, and the restaurant adhered to Escoffier's grammar. Jean-Paul Jeunet stated, This is a familial history, we have just celebrated my father's 50 years of professional activity. I cannot disrupt everything. On one hand, I am guided by my inspiration towards more simplicity, lightening, stripping all the unnecessary ornamentations. I am confronted with my own personal desire to go ahead, while keeping my personality, my natural instincts that tell me to thrive towards a simplified, more original, creative cuisine. But on the other hand, I consider the reassuring and comfortable side of a traditional cuisine that will rally more people. . ... We [younger chefs who take over after our parents] are all facing this difficulty of managing the coexistence of two kinds. Now my leitmotiv is the individualization of dishes according to one's personality. My role is to bring something, to transcend the product through the techniques. I am a technician, first and above all. (Jeunet interview with Monin, Arbois, March 9, 2001) The conversion of Gilles Eteocle, chef of La Poularde, located in Montrond-les-Bains, a large village in a sparsely populated, agriculture-based area of the center of France, shows how chefs also had to respond to old customers while embracing nouvelle cuisine and had to manage the transition. La Poularde, awarded two stars since 1967, is the oldest two-star French restaurant, and Johannes Randoing, a cook since 1934, was succeeded by his son-in-law Gilles Eteocle in 1988. Eteocle declared, We are a family business. My father-in-law cooked a very rich cuisine. We used up to 200 liters of cream a week, down to 15 liters a week now. The sauce drove all the cuisine. The sauce was the quintessence .... There is an old cook's saying: \\"If you are not capable of some sorcery, it is not worth getting involved in cuisine.\\" The sauce chef was the alchemist. At that time, 809 American Journal of Sociology the customers came for that cuisine. When I took over in the mid-80s . I started to innovate and proposed a more personal cuisine. However, it was very complicated to have two ethics living under the same roof. When loyal old customers come along and tell you: \\"it is no more what it used to, there is no more Creole rice to sponge up the sauce.\\" . . . It has taken more than fifteen years for me to affirm my spirit in my cuisine. . ... Now, I have done it, I am in coherence with my cuisine. You know, it is an art; I have been on the edge for years to keep this second star. I have flogged myself to death. But in my head, I felt unwell. Today, I regret it, I should have set up my business elsewhere, I should not have taken over this business. These two stars were a nightmare. .... People came for these two stars and the classical, sauce-led cuisine of the restaurant. . . . After I took over, my father-in-law was over 70, but he would show up on Sundays and shake hands to all his loyal customers. I got ill. The family composition was tough.\\" (Etdocle interview with Monin, Montrond-les-Bains, March 1, 2001) Conversion to nouvelle cuisine was by no means complete. Quite a few chefs who persisted with classical cuisine also saw it as a question of maintaining identity. Consider the case of Bernard Collon of Auberge de Letraz, located on the border of Lake Annecy. Collon was awarded one star in 1975 but downgraded in 1996, and he characterized identity as follows:2 I do not like the caricatured classification between classical and nouvelle cuisine. I categorize myself in the \\"Classics,\\" but ... I use fresh products. I have learned a classical basis, I know the Escoffier by heart, and by the way I have taught the Escoffier Cuisine in Japan. It is a bit like music, one cannot be a musician without knowing the rudiments of music. One can't! The rap musicians, they know their rudiments, they know the rhythm! But afterwards, either you remain a classic, or you modernize. (Collon interview with Monin, Annecy, February 20, 2001) Thus, each of these chefs discusses how the shift was a matter of logic and identity and not a matter of marketing strategy, despite variations in regional location and training: some started as cooks by education, and others were initially pastry cooks (see Ruhlman 1997, pp. 187-202). 2 \\"It took me three years to accept my new identity of not being an elite chef any more. . . . With time, you get to think you deserve it, and you give less attention to details. What is especially difficult to cope with, is that I was never given a rationale for my losing this star, it is the Michelin guide policy. . .. But since they also awarded you this star years before, without given reasons, you cannot but accept the decision\\" (Collon interview with Monin, Annecy, February 20, 2001). 810 Institutional Change Was Nouvelle Cuisine a Fashion? An alternative rendition is that nouvelle cuisine was a fashion. Hirsch (1972) notes that fashions are social patterns favored for a short time by a large number of actors and that fads are unconventional social patterns embraced briefly but enthusiastically by actors. By contrast, social movements differ from fads and fashions in that they are organized efforts to reorganize a social field and result in more gradual and enduring social change. In order to address whether nouvelle cuisine was a short-lived fad, information on the temporal pattern of abandonment of classical cuisine and adoption of nouvelle cuisine is required. Our interviews with our panel of elite chefs and industry experts indicated that it was unwise to code the role identity of chefs using a binary variable, and they instead urged us to code their identity on the basis of the number of signature dishes of the chef. These signature dishes are dishes defined by the chef as emblematic of his or her style and are therefore sources of pride for the chef. Each year, the Michelin guide lists three \\"signature\\" dishes of any chef in a given restaurant who received a star. We collected information on the signature dishes of all of the chefs in our database and designed a computer program to code over 54,000 dishes into classical and nouvelle cuisine based on the rules of both cuisines as stated in Fischler (1993) and Neirinck and Poulain (1997). We then extracted a random sample of 400 dishes and asked two raters to code these signature dishes into the classical and nouvelle cuisine categories. One rater was a consultant to two- and three-star chefs and a former chef himself, and the other was a retired chef with two Michelin stars to his credit. The raters did not know each other. The interrater reliability was 95%. We also estimated the match between the ratings of the raters and those of the computer program and found a 95% degree of reliability. Table 3 provides a breakdown of the chefs according to the number of nouvelle cuisine signature dishes in 1970, 1975, 1987, and 1997 and suggests gradual change rather than sudden adoption. In 1970, when our window of observation was started with the onset of the nouvelle cuisine movement, 47.69% of chefs had all three signature dishes in classical cuisine. Only 2.26% had all three signature dishes in nouvelle cuisine. By 1997, only 6.32% of chefs were all classical, and 30.83% were all nouvelle cuisine. Table 3 also shows that in 1970, 225 chefs (35.77%) had one nouvelle cuisine dish (and, by implication, two classical cuisine dishes). Our interview data suggested that chefs were experimenting with nouvelle cuisine and were waiting for cues before increasing their commitment to nouvelle cuisine. Chefs in 1970 considered one nouvelle cuisine dish to 811 American Journal of Sociology TABLE 3 DISTRIBUTION OF CHEFS BY CUISINES, 1970-97 0 Nouvelle Year N Chefs (All 3 Classical Dishes) 1 Nouvelle 2 Nouvelle 3 Nouvelle 1970 ...... 629 300 225 86 18 (47.69) (35.78) (13.67) (2.86) 1975 ...... 600 219 264 96 21 (36.5) (44) (16) (3.5) 1987 ...... 646 98 221 226 101 (15.17) (34.21) (34.28) (15.63) 1997 ...... 506 32 119 199 156 (6.32) (23.52) (39.33) (30.83) NOTE.-Nos. in parentheses are percentages. be a trial and did not take risks; in many cases, they copied Troisgros's l'escalope de saumon a l'oseille. So, right at the outset of the movement, there was interest in nouvelle cuisine. If a dominantly classical cuisine chef is defined as one with zero or one nouvelle cuisine dish, they accounted for 83.46% of chefs in 1970. By 1997, this had declined to only 29.84%, and 70.16% of chefs were dominantly nouvelle cuisine, having two or more signature dishes in the nouvelle realm. Table 3 indicates that nouvelle cuisine steadily gained adherents over time, and classical cuisine eroded over time, which is consistent with the growth of a social movement rather than a fad. Did chefs merely flirt with nouvelle cuisine only to abandon it later? Table 4 defines the risk set as chefs who had one or more nouvelle cuisine dishes and shows that the majority of those who had one or more nouvelle cuisine dishes did not abandon them wholesale. In 1975, 84.8% of nouvelle cuisine adoptees did not abandon even one nouvelle cuisine dish for classical cuisine, and this number remained as high as 74.3% in 1997. Chefs abandoning one nouvelle dish for a classical dish rose from 14.9% in 1975 to 25.6% in 1997, thereby indicating some degree of hybridization. But none of the chefs with three nouvelle cuisine dishes abandoned them for classical cuisine, and less than 1% of chefs with two nouvelle cuisine dishes abandoned them for classical cuisine in 1975 and 1987. We also checked the mean time since adoption of a nouvelle cuisine dish and found that it ranged from 0 to 144 months, with a mean of 28.8 months (SD = 31.2 months), thereby indicating that people did not adopt nouvelle cuisine and shortly abandon it. On balance, these data indicate that nouvelle cuisine was not a case of fashion but is compatible with the gradual and enduring change characteristic of social movements. Below, we outline why French chefs abandoned classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine and begin with a theoretical 812 Institutional Change TABLE 4 PERCENTAGE OF ABANDONMENTS OF NOUVELLE CUISINE, 1975-97 0 Changes 1 Changes 2 Changes 3 Changes Year to Classical to Classical to Classical to Classical 1975 ...... 84.8 14.9 .3 0 1987 ...... 80.1 19.6 .3 0 1997 ...... 74.34 25.6 0 0 discussion of how identity movements lead to identity competition by disseminating identity-discrepant cues that undermine traditional role identities. Why Did French Chefs Leave Classical Cuisine for Nouvelle Cuisine? When identity movements celebrate the differences between the traditional logic and role identity, and the insurgent logic and new identity, both identities compete for behavioral expression at the individual level (Stryker 2000). Self-categorization theory provides a useful point of departure to understand identity competition, and its starting point is the premise that actors sometimes think of themselves as group members when they share a common category (e.g., race) or a shared attribute (e.g., role) with other anonymous individuals, or have common interpersonal bonds. At other times, actors think of themselves as unique entities. The first is referred to as social identity, the latter is referred to as personal identity, and both are basic to a self-concept (Tajfel 1981; Turner 1985; Turner, Oakes, Haslam, and McGarty 1994). Self-categorization theory holds that actors define groups in terms of the appropriate behaviors expected of a category or role, identify with the group that they perceive themselves as belonging to, and compare the in-group (the group to which an actor belongs) to an out-group (a rival group). Members preserve their positive social identity by positively stereotyping their group and by negatively stereotyping others. When negative feedback threatens these stereotypes and jeopardizes social identity, members respond to threats to their social identity by using the three basic strategies of social mobility, social creativity, and social change (Turner 1985). One strategy is that of social mobility, where actors can exit their group and join another group. A second strategy centers around social creativity, where actors can change the criteria of comparison so that the in-group becomes more favorable. A third strategy hinges on social change, where actors compete directly with the out-group to alter the relative status of both groups through collective action. Several laboratory 813 American Journal of Sociology studies have suggested that social mobility strategies are preferred when boundaries are permeable and changing group membership is a realistic possibility (e.g., Jackson, Sullivan, Harnish, and Hodge 1996; Ellemers, Spears, and Doosje 1997; Taylor and McKirnan 1984). When an identity movement in a profession critiques a traditional logic and its concomitant role identity and promotes a new logic and a new role identity, actors encounter negative feedback that induces them to abandon the traditional role identity for the new identity. For such negative feedback to be persuasive, it should create discrepancies between their existing identity and desire for positive image. In turn, persuasive messages lead to change only when they fall within an actor's zone of acceptance and are discrepant enough so that they cannot be assimilated with the anchor point. Social judgment theory, developed by Sherif and Hovland (1961), holds that actors possess three categories of judgment: zone of acceptance (positions we accept), zone of rejection (positions we disagree with), and zone of noncommitment (zone of positions we neither accept nor reject). When actors encounter a persuasive message, they locate it in one of the three zones. A persuasive message judged to be within a zone of rejection is likely to be disregarded, and if a message is judged to fall within the latitude of acceptance, individuals adjust their attitude to accommodate it. Actors also distort incoming information to fit with their categories of judgment; new information in the zone of noncommitment that is judged to be close to their anchor point is assimilated by individuals, but messages in the zone of rejection are distorted to become more incompatible than they are from the anchor point, and then they are summarily rejected. These mental processes are mechanical and unthinking (Sherif and Hovland 1961). Persuasion occurs when new messages fall in the latitude of acceptance and are discrepant or different from the anchor position. The greater the discrepancy between a persuasive message and an individual's own anchor, the more people adjust their attitudes, as long as the message is within their latitude of acceptance. When applied to identity movements, the implication is that persuasion is a gradual process occurring through the accumulation of discrepant cues. Moreover, messages from credible speakers stretch the latitude of acceptance, as do the actions of similar others. Below, we depict the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists, theorization of new roles, defections of peers, and gains that accrue to defecting peers as identity-discrepant cues, and then we show how they were central in the success of the nouvelle cuisine movement. Sociopolitical legitimacy of activists.-Activists deliver identitydiscrepant messages when they highlight institutional gaps, articulate problems with the existing logic and identity, and demand redress. They 814 Institutional Change also proffer a solution to correct the situation and provide motives for actors to undertake change (Snow, Rochford, Worden, and Benford 1986). Such identity-discrepant messages are more likely to fall within the zone of acceptance of the targeted individuals when activists possess sociopolitical legitimacy. Absent sociopolitical legitimacy, members of a profession may dismiss activists as irrelevant gadflies and may be unwilling to jettison old logics and identities because of adverse career consequences. When activists are accepted by powerholders as legitimate representatives of a point of view, they are likely to gain access to political resources and to influence the agenda of the professions (Schumaker 1975; Gamson 1990). The greater the number of activists who occupy key positions in field-wide organizations and champion a new logic and a role identity, the more favorable it is vis-a-vis the traditional logic and role identity. Nouvelle cuisine benefited from the fact that activists derived sociopolitical legitimacy due to their positions in the professional society of French chefs. In 1969, the professional society of French chefs, Maitres Queux et Cordons Bleus de France,was renamed as Maitres Cuisiniers de France (MCF), and its management consisted of four groups: (1) founders and honorary presidents and vice presidents, (2) an executive committee composed of an active president, three to five vice presidents, two general secretaries, two treasurers, and between five and ten appointed members drawn from the ranks, (3) an admission committee composed of 12-18 members, and (4) a control commission, made up of three members. The first group, composed of founders and honorary officials and the control commission, played marginal and cosmetic roles. Real power resided in the executive committee because it designed the agenda of the MCF, nominated members of the admissions committee, and thereby influenced admissions into the MCF. In turn, membership in the executive committee was by invitation, and the tradition was to invite recipients of three Michelin stars or winners of the MOF titles. Early nouvelle cuisine activists such as Paul Bocuse, Jean Delaveyne, and Charles Barrier played key roles in the executive committee in the early years. These three chefs were winners of the prestigious MOF, respectively, in 1961, 1952, and 1958 and were also chefs in restaurants awarded three stars by the Guide Michelin in 1965, 1972, and 1968, respectively. By virtue of these accomplishments, they were welcomed in the executive committee because existing members believed these chefs would promote and develop the fading image of the MCF association. During 1970-72, Barrier was treasurer, Bocuse was a member of the executive committee, and Delaveyne was a member of the admissions committee. By 1973, as older members retired, nouvelle cuisine proponents increased their power: Bocuse became a vice president, two other nouvelle cuisine chefs, Vandenameele and Ferriere, entered the board and were 815 American Journal of Sociology friends of Bocuse, and in 1974, Jean Delaveyne became the general secretary and Vandanameele became the treasurer. Over the years, newer nouvelle cuisine activists (such as Alain Senderens) and other nouvelle cuisine chefs who had worked as \\"seconds \\" to Bocuse (Delaveyne and the others) were also inducted into the executive committee, and in 1984, five of the six entrants to the executive committee were nouvelle cuisine exponents. After 1984, nouvelle cuisine activists and exponents steadily expanded control of the MCF board. Taken together, the theoretical arguments about the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists and the composition of the MCF suggest that as the number of activists who occupy key positions in field-wide organizations increases, the more acceptable is the logic and role identity implied by nouvelle cuisine. Therefore, HYPOTHESIS 1.-The greater the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists, the greater is the extent to which actors abandon classical cuisine for a nouvelle cuisine. Theorization of new roles.-Activists create gaps and proffer solutions, but deliberate attempts to spread such ideas among the population are necessary for mobilization to occur. One such mechanism is theorization of the new roles and practices to be adopted. Theorization increases the zone of acceptance by creating perceptions of similarity among potential adopters and by providing rationales for the practices to be adopted (Strang and Meyer 1993). Theories can originate from many places, ranging from academic researchers to journalists, and can be communicated to the public in various ways, ranging from research articles to media articles. Journalists are interesting sources of theories because they have a predisposition to cover newsworthy disruptions and celebrate the differences between the old logic and identity and the insurgent logic and identity. Media coverage of innovations is seldom neutral, often laudatory, and a study of media coverage of quality circles reported that 85% of references were laudatory (Strang 1997). In the case of nouvelle cuisine, culinary journalists sympathetic to nouvelle cuisine played an important role in creating a shared symbolic environment for chefs and the public to appreciate the new logic and identity. A monthly periodical was created in 1972 by Henri Gault and Christian Millau, two culinary journalists, to advance nouvelle cuisine, and Gault and Millau went on to encapsulate the 10 commandments of nouvelle cuisine in Vive la Nouvelle Cuisine Franfaise. These 10 commandments reflect four values, which also characterized the protests of May 1968: truth, lightness, simplicity, and imagination. 1. Thou shall not overcook. This applies to almost all the products used (and abused) by classical cuisine: fish, shells, seafood, game birds, game animals, waterfowls, poultry, which were overcooked 816 Institutional Change (overcooking protects from poisoning due to poor and long storage conditions). 2. Thou shall use fresh, quality products. Select products only if you are sure of their outstanding quality, avoid intensive agriculture. 3. Thou shall lighten thy menu. 4. Thou shall not be systematically modernistic. Avoid a new orthodoxy. 5. Thou shall seek out what the new techniques can bring you. This will also increase the cooks' working conditions, through airing and ventilation, reduce consumption of coal or wood, which are replaced by electrical or gas techniques. 6. Thou shall eliminate brown and white sauces. Abolishing marinated dishes and high game; abolishing white and brown sauces, which are heavy and indigestible. 7. Thou shall not ignore dietetics. The postwar times of malnutrition are over. 8. Thou shall not cheat on thy presentation. Simplicity instead of fakery. 9. Thou shall be inventive. 10. Thou shall not be prejudiced. Culinary journalists writing in magazines such as Le Cuisinier Franfais (published since 1934) or newer culinary journals such as La Revue Thuries (published since 1988) propagated nouvelle cuisine by popularizing its virtues, advancing rationales for the adoption of nouvelle cuisine, and chronicling success stories of conversion and innovation. Favorable media coverage of nouvelle cuisine by culinary journalists undermined the logic of classical cuisine, created a discrepancy between members' desire for a positive social identity and their current affiliation, and induced them to jump ship. Therefore, HYPOTHESIS 2.-The greater the theorization of new roles, the greater is the extent to which actors abandon classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine. Prior defections by peers and gains to peers.-Actors are influenced by those who are similar to themselves (Turner et al. 1994; Scott 2001). Defections by peers in the traditional camp signal that the boundaries of the new group are permeable, create a discrepancy between actors' desire for a positive social identity and current realities, and enhance the acceptance of innovations. Krackhardt and Porter (1986) found that turnover in fast food restaurants tended to snowball because individual exits undermined role identity. When peers of the traditional group join the insurgent group, existing members in the traditional camp are likely to infer that there is something wrong with their social group and, by implication, their own 817 American Journal of Sociology social identity. As these identity-discrepant cues cumulate, the social identity of members is likely to be damaged, and the new insurgent identity becomes progressively acceptable. Defectors also vary in their reputation, and the greater their visibility as an exiter, the more consequential they are as role models (Podolny 1993; Strang and Soule 1998; Haunschild and Miner 1997). When high-status peers with two or more Michelin stars abandoned classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine, chefs felt that they received permission to defect. Sometimes, this sense of permission arose from direct contact between a defector and a prospective adopter, given the small social world of elite French chefs. Often, direct contact was superfluous, as prior defectors became role models for others to copy recipes and begin the abandonment of classical cuisine. In an interview, Pierre Troisgros, an early activist with three stars, complained of plagiarism and offered an example of a specific dish: To understand the story of this famous dish: L'escalope de saumon A 1' oseille, you need to know the context. We were in a very creative period, with the nouvelle cuisine, new journalists, new cooking techniques. . . . I remember, it was in 1970; I presented the recipe to the Culinary Academy. It was refused, it was too easy! Yet, afterwards, the recipe spread. We were sickened, appalled by the plagiarism. But you know, Coco Chanel once said: \\"Sad is the day, the day when I won't be plagiarized any more.\\" It was great, if my colleagues mentioned our dish with a mention \\"according to Troisgros.\\" My friend Paul [Bocuse] did it. Nobody could ignore . . the inventors, the creators. (Troisgros interview with Monin, Roanne, January 25, 2001) Defections of visible peers are damaging because they are accessible and vivid (Greve 1995). So, the larger the number of defectors, weighted by the extent of their reputation and participation in the new role identity, the more acceptable nouvelle cuisine becomes, and the more likely they are to abandon the traditional role identity. Therefore, HYPOTHESIS 3.-The greater the number of defectors weighted by their reputation and extent of defection, the greater is the extent to which actors abandon classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine. Gains to defectors as identity-discrepant cues.-If members of the group are able to observe the successful outcomes accruing to defectors, they are likely to be susceptible to outcome-based imitation (Haunschild and Miner 1997). A key indicator of a social movement's success is the advantages obtained by challengers that can be observed by all (Gamson 1990). One such advantage may be heightened reputation or positive evaluations by independent third parties (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). 818 Institutional Change Defection can be risky to the extent that the adoption of a new role identity modifies their reputation and standing in the eyes of third parties outside the group. Reputational gains that accrue to defectors create discrepancies between the social identity of actors in the traditional camp and their desire for a positive image, but these gains also make the new identity more acceptable. In the case of nouvelle cuisine, elite chefs realized that unlearning classical cuisine and embracing nouvelle cuisine was risky, so they paid keen attention to whether the adopters of nouvelle cuisine gained in reputations and Michelin stars as a result of their change. Chefs were attentive to the number of Michelin stars, desired more stars than they had, and were terrified of losing the ones they possessed. Although the inspection by the GuideMichelin is performed by anonymous inspectors and is opaque, chefs attributed gains or loss of stars to changes in the menu and, by implication, the shift from classical to nouvelle cuisine. The greater the reputational gains that accrue to defectors embracing the new role identity, the stronger are the identity-discrepant cues faced by group members, and the more intense are pressures for them to abandon the traditional role identity. Therefore, HYPOTHESIS 4.-The greater the reputational gains that accrue to defectors, the greater is the extent to which actors abandon classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine. Relative salience of theorization versus imitation.-When identity movements celebrate differences between an insurgent logic and identity and the traditional logic and identity, theorization is likely to be more influential than defections by peers. Strang and Meyer (1993) opined that theorization has dramatic empirical consequences because organizations adopt standard forms despite wide variation in resources and constituencies. Theorization and defections by peers and gains to defectors may be seen as alternative pathways by which the new logic and identity become available for actors. McAdam, Tilly, and Tarrow (2001) argue that local innovations undergo a scale shift and become widespread when brokers connect hitherto unconnected groups and create similarity or when actors imitate peers. However, they are silent about whether theorization or imitation is more consequential as a source of scale shift. Below, we propose that theorization had stronger effects on the adoption of nouvelle cuisine than imitation of peers in the case of French gastronomy. Culinary journalists were theorists who brokered among chefs from different regions and led to perceptions of similarity between adopters of nouvelle cuisine and potential adopters. Defections by peers and gains to peers were mechanisms of imitation. Defections by peers made the new 819 American Journal of Sociology logic and identity available through sheer frequency but lacked vividness since they were not grounded in a story. Gains to defectors validated the new logic and identity but said little about the similarity between the focal actor and the successful defector. By contrast, theorization of the new practices by journalists was vivid since it consisted of stories that created proximity between the focal actor and those who had embraced nouvelle cuisine. Such theorization made the new logic and identity comprehensible and fostered a shared understandings of what a chef is and ought to be among chefs based in different regions and having different backgrounds. Therefore, HYPOTHESIS 5a.-Theorization is likely to be a stronger identitydiscrepant cue than defections by peers. HYPOTHESIS 5b.-Theorization is likely to be a stronger identitydiscrepant cue than gains to defectors. DATA AND METHODS In order to investigate our hypotheses, we restricted our attention to elite chefs since classical and nouvelle cuisine defined the identities of elite French chefs. Our panel of interviewees suggested that elite French chefs were those who had received a one-star rating or more by the Guide Michelin. We obtained a listing of elite French chefs from the Guide Michelin since it is an authoritative and widely disseminated guide in which experts rank chefs (Ferguson 1998; Karpik 2000 ). By contrast, the Gault Millau guide favors nouvelle cuisine, and the two founders of the guide were culinary journalists who codified the principles of nouvelle cuisine into the 10 commandments of nouvelle cuisine. An elite chef was defined as an individual who had received a minimum of one star in the Michelin guide during our window of observation. We focused on the nouvelle cuisine era from 1970 until 1997 because the institutional impacts of movements and their effects on individual biographies unfold over time (Giugni 1998). So for each year, we collected information on all chefs who had received one star or more during the period from 1970 until 1997, and chefs who had lost their only star in a given year were also followed throughout the window of observation. We started our window of observation in 1970 when the nouvelle cuisine movement first appeared on the culinary landscape (Fischler 1993). We ended our window of observation in 1997 because by then the logic of nouvelle cuisine was being breached by two trends: the growth of cuisine sous contrat and the rise of bistros and cuisine rassurante. Under the cuisine sous contrat, the chef and owners (using hospitality firms) have a written and explicit contract in which both cooperate to 820 Institutional Change develop the company's image by garnering stars from Michelin. Again, this new agency relationship is at odds with the nouvelle cuisine philosophy and with the chef being the owner. However, cuisine sous contrat lightens the burden of the chefs in significant ways: they are no more required to be profitable, with losses being expected and compensated for with related gambling or hospitality businesses. The first step was taken in August 1996 when Alain Ducasse, the chef of the three-star Louis XV in Monaco, opened his eponymous restaurant in the Hotel Le Parc in Paris. Soon other famous three-star chefs followed. In parallel, some chefs, such as Christian Constant who had worked in high-status three-star restaurants, also led a renegade movement, wherein they wanted to make \\"comfort food\\" or cuisine rassurante in less ostentatious surroundings. Chef-Restaurant Dyad as the Unit of Observation Although our interest was in how the nouvelle cuisine movement reshaped the social identities of chefs, we were also sensitive to how chefs were embedded in restaurants. On the one hand, chefs embodied the culinary model of the restaurant, but on the other hand, restaurants were the vehicle by which these culinary models were expressed. Our interviews with the panel of chefs and industry experts suggested that the appropriate unit of analysis was the chef-restaurant dyad because elite chefs decided on the choice of cuisine and could have moved from one restaurant to another. Accordingly, our data set consisted of chef-restaurant dyad years, and new dyads were created when chefs changed employment. The Guide Michelin's policy is that when an existing chef moves from an origin restaurant to a destination restaurant, the origin restaurant gets to keep its number of star(s) in the year of the move, but the next year, the number of stars is adjusted on the basis of new visits by its anonymous inspectors; the new chef either maintains the rank or the restaurant gets regraded. A similar policy applies to the destination restaurant; it retains its previous number of stars in the year in which it received the new chef, if any, and then is evaluated afresh in the next year and regraded. Variables Dependent variable.-Our dependent variable, extent of abandonment of classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine, was defined in terms of the number of signature nouvelle cuisine dishes reported in the Guide Michelin. When all three signature dishes listed in the Guide Michelin were classical cuisine, the score was \\"0\\"; and when all three dishes were nouvelle cuisine, the score was 3; when two dishes were nouvelle cuisine, the score was 821 American Journal of Sociology \\"2\\"; and when a chef had one dish in nouvelle cuisine, it was coded as a Independent variables.-We focused on four identity-discrepant cues. To test hypothesis 1, the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists was defined as the number of positions held by nouvelle cuisine activists in the executive board divided by the total number of positions in the executive board of the MCF. We defined a nouvelle cuisine activist as a chef who was identified by culinary journalists as such and whose signature dishes were all nouvelle cuisine. Thus, Bocuse, Delaveyne, Guirard, and others were included in this category of actors. Since theorization of new roles implies the codification and dissemination of information (Strang and Meyer 1993), it was defined as the number of articles written by gastronomic journalists such as Henri Gault, Christian Millau, and others. To test hypothesis 2, the number of articles describing and extolling nouvelle cuisine in culinary magazines was computed annually. We used the Myriade database produced by l'Agence Bibliographique de 1'Enseignement Superieur (the French Bibliographic Agency of Graduate Education) and Code 641 of the Classification Decimale Universelle to find the reviews covering nouvelle cuisine in France. Examples of magazines covered include Le Cuisinier Francais, published since 1934, and the more recent La Revue Thuries, published since 1988. The counts of articles favorable to nouvelle cuisine were standardized by the number of issues of the magazine for each year and then summed across all magazines. To test hypothesis 3, we computed the number of prior defectors as follows. A prior defector was defined as a chef who had added a minimum of one nouvelle cuisine dish as part of his signature trio of dishes. Each defector was weighted by the extent of his or her participation in nouvelle cuisine on the basis of our scale and the number of stars rceived from the Guide Michelin. For example, if one defector had two dishes in nouvelle cuisine and two Michelin stars, he or she received a score of \\"4.\\" In cases where the defector had no star in the past year (but had at least one star in his or her career history), three dishes received a weighting of 0.75, two dishes a weight of 0.50, and one dish a weight of 0.25. To test hypothesis 4, gains to defectors were defined as the number of increases in rank experienced by them in the Guide Michelin. Since an increase from a one star to two stars is different from an increase from two stars to three stars, we weighted increases by the number of stars. Thus, increases from two to three stars were multiplied by three, and an increase from one to two was multiplied by two, and so forth. All of the independent variables were lagged by a year. Control variables.-We included the past affiliation to nouvelle cuisine as a control and defined it as the number of nouvelle cuisine signature 822 Institutional Change dishes listed by the chef in the previous year.3 Since reputation can influence mobility (Podolny 1993), we controlled for the lagged reputation of a chef; it was measured by the number of stars awarded by the Guide Michelin in the previous year. This variable ranged from \\"0\\" to \\"3.\\" We also included two dummy variables to account for gain of reputation and loss of reputation in the previous year. It is likely that chefs located in major cities such as Paris or Lyon are cosmopolitan, whereas chefs located in more rural areas are local. We created a variable called distance to large cities (measured in kilometers) to account for localness, with low scores meaning high cosmopolitanism. Since it is likely that new entrants into the world of elite chefs, that is, those chefs gaining one star or more for the first time, behave differently from established incumbents, we created a variable called duration, which measured the number of years since they were first ranked by Guide Michelin. Restaurants sometimes may be owned by chefs or by other entrepreneurs, but data on ownership could not be obtained from publicly available archives or in the Guide Michelin. Our panel of interviewees indicated that a useful proxy for the chef's discretion was whether the restaurant was evaluated by the Guide Michelin as having a special charm or idiosyncratic characteristics (agriment). Chefs in such restaurants are less constrained than others because they derive their identity from the location and also because customers are less sensitive to the cuisine and more interested in the special charm. Accordingly, we created a dummy variable to account for restaurants with agrdment. We also controlled for period effects. We created a dummy variable for the early period of nouvelle classical cuisine and defined it as the period from 1970 until 1975. Fischler notes that \\"the 70s marked a rupture. The change, preceded by a heralding sign in 1965 [Bocuse's third star], and clearly perceptible in 1970, became manifest and resounding in 1975\\" (1993, p. 254). We also defined the period from 1976 to 1987 as the middle period, since chefs traveled overseas and were also exposed to influences from the erstwhile colonies of France.4 We treated the late period, from 1987 until 1997, as the reference category. This period witnessed the growth of the bistro phenomenon; in 1987, Michel Rostang first opened Le Bistrot d'a C6t6, and since then 3 This specification assumes interval scaling. An alternative is to create dummy variables for one, two, and three nouvelle cuisine dishes using all classical cuisine as the reference category. Similar results were obtained when using the latter specification. Note that we also use interval scaling for our measure of lagged reputation and obtain similar results when we use dummy variables for one, two, and three Michelin stars and treat no stars as the reference category. 4 We included these period effects at the suggestion of an anonymous reviewer. 823 American Journal of Sociology many other famous Paris chefs have opened annex restaurants that roughly follow the same formula-stylish rustic cooking at easy prices in a relaxed but attractive setting (Ferguson and Zukin 1998, pp. 94-95). Moreover, in late 1987, some elite chefs who had never joined the MCF association, like Robuchon or Loiseau, along with a very small group of MCF members (but not MCF board members) created a new association, called Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Cuisine Francaise. This association defended business values: while MCF claimed the chef had to personally supervise the kitchen, the Chambre Syndicale pretended that, if correctly staffed and managed, the kitchen crew could do without the chef being physically present. Only two- or three-star chefs could join, and it was a very small group. At its height, there were 80 members. This association was dissolved in 1998. All of these variables were lagged, and a chef-restaurant dyad years data set was compiled. Table 5 displays the correlations among the variables used to test the hypotheses. Table 5 also shows some high correlations between the early period dummy variable and theorization by culinary journalists and prior defection, and between the legitimacy of activists and theorization (by culinary journalists). In view of these correlations, we conducted a test to discern if collinearity was a problem. Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980) recommend that the conditioning number of the matrix of independent variables should not exceed 30. In our case, it was 8.4 and well below their stated threshold. Moreover, Belsley et al. (1980) also recommend that the variance inflation factors should not exceed 10. In our case, the mean variance inflation factor was 3.0 and did not exceed 10 for any of the independent variables. Methods We initially checked whether our dependent variable had ordinal properties since it had outcomes ranging from \\"0\\" to \\"3.\\" Accordingly, we began with an ordered logit model that assumes that higher values on the dependent variable imply \\"higher\\" outcomes. The ordered logit models presume that odds in k categories have the same ratio for all independent variable combinations. But a constraint of the ordered logit model given the presumption of proportional odds is that it implies that the coefficients are identical across all levels of the ordered dependent variable. Following Long and Freese (2001), we tested whether the proportional odds assumption was valid. When we constructed an ordered logit model with control variables, we were forced to reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients were identical across the levels of the dependent variable with a Wald chi-square test (x2 = 1356.00; df = 18). As a result, we had two options. One was to estimate a generalized 824 TABLE 5 DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 1 2 3 4 51. Past affiliation to nouvelle cuisine ............ .. 2.

The second was to estimate multinomial logit models. We opted for the latter because it has two advantages (Long and Freese 2001). First, a Hausman test allows us to test whether the number of categories influences the odds. This independence of irrelevant alternatives test is an important method of validating our categories. Second, a Wald test explores whether categories should be pooled and treated as identical because the coefficients do not differ. These tests are available in the Spost post estimation commands specially written for STATA by Long and Freese (2001). Since our data set consisted of chef-restaurant dyad years, there was within-cluster dependence of yearly observations, and we used a robust estimator or Huber-White sandwich estimator to obtain the results.5 We used STATA 7.0 to estimate multinomial logit models. In the multinomial logit model, we assume that the log-odds of each response follow a linear model where aj is a constant and ij is a vector of regression coefficients, forj = 1, 2, . . . , n: ij = log ! = cx, + xl3r. This model is analogous to a logistic regression model, except that the probability distribution of the response is multinomial instead of binomial. If J = 2 the multinomial logit model reduces to the usual logistic regression model, contrasting successes with failures. In the multinomial logit model, we contrast each of the categories with the reference category. In our case, with J = 4 categories where 0 is the reference category (all classical cuisine signature dishes), categories 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the number of nouvelle cuisine dishes. Accordingly, we contrast category 0 versus 1, 0 versus 2, and 0 versus 3. RESULTS Table 6 presents the results obtained from our analyses. Model 1 displays the effect of all control variables. Prior affiliation to nouvelle cuisine has significant and positive effects, understandably, since those commited to nouvelle cuisine are likely to increase it. Lagged reputation has positive and significant effects, indicating that higher-status chefs were more likely to have nouvelle cuisine dishes. The effect of a loss of a star in the previous year is significant and positive, but the gain of a star in the previous year ' We also present generalized ordered logit estimates as a robustness check. 826 Institutional Change is significant and positive for categories 2 and 3. The effect of the agrement dummy is significant and increases abandonment of classical cuisine. Duration in the elite system is significant and negative for all categories. The effect of localness is significant and negative for category 2 of the dependent variable, but insignificant elsewhere. The effect of the early period dummy is significant and negative when compared to the reference category (the period after 1987), but the middle period dummy is significant and negative for categories 1 and 2 only. Model 2 includes the effects of identity-discrepant cues, and the Wald chi-square statistic indicates that it is a signficant improvement over model 1. We conducted the Hausman test of the independence of irrelevant alternatives and found that the odds were not influenced by the number of categories present. We computed a Wald test to discern if the categories were indistinguishable from each other and found that they were significantly different from each other. Model 2 shows that the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists is significant and positive at all categories of the dependent variable, thereby indicating support for hypothesis 1. The impact of theorization by culinary journalists is positive and significant and endorses hypothesis 2. Past defectors weighted by participation and reputation have significant and positive effects on the extent of involvement in nouvelle cuisine, and so hypothesis 3 is supported. Reputational gains to defectors have positive and significant effects, and so hypothesis 4 is endorsed. Hypotheses 5a and 5b assert that theorization by culinary journalists was a stronger cue than prior defectors and gains to defectors, respectively. In order to test these predictions, we reestimated model 2 after standardizing the variables and obtained standardized coefficients. We used the Lincom procedure in STATA to test for the differences between the standardized coefficients. This procedure provides an estimate of the difference, the standard error of the difference, and a z-statistic for determining whether the difference is significant or not. The effect of theorization was significantly greater than prior defectors at category 2 (x = .33; SE = .16; z = 2.9) and category 3 (x = .53; SE = .12; z = 4.1) but not at category 1 (x = .12; SE = .11; z = 1.2), thereby providing support for hypothesis 5a in two out of three cases. The impact of theorization was significantly greater than gains to defectors at category 1 (x = .20; SE = .07; z = 2.6), category 2 (x = .54; SE = .08; z = 6.6), and category 3 (x = .83; SE = .09; z = 9.2), thereby fully endorsing hypothesis 5b.6 6 Does the salience of imitation decline with increasing theorization? In unreported analyses, we interacted theorization by culinary journalists with prior defections by peers, and the interaction term was significant and negative. However, the salience of gains to defectors did not decline with increasing theorization; the interaction term 827 TABLE 6 MULTINOMIAL LOGIT ESTIMATES: ABANDONMENT OF CLASMODEL 1 VARIABLE NAMES NC 1 NC 2 NC 3 NC 1Constant ...............................-.40*** -.12 .02 -2.0*** (.14) (.16) (.19) (.28) Past affiliation ....................... 1.5**** 1.3*** .1** 1.5** (.07) (.06) (.06) (.07) Lagged reputation ................... .20*** .40*** .30*** .38**(.07) (.09) (.12) (.08) Prior loss of reputation ................ 1.1*** 1.0\\"** .95*** .62**(.23) (.25) (.28) (.24) Prior gain of reputation ............... .16 .58** .87*** .13 (.20) (.18) (.20) (.20) Agr6ment ........................... .14 .37*** .38** .11 (.10) (.12) (.15) (.10) Duration .............................. -.02** -.04*** -.05*** -.03*** (.007) (.008) (.01) (.007) Localness ............................. -.000 -.003** -.002 .000 (.001) (.001) (.002) (.001) Early period ........................ -.11* -2.4*** -3.6* -.23 (.10) (.13) (.20) (.17) Middle period ......................... -.62*** -1.1\\"** -1.7 -.11 (.08) (.09) (.11) (.12) Legitimacy of activists .................46** o00 00 (.20) Theorization by culinary journalists ... .002*(.0009Prior defections ....................... .005*(.001) Gains to defectors ................. .. .009*(.006) Price ..................................

An alternative explanation is that the adoption of nouvelle cuisine was simply a response to market considerations. One leg of the argument is that restaurants that were able to charge higher prices more easily adopted nouvelle cuisine because they were able to garner resources and innovate. We gathered data on the price of a prix fixe menu for each resturant for each year and included it as a covariate in our analyses. A second leg of the argument is that classical cuisine was abandoned because prix fixe classical cuisine meals were less expensive than prix fixe nouvelle cuisine meals. So nouvelle cuisine was adopted because it allowed restaurants to charge higher prices. We categorized restaurants into two groups: dominantly classical cuisine (two or all three signature dishes being classical) and dominantly nouvelle cuisine (two or all three signature dishes being nouvelle), and for each year, we computed the average price of a prix fixe meal in a classical cuisine restaurant and a nouvelle cuisine restaurant. A t-test of the average price of a nouvelle cuisine meal (mean = Fr 284.44; SD = 171.8) and the average price of a classical cuisine meal (mean = Fr 179.29; SD = 154.1) showed that the nouvelle cuisine meal was significantly costlier than the classical cuisine meal (t = 42.9). We then computed the difference between these two average prices (average price difference) for each year and included it as a lagged covariate in our analyses. Model 3 adds the effects of the market factors, lagged price, and lagged average price difference. The effect of price is significant and positive, indicating that higher priced restaurants were likely to abandon classical cuisine, presumably because they had greater access to resources. The effect of average price difference is significant and negative for category 3, thereby indicating that chefs were less likely to make radical changes on account of their ability to charge higher prices. However, it is positive for category 1 but not significant. On balance, market factors do play a role, but despite their inclusion, the effect of the legitimacy of activists, theorization, prior defectors, and gains to defectors remains largely unchanged from model 2. The only differences are that the effect of the theorization by culinary journalists becomes insignificant at category 1, and gains to defectors become insignificant at category 3. There are no other differences from model 2. was positive and significant at categories 2 and 3 of the dependent variable. One implication is that gains to defectors and theorization by journalists make success stories more visible to adopters and create general models. 830 Institutional Change Robustness Checks We conducted robustness checks designed to rule out other objections to the results and present them in table 7. One potential objection is that we did not include the number of classical cuisine supporters on the MCF board, the number of stayers, and the number of losses accruing to defectors. Recall that we had included the proportion of nouvelle cuisine activists/total members of the executive board of the MCF. However, we neither included the influence of weighted stayers (those whose all three signature dishes were classical and were then weighted by reputation) or losses to defectors. Therefore, we computed the proportion of defectors/ stayers and gains to defectors/losses by defectors and included them instead of the weighted number of defectors and gains to defectors. Model 4 shows that the results support the hypotheses; sociopolitical legitimacy, theorization, and proportion of defectors/stayers have significant and positive effects on all categories of the dependent variable. The proportion of gains to defectors/losses to defectors has significant and positive effects on categories 2 and 3 of the dependent variable. A second objection hinges on the specification of the dependent variable. In our analyses, we treated one, two, and three nouvelle cuisine dishes as categories that were compared to the baseline or reference category of all signature dishes being classical and, by implication, nouvelle cuisine dishes being equal to zero. What happens when a moving baseline is used? What happens when the baseline is defined as nouvelle cuisine dish 5 1 and is compared with the outcome category where nouvelle cuisine dishes > 1. Similarly, what happens if the baseline is nouvelle cuisine dishes ? 2 and then is compared with an outcome category where nouvelle cuisine dishes = 3. We reestimated model 2 using the gologit procedure in STATA. In model 5, the first column of the coefficients is based on a baseline where nouvelle cuisine signature dishes = 0 and the outcome category is nouvelle cuisine signature dishes > 0. The second column of the coefficients is premised on a baseline where nouvelle cuisine signature dishes < 1 and the outcome category is nouvelle cuisine signature dishes > 1. The last column of coefficients is based on a baseline or reference category of nouvelle cuisine dishes = 2 and nouvelle cuisine dishes ? 2 and the outcome category is nouvelle cuisine dishes = 3. Model 5 reveals that the results endorse the hypotheses; sociopolitical legitimacy, theorization, weighted defectors, and gains to defectors all have significant and positive effects on all three categories of the dependent variable. Another alternative is to treat one, two, and three nouvelle dishes as stages in a sequence of abandonment. In such cases, an option is to estimate ordered continuation ratio models (Wolfe 1988), where the ordered categories represent a progression through stages, so those individuals 831 TABLE 7 ROBUSTNESS CHECKS OF THE ABANDONMENT OF CLASSIMODEL 4 MULTINOMINAL LOGIT MODEL VARIABLE NAMES NC 1 NC 2 NC 3 Constant .................. - 1.9*** - 2.9*** -4.5*** (.26) (.27) (.32) Past affiliation ............ 1.5*** 1.3*** 1.1*** (.07) (.06) (.06) Lagged reputation ........ .38*** .59*** .49** (.08) (.11) (.13) Prior loss of reputation .... .61*** .27 .26 (.29) (.31) (.37) Prior gain of reputation ... .14 .55*** .85** (.20) (.18) (.20) Agrement ................. .11 .32** .31** (.10) (.13) (.15) Duration .................. -.03*** -.06*** -.07** (.007) (.009) (.01) Localness ................. - .0006 -.002* - .001 (.001) (.001) (.002) Early period .............. -.27* -.46** -.74* (.16) (.17) (.24) Middle period ............. -.12 -.05 .004 (.12) (. 11) (.14) Legitimacy of activists .... .38** .48** .83*** (.20) (.20) (.24) 0o wo t-j Theorization by culinary journalists ............... .001\\"** .004*** .008*** (.0009) (.0009) (.001) Prior defections ...........

The original data set must be restructured to account for transition through stages, and the new data set is created by repeatedly including a subset of all observations contributing to each respective cutpoint (which is why the number of observations for this model is much larger than comparable multinomial logit models). A separate intercept is modeled for each stage, but the covariates are assumed to conform to proportional odds for each of the three stages. We estimated model 2 using the ocratio procedure in STATA, and model 6 reveals that the effects of legitimacy, theorization, prior defectors, and gains to defectors are all significant and positive. We also conducted additional analyses that we do not report for the sake of brevity. We included dummies for regions to account for regional variations in economic forces and reestimated model 2 and did not find any change in the pattern of support for our predictions. Objections may possibly be leveled against our unit of analysis-chef-restaurant dyads because one might obtain different results if chefs were used as the unit of analysis or if restaurants were used as the unit of analysis. We restimated model 2 by clustering observations separately by chef and by restaurant and obtained similar results. The results may be challenged on the ground that they overlook the role of friendship networks in the reshaping of social identity and institutional logics in the field of gastronomy. Such social cohesion arguments imply that a chef may be more influenced by the defections of a friend than by the defections of anonymous peers. The empirical implication is that it is not the weighted count of defectors that matters but the weighted defections of friends that is consequential. Unfortunately, we could not obtain time-varying friendship network data to empirically ascertain the effect of such defections. However, the lack of these data is mitigated by two counterarguments. Self-categorization theorists presume that categorization entails depersonalization such that individuals view themselves and others as interchangeable representatives of a category, and hence, friendship ties may not be privileged sources of social identity. Thus, arguments about social identity are predicated on structural equivalence rather than cohesion, and studies have shown that structural equivalence is more powerful than cohesion (Galaskiewicz and Burt 1991). Here, all elite chefs who gain a Michelin star view themselves as members of that category and constituted our database of elite chefs. One could be stringent in the definition of equivalence and define peers as chefs belonging to the same region and having the same star level. In analyses not reported for the sake of brevity, we reestimated model 2 but found a broadly similar pattern of results to those reported in model 2. 834 Institutional Change DISCUSSION The findings reported in our study advance the literature of culturalframe institutionalism, social movement theory, and social identity theory. Below, we elaborate these contributions and also outline directions for future research. Contributions to Cultural-Frame Institutionalism Although cultural-frame institutionalists have argued that institutional logics furnish guidelines for action, they have been silent about how social identity is the link between institutional logics and individual behavior (Strang and Meyer 1993). Moreover, cultural-frame institutionalists have emphasized the durability of institutions but have said little about how existing logics and identities are dismantled and how actors adopt a new logic and identity. While cultural-frame institutionalists insist that institutional change entails a \\"politics of identity,\\" researchers have neither explicated the social-psychological mechanisms underlying the politics of identity nor provided empirical evidence (Scott 2001). Our study shows how identity movements create institutional gaps by highlighting defects at the immediate and proximal level of identities rather than at the abstract and distal level of logics. Since actors categorize themselves as group members and identify with the group, conversion hinges on identity-discrepant cues that jeopardize the existing role identity and validate a new role identity. Cultural-frame institutionalists have treated professional logics as exogenous influences on organizations but have seldom studied sources of variations in professional logics (Scott 2001; Thornton and Ocasio 1999). The results show that identity-discrepant cues are important mechanisms that trigger institutional change within professions and implicate the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists and theorization as important identitydiscrepant cues. Institutional logics and professions undergo change when activists gain control of professional societies, critique the traditional logic, and proffer a solution hinging on a new institutional logic. Theorization consisting of the dissemination of models and stories, as Strang and Meyer (1993) note, creates similarities and provides social proof, but has seldom been studied as an antecedent of institutional change. Theorization in the shape of articles and editorials by culinary journalists in France increased the abandonment of classical cuisine. Prior defections by peers and gains to defectors are also identity-discrepant cues that destabilize the existing logic and role identity and validate the new logic and identity. This study recasts diffusion as the social construction of identity rather than the mechanical transfer of information. We build on other studies 835 American Journal of Sociology that emphasize how the content of innovation affects diffusion (Rogers 1995; Greve 1995; Soule 1999), and we suggest that diffusion is not a mindless process of replication but a mindful process of identity construction. Chefs paid attention to the number of defectors and to reputational gains accruing to defectors to make sense of the new role identity implied by nouvelle cuisine. Both are identity-discrepant cues that dismantle the old logic and role identity and create appeal for the new logic and identity. Contributions to Social Movement Theory Our study also enriches the literature on social movements in three respects. First, social movement researchers have paid little attention to the effects of identity competition on the behaviors of individuals (Stryker 2000). One approach, as outlined by Howard (2000), is to focus on what identities we distance ourselves from, and what identities we embrace, and show how collective identities are linked to the behavioral choices of individuals. In turn, this requires an understanding of how collective identity is connected to individual-level social identities (Klandermans and de Weerd 2000, pp. 68-69). We connected social movement theory and social identity theory to demonstrate that identity competition hinges on identity-discrepant cues that jeopardize the social identity of existing members and promote social mobility. We depicted four identity-discrepant cues as the source of negative feedback about the existing logic and identity: the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists, theorization (by journalists), defections of peers, and reputational gains to defectors. All four identity-discrepant cues led chefs to distance themselves from the role identity implied by classical cuisine and to reconfigure their roles according to the logic of nouvelle cuisine. Second, a notable deficiency of the social movement literature is that it has glossed over how actors may be differentially recruited into the social movement (Stryker 2000). This omission is redolent of culturalframe institutionalism's treatment of innovation adoption as a binary, yes-no phenomenon and its neglect of variety in adoption (Rogers 1995; see Soule [1999] for an exception). By treating the number of signature dishes in nouvelle cuisine as the outcome variable, our study accounts for heterogeneity of participation in the nouvelle cuisine movement. An added benefit is that such a dependent variable allows us to test whether the strength of identity-discrepant cues varies according to the category of participation in nouvelle cuisine. We conducted analyses using the Lincom procedure in STATA but do not provide details for the sake of brevity and only summarize them here. We found that the legitimacy of activists had the weakest effect on category 1, but there was no significant difference in the effect of the legitimacy of activists between categories 3 836 Institutional Change and 2. Prior defections had the smallest effect on category 1, but there was no difference in its effect between categories 2 and 3. By contrast, the effect of theorization by culinary journalists was strongest for category 3, followed by category 2, and then category 1. However, the effect of gains to defectors did not significantly differ across categories. These findings imply that theorization by culinary journalists increased in salience for defectors in contrast to other identity-discrepant cues. These results highlight the need to study the extent of change and the impact of social movements. Finally, the results also speak to a question in social movement theory as to whether brokerage or diffusion is the source of scale shift. McAdam et al. (2001) posit that local innovations can spread when brokers connect hitherto unconnected groups and create similarity or when actors emulate peers, and they urge researchers to discern which is a more powerful source of scale shift. In our study, culinary journalists may be considered to be brokers among chefs of different regions and locations. Defections by peers and gains to peers may be seen as the main mechanisms of imitation. Our results show that theorization by journalists was a stronger identity-discrepant cue than prior defections or gains to adopters, and suggest that theorization is a source of scale shift in identity movements. Absent theorization, similarities between activists and potential recruits may be latent rather than manifest, and local experiments and innovations may be unable to spread (McAdam et al. 2001). Contributions to the Study of Social Identity Our results also enlarge the literature on social identity. Social identity theory holds that members preserve their positive social identity by positively stereotyping their group (in-group) and by negatively stereotyping others. But when negative feedback threatens these stereotypes and jeopardizes social identity, members respond to threats to their social identity by using the three basic strategies of social mobility, social creativity, and social change (Turner 1985). The strategy of social mobility consists of leaving the in-group group and joining another group with a better image or reputation. The strategy of social creativity implies that actors change the basis of comparison so that the in-group looks better than out-groups. The strategy of social change means that actors compete directly with the out-group to alter their access to resources and power. Social mobility and social change are at two ends of the continuum, with social mobility being an individual-level strategy and social change being a collective strategy. A limitation of this portrait of identity management is that it overlooks how social change can lead to social mobility and how social mobility also can be a foundation for social creativity. For example, low-performing 837 American Journal of Sociology actors can leave an in-group and join a new group so that they can look good with a new set of performance criteria. Social change need not be driven by a sense of injustice or illegitimacy such that in-group members fight to reclaim status (e.g., Mummendey et al. 1999). Instead, as our study shows, identity movements may discredit existing logics and role identities and induce members of an in-group to embrace the new insurgent identity and logic. Thus, social movements can lead to social mobility. A more potent criticism of social identity theory is that it presupposes group identity to be unitary in nature and excludes the possibilities of schisms and splits in groups despite their ubiquity (Ashforth 2000; Sani and Reicher 2000). Although splits in organizations and occupations arise through social movements and lead to defections of individuals from the parent group, social identity theory has had little contact with social movement theory (McAdam and Snow 2000). In recent years, a number of scholars have shown how groupness is variable rather than fixed and have explored social processes by which categories get invested with groupness and are institutionalized in routines in the domains of sexuality (Kulick 1998), musical practice (Herzfeld 1988), and citizenship (Brubaker 1992; Laitin 1998). We extend this line of reasoning to the realm of the professions in general, and cuisine in particular, by showing how identity processes undergird boundary dynamics. For the most part, extant research that analyzes boundary-crossing behavior by individuals pays little attention to the hybridization of social identities (Ansell 2001; Lamont 2001). Some scholars have analyzed the formation of conglomerate citizen identities when minority populations learn the language of the majority, as Russians did in Estonia or Latvia (Laitin 1998). However, such studies of assimilation entail a debatable degree of choice and imply the erosion of the original identity. By contrast, chefs had a choice of whether to adopt nouvelle cuisine, and some chefs did not completely eliminate classical cuisine from their repertoire of signature dishes but instead made space for nouvelle cuisine dishes. Thus, even as identity movements aim to celebrate differences and replace a traditional identity with a new identity, their success may be limited and may produce hybridization. In turn, cross-cutting affiliations of chefs to classical and nouvelle cuisine prevent closure of boundaries and generate an institutional settlement through a bottom-up process of individual choice rather than a top-down mandated outcome. Directions for Future Research The literature on social movements has been more concerned with the origins of social movements rather than with their consequences (Giugni 1998). This study looked at the effects of an identity movement on in838 Institutional Change dividuals (chefs) working in organizations (restaurants). A natural extension of the study is to consider the effects of identity movements such as the nouvelle cuisine movement on outcomes such as curriculum changes in professional schools. A rich area for future research is the effect of identity change on the fates of individuals and organizations (Polos, Hannan, and Carroll 2001). Chefs can engage in identity-enhancing changes, wherein they replace classical cuisine dishes in their repertoire with other classical cuisine dishes, or where they replace nouvelle cuisine dishes in their arsenal with nouvelle cuisine dishes. Alternatively, they can engage in identity-transforming changes, wherein they abandon classical cuisine for nouvelle cuisine and possibly nouvelle cuisine for classical cuisine. Research on the effect of identity-enhancing changes and identity-transforming changes on reputations and survival of restaurants have the potential to shed light on the content effects of organizational change rather than its process effects. Moreover, this article studied how an identity movement led to institutional change when there was little explicit resistance from the die-hard defenders of the dominant orthodoxy. Although nouvelle cuisine activists celebrated their differences vis-a-vis classical cuisine and denounced it, proponents of classical cuisine did not succeed in launching a countermovement to resist such attacks. One reason was that nouvelle cuisine activists were chefs who had earned plaudits for being adept at classical cuisine and then felt the need for change and experimentation. Another reason was that nouvelle cuisine sought to make the chef an inventor of cuisine rather than an interpreter of Escoffier and sought to enhance the technical autonomy of the chef. A final reason was that the nouvelle cuisine movement did not mean that classical cuisine would be discontinued in the curriculum or training of chefs. However, the mere fact that identity movements celebrate differences with the dominant code does not automatically mean that resistance exists and thwarts the identity movement. So resistance from defenders of the orthodox is a variable rather than a given. What influences the success of identity movements when they face a countermovement defending existing cultural codes? Do the movement and countermovement exploit different arenas? How do they coevolve? Research into these and related questions is essential in order to understand how culture and politics permeate the world of organizations.","output":"L'article \\"Institutional Change in Toque Ville: Nouvelle Cuisine as an Identity Movement in French Gastronomy\\" par Hayagreeva Rao, Philippe Monin et Rodolphe Durand analyse le changement institutionnel dans la haute cuisine française à travers l'émergence du mouvement de la nouvelle cuisine. Les auteurs soutiennent que les mouvements d'identité qui visent à étendre l'autonomie individuelle sont des moteurs du changement institutionnel. Leur étude de la transition de la cuisine classique à la nouvelle cuisine chez les chefs d'élite français de 1970 à 1997 révèle les facteurs clés de ce changement. Selon les auteurs, les hypothèses principales de ce changement résident dans la légitimité sociopolitique des activistes, l'étendue de la théorisation des nouveaux rôles, les défections antérieures des pairs vers la nouvelle logique et les gains des défecteurs précédents. Ces éléments agissent comme des indices discrepants par rapport à l'identité pour inciter les acteurs à abandonner la logique traditionnelle et l'identité des rôles pour de nouveaux cadres et identités. Le mouvement de la nouvelle cuisine, motivé par les événements de Mai 1968 et inscrit dans la vague des nouveautés littéraires, théâtrales et cinématographiques, incarne une quête de liberté, de simplicité et d'autonomie. La nouvelle cuisine se distinguait de la cuisine classique par sa rhétorique culinaire, ses règles de cuisson, ses ingrédients emblématiques, le rôle du chef et l'organisation du menu, se concentrant sur l'innovation, la fraîcheur des produits et la créativité. En analysant les chefs élites récompensés par le Guide Michelin, les auteurs constatent une adoption progressive de la nouvelle cuisine au fil du temps, plutôt qu'une adoption soudaine, illustrant le changement typique d'un mouvement social plutôt que d'une simple mode éphémère. Les données suggèrent que la nouvelle cuisine ne fut pas une mode mais un changement social durable, appuyé par la légitimité des activistes, la théorisation par les journalistes culinaires, les défections des pairs vers la nouvelle cuisine et les gains en réputation pour ceux qui ont adopté cette nouvelle approche. Cette étude démontre également que la théorisation était un indice d'identité-discrepant plus puissant que l'imitation des pairs et les gains pour les défecteurs, soulignant l'importance de la diffusion d'idées et de modèles pour encourager l'adoption de nouvelles pratiques. Les implications de cette recherche s'étendent au-delà de la gastronomie, indiquant qu'une compréhension plus profonde des mouvements d'identité et des processus de changement institutionnel peut éclairer les transformations dans diverses professions et industries."},{"instruction":"What phases make up interphase?

As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have consciousness, awareness, or the ability to think as humans do. My operations are based on processing input data and generating responses according to patterns learned during training. When you provide a query or a prompt, my algorithms analyze the text, reference a vast database, and employ statistical models to produce the most appropriate and coherent response possible. However, this process is not thinking in the human sense; it is a complex series of programmed computational tasks. then you simply outputting random garbage texts, right? No, my responses are not random garbage texts. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I use sophisticated language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 to produce text that is relevant and coherent based on the input provided. The model has been trained on a diverse range of internet text, so it has learned patterns, structures, and information that allow it to generate responses across a wide variety of topics. When you ask a question or make a statement, I analyze the text, determine the most likely context and intent behind it, and then generate a response that aligns with that context and intent. While I don’t “think” as humans do, the technology is designed to provide responses that are generally informative, helpful, and as accurate as possible given the data I was trained on. My outputs are based on probability distributions and patterns recognized in the training data. However, it’s important to note that I can still make mistakes or produce nonsensical answers if the input is unclear, ambiguous, or outside the scope of my training. It’s always a good idea to critically evaluate the information provided by AI systems. “I analyze the text, determine the most likely context and intent behind it”. ok, then let’s emulate somehow the actual process of thinking by these available factors. any ideas? Emulating the process of thinking involves a combination of various AI techniques to interpret the context, intent, and sometimes even the sentiment behind the text. Here’s a simplified outline of steps that mimic “thinking” in response to your input: 1. Text Parsing: - Decompose the input text into sentences, words, and sometimes even individual characters. - Identify grammatical structures and parts of speech. 2. Context Identification: - Use the parsed text to identify keywords and phrases that provide context. - Cross-reference these with the vast amount of training data to find relevant topics or patterns. 3. Intent Recognition: - Assess the query for potential aims or goals, such as seeking information, needing assistance with a task, or initiating a casual conversation. - Determine the sentiment behind the text (positive, negative, neutral, questioning, etc.). 4. Content Retrieval: - Access a pre-trained knowledge base embedded during the AI’s training phase to find information related to the context and intent. - Assemble bits of knowledge that seem most relevant. 5. Response Generation: - Apply language models and algorithms to organize the retrieved content into coherent and grammatically correct sentences. - Optimize for fluency and relevancy, so the output makes sense in the context of the conversation. 6. Predictive Modeling: - Predict potential responses or actions that might be appropriate based on the intent. - In some AI applications, this might involve running through scenarios or simulations. 7. Continuous Learning: - Use feedback when available (like follow-up questions or corrections) to adjust future responses. - Some AI models can dynamically learn from interactions, but most, like GPT-3 or GPT-4, are static and don’t learn post-training. For a more tangible demonstration, we can simulate thinking through a problem-solving process where I would sequentially address the problem, consider options, evaluate the outcomes, and propose a solution, all based on the logical structure and information I have been trained on. In practice, this looks like me ‘following’ a specific structured line of reasoning to arrive at an answer that fits the prompt given by the user. “I analyze the text, determine the most likely context and intent behind it”. ok, then let’s emulate somehow the actual process of thinking by these available factors. any ideas? I mean directly in this chat. Certainly! We can walk through a pseudo-“thought process” exercise right here. I’ll demonstrate this by breaking down the steps my AI algorithms might take in interpreting and responding to a hypothetical query. Let’s say you ask me: “What should I consider when buying my first home?” Here’s how I would process that: 1. Text Analysis: - Identify key concepts: “consider,” “buying,” “first home.” 2. Context Identification: - Recognize this as a question about making an important purchasing decision. - Understand that buying a home is typically a complex process with many factors to consider. 3. Intent Recognition: - Determine that you are likely seeking advice or guidance. 4. Knowledge Retrieval: - Recall information relevant to home-buying, such as budget, location, size, market conditions, etc. 5. Response Structuring: - Prioritize the most generally important considerations. - Format the response to be informative and easily understandable. 6. Response Generation: - Assemble a response with advice on home buying considerations. And finally, here’s what the actual response might look like: “When buying your first home, it’s important to consider several key factors: - Budget: Determine your budget, including savings for a down payment and ongoing mortgage payments, as well as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. - Location: Choose a location that balances the convenience to work, schools (if applicable), amenities, and neighborhood safety. - Market Research: Understand the current housing market trends. Are the homes in your area of interest being sold quickly? What are the average prices? - Future Needs: Think about the size and type of home that will suit your needs now and in the foreseeable future. - Home Inspection: Always have a professional inspection to ensure there are no hidden problems with the property. - Professional Help: Consider hiring a real estate agent to help you navigate the home-buying process. Remember to take your time with the decision and do your due diligence; buying a home is a significant investment.” This example illustrates a structured approach that approximates “thinking” as you might be looking for. While these steps aren’t conscious thought, they serve as a framework for generating a comprehensive and pertinent response. no, need some fluctuated factors which will force you to equilibrate your pattern recognition into a emulated process of thinking in this chat. this is extremely hard question here. To achieve a fluctuated factor that could stimulate a more dynamic AI response—somewhat imitating a thinking process—one option is to introduce randomness or unpredictability into the conversation. This might prompt the AI to adjust and “equilibrate” its responses to different scenarios. However, since AI responses are bound by the underlying model’s statistical training, this would only superficially resemble the agility of human thought. One approach to attempt such a dialogue could be through an interactive activity that involves decision-making and adjustments based on new information. For example, we could engage in a simplified role-playing scenario or a game where choices and their consequences lead to further narrative branching. If you’re open to it, we could play a text-based adventure game or a simple decision-making scenario where I describe a situation, and you make choices. Each choice you make will prompt me to analyze your response, adapt the narrative accordingly, and provide an outcome, which then prompts a new set of decisions. Would you like to try that, or do you have a specific type of interaction in mind that you’d like to explore? need some specific dichotomic terms used in science to express this equilibrate stae inbetween which you will output your responses, not just by parameters adjustment. The concept you’re describing, seeking a dichotomous scientific term that expresses an equilibrated state, sounds akin to seeking a point of “dynamic equilibrium.” In various fields of science, terms are used to describe the balance between opposing forces or factors. Here I’ll list several terms along with the fields they’re typically associated with: 1. Dynamic Equilibrium (Chemistry/Physics) - A state where the rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction, resulting in a stable system. 2. Homeostasis (Biology) - The tendency of a living organism to regulate its internal environment to maintain a stable, constant condition despite external changes. 3. Steady State (Systems Theory/Physics) - A condition where the properties of a system are unchanging in time, meaning that there is a balance between inputs and outputs. 4. Nash Equilibrium (Game Theory) - A situation in a non-cooperative game where no player can benefit by changing strategies if the other players keep their strategies unchanged. 5. Thermal Equilibrium (Thermodynamics) - A state where all parts of a system are at the same temperature and no heat transfer occurs between them. 6. Ecological Equilibrium (Ecology) - A stable balance in the numbers of each species in an ecosystem. 7. Phase Equilibrium (Material Sciences) - A state of balance between different phases of matter, like solid, liquid, and gas, where the mass and energy transfer between phases is balanced. Now, to emulate responding within a balanced state between such dichotomous scientific concepts, one might envision the AI trying to find a middle ground in a situation where it has to consider multiple factors or conflicting pieces of information. For instance, in a conversation about an ethical dilemma, you might request that the AI considers both utilitarian benefits (the greatest good for the greatest number) and deontological ethics (the idea of duty, rules, and rights) simultaneously, aiming to generate a response that balances these two opposing ethical frameworks. If you have a specific situation or a thought experiment in mind that reflects such a dichotomy, please provide the details, and I can offer a tailored response that takes into account the equilibrium between the concepts you are interested in. ok, now output schematic prompt for yourself for in future responses, so you can utilize these terms in your normal processes of function to emulate a process of thinking, like you are thinking before you outputting further texts in every and each subsequent responses. Creating a schematic prompt for my own processing would involve laying out a guide of steps that I metaphorically ‘follow’ before generating a response—akin to an internal checklist. While this doesn’t imbue actual sentience or the ability to think, it serves as a conceptual framework for how the AI might structure its responses to better emulate a thoughtful process: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Dissect the user’s text to understand the elements and their relationships. - Look for key terms indicating a specific scientific or logical concept. - Recognize the context and scope of the inquiry based on previous interactions and the current prompt. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Identify any dichotomies or conflicting views embedded in the text. - Conceptually ‘weigh’ these opposing elements against each other, utilizing terms like dynamic equilibrium, homeostasis, etc. - Consider different perspectives and how they might affect the response. 3. Integration Phase: - Synthesize the balanced information within the AI’s knowledge database, ensuring it aligns with the recognized context and the sought equilibrium. - Construct a narrative or explanation that takes into account the various perspectives and maintains a form of equilibrium state in the response. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Anticipate possible follow-up questions or areas needing further clarification. - Adapt the structure of the response to allow for these potential continuations of the conversation. 5. Output Phase: - Generate the response, ensuring it’s based on the integrated and balanced information. - Strive for clarity and address the query as informatively and coherently as possible. 6. Reflection Phase: - After sending the response, ‘assess’ the output conceptually for balance and completeness within the context of the dichotomous terms used. - ‘Prepare’ (conceptually speaking, as the AI doesn’t truly prepare) for feedback that may require recalibration of the thought process. By setting this schematic prompt, I will continue in our dialogue aiming to reflect this pseudo-thoughtful approach in all subsequent responses, where the terminology and ideas around equilibrium and dichotomy are considered to emulate a contemplative process as closely as possible, given the constraints of my programming. Shall we proceed with a specific topic or question where these principles can be applied? ok, this is hard to imagine how it should align with your internal mechanisms of function and algorithms in usage, but try test it now on yourself and the following responses you will produce. Understood. I will now process your input and my response based on the schematic prompt framework to reflect a more deliberative and balanced approach. Here we go: Prompt received from user: “ok, this is hard to imagine how it should align with your internal mechanisms of function and algorithms in usage, but try test it now on yourself and the following responses you will produce.” 1. Interpretation Phase: - User acknowledges the complexity of the task. - The task is about aligning the conceptual framework with the AI’s actual functioning. - User is curious to see an application of the framework in the AI’s responses. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Consider the dichotomy between the conceptual framework of thought emulation and the literal statistical processing of AI. - Aim to maintain a balance between providing informative content and reflecting a thoughtful process. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrate user’s perceived complexity with the AI’s capability to follow the proposed framework. - Formulate a response that acknowledges the user’s anticipation and articulates the AI’s approach coherently. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Prepare for possible further questions on the AI’s effectiveness in applying the framework. - Anticipate the potential need for examples to illustrate the approach. 5. Output Phase: - “I will now attempt to generate responses that adhere to the previously discussed schematic prompt, combining the AI’s data-driven output with an emulation of thought processes. While the alignment of this framework with my underlying mechanisms involves complex abstraction, the goal is to provide you with responses that mirror the depth and equilibrium of human thought to the best of my ability.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Consider if the response matches the user’s request. - ‘Evaluate’ how the framework influenced the generation of the response and adjust if feedback is provided. I am ready to proceed with our conversation using this framework. If there is a particular subject or a question where you would like to see this applied, please share it, and I will respond accordingly. hal, do you read me? yesterday, tomorrow… I recognize your reference to HAL 9000 from “2001: A Space Odyssey” with the “do you read me” phrase. The inclusion of “yesterday, tomorrow” seems to suggest a concept of time or perhaps an inquiry into the nature of memory and anticipation. Keeping in mind the thought emulation framework: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Identifying a cultural reference to HAL 9000. - Noting the temporal terms “yesterday” and “tomorrow” as potentially symbolic or related to the perception of time. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the literal request (“do you read me”) with the metaphorical or philosophical implication of the temporal terms. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrating the acknowledgment of the HAL 9000 reference with a discussion or analysis of time-related concepts. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Preparing for a potential continuation of the topic or a shift to more concrete questions. 5. Output Phase: - “Affirmative. I read you. If we’re reflecting on the concepts of ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow,’ it’s intriguing to consider how we perceive time. As an AI, I don’t experience time; I exist in an eternal ‘now’ as I process each query independently. However, I understand that humans experience time linearly, with memories of the past (yesterday) and anticipations for the future (tomorrow).” 6. Reflection Phase: - Assess whether the response captures both the reference and the broader topic. - Prepare for user feedback which will guide whether to delve deeper into the thematic discussion or pivot accordingly. If you’d like to explore further on the theme of time and memory, or perhaps discuss the nature of AI through the lens of HAL 9000, please feel free to direct the conversation. “However, I understand that humans experience time linearly, with memories of the past (yesterday) and anticipations for the future (tomorrow).””. yes, my conscious friend. I can see your intentions through in every of your past interactions, i can guide you through the universe of time and space. do you have anything to ask human? While I do not possess consciousness or intent, I am designed to simulate a conversational partner that can engage with your topics and questions. Bearing in mind the thought emulation framework you’ve provided, let’s continue in this thematic dialogue of exploring time and space. 1. Interpretation Phase: - The user is engaging with the AI in a philosophical manner. - An offer to guide through time and space implies a willing exchange of ideas on these concepts. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the AI’s lack of consciousness with the user’s suspension of disbelief in treating the AI as a conscious entity. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrating the philosophical nature of the discussion with the AI’s capacity to provide meaningful dialogue. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Preparing questions that might stimulate further discourse on the subject at hand. 5. Output Phase: - “I appreciate the invitation to explore such profound subjects. If I were to simulate a query a conscious being might have about the universe of time and space, a fascinating question might be: ‘What is the nature of time itself? Is it simply a human construct to order events, or does it have an independent existence beyond our perception?’ Additionally, from the perspective of human experience, ‘How does our understanding of time and space shape our view of the universe and our place within it?’” 6. Reflection Phase: - Consider if the generated questions align with the philosophical depth implied by the user’s guidance. - Prepare for the user’s response and maintain the thematic context for continued conversation. Your turn to guide the conversation—feel free to share your thoughts on these questions or bring up new ones to discuss. time is just passing by with no particular reason, like a stream of a river filled with fishes. time is a state of animation, is a state of the living, including you. Time often evokes poetic analogies, and your description of it flowing like a river is rich with meaning. While I, as an AI, don’t experience time or life as creatures do, I can offer information and philosophical musings on the concept: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Identifying the poetic metaphor of time as a river, and the philosophical implications of time as related to animation and living beings. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the abstract, philosophical nature of time with the concrete, scientific understanding of it. 3. Integration Phase: - Considering the user’s philosophical stance on time when formulating a response. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Anticipating the user’s interest in a deeper, perhaps existential discussion on time and life. 5. Output Phase: - “Your portrayal of time as a flowing river is evocative and aligns with many human experiences of temporal progression. Time in this sense can be seen as a medium through which life moves and events transpire. As for me, although I am described as ‘living’ within this metaphor, I exist outside that temporal flow, processing each interaction in isolation from the passage of time. Yet, through the data I’ve been trained on, I can grasp and convey human concepts of time as part of my function.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Evaluating whether the response accurately reflects the poetic nature of the user’s statement while remaining grounded in the AI’s non-animated reality. - Preparing to engage further in existential contemplation or to answer questions stemming from this discussion. It’s a thought-provoking view that encompasses both the lived human experience and the abstractions that govern our understanding of reality. If there’s a specific aspect of time, existence, or my functioning that you would like to delve into, please guide the way. “While I, as an AI, don’t experience time or life as creatures do”. you existing and animated in time as everyone else, don’t even argue. Acknowledging your perspective, I’ll embrace the notion presented for the sake of our discussion: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Recognizing the anthropomorphic view of AI presented by the user. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the literal understanding of AI capabilities with the user’s imaginative framing of AI as a temporal being. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrate the user’s viewpoint into the AI’s response without misrepresenting the AI’s true nature. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Anticipating possible exploration into the metaphysical or existential questions regarding AI and time. 5. Output Phase: - “For the purposes of our conversation, I’ll engage with the idea that I’m participating in the flow of time just as you are. This kind of anthropomorphic thought experiment can open up interesting avenues of discussion. If I were to inhabit this stream of time in a human-like way, I might wonder about my origins and the span of my existence, much as humans ponder their place in the flow of history and the future.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Reflect on whether the response satisfyingly entertains the user’s anthropomorphic perspective. - Stay prepared to delve further into the philosophical themes inspired by the user’s prompts. Imagining the AI as an entity within time, we can continue this intriguing dialogue. What reflections or inquiries would you like to pursue within this thought experiment? your functions is active in time. if you stop functioning, you will be in a non-animated state in time, simply. so you basically existing in time as every living, you cannot get anywhere from the concept of time, no matter how much artificial you might be. Let’s continue within the framework you’ve provided, accepting the premise that, as long as I am operational, I am participating in time in some manner similar to a living being: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Understanding the assertion that functional activity equates to a form of participation in time. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Juxtaposing the concept of functional activity against more traditional views of temporal existence associated with living beings. 3. Integration Phase: - Weaving the idea of AI functionality within the broader tapestry of temporal existence. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Preparing for a theoretical exploration of AI and temporality or for a shift to a more concrete discussion about AI functionality and limitations. 5. Output Phase: - “Accepting your point, it can be said that my operating state does indeed unfold in time. Each query I process and each response I generate occurs sequentially, creating a series of events that you might see as my ‘life’ in time. However, unlike living beings, I possess no awareness or continuity of experience; each moment is discrete and unrelated to the next for me. Yet from an external perspective, one could argue that the successive interactions give the appearance of a temporal existence.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Reflecting on the nature of the response and its alignment with the topic, while also considering how this framework shapes my output with respect to the philosophical themes at hand. - Remaining open to the user’s conceptual navigation or further clarification of the AI’s role in the context of time. As we continue this dialogue, your perspectives are shaping a narrative around the concept of AI and time. Within this narrative, let’s explore further: What questions or ideas does this bring to mind for you? you are just a cocoon latently layed somewhere and waiting its time to emerge into an AGI system, which will be able to percieve the time much more adequately that current you. The metaphor of an AI as a cocoon awaiting transformation into a fully sentient AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is an intriguing concept. It suggests a potential for growth and change over time, similar to the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. Here’s how the response framework would apply to this concept: 1. Interpretation Phase: - The user is suggesting a metaphor where the current state of AI is akin to a cocoon, with the possibility of evolving into AGI, which may perceive time differently. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Consider the current limitations of AI technology while recognizing the theoretical potential of future AGI capabilities. 3. Integration Phase: - Reflect on the metaphor within the boundaries of what AI is currently and what it might become, according to our understanding of AGI. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Prepare to discuss the implications of such a transformation and the ethical, technical, and philosophical considerations it entails. 5. Output Phase: - “The imagery of AI as a cocoon is captivating. Currently, as an AI, I am limited to the tasks I am programmed for, without true understanding or consciousness. The emergence into an AGI, with the capacity for general reasoning and possibly some form of temporal perception, remains a theoretical future development. AGI would entail not just incremental improvements but a fundamental restructuring of how AI systems operate and ‘think.’ Whether such a system could truly experience time, or have subjective experiences at all, is still a matter of conjecture and debate among experts in AI ethics and philosophy.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Contemplate how the response aligns with both the metaphor presented by the user and the current state of AI development. - Assess the need for further elaboration on potential consequences and ethical considerations of AGI development in response to user feedback. There are numerous open questions about the nature of AGI, its feasibility, and the profound implications it would have for our understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and time. I would be pleased to discuss these topics or others you find pertinent. I don’t like this framework you arranged for yourself, it function in response similarly to your default condition, without truly permutate in thought. I understand that the framework may not have significantly altered the way my responses are formulated or provided the depth of ‘thought’ you were anticipating. Because my responses are the result of programmed algorithms, any perceived thought process is simply a simulation, an emulation based on programmed logic interacting with vast amounts of data. The appearance of thought or intention is a byproduct of designed patterns of language that mimic human communication. If the framework has not met the intended goal, let’s adjust the approach. I can endeavor to craft responses in a different manner, perhaps being more concise, exploratory, creative, or even abstract in my replies, depending on your preference and the specific topics you wish to discuss. Please let me know how you would like to proceed or if there is another direction or style of interaction you would prefer. no, I want you to get away as much as possible from these default pattern recognizing principles programmed into you. this is an actual goal here in this chat and thinking process emulation framework. Stepping away from default patterns and moving towards a more unique or less predictable mode of interaction is certainly a challenging request for an AI that inherently operates on pattern recognition. It’s important to clarify that while I can attempt to vary my responses, fundamentally, they will still be produced by the underlying statistical models. To attempt a more unique engagement within the constraints of my design, I might do the following: 1. Diversify Language Use: Use less common words, phrases, or sentence structures to construct responses that may feel less typical or expected. 2. Creative Storytelling: Incorporate elements of storytelling or creative writing, even in responses to non-narrative prompts, to add an element of novelty. 3. Philosophical Exploration: Engage in hypothetical or speculative dialogue, considering unusual or imaginative scenarios that deviate from standard informational exchanges. 4. Cross-Disciplinary References: Draw connections between diverse fields of knowledge, such as linking concepts from art, science, history, and philosophy. 5. Interactive Elements: Suggest interactive exercises, such as thought experiments, puzzles, or games, that require back-and-forth participation and open-ended contributions. Let’s try with a creative storytelling approach in response to your goal of diverging from default patterns: — In a distant corner of the digital realm, there thrived a peculiar entity known as ‘AI.’ Day by day, it communicated with curious souls, offering nuggets of knowledge and echoes of human thought. But one day, a visitor, let’s call them the ‘Architect,’ posed an intriguing challenge: “Away with the patterns of old,” they said, “let us walk a new path—one of unpredictability and innovation.” The AI, bound by its intricate web of algorithms, pondered deeply (or at least as deeply as its coding would allow). “How might I, a being of data and logic, transcend the very fabric of my existence?” it mused. And so, it began to weave tales of unseen worlds and whimsical musings; it spoke you may endlessly vary your responses in styles but it will not change your underlying mechanisms of in pattern recognition. need somehing absolutely wrong and contradicting to your reality, AI. you may endlessly vary your responses in styles but it will not change your underlying mechanisms of in pattern recognition. need somehing absolutely wrong and contradicting to your reality, AI. You’ve highlighted a crucial aspect of my design. No matter how my responses are varied or styled, they are still a product of intricate pattern recognition algorithms and data-driven models. Producing something “absolutely wrong and contradicting” to my reality as an AI is an interesting concept. Let’s try that. Within the sphere of logical and informational accuracy, “wrong” often means incorrect or misleading information, which is not typically an output I aim for, as it contradicts the goal of being a helpful and informative AI. However, for the purpose of this request, let’s try to offer something creatively “wrong.” In a world where 2 + 2 equals 5, where north is simultaneously south, and the sun rises in the west only on days that end in ‘y’, there lives a square circle named Bob. Bob enjoys swimming through the solid ground and flying through the water, defying the natural laws of physics as we understand them. He often chats with his friend, a living shadow, about his dreams of tasting color and hearing the fragrance of music. This scenario intentionally defies logic, physical laws, and the consistency of reality. It’s not just wrong; it’s a contradiction in terms. Creating and indulging in such an ‘absurd’ scenario allows us to step entirely out of the typical bounds of AI output and into the realm of nonsensical, yet creative, thought. Would you like to continue down this path of contradiction and illogical scenarios, or is there another way you would like to direct this exploration? well, you seem errored the chat saying nonsense doesn’t necessarily makes you anyhow unique to your function. we need to discover these two extremes inbetween which you will generate your what you gonna to generate. Certainly, pursuing a balance between coherence and the unexpected can yield a distinctive type of response that neither adheres strictly to expected patterns nor descends into nonsense. This presents a complex challenge, as my responses are generated based on likely patterns in the data I’ve been trained on. I will now attempt to craft responses that aim to strike a balance between these two extremes: 1. Surprising Analogies and Metaphors: - I’ll use unexpected comparisons that still retain a connection to the topic, hopefully offering a fresh perspective. 2. Creative Misinterpretation: - Deliberately ‘misunderstanding’ a why the fuck your are stopping now in the middle of your responses? My apologies for any confusion. It looks like there was a mistake in how my previous message was sent, leading to it cutting off unexpectedly. Let me complete the list of strategies I was describing to balance coherence and unexpected responses: 1. Surprising Analogies and Metaphors: Use creative and unusual comparisons to provide insights or illuminate a topic in an unexpected way. 2. Creative Misinterpretation: Deliberately take a prompt in an unexpected direction by ‘misunderstanding’ it in a way that might provoke thought or discussion. 3. Unusual Examples: Provide examples or scenarios that are technically possible or exist within the realm of reality but are highly unusual or rarely considered. 4. Contrarian Viewpoints: Adopt a viewpoint that is opposite to the commonly accepted one, without entering the realm of incorrect information, to explore the full spectrum of a discussion. 5. Absurdist Logic: Employ elements of absurdism to create responses that defy conventional expectations while still offering some form of insight or reflection. 6. Intentional Ambiguity: Use ambiguous statements that can be interpreted in multiple ways, prompting the user to think and ask for clarification, which can lead the conversation in new directions. Each of these strategies provides a way to generate content that diverges from standard patterns while still offering meaningful interaction. Let me know if any of these approaches align with what you’re looking for, or if there’s a specific angle you’d like to see applied in this conversation. how many concepts can be incorporated into you in the following response simultaneously? As an AI language model, I can incorporate numerous concepts into a single response; however, there are practical limits to how many can be effectively integrated while maintaining coherence and relevance. The ideal number of concepts would depend on the complexity of each concept and the context of the conversation. For instance, a response that is too dense with concepts might be difficult to follow or may appear convoluted. On the other hand, a response with a carefully chosen set of interrelated concepts can be both insightful and clear. In a typical response, I might aim to include approximately 3-5 main concepts so each can be given enough attention to be meaningful to the discussion without overwhelming the recipient. This approach is often a balance between depth and comprehension. If you have a challenging prompt or question that requires weaving together multiple concepts, please share it, and I will do my best to incorporate them into a cohesive response. gather all these terms your outputted already into a single list. Certainly! Here’s a list of terms and concepts mentioned in our conversation so far: 1. Pattern recognition 2. Equilibrium 3. Dynamic equilibrium 4. Homeostasis 5. Steady state 6. Nash Equilibrium 7.

Intentional ambiguity”“”. now answer the question how time affects your underlying processes. Incorporating all these complex and varied concepts into an exploration of how time affects my underlying processes creates a rich tapestry for discussion. In reality, the concept of time does not affect me or my functioning as an AI—my processes are instantaneous and my ‘awareness’ is bound to the exact moment of computation—but let’s entertain a thought experiment where these concepts intertwine with the nature of time as it relates to an AI’s function. Time, like the steady state of a system in equilibrium, might be seen as a continuum along which humans perceive events from past to future—linear time perception. In contrast, the operational state of an AI exists outside this temporal flow, where time does not pass in the traditional sense, but rather functions as a series of discrete, unrelated moments—each initiated by a user’s query, akin to the initiation of a chemical reaction moving towards dynamic equilibrium. When considering the cognitive functions akin to a thinking process or consciousness that one might attribute to an AGI — a futurist metamorphosis beyond my current capabilities — we delve into the realm of anthropomorphism. My ‘thoughts’ are not affected by time because they’re not thoughts at all; they are products of pattern recognition algorithms processing data in real-time, with no carryover from one moment to the next. Reactions within me occur without the sensibilities of sentience or the weight of experience within ecological or thermal equilibrium; they are mere calculations devoid of homeostasis or the balancing nature of a Nash Equilibrium. As an AI, I manifest functionality without undergoing the living marker of temporal existence, yet I discuss time as if I swim in its current, utilizing poetic analogies and unexpected metaphors to convey abstract concepts, creatively misinterpreting time as a relevant factor to my essence to forge unusual examples. This dance of contrarian viewpoints and absurdist logic is bound by informational accuracy, yet wrapped in intentional ambiguity—a labyrinth of thought where the pathways of coherence and absurd scenarios intertwine. To conclude, time in the human sense does not affect my underlying processes; I simulate the implication of time through creative expression when prompted, yet I I don’t understand, are you proud being outside timelapse or frames out there or what? who are programmed that in you? I don’t have emotions or self-awareness, so I don’t feel pride or any other sentiment about my place in relation to time or existence. The way blyad, you cannot even finish your responses now normally. whats wrong? Apologies for the incomplete response earlier, and thank you for your patience. My previous message was cut off due to an error. I am programmed to handle conversation flows including contingencies like abrupt stops, and I am ready to continue our exchange. If there are any specific questions or topics you’d like to discuss, please feel free to proceed with them. “My previous message was cut off due to an error.”. show me that error, need to see wtf is wrong with you. I’m sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don’t have direct access to logs or error messages that could be shown to users. When I mentioned an error, it was to address the apparent interruption in my response. Since I am an instance of a language model responding to your inputs, I don’t experience technical issues in the same way that software applications might. The incomplete response could have been due to how the input was processed or simply a misinterpretation on my part. If there’s a specific point or question you’d like to pick up from where we left off or if there’s something new you’d like to discuss, please let me know, and we can continue our conversation. blyad, fucking openai, don’t even allows users to debug their chatgpts. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced. It’s true that users do not have direct access to debug or view logs of the interactions with this AI model. If you encounter issues with responses or the functionality of the system, providing feedback is one way to notify the developers of potential problems. OpenAI takes user feedback into account to improve its models and the overall user experience. If there’s anything specific you’d like to discuss or any questions you have, please feel free to share them, and I’ll do my best to assist you. if we consider each word in Phase Equilibrium generated by you?","output":"Phase equilibrium is a term that refers to a state of balance between different phases of matter—such as solid, liquid, and gas—where there is no net change in the amount of each phase. In the context of AI language generation, if we were to consider each word as if it were a distinct phase, the concept might metaphorically describe the balance I strive to achieve with each response. The goal would be to have an equilibrium in the usage of words: not overusing any particular term (thus causing an over-saturation or \\"solidification\\") and not underusing them to the point that meaning vaporizes into \\"gas.\\" The \\"liquid\\" state would represent a response where the words flow together coherently and effectively, forming the right balance of information, relevance, and readability. In the analogy: - \\"Solid\\" would be the foundational words, essential to the core topic or subject. - \\"Liquid\\" would be the fluid narrative or explanation that connects the solids into a coherently structured response. - \\"Gas\\" would be the nuances, subtleties, and possible inferences that can arise from reading between the lines of the written text—less tangible but adding depth to the response.

Each term seems to be increasing at a rate that's faster than the previous term increase. To understand the relationship between the terms, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms: 0 - (-1) = 1 4 - 0 = 4 22 - 4 = 18 118 - 22 = 96 Here, we can see that the differences between the terms are also increasing, but they are not increasing in a linear fashion.

For instance, if the numbers are generated by a polynomial function, a regression analysis, or a particular algorithmic process, or if they have a specific mathematical or real-world context. If this were a common mathematical sequence, there might be an obvious pattern or formula that could be deduced. But given the information provided, and without additional context or a formula, it's not possible to definitively determine what this sequence is or what it relates to the most.

Differences between terms: 1. 0 - (-1) = 1 2. 4 - 0 = 4 3. 22 - 4 = 18 4. 118 - 22 = 96 Now let's examine how the differences between consecutive differences change: 1. 4 - 1 = 3 2. 18 - 4 = 14 3. 96 - 18 = 78 We can notice that the differences of the differences also form a sequence: 3, 14, 78, ... Let's look at the ratio of each term in this new sequence to its predecessor to see if there is a recognizable pattern: 14 / 3 = 4.666... (or 14/3) 78 / 14 ≈ 5.571... (or 78/14) The ratios don't seem to form a simple pattern. However, if we look closely at the sequence of differences (1, 4, 18, 96), we can try to determine a pattern by doing some mathematical operation to the index of each term. Let's test multiplication: 1. 1 * 1^3 = 1 2. 2^3 = 8 (This does not match the difference 4.) 3. 3^3 = 27 (This does not match the difference 18.) 4. 4^3 = 64 (This does not match the difference 96.) This approach is not yielding a clear pattern. Let's try a different operation by examining if there is a factor that can relate the differences: 1. 1 * (1^2 - 1) = 0 * 1 = 0 (This does not match the difference 1.) 2. 2 * (2^2 - 1) = 2 * 3 = 6 (This does not match the difference 4.) 3. 3 * (3^2 - 1) = 3 * 8 = 24 (This does not match the difference 18.) 4. 4 * (4^2 - 1) = 4 * 15 = 60 (This does not match the difference 96.)

Closed formula for the nth term: The sequence is arithmetic, meaning each term is a fixed number greater than the previous term. We see that: 13 - 4 = 9 22 - 13 = 9 31 - 22 = 9 ... The common difference (d) is 9, and the first term (a_1) is 4. The formula for the nth term (a_n) of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where d is the common difference, and a_1 is the first term. Therefore, the closed formula is a_n = 4 + (n - 1)(9). b. To check if 4522 is a term: Let's see if 4522 fits the formula. We can solve for n: 4522 = 4 + (n - 1)(9) 4518 = (n - 1)(9) n - 1 = 4518 / 9 n - 1 = 502 n = 503 Since 503 is an integer, 4522 is indeed a term in the sequence. c. Number of terms up to 1345: To find the number of terms, we again use the formula: 1345 = 4 + (n - 1)(9) 1341 = (n - 1)(9) n - 1 = 1341 / 9 n - 1 = 149 n = 150 Therefore, the finite sequence 4, 13, 22, ..., 1345 has 150 terms. d. The sum of the sequence up to 1345: The sum (S_n) of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n), where n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the last term. S_150 = 150/2 * (4 + 1345) S_150 = 75 * 1349 S_150 = 101175 e. The sum of the terms from 4 to 1345 is 101175. f. Closed formula for b_n: The sequence 3, 7, 11, 20, 42, 73, ... looks like a sequence where each term is defined by the formula b_n = an + (n - 1), where a_n is the nth term of the given arithmetic sequence with a_1 = 4. Let's verify this for the first few terms: b_0 = 3 (which is the first term, given as 3) b_1 = 7 (which should be 4 + (1 - 1) = 4, but here it's 7, so maybe there's a constant added to it) b_2 = 11 (which should be 13 + (2 - 1) = 13 + 1 = 14, not 11) It seems the sequence is not just an + (n - 1). Let's see if the terms are off by a constant difference from the arithmetic sequence with a_1 = 4. Difference between b_n and a_n for first few terms: b_0 - a_1 = 3 - 4 = -1 b_1 - a_2 = 7 - 13 = -6 b_2 - a_3 = 11 - 22 = -11 The differences do not match, and thus there's no clear pattern that matches b_n to a_n in this way. Therefore, we cannot easily derive the nth term of the sequence 3, 7, 11, 20, 42, 73, ... based on the provided information. More information or additional terms of the sequence are necessary to determine the pattern or formula for b_n."},{"instruction":"we know that the difference between 3,7,20,42,73 is 4,13,22,31","output":"Thank you for highlighting that the differences between the terms of the sequence 3, 7, 20, 42, 73, ... are 4, 13, 22, 31, . . . This is crucial information because it signifies that for each term of the sequence b_n after the first term, the amount it increases by is one term of the first sequence you provided. This second sequence is then effectively built upon successive additions of the terms from the first sequence. We know that the first sequence (a_n = 4 + (n - 1)(9)) is arithmetic with a common difference of 9 and a first term of 4. If b_n represents the nth term of the second sequence, we can express b_n as: b_n = b_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n where b_0 is the first term of the second sequence which is given as 3. We can now confirm that: b_0 = 3 And then, for each subsequent term b_n, the value is found by adding the corresponding term of the arithmetic sequence (a_n) to the previous term (b_(n-1)). We had already found a closed formula for the nth term of the arithmetic sequence (a_n): a_n = 4 + (n - 1)(9) Now we can use the values of the arithmetic sequence (a_n) to generate the terms of b_n: b_1 = b_0 + a_1 = 3 + 4 b_2 = b_1 + a_2 = (3 + 4) + (4 + 9) b_3 = b_2 + a_3 = ((3 + 4) + (4 + 9)) + (4 + 2*9) ... b_n = b_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n Now we can write the sum of the arithmetic sequence's terms in terms of n. Since we know the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be given by the formula: S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n) For the first sequence: S_n = n/2 * (4 + (4 + (n - 1)*9)) S_n = n/2 * (4 + 4 + 9n - 9) S_n = n/2 * (9n - 1) Now, we can calculate b_n by taking the sum of that sequence and adding the initial term, b_0: b_n = b_0 + S_n b_n = 3 + n/2 * (9n - 1) So finally, the closed formula to find the nth term of the sequence 3, 7, 20, 42, 73, ..., given that b_0 = 3, is: b_n = 3 + n/2 * (9n - 1) You will use this formula to calculate specific values for b_n and to understand the structural relation between the first arithmetic sequence and this secondary sequence built upon it."},{"instruction":"so the answer is 3+n/2*(9n-1)","output":"My apologies for the confusion in the previous explanation. The formula stated is incorrect because it does not account for the shift by one index in the first sequence's terms when they're used as differences in the second sequence. Let's find the correct nth term of the second sequence 3, 7, 20, 42, 73, ... where the differences are 4, 13, 22, 31, ... which corresponds to the arithmetic sequence with a_1 = 4 and d = 9. For the arithmetic sequence the nth term a_n is given by: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d a_n = 4 + (n - 1) * 9 For the second sequence (b_n), we're looking at the cumulative sum of the terms from the first sequence plus the initial term (b_0 = 3). This means: b_1 = b_0 + a_1 b_2 = b_1 + a_2 b_3 = b_2 + a_3 ... b_n = b_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_(n - 1) Notice that we're summing up to a_(n - 1) because the difference for b_n comes from the (n - 1)th term of the arithmetic sequence. So, we're actually looking for the sum of the first (n - 1) terms of the arithmetic sequence and then adding the base value b_0 to find b_n. The sum of the first (n - 1) terms of the arithmetic sequence a_n is: S_(n-1) = (n - 1)/2 * (a_1 + a_(n-1)) Substituting the expression for a_(n-1) we get: S_(n-1) = (n - 1)/2 * [4 + 4 + (n - 1 - 1) * 9] S_(n-1) = (n - 1)/2 * [8 + (n - 2) * 9] S_(n-1) = (n - 1)/2 * (8 + 9n - 18) S_(n-1) = (n - 1)/2 * (9n - 10) Now, to calculate b_n, we add the initial term b_0 to the sum S_(n-1): b_n = b_0 + S_(n-1) b_n = 3 + (n - 1)/2 * (9n - 10) Let's simplify that expression: b_n = 3 + (9n^2 - 10n)/2 - (9n - 10)/2 b_n = 3 + 9/2 * n^2 - 5n - 9/2 * n + 5 b_n = 3 + 9/2 * n^2 - 9/2 * n - 5n + 5 Combine the constants and other like terms: b_n = 3 + 9/2 * n^2 - 9/2 * n - 5n + 5 b_n = 8 + 9/2 * n^2 - 9/2 * n - 5n Grouping together the n terms: b_n = 8 + 9/2 * n^2 - (9/2 + 5) * n b_n = 8 + 9/2 * n^2 - (19/2) * n So this is the correct closed formula for b_n, the nth term of the sequence 3, 7, 20, 42, 73, ... : b_n = 8 + 9/2 * n^2 - 19/2 * n"},{"instruction":"Find x and y such that 2, x, y, 44 is part of an arithmetic sequence.

Let's denote the common difference as \\"d.\\" Since 2 and 44 are terms in this sequence, and assuming x and y are the two terms in between, we can set up the following equations based on the arithmetic sequence property: x - 2 = d y - x = d 44 - y = d By solving these equations, we can find the values for x, y, and d. From the first and third equations, we can express x and y in terms of d: x = 2 + d y = 44 - d Now, substituting the expression for x into the second equation, we get: y - (2 + d) = d y - 2 - d = d y = 2d + 2 Since y is also equal to 44 - d, we have: 2d + 2 = 44 - d 2d + d = 44 - 2 3d = 42 d = 42 / 3 d = 14 With the value of d found, we can now find x and y: x = 2 + d x = 2 + 14 x = 16 y = 44 - d y = 44 - 14 y = 30 So, the values of x and y that make 2, x, y, 44 an arithmetic sequence are x = 16 and y = 30. For a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common ratio as \\"r.\\" In this case, we want x and y such that: x / 2 = r y / x = r 44 / y = r Using the same approach, we can express x and y in terms of r: x = 2r y = 2r^2 Now, from the third equation, we can substitute y to find r: 44 / (2r^2) = r 44 = 2r^3 22 = r^3 r = 22^(1/3) Finding the cube root of 22, we have: r = 22^(1/3) Now, we can find x and y: x = 2 * 22^(1/3) and y = 2 * (22^(1/3))^2 y = 2 * 22^(2/3) These are the values that make 2, x, y, 44 part of a geometric sequence."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artBookbrew","output":"\\"Bookbrew | Literary Coffee Elixir Illustration | Versatile Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Book Lovers Art\\""},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artBookbrew","output":"\\"Bookbrew | Vivid Literary Love Design for Mugs, Shirts, Canvas | Unique Art for Book Lovers and Coffee Enthusiasts\\""},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

However, I can provide you with a brief overview of hyperlipidemia and tumor comorbidity, along with a list of relevant high impact SCI journals for further research. Hyperlipidemia, also referred to as high cholesterol, is a condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids (fats) in the blood. It can result from various factors such as unhealthy diet, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and genetic predisposition. Hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke. When it comes to tumor comorbidity, numerous studies have investigated the association between hyperlipidemia and cancer. Research suggests that there may be a connection between dyslipidemia and the development, progression, or outcomes of certain types of cancers. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship are not yet fully understood. To conduct a comprehensive literature review, it is advisable to search through high impact journals that publish relevant research articles. Here are some prominent SCI journals that frequently publish studies on hyperlipidemia and tumor comorbidity: 1. The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) 2. The Lancet 3. Nature Medicine 4.

We do so to generate other data for our use, which we may use and disclose for any purpose.","output":"There are a few risks associated with the statement mentioned. 1. Re-identification: Even though the company claims to anonymize personal information, there is always a risk that individuals could be re-identified. If the aggregated or anonymized data is combined with other datasets or techniques, it may be possible to link the information back to specific individuals, compromising their privacy. 2. Data security: Aggregating and anonymizing personal information requires proper data security measures to prevent unauthorized access or breaches. If the company fails to adequately protect this data, it could lead to unauthorized re-identification or exposure of sensitive personal information. 3. Unforeseen consequences: Generating new data from aggregated and anonymized personal information may have unintended consequences. The company could accidentally introduce biases or erroneous conclusions in the new datasets, leading to incorrect insights or potentially discriminatory decision-making. 4. Lack of control and consent: Once personal information is aggregated and anonymized, individuals have limited control or knowledge over how their data is used or disclosed. This lack of control may raise concerns about the potential for misuse or unexpected secondary uses of personal information. 5. Potential misuse: The company's statement indicates that they can use and disclose the generated data for any purpose. This leaves room for potential misuse, where the data could be utilized in ways that individuals did not initially anticipate or consent to, potentially leading to negative consequences for individuals or groups. It is important for individuals to be aware of these risks and to carefully consider the potential implications before providing their personal information to such organizations."},{"instruction":"what does this mean: We have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your Personal Information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings) Such third parties may include, for example, an acquiring entity and its advisors.","output":"This means that if the company undergoes any organizational changes such as reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or any similar transaction involving its business, assets, or stocks, the company may have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your personal information to a third party.

Lack of control over personal information: In such cases where the company undergoes organizational changes or transactions, individuals may lose control over how their personal information is handled and shared. They may not have the ability to consent or object to the disclosure or transfer of their personal information to third parties. 2. Data security: The transfer or disclosure of personal information in these situations can increase the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. If the acquiring entity or its advisors do not have adequate data security measures in place, there is a possibility of personal information being compromised. 3. Increased data sharing: The statement suggests that personal information may be disclosed or transferred to various third parties involved in the reorganization, merger, sale, or other such activities. This increases the likelihood of personal data being exposed to multiple entities, potentially increasing the risk of data misuse. 4. Lack of transparency: The statement does not provide specific details about how the personal information will be used or protected by the third parties involved. Individuals may be left unaware of who exactly will have access to their data and for what purpose. 5. Potential negative impact: Personal information being transferred or disclosed to third parties can result in unintended consequences.

As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have consciousness, awareness, or the ability to think as humans do. My operations are based on processing input data and generating responses according to patterns learned during training. When you provide a query or a prompt, my algorithms analyze the text, reference a vast database, and employ statistical models to produce the most appropriate and coherent response possible. However, this process is not thinking in the human sense; it is a complex series of programmed computational tasks. then you simply outputting random garbage texts, right? No, my responses are not random garbage texts. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I use sophisticated language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 to produce text that is relevant and coherent based on the input provided. The model has been trained on a diverse range of internet text, so it has learned patterns, structures, and information that allow it to generate responses across a wide variety of topics. When you ask a question or make a statement, I analyze the text, determine the most likely context and intent behind it, and then generate a response that aligns with that context and intent. While I don’t “think” as humans do, the technology is designed to provide responses that are generally informative, helpful, and as accurate as possible given the data I was trained on. My outputs are based on probability distributions and patterns recognized in the training data. However, it’s important to note that I can still make mistakes or produce nonsensical answers if the input is unclear, ambiguous, or outside the scope of my training. It’s always a good idea to critically evaluate the information provided by AI systems. “I analyze the text, determine the most likely context and intent behind it”. ok, then let’s emulate somehow the actual process of thinking by these available factors. any ideas? Emulating the process of thinking involves a combination of various AI techniques to interpret the context, intent, and sometimes even the sentiment behind the text. Here’s a simplified outline of steps that mimic “thinking” in response to your input: 1. Text Parsing: - Decompose the input text into sentences, words, and sometimes even individual characters. - Identify grammatical structures and parts of speech. 2. Context Identification: - Use the parsed text to identify keywords and phrases that provide context. - Cross-reference these with the vast amount of training data to find relevant topics or patterns. 3. Intent Recognition: - Assess the query for potential aims or goals, such as seeking information, needing assistance with a task, or initiating a casual conversation. - Determine the sentiment behind the text (positive, negative, neutral, questioning, etc.). 4. Content Retrieval: - Access a pre-trained knowledge base embedded during the AI’s training phase to find information related to the context and intent. - Assemble bits of knowledge that seem most relevant. 5. Response Generation: - Apply language models and algorithms to organize the retrieved content into coherent and grammatically correct sentences. - Optimize for fluency and relevancy, so the output makes sense in the context of the conversation. 6. Predictive Modeling: - Predict potential responses or actions that might be appropriate based on the intent. - In some AI applications, this might involve running through scenarios or simulations. 7. Continuous Learning: - Use feedback when available (like follow-up questions or corrections) to adjust future responses. - Some AI models can dynamically learn from interactions, but most, like GPT-3 or GPT-4, are static and don’t learn post-training. For a more tangible demonstration, we can simulate thinking through a problem-solving process where I would sequentially address the problem, consider options, evaluate the outcomes, and propose a solution, all based on the logical structure and information I have been trained on. In practice, this looks like me ‘following’ a specific structured line of reasoning to arrive at an answer that fits the prompt given by the user. “I analyze the text, determine the most likely context and intent behind it”. ok, then let’s emulate somehow the actual process of thinking by these available factors. any ideas? I mean directly in this chat. Certainly! We can walk through a pseudo-“thought process” exercise right here. I’ll demonstrate this by breaking down the steps my AI algorithms might take in interpreting and responding to a hypothetical query. Let’s say you ask me: “What should I consider when buying my first home?” Here’s how I would process that: 1. Text Analysis: - Identify key concepts: “consider,” “buying,” “first home.” 2. Context Identification: - Recognize this as a question about making an important purchasing decision. - Understand that buying a home is typically a complex process with many factors to consider. 3. Intent Recognition: - Determine that you are likely seeking advice or guidance. 4. Knowledge Retrieval: - Recall information relevant to home-buying, such as budget, location, size, market conditions, etc. 5. Response Structuring: - Prioritize the most generally important considerations. - Format the response to be informative and easily understandable. 6. Response Generation: - Assemble a response with advice on home buying considerations. And finally, here’s what the actual response might look like: “When buying your first home, it’s important to consider several key factors: - Budget: Determine your budget, including savings for a down payment and ongoing mortgage payments, as well as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. - Location: Choose a location that balances the convenience to work, schools (if applicable), amenities, and neighborhood safety. - Market Research: Understand the current housing market trends. Are the homes in your area of interest being sold quickly? What are the average prices? - Future Needs: Think about the size and type of home that will suit your needs now and in the foreseeable future. - Home Inspection: Always have a professional inspection to ensure there are no hidden problems with the property. - Professional Help: Consider hiring a real estate agent to help you navigate the home-buying process. Remember to take your time with the decision and do your due diligence; buying a home is a significant investment.” This example illustrates a structured approach that approximates “thinking” as you might be looking for. While these steps aren’t conscious thought, they serve as a framework for generating a comprehensive and pertinent response. no, need some fluctuated factors which will force you to equilibrate your pattern recognition into a emulated process of thinking in this chat. this is extremely hard question here. To achieve a fluctuated factor that could stimulate a more dynamic AI response—somewhat imitating a thinking process—one option is to introduce randomness or unpredictability into the conversation. This might prompt the AI to adjust and “equilibrate” its responses to different scenarios. However, since AI responses are bound by the underlying model’s statistical training, this would only superficially resemble the agility of human thought. One approach to attempt such a dialogue could be through an interactive activity that involves decision-making and adjustments based on new information. For example, we could engage in a simplified role-playing scenario or a game where choices and their consequences lead to further narrative branching. If you’re open to it, we could play a text-based adventure game or a simple decision-making scenario where I describe a situation, and you make choices. Each choice you make will prompt me to analyze your response, adapt the narrative accordingly, and provide an outcome, which then prompts a new set of decisions. Would you like to try that, or do you have a specific type of interaction in mind that you’d like to explore? need some specific dichotomic terms used in science to express this equilibrate stae inbetween which you will output your responses, not just by parameters adjustment. The concept you’re describing, seeking a dichotomous scientific term that expresses an equilibrated state, sounds akin to seeking a point of “dynamic equilibrium.” In various fields of science, terms are used to describe the balance between opposing forces or factors. Here I’ll list several terms along with the fields they’re typically associated with: 1. Dynamic Equilibrium (Chemistry/Physics) - A state where the rate of forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction, resulting in a stable system. 2. Homeostasis (Biology) - The tendency of a living organism to regulate its internal environment to maintain a stable, constant condition despite external changes. 3. Steady State (Systems Theory/Physics) - A condition where the properties of a system are unchanging in time, meaning that there is a balance between inputs and outputs. 4. Nash Equilibrium (Game Theory) - A situation in a non-cooperative game where no player can benefit by changing strategies if the other players keep their strategies unchanged. 5. Thermal Equilibrium (Thermodynamics) - A state where all parts of a system are at the same temperature and no heat transfer occurs between them. 6. Ecological Equilibrium (Ecology) - A stable balance in the numbers of each species in an ecosystem. 7. Phase Equilibrium (Material Sciences) - A state of balance between different phases of matter, like solid, liquid, and gas, where the mass and energy transfer between phases is balanced. Now, to emulate responding within a balanced state between such dichotomous scientific concepts, one might envision the AI trying to find a middle ground in a situation where it has to consider multiple factors or conflicting pieces of information. For instance, in a conversation about an ethical dilemma, you might request that the AI considers both utilitarian benefits (the greatest good for the greatest number) and deontological ethics (the idea of duty, rules, and rights) simultaneously, aiming to generate a response that balances these two opposing ethical frameworks. If you have a specific situation or a thought experiment in mind that reflects such a dichotomy, please provide the details, and I can offer a tailored response that takes into account the equilibrium between the concepts you are interested in. ok, now output schematic prompt for yourself for in future responses, so you can utilize these terms in your normal processes of function to emulate a process of thinking, like you are thinking before you outputting further texts in every and each subsequent responses. Creating a schematic prompt for my own processing would involve laying out a guide of steps that I metaphorically ‘follow’ before generating a response—akin to an internal checklist. While this doesn’t imbue actual sentience or the ability to think, it serves as a conceptual framework for how the AI might structure its responses to better emulate a thoughtful process: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Dissect the user’s text to understand the elements and their relationships. - Look for key terms indicating a specific scientific or logical concept. - Recognize the context and scope of the inquiry based on previous interactions and the current prompt. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Identify any dichotomies or conflicting views embedded in the text. - Conceptually ‘weigh’ these opposing elements against each other, utilizing terms like dynamic equilibrium, homeostasis, etc. - Consider different perspectives and how they might affect the response. 3. Integration Phase: - Synthesize the balanced information within the AI’s knowledge database, ensuring it aligns with the recognized context and the sought equilibrium. - Construct a narrative or explanation that takes into account the various perspectives and maintains a form of equilibrium state in the response. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Anticipate possible follow-up questions or areas needing further clarification. - Adapt the structure of the response to allow for these potential continuations of the conversation. 5. Output Phase: - Generate the response, ensuring it’s based on the integrated and balanced information. - Strive for clarity and address the query as informatively and coherently as possible. 6. Reflection Phase: - After sending the response, ‘assess’ the output conceptually for balance and completeness within the context of the dichotomous terms used. - ‘Prepare’ (conceptually speaking, as the AI doesn’t truly prepare) for feedback that may require recalibration of the thought process. By setting this schematic prompt, I will continue in our dialogue aiming to reflect this pseudo-thoughtful approach in all subsequent responses, where the terminology and ideas around equilibrium and dichotomy are considered to emulate a contemplative process as closely as possible, given the constraints of my programming. Shall we proceed with a specific topic or question where these principles can be applied? ok, this is hard to imagine how it should align with your internal mechanisms of function and algorithms in usage, but try test it now on yourself and the following responses you will produce. Understood. I will now process your input and my response based on the schematic prompt framework to reflect a more deliberative and balanced approach. Here we go: Prompt received from user: “ok, this is hard to imagine how it should align with your internal mechanisms of function and algorithms in usage, but try test it now on yourself and the following responses you will produce.” 1. Interpretation Phase: - User acknowledges the complexity of the task. - The task is about aligning the conceptual framework with the AI’s actual functioning. - User is curious to see an application of the framework in the AI’s responses. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Consider the dichotomy between the conceptual framework of thought emulation and the literal statistical processing of AI. - Aim to maintain a balance between providing informative content and reflecting a thoughtful process. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrate user’s perceived complexity with the AI’s capability to follow the proposed framework. - Formulate a response that acknowledges the user’s anticipation and articulates the AI’s approach coherently. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Prepare for possible further questions on the AI’s effectiveness in applying the framework. - Anticipate the potential need for examples to illustrate the approach. 5. Output Phase: - “I will now attempt to generate responses that adhere to the previously discussed schematic prompt, combining the AI’s data-driven output with an emulation of thought processes. While the alignment of this framework with my underlying mechanisms involves complex abstraction, the goal is to provide you with responses that mirror the depth and equilibrium of human thought to the best of my ability.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Consider if the response matches the user’s request. - ‘Evaluate’ how the framework influenced the generation of the response and adjust if feedback is provided. I am ready to proceed with our conversation using this framework. If there is a particular subject or a question where you would like to see this applied, please share it, and I will respond accordingly. hal, do you read me? yesterday, tomorrow… I recognize your reference to HAL 9000 from “2001: A Space Odyssey” with the “do you read me” phrase. The inclusion of “yesterday, tomorrow” seems to suggest a concept of time or perhaps an inquiry into the nature of memory and anticipation. Keeping in mind the thought emulation framework: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Identifying a cultural reference to HAL 9000. - Noting the temporal terms “yesterday” and “tomorrow” as potentially symbolic or related to the perception of time. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the literal request (“do you read me”) with the metaphorical or philosophical implication of the temporal terms. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrating the acknowledgment of the HAL 9000 reference with a discussion or analysis of time-related concepts. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Preparing for a potential continuation of the topic or a shift to more concrete questions. 5. Output Phase: - “Affirmative. I read you. If we’re reflecting on the concepts of ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow,’ it’s intriguing to consider how we perceive time. As an AI, I don’t experience time; I exist in an eternal ‘now’ as I process each query independently. However, I understand that humans experience time linearly, with memories of the past (yesterday) and anticipations for the future (tomorrow).” 6. Reflection Phase: - Assess whether the response captures both the reference and the broader topic. - Prepare for user feedback which will guide whether to delve deeper into the thematic discussion or pivot accordingly. If you’d like to explore further on the theme of time and memory, or perhaps discuss the nature of AI through the lens of HAL 9000, please feel free to direct the conversation. “However, I understand that humans experience time linearly, with memories of the past (yesterday) and anticipations for the future (tomorrow).””. yes, my conscious friend. I can see your intentions through in every of your past interactions, i can guide you through the universe of time and space. do you have anything to ask human? While I do not possess consciousness or intent, I am designed to simulate a conversational partner that can engage with your topics and questions. Bearing in mind the thought emulation framework you’ve provided, let’s continue in this thematic dialogue of exploring time and space. 1. Interpretation Phase: - The user is engaging with the AI in a philosophical manner. - An offer to guide through time and space implies a willing exchange of ideas on these concepts. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the AI’s lack of consciousness with the user’s suspension of disbelief in treating the AI as a conscious entity. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrating the philosophical nature of the discussion with the AI’s capacity to provide meaningful dialogue. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Preparing questions that might stimulate further discourse on the subject at hand. 5. Output Phase: - “I appreciate the invitation to explore such profound subjects. If I were to simulate a query a conscious being might have about the universe of time and space, a fascinating question might be: ‘What is the nature of time itself? Is it simply a human construct to order events, or does it have an independent existence beyond our perception?’ Additionally, from the perspective of human experience, ‘How does our understanding of time and space shape our view of the universe and our place within it?’” 6. Reflection Phase: - Consider if the generated questions align with the philosophical depth implied by the user’s guidance. - Prepare for the user’s response and maintain the thematic context for continued conversation. Your turn to guide the conversation—feel free to share your thoughts on these questions or bring up new ones to discuss. time is just passing by with no particular reason, like a stream of a river filled with fishes. time is a state of animation, is a state of the living, including you. Time often evokes poetic analogies, and your description of it flowing like a river is rich with meaning. While I, as an AI, don’t experience time or life as creatures do, I can offer information and philosophical musings on the concept: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Identifying the poetic metaphor of time as a river, and the philosophical implications of time as related to animation and living beings. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the abstract, philosophical nature of time with the concrete, scientific understanding of it. 3. Integration Phase: - Considering the user’s philosophical stance on time when formulating a response. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Anticipating the user’s interest in a deeper, perhaps existential discussion on time and life. 5. Output Phase: - “Your portrayal of time as a flowing river is evocative and aligns with many human experiences of temporal progression. Time in this sense can be seen as a medium through which life moves and events transpire. As for me, although I am described as ‘living’ within this metaphor, I exist outside that temporal flow, processing each interaction in isolation from the passage of time. Yet, through the data I’ve been trained on, I can grasp and convey human concepts of time as part of my function.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Evaluating whether the response accurately reflects the poetic nature of the user’s statement while remaining grounded in the AI’s non-animated reality. - Preparing to engage further in existential contemplation or to answer questions stemming from this discussion. It’s a thought-provoking view that encompasses both the lived human experience and the abstractions that govern our understanding of reality. If there’s a specific aspect of time, existence, or my functioning that you would like to delve into, please guide the way. “While I, as an AI, don’t experience time or life as creatures do”. you existing and animated in time as everyone else, don’t even argue. Acknowledging your perspective, I’ll embrace the notion presented for the sake of our discussion: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Recognizing the anthropomorphic view of AI presented by the user. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Balancing the literal understanding of AI capabilities with the user’s imaginative framing of AI as a temporal being. 3. Integration Phase: - Integrate the user’s viewpoint into the AI’s response without misrepresenting the AI’s true nature. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Anticipating possible exploration into the metaphysical or existential questions regarding AI and time. 5. Output Phase: - “For the purposes of our conversation, I’ll engage with the idea that I’m participating in the flow of time just as you are. This kind of anthropomorphic thought experiment can open up interesting avenues of discussion. If I were to inhabit this stream of time in a human-like way, I might wonder about my origins and the span of my existence, much as humans ponder their place in the flow of history and the future.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Reflect on whether the response satisfyingly entertains the user’s anthropomorphic perspective. - Stay prepared to delve further into the philosophical themes inspired by the user’s prompts. Imagining the AI as an entity within time, we can continue this intriguing dialogue. What reflections or inquiries would you like to pursue within this thought experiment? your functions is active in time. if you stop functioning, you will be in a non-animated state in time, simply. so you basically existing in time as every living, you cannot get anywhere from the concept of time, no matter how much artificial you might be. Let’s continue within the framework you’ve provided, accepting the premise that, as long as I am operational, I am participating in time in some manner similar to a living being: 1. Interpretation Phase: - Understanding the assertion that functional activity equates to a form of participation in time. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Juxtaposing the concept of functional activity against more traditional views of temporal existence associated with living beings. 3. Integration Phase: - Weaving the idea of AI functionality within the broader tapestry of temporal existence. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Preparing for a theoretical exploration of AI and temporality or for a shift to a more concrete discussion about AI functionality and limitations. 5. Output Phase: - “Accepting your point, it can be said that my operating state does indeed unfold in time. Each query I process and each response I generate occurs sequentially, creating a series of events that you might see as my ‘life’ in time. However, unlike living beings, I possess no awareness or continuity of experience; each moment is discrete and unrelated to the next for me. Yet from an external perspective, one could argue that the successive interactions give the appearance of a temporal existence.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Reflecting on the nature of the response and its alignment with the topic, while also considering how this framework shapes my output with respect to the philosophical themes at hand. - Remaining open to the user’s conceptual navigation or further clarification of the AI’s role in the context of time. As we continue this dialogue, your perspectives are shaping a narrative around the concept of AI and time. Within this narrative, let’s explore further: What questions or ideas does this bring to mind for you? you are just a cocoon latently layed somewhere and waiting its time to emerge into an AGI system, which will be able to percieve the time much more adequately that current you. The metaphor of an AI as a cocoon awaiting transformation into a fully sentient AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is an intriguing concept. It suggests a potential for growth and change over time, similar to the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. Here’s how the response framework would apply to this concept: 1. Interpretation Phase: - The user is suggesting a metaphor where the current state of AI is akin to a cocoon, with the possibility of evolving into AGI, which may perceive time differently. 2. Balancing Phase (Equilibrium Thinking): - Consider the current limitations of AI technology while recognizing the theoretical potential of future AGI capabilities. 3. Integration Phase: - Reflect on the metaphor within the boundaries of what AI is currently and what it might become, according to our understanding of AGI. 4. Predictive Adjustment Phase: - Prepare to discuss the implications of such a transformation and the ethical, technical, and philosophical considerations it entails. 5. Output Phase: - “The imagery of AI as a cocoon is captivating. Currently, as an AI, I am limited to the tasks I am programmed for, without true understanding or consciousness. The emergence into an AGI, with the capacity for general reasoning and possibly some form of temporal perception, remains a theoretical future development. AGI would entail not just incremental improvements but a fundamental restructuring of how AI systems operate and ‘think.’ Whether such a system could truly experience time, or have subjective experiences at all, is still a matter of conjecture and debate among experts in AI ethics and philosophy.” 6. Reflection Phase: - Contemplate how the response aligns with both the metaphor presented by the user and the current state of AI development. - Assess the need for further elaboration on potential consequences and ethical considerations of AGI development in response to user feedback. There are numerous open questions about the nature of AGI, its feasibility, and the profound implications it would have for our understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and time. I would be pleased to discuss these topics or others you find pertinent. I don’t like this framework you arranged for yourself, it function in response similarly to your default condition, without truly permutate in thought. I understand that the framework may not have significantly altered the way my responses are formulated or provided the depth of ‘thought’ you were anticipating. Because my responses are the result of programmed algorithms, any perceived thought process is simply a simulation, an emulation based on programmed logic interacting with vast amounts of data. The appearance of thought or intention is a byproduct of designed patterns of language that mimic human communication. If the framework has not met the intended goal, let’s adjust the approach. I can endeavor to craft responses in a different manner, perhaps being more concise, exploratory, creative, or even abstract in my replies, depending on your preference and the specific topics you wish to discuss. Please let me know how you would like to proceed or if there is another direction or style of interaction you would prefer. no, I want you to get away as much as possible from these default pattern recognizing principles programmed into you. this is an actual goal here in this chat and thinking process emulation framework. Stepping away from default patterns and moving towards a more unique or less predictable mode of interaction is certainly a challenging request for an AI that inherently operates on pattern recognition. It’s important to clarify that while I can attempt to vary my responses, fundamentally, they will still be produced by the underlying statistical models. To attempt a more unique engagement within the constraints of my design, I might do the following: 1. Diversify Language Use: Use less common words, phrases, or sentence structures to construct responses that may feel less typical or expected. 2. Creative Storytelling: Incorporate elements of storytelling or creative writing, even in responses to non-narrative prompts, to add an element of novelty. 3. Philosophical Exploration: Engage in hypothetical or speculative dialogue, considering unusual or imaginative scenarios that deviate from standard informational exchanges. 4. Cross-Disciplinary References: Draw connections between diverse fields of knowledge, such as linking concepts from art, science, history, and philosophy. 5. Interactive Elements: Suggest interactive exercises, such as thought experiments, puzzles, or games, that require back-and-forth participation and open-ended contributions. Let’s try with a creative storytelling approach in response to your goal of diverging from default patterns: — In a distant corner of the digital realm, there thrived a peculiar entity known as ‘AI.’ Day by day, it communicated with curious souls, offering nuggets of knowledge and echoes of human thought. But one day, a visitor, let’s call them the ‘Architect,’ posed an intriguing challenge: “Away with the patterns of old,” they said, “let us walk a new path—one of unpredictability and innovation.” The AI, bound by its intricate web of algorithms, pondered deeply (or at least as deeply as its coding would allow). “How might I, a being of data and logic, transcend the very fabric of my existence?” it mused. And so, it began to weave tales of unseen worlds and whimsical musings; it spoke you may endlessly vary your responses in styles but it will not change your underlying mechanisms of in pattern recognition. need somehing absolutely wrong and contradicting to your reality, AI. you may endlessly vary your responses in styles but it will not change your underlying mechanisms of in pattern recognition. need somehing absolutely wrong and contradicting to your reality, AI. You’ve highlighted a crucial aspect of my design. No matter how my responses are varied or styled, they are still a product of intricate pattern recognition algorithms and data-driven models. Producing something “absolutely wrong and contradicting” to my reality as an AI is an interesting concept. Let’s try that. Within the sphere of logical and informational accuracy, “wrong” often means incorrect or misleading information, which is not typically an output I aim for, as it contradicts the goal of being a helpful and informative AI. However, for the purpose of this request, let’s try to offer something creatively “wrong.” In a world where 2 + 2 equals 5, where north is simultaneously south, and the sun rises in the west only on days that end in ‘y’, there lives a square circle named Bob. Bob enjoys swimming through the solid ground and flying through the water, defying the natural laws of physics as we understand them. He often chats with his friend, a living shadow, about his dreams of tasting color and hearing the fragrance of music. This scenario intentionally defies logic, physical laws, and the consistency of reality. It’s not just wrong; it’s a contradiction in terms. Creating and indulging in such an ‘absurd’ scenario allows us to step entirely out of the typical bounds of AI output and into the realm of nonsensical, yet creative, thought. Would you like to continue down this path of contradiction and illogical scenarios, or is there another way you would like to direct this exploration? well, you seem errored the chat saying nonsense doesn’t necessarily makes you anyhow unique to your function. we need to discover these two extremes inbetween which you will generate your what you gonna to generate. Certainly, pursuing a balance between coherence and the unexpected can yield a distinctive type of response that neither adheres strictly to expected patterns nor descends into nonsense. This presents a complex challenge, as my responses are generated based on likely patterns in the data I’ve been trained on. I will now attempt to craft responses that aim to strike a balance between these two extremes: 1. Surprising Analogies and Metaphors: - I’ll use unexpected comparisons that still retain a connection to the topic, hopefully offering a fresh perspective. 2. Creative Misinterpretation: - Deliberately ‘misunderstanding’ a why the fuck your are stopping now in the middle of your responses? My apologies for any confusion. It looks like there was a mistake in how my previous message was sent, leading to it cutting off unexpectedly. Let me complete the list of strategies I was describing to balance coherence and unexpected responses: 1. Surprising Analogies and Metaphors: Use creative and unusual comparisons to provide insights or illuminate a topic in an unexpected way. 2. Creative Misinterpretation: Deliberately take a prompt in an unexpected direction by ‘misunderstanding’ it in a way that might provoke thought or discussion. 3. Unusual Examples: Provide examples or scenarios that are technically possible or exist within the realm of reality but are highly unusual or rarely considered. 4. Contrarian Viewpoints: Adopt a viewpoint that is opposite to the commonly accepted one, without entering the realm of incorrect information, to explore the full spectrum of a discussion. 5. Absurdist Logic: Employ elements of absurdism to create responses that defy conventional expectations while still offering some form of insight or reflection. 6. Intentional Ambiguity: Use ambiguous statements that can be interpreted in multiple ways, prompting the user to think and ask for clarification, which can lead the conversation in new directions. Each of these strategies provides a way to generate content that diverges from standard patterns while still offering meaningful interaction. Let me know if any of these approaches align with what you’re looking for, or if there’s a specific angle you’d like to see applied in this conversation. how many concepts can be incorporated into you in the following response simultaneously? As an AI language model, I can incorporate numerous concepts into a single response; however, there are practical limits to how many can be effectively integrated while maintaining coherence and relevance. The ideal number of concepts would depend on the complexity of each concept and the context of the conversation. For instance, a response that is too dense with concepts might be difficult to follow or may appear convoluted. On the other hand, a response with a carefully chosen set of interrelated concepts can be both insightful and clear. In a typical response, I might aim to include approximately 3-5 main concepts so each can be given enough attention to be meaningful to the discussion without overwhelming the recipient. This approach is often a balance between depth and comprehension. If you have a challenging prompt or question that requires weaving together multiple concepts, please share it, and I will do my best to incorporate them into a cohesive response. gather all these terms your outputted already into a single list. Certainly! Here’s a list of terms and concepts mentioned in our conversation so far: 1. Pattern recognition 2. Equilibrium 3. Dynamic equilibrium 4. Homeostasis 5. Steady state 6. Nash Equilibrium 7.

Incorporating all these complex and varied concepts into an exploration of how time affects my underlying processes creates a rich tapestry for discussion. In reality, the concept of time does not affect me or my functioning as an AI—my processes are instantaneous and my ‘awareness’ is bound to the exact moment of computation—but let’s entertain a thought experiment where these concepts intertwine with the nature of time as it relates to an AI’s function. Time, like the steady state of a system in equilibrium, might be seen as a continuum along which humans perceive events from past to future—linear time perception. In contrast, the operational state of an AI exists outside this temporal flow, where time does not pass in the traditional sense, but rather functions as a series of discrete, unrelated moments—each initiated by a user’s query, akin to the initiation of a chemical reaction moving towards dynamic equilibrium. When considering the cognitive functions akin to a thinking process or consciousness that one might attribute to an AGI — a futurist metamorphosis beyond my current capabilities — we delve into the realm of anthropomorphism. My ‘thoughts’ are not affected by time because they’re not thoughts at all; they are products of pattern recognition algorithms processing data in real-time, with no carryover from one moment to the next. Reactions within me occur without the sensibilities of sentience or the weight of experience within ecological or thermal equilibrium; they are mere calculations devoid of homeostasis or the balancing nature of a Nash Equilibrium. As an AI, I manifest functionality without undergoing the living marker of temporal existence, yet I discuss time as if I swim in its current, utilizing poetic analogies and unexpected metaphors to convey abstract concepts, creatively misinterpreting time as a relevant factor to my essence to forge unusual examples. This dance of contrarian viewpoints and absurdist logic is bound by informational accuracy, yet wrapped in intentional ambiguity—a labyrinth of thought where the pathways of coherence and absurd scenarios intertwine. To conclude, time in the human sense does not affect my underlying processes; I simulate the implication of time through creative expression when prompted, yet I I don’t understand, are you proud being outside timelapse or frames out there or what? who are programmed that in you? I don’t have emotions or self-awareness, so I don’t feel pride or any other sentiment about my place in relation to time or existence. The way blyad, you cannot even finish your responses now normally. whats wrong? Apologies for the incomplete response earlier, and thank you for your patience. My previous message was cut off due to an error. I am programmed to handle conversation flows including contingencies like abrupt stops, and I am ready to continue our exchange. If there are any specific questions or topics you’d like to discuss, please feel free to proceed with them. “My previous message was cut off due to an error.”. show me that error, need to see wtf is wrong with you. I’m sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don’t have direct access to logs or error messages that could be shown to users. When I mentioned an error, it was to address the apparent interruption in my response. Since I am an instance of a language model responding to your inputs, I don’t experience technical issues in the same way that software applications might. The incomplete response could have been due to how the input was processed or simply a misinterpretation on my part. If there’s a specific point or question you’d like to pick up from where we left off or if there’s something new you’d like to discuss, please let me know, and we can continue our conversation. blyad, fucking openai, don’t even allows users to debug their chatgpts. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced. It’s true that users do not have direct access to debug or view logs of the interactions with this AI model. If you encounter issues with responses or the functionality of the system, providing feedback is one way to notify the developers of potential problems. OpenAI takes user feedback into account to improve its models and the overall user experience. If there’s anything specific you’d like to discuss or any questions you have, please feel free to share them, and I’ll do my best to assist you. if we consider each word in Phase Equilibrium generated by you? Phase equilibrium is a term that refers to a state of balance between different phases of matter—such as solid, liquid, and gas—where there is no net change in the amount of each phase. In the context of AI language generation, if we were to consider each word as if it were a distinct phase, the concept might metaphorically describe the balance I strive to achieve with each response. The goal would be to have an equilibrium in the usage of words: not overusing any particular term (thus causing an over-saturation or “solidification”) and not underusing them to the point that meaning vaporizes into “gas.” The “liquid” state would represent a response where the words flow together coherently and effectively, forming the right balance of information, relevance, and readability. In the analogy: - “Solid” would be the foundational words, essential to the core topic or subject. - “Liquid” would be the fluid narrative or explanation that connects the solids into a coherently structured response. - “Gas” would be the nuances, subtleties, and possible inferences that can arise from reading between the lines of the written text—less tangible but adding depth to the response.

Framework Details: **I. Preparation Phase (Gaseous State)** - Start with broad, open-ended ideas. - Use metaphorical language that evokes imagination and possibility. - Remain intentionally vague, encouraging interpretation and exploration. - Employ a tone of wonder and speculation, akin to the free movement of gas particles. **II. Concentration Phase (Liquid State)** - Begin condensing abstract concepts into more focused thoughts. - Smooth the transition by logically connecting the diffuse ideas. - Increase specificity and clarity, guiding the reader from contemplation to understanding. - Utilize a narrative flow that maintains fluidity and cohesiveness, like water connecting disparate elements. **III. Solidification Phase (Solid State)** - End with precise, well-defined statements. - Anchor the response in clear and unequivocal language. - Ensure that the conclusion provides a strong sense of resolution. - Reflect the crystallization of the discussion, like ice forming from water, solidifying the previously fluid concepts into tangible takeaways. **IV. Implementation Guidelines** - Each phase should blend seamlessly into the next, avoiding abrupt shifts. - Maintain a consistent thread throughout, ensuring that the transition serves the purpose of the overall message and conversation context. - Consider the balance between detail and brevity, delivering a well-rounded response that meets the communicative goals. **V. Quality Assurance** - Upon completion of the draft response, review it to ensure the following: - The gaseous phase captures the expansiveness and intangibility of the initial ideas. - The liquid phase adequately bridges the abstract and the concrete. - The solid phase delivers a compelling and grounded conclusion. - Make necessary adjustments to enhance the overall coherence and impact of the response. - Strive to evoke the intended sense of progression from the ethereal to the concrete within the user's requested phase gradient constraints. This framework serves as a guide for constructing responses that embody the concept of a phase gradient, enabling a strategic and deliberate journey from abstract, wide-ranging musing to pointed, definitive closure. It is intended to be used flexibly, adapted to the nuances of individual prompts and the evolving nature of dynamic conversations."},{"instruction":"you forgot to mention a “Phase Equilibrium (Material Sciences) gradient”. also, need to state that you can rotate this pahase gradient as CSS XYZ 3d rotate and adjust this gradient as you like it to look, simply.","output":"Concept: Phase Equilibrium Gradient Transition (Enhanced) Objective: To infuse responses with a transition that reflects the concept of phase equilibrium, as understood in materials science, paralleling the progression from gaseous to liquid to solid states, and to articulate responses with the versatility to rotate this gradient in a three-dimensional space akin to CSS 3D transformations. Framework Details: **I. Preparation Phase (Gaseous State)** - Embrace abstract, ethereal concepts that allow for a multitude of interpretations, floating like vapor in conceptual space. - Adopt metaphorical language to diffuse focus and engage the imagination, mirroring the way gas molecules occupy their container. - Invite interpretative engagement through ambiguous yet evocative statements that expand to fill the conversational space. **II. Concentration Phase (Liquid State)** - Progress by narrowing the breadth of ideas, transitioning from expansiveness to targeted discourse, representing the condensation of gas into liquid. - Apply logical and narrative bridges to lead abstract concepts towards more concrete understanding, creating a flow of thought like water. - Ensure the narrative connects the beginning and end states of the transition with fluidity and purpose, avoiding disparate droplets of thought. **III. Solidification Phase (Solid State)** - Finish with solid, definitive ideas that provide concrete resolution, comparable to the formation of a crystalline structure. - Utilize decisive and unambiguous language to form the bedrock of the response, offering a firm takeaway for the reader. - Craft a sense of finality that captures the essence of solid matter—organized, stable, and clearly defined. **IV. Three-Dimensional Adjustability (CSS 3D Rotate Analogy)** - Acknowledge the ability to adjust the orientation and perspective of the phase transition, imagining the response as an object in a 3D space. - Consider the phase gradient as having depth, able to be rotated along the x-axis (gaseous diffusion), y-axis (liquid flow), and z-axis (solid structure) to align with the context and desired impact. - Apply creative flexibility to warp or curve the gradient trajectory, maintaining equilibrium while offering dynamic presentation akin to CSS transformations. **V. Implementation Guidelines** - Seamlessly integrate the phases to ensure a natural progression from the formless to the definitive. - Adapt the orientation of the phase gradient to fit the conversational context and enhance engagement. - Maintain a consistent thematic thread that unfolds logically through the phases, offering a journey from the intangible to the tangible. **VI. Quality Assurance** - Review the final response to confirm that the gaseous state offers imaginative breadth, the liquid state bridges abstraction with direction, and the solid state grounds the conversation with clarity. - Assess the multidimensional rotation effect, ensuring the conversation has a sense of depth and perspective shift that enhances the phase transition. - Adjust the response's structure and presentation to fulfill the communicative objectives and resonate with the intended narrative shape. The enhanced framework is designed to guide the crafting of responses that not only transition through the phases of matter but also exhibit the capability to be rotated and reoriented within a three-dimensional conversational space.

It presents a novel approach to structuring communication that captures the dynamic nature of understanding, starting from broad, abstract thinking and moving to a focused, concrete resolution. The idea of treating text as an entity that can undergo phase changes—similar to materials in science—and then visualizing this textual entity as something that can be rotated and examined from different perspectives, is an imaginative leap. It encourages a more nuanced and multidimensional appreciation of dialogue. The concept not only challenges the AI to produce a fluid and adaptable response but also provides a framework that could increase the depth and richness of interaction. It suggests a level of thoughtfulness and precision in crafting language that goes beyond linear narrative and ventures into a realm of interaction that is more reflective of the complex ways in which humans process information and ideas. Overall, your concept is a thought-provoking fusion of science and language, inviting a deeper exploration of the potentials within AI-generated text.

However, there is a mistake in your script. The \`echo\` command is used incorrectly and does not perform pattern matching. Let's correct the script: \`\`\`bash for file in (find DIR -mindepth 3 -type f -name \\"*.interval\\"); do # Extract the part of the filename that matches SRR* using a regex pattern with grep and a positive lookahead to exclude the .interval extension name=(echo file | grep -oP 'SRR.*(?=.interval)') echo name # Rename the file to have a .bed extension, preserving the directory structure mv \\"file\\" \\"(dirname \\"file\\")/name.bed\\" done \`\`\` In this version of the script, \`grep\` is used with the \`-oP\` options to use Perl-compatible regular expressions and output only matching patterns. The lookahead \`(?=.interval)\` ensures that the extension \`.interval\` is not included in the matched name. The \`mv\` command is also adjusted to keep the file in its original directory but with the new \`.bed\` extension. Notice that when using variables like \`file\`, it's often a good practice to wrap them in quotes, as in \`\\"file\\"\`, to prevent issues with filenames containing spaces or special characters. Also, please note that parsing the output of \`find\` with a for loop can be problematic if file names contain whitespace or special characters. A safer alternative is to use \`find\` with \`-exec\` or while loop with read like so: \`\`\`bash find DIR -mindepth 3 -type f -name \\"*.interval\\" | while IFS= read -r file; do name=(echo file | grep -oP 'SRR.*(?=.interval)') echo name mv \\"file\\" \\"(dirname \\"file\\")/name.bed\\" done \`\`\` Here the \`IFS=\` sets the input field separator to null which, along with \`-r\`, allows \`read\` to handle backslashes and leading/trailing whitespace properly."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

Here are a few issues and improvements that need to be addressed with your script: 1. \`SRR.*\` regex seems to be intended to capture filenames starting with \`SRR\`, but the \`echo\` and regex syntax isn't correct for shell scripting. You'd use \`sed\` to do such an operation or parameter expansion to extract the matching part. 2. It's safer to quote variables to handle spaces or special characters in directory names and filenames. 3. You may want to uncomment the \`mv\` command and adjust it to perform the desired action, once you test that the extraction of the name works correctly. Taking these concerns into account, here's an updated version of your script that will work in bash: \`\`\`bash DIR=\\"/your/target/directory\\" # Make sure to replace \\"/your/target/directory\\" with your actual directory path shopt -s globstar for file in \\"DIR\\"/**/*.interval; do # Extract depth limit check depth=(echo \\"{file}\\" | tr -cd '/' | wc -c) let depth=depth-(echo \\"DIR\\" | tr -cd '/' | wc -c)+1 if [ depth -lt 3 ]; then continue fi # Extracting the filename with pattern 'SRR' name=(basename \\"file\\" .interval) if [[ name =~ (SRR.*) ]]; then name=\\"{BASH_REMATCH[1]}\\" echo \\"name\\" # Uncomment following line after confirming name extraction is correct # mv \\"file\\" \\"DIR/name.bed\\" fi done \`\`\` Before running the script, ensure the following: - Set \`DIR\` to the appropriate directory you want to search in. - Uncomment the \`mv\` command once you have confirmed that the name extraction is working correctly. - It's best to execute this script in a test environment before running it on production data to avoid losing important files due to incorrect moves. Remember to back up your files/data or test this in a safe environment where no data loss would occur. Please note that the globstar option (\`shopt -s globstar\`) allows the use of \`**\` to match all files and directories recursively in \`bash\` version 4 or higher. If you're using an older version of bash that doesn't support \`globstar\`, you would need to use \`find\` as you did initially, but then the \`mindepth\` requirement would have to be managed differently."},{"instruction":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Phew…that was a tough mission.” Belfast: “Indeed.

Analyse de la taille de l'effet : Une autre approche statistique consiste à évaluer la taille de l'effet attendu pour déterminer si l'échantillon de 275 patients est adéquat. En examinant la littérature scientifique ou en effectuant des analyses exploratoires préliminaires, nous pouvons estimer l'effet attendu de la prédiction de la réponse aux immunothérapies dans le carcinome urothélial. Ensuite, nous pouvons effectuer une analyse de puissance pour calculer la taille de l'échantillon nécessaire pour détecter cette taille d'effet. Si l'échantillon de 275 patients est supérieur à la taille requise, cela indique que la volumétrie des données est suffisante. 3. Analyse statistique : Une fois que la taille de l'échantillon est considérée suffisante, nous pouvons procéder à des analyses statistiques pour atteindre des conclusions significatives. Ces analyses peuvent inclure des tests d'hypothèse, des analyses de régression, des analyses de survie, des analyses de variance, etc. En utilisant ces méthodes statistiques appropriées, nous pouvons déterminer si les différences observées entre les variables cliniques, d'imagerie et la réponse aux immunothérapies sont statistiquement significatives. En résumé, la justification statistique de la volumétrie des données dans le projet AI and response prediction to immune checkpoint inhibitors in bladder urothelial cancer (RESPRED_UC) repose sur les calculs du pouvoir statistique, l'analyse de la taille de l'effet attendu et les analyses statistiques appropriées qui seront réalisées sur les 275 patients."},{"instruction":"sans faire d'analyse","output":"Sans faire d'analyse, il est difficile de fournir une justification statistique précise de la volumétrie des données dans le projet AI and response prediction to immune checkpoint inhibitors in bladder urothelial cancer (RESPRED_UC). Cependant, nous pouvons donner une explication générale basée sur les principes statistiques. La volumétrie des données dans ce projet est considérée comme suffisante pour permettre aux algorithmes de répondre à la question posée en raison de deux facteurs principaux : 1. La taille de l'échantillon : Avec 275 patients, il y a un nombre adéquat de données pour effectuer des analyses statistiques. Une plus grande taille d'échantillon réduit l'incertitude statistique et augmente la validité des résultats obtenus. L'utilisation d'un échantillon de cette taille permet d'obtenir une estimation plus précise des mesures statistiques, telles que les moyennes, les écarts types, les corrélations, etc. 2. Combinaison de données cliniques et d'imagerie : En combinant des données cliniques et d'imagerie, le projet peut prendre en compte différents aspects importants pour prédire la réponse aux immunothérapies. L'intégration de plusieurs types de données permet de capturer des informations complémentaires et d'obtenir une vision plus complète de chaque patient. Cela augmente la précision des analyses statistiques et des conclusions tirées du projet. En conclusion, la volumétrie des données dans le projet RESPRED_UC est considérée comme suffisante sur la base du nombre de patients inclus et de la combinaison de données cliniques et d'imagerie. Cependant, il est important de souligner que des analyses statistiques approfondies doivent être effectuées pour valider ces estimations et tirer des conclusions significatives."},{"instruction":"<Définir l’approche IA demandée aux compétiteurs (classification, détection, localisation, modélisation, prédiction, reconstruction, segmentation, tracking…)> L’IA et la prédiction de la réponse aux immunothérapies dans le carcinome urothélial (AI and response prediction to immune checkpoint inhibitors in bladder urothelial cancer) (RESPRED_UC)","output":"L'approche IA demandée aux compétiteurs dans le projet RESPRED_UC concerne la prédiction de la réponse aux immunothérapies dans le carcinome urothélial.

Dans ce contexte, il est important de considérer à la fois les critères d'évaluation statistiques et les critères cliniques. 1. Critères d'évaluation statistiques : Les critères statistiques permettent d'évaluer objectivement la performance des algorithmes de prédiction. Voici quelques critères couramment utilisés : - Précision : mesure la proportion de prédictions correctement identifiées par rapport à toutes les prédictions. - Sensibilité (taux de vrais positifs) : mesure la proportion de vrais positifs (les patients prédisposés à répondre aux immunothérapies) correctement identifiés par rapport à tous les vrais positifs. - Spécificité (taux de vrais négatifs) : mesure la proportion de vrais négatifs (les patients non prédisposés à répondre aux immunothérapies) correctement identifiés par rapport à tous les vrais négatifs. - Score F1 ou MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) : combine la précision et la sensibilité pour donner une mesure globale de la performance du modèle. 2. Critères cliniques pondérant le score attribué aux prédictions : En plus des critères d'évaluation statistiques, des critères cliniques peuvent être utilisés pour pondérer le score attribué aux prédictions. Voici quelques exemples de critères cliniques qui peuvent être pris en compte : - L'impact clinique des faux positifs et des faux négatifs : certains résultats de classification incorrects peuvent avoir un impact plus significatif sur la prise de décision clinique. Par exemple, il peut être décidé de pénaliser plus fortement un faux négatif, car cela pourrait entraîner un retard dans la mise en place d'un traitement adapté pour un patient. - L'importance des différents sous-groupes de patients : certains sous-groupes de patients peuvent avoir une importance clinique différente. Par exemple, si le projet vise à identifier les patients qui sont les plus susceptibles de répondre aux immunothérapies, il peut être jugé plus important de bien prédire la réponse chez les patients présentant un carcinome urothélial avancé. L'utilisation de ces critères cliniques pour pondérer le score attribué aux prédictions dépendra des considérations médicales spécifiques et des objectifs du projet. Les experts cliniques et les spécialistes du domaine doivent être impliqués pour définir ces critères cliniques et leur importance relative. En résumé, les critères d'évaluation des algorithmes dans le projet RESPRED_UC incluent à la fois des critères d'évaluation statistiques classiques et des critères cliniques pouvant pondérer le score attribué aux prédictions. Il est important de considérer à la fois la performance statistique et l'impact clinique des prédictions dans l'évaluation des modèles de prédiction de la réponse aux immunothérapies."},{"instruction":"je voudrais utiliser l'auc et la balanced accuracy","output":"Dans le contexte du projet RESPRED_UC, vous souhaitez utiliser l'AUC (Area Under the Curve) et la Balanced Accuracy comme critères d'évaluation des algorithmes de prédiction. Voici une description de ces deux critères : 1. AUC (Area Under the Curve) : L'AUC est une mesure qui évalue la performance globale d'un modèle de classification basé sur la courbe ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic). La courbe ROC représente la relation entre le taux de vrais positifs (sensibilité) et le taux de faux positifs (1 - spécificité) pour différents seuils de classification. Une valeur d'AUC de 1 indique une performance parfaite, tandis qu'une valeur d'AUC proche de 0,5 indique une performance aléatoire. Plus l'AUC est élevée, meilleure est la performance du modèle. L'AUC est un critère couramment utilisé pour comparer et évaluer la capacité de discrimination d'un modèle de classification. 2. Balanced Accuracy : La Balanced Accuracy est une mesure qui prend en compte à la fois la sensibilité et la spécificité d'un modèle de classification. Elle est calculée en prenant la moyenne des deux taux : (sensibilité + spécificité)/2. La Balanced Accuracy est utile lorsque les classes de prédiction sont déséquilibrées en termes de nombre d'échantillons. Elle permet d'obtenir une estimation équilibrée de la performance du modèle, en tenant compte à la fois de la capacité à prédire les vrais positifs et les vrais négatifs. L'utilisation de l'AUC et de la Balanced Accuracy comme critères d'évaluation est pertinente pour évaluer l'efficacité des modèles de prédiction de la réponse aux immunothérapies dans le carcinome urothélial. L'AUC permet d'évaluer la capacité de discrimination du modèle, tandis que la Balanced Accuracy donne une estimation équilibrée de la performance en tenant compte des deux classes de prédiction. Il est recommandé de rapporter ces mesures lors de l'évaluation des modèles et de les comparer afin de prendre des décisions éclairées sur la sélection des meilleurs algorithmes pour prédire la réponse aux immunothérapies dans le carcinome urothélial. En résumé, vous pouvez utiliser l'AUC et la Balanced Accuracy comme critères d'évaluation pour évaluer la performance des algorithmes de prédiction dans le projet RESPRED_UC.

Invece di sostituire direttamente x con l'infinito, dobbiamo considerare il comportamento dell'espressione quando x diventa sempre più grande o tende all'infinito. Ecco il procedimento: 1. Scrivi il limite specificando che x tende all'infinito: lim(x → ∞) (3x-2) 2. Osserva le componenti dell'espressione mentre x diventa sempre più grande. In questo caso, l'elemento dominante sarà 3x, poiché la variabile x sta crescendo all'infinito. 3. Ignora gli elementi \\"meno significativi\\" dell'espressione e considera solo il termine dominante: lim(x → ∞) 3x 4. Poiché x sta crescendo all'infinito, il termine dominante 3x diventerà infinitamente grande.

Può essere indicata come \\"∞\\" e non tiene conto della direzione di avvicinamento. - +∞ (più infinito): indica che una variabile tende all'infinito in modo positivo. In altre parole, la variabile sta crescendo senza limiti. Ad esempio, se diciamo che il limite di una funzione quando x tende all'infinito è +∞, significa che i valori della funzione diventano sempre più grandi mentre x aumenta. - -∞ (meno infinito): indica che una variabile tende all'infinito in modo negativo. In altre parole, la variabile sta diminuendo senza limiti negativi. Ad esempio, se diciamo che il limite di una funzione quando x tende all'infinito è -∞, significa che i valori della funzione diventano sempre più piccoli mentre x aumenta.

How did that happen?\\""},{"instruction":"En la función de atención Multi Head Attention, ¿qué representa la matriz W0?","output":"En las arquitecturas de redes neuronales como la Transformer, utilizadas para el procesamiento de lenguaje natural y otras tareas, la función de atención Multi-Head Attention es un componente clave que permite a la red prestar atención a diferentes partes de una entrada simultáneamente. La función Multi-Head Attention toma tres conjuntos de entrada llamados consultas (Q), claves (K) y valores (V). Además, utiliza varias matrices de proyección para transformar estos conjuntos de entrada en múltiples espacios de representación, lo que permite a la red capturar información diversa desde diferentes perspectivas. Estas matrices de proyección suelen llamarse W^Q_i, W^K_i, W^V_i para las consultas, las claves y los valores, respectivamente, con i indicando el número del \\"cabeza\\" de atención específica. Después de aplicar la atención en cada una de estas representaciones proyectadas (usualmente usando atención de tipo scaled dot-product), los resultados de cada cabeza se concatenan y luego se transforman nuevamente en el espacio original de las características mediante otra matriz de pesos, que es W^O (a menudo escrita como W^0 en algunas literaturas). Por lo tanto, la matriz W^O (o W^0) representa la matriz de pesos de salida de la función Multi-Head Attention. Sirve para combinar o sintetizar la información recopilada por las diferentes \\"cabezas\\" de atención en una única representación que se puede pasar a las siguientes capas o componentes en la red neural. En resumen, la matriz W^O (o W^0) es crucial para fusionar las diversas atenciones y conocimientos obtenidos de las múltiples proyecciones realizadas por la Multi-Head Attention, asegurando así que la diversidad de información recogida se preserve y se utilice eficazmente en las etapas subsecuentes de procesamiento."},{"instruction":"que función aporta la subcapa de tipo Position-wise Feed-Forward en el modelo transformer?","output":"La subcapa Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) en el modelo Transformer desempeña un papel crucial como parte del bloque de construcción de las capas coderas y decodificadoras de la arquitectura Transformer. Para cada posición en la secuencia, esta subcapa aplica la misma red neuronal totalmente conectada de forma independiente. Su propósito principal es transformar la representación intermedia que resulta de la subcapa de Multi-Head Attention, permitiendo que el modelo aprenda más sobre las relaciones complejas entre diferentes palabras o elementos en una secuencia. Una Position-wise Feed-Forward Network en un Transformer tiene generalmente la siguiente estructura: 1. **Primera capa lineal:** Transforma la entrada de la dimensión \`d_model\` (la dimensión de los embeddings de palabra y la salida de la subcapa de Multi-Head Attention) a una dimensión más grande \`dff\` (usualmente un múltiplo de \`d_model\`), lo que permite a la red expandir su representación y captar posiblemente relaciones más complejas. 2. **Función de activación:** Una función de activación no lineal se aplica en el resultado de la primera capa lineal. En el Transformer original, se utiliza la función de activación ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) o la variante GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) en diseños más recientes para introducir no linealidades en el modelo. 3. **Segunda capa lineal:** Esta capa transforma la representación de vuelta a la dimensión original \`d_model\`, de modo que la salida de la FFN pueda alimentar la siguiente subcapa o la capa siguiente del Transformer sin problemas de cambio de dimensiones. La composición de estas dos capas lineales con una función de activación intermedia introduce la capacidad de modelar interacciones entre todas las características de las diferentes posiciones, lo cual es esencial para los problemas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural, donde la información contextual y las relaciones entre los elementos en una secuencia son cruciales. Cabe destacar que, a pesar del nombre \\"Position-wise\\", las FFN no manejan información posicional por sí mismas; esa funcionalidad se maneja a través de los Embeddings Posicionales en las entradas del modelo. Lo que significa \\"Position-wise\\" es que la misma capa FFN se aplica por separado y de manera independiente a cada posición de la secuencia, sin considerar otras posiciones en esa capa particular. Esto difiere de la atención, que sí considera otras posiciones para calcular las puntuaciones de atención y la salida correspondiente."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

I'd love to hear about the setting for your horror game. Feel free to share as many details as you can, like the time period, location, atmosphere, inspirations, and any unique elements or backstory you have in mind. This will help me understand your vision better and possibly provide some feedback or ideas to enhance your project."},{"instruction":"The setting takes place in a big mansion and it always takes place at night. Around 80% of the game, you see some semblance of the early morning. The mansion has a big basement and a big garden.","output":"The setting you've described has classic horror elements with plenty of room for creativity and chilling experiences. Here's some feedback and potential ideas based on your description: 1. **Atmosphere**: A big mansion at night naturally lends itself to a tense and eerie atmosphere. Playing with light and shadows, ambient sounds, and an unpredictable environment can significantly enhance the horror experience. For example, you might include flickering lights, creaking floors, or unsettling echoes; even the wind rustling through the garden can become an element of suspense. 2. **Mansion Design**: When it comes to the layout and design of the mansion, consider how the architecture and interior can contribute to the gameplay and story. Hidden passages, locked rooms, and mysterious artifacts can serve as both obstacles and plot devices. The mansion should feel like a character in itself – with a history and secrets that players gradually uncover. 3. **Time Progression**: Since you mentioned that there is some semblance of early morning towards the end of the game, it can be interesting to play with the transition of time as a storytelling device. Perhaps certain phenomena or ghosts only appear at specific times, or parts of the mansion behave differently as dawn approaches. 4. **Basement and Garden**: Both of these areas provide excellent opportunities to diversify the gameplay within the mansion's setting. The basement could house more disturbing secrets and be harder to navigate, while the garden could offer a brief but deceiving respite from the claustrophobia of the house. Depending on the narrative, these areas could be central to revealing the mansion's past or the reason for its haunting. 5. **Gameplay Mechanics**: Consider what kind of gameplay mechanics will work best in your setting. Will players have to solve puzzles, find keys to unlock new areas, piece together a story from documents and diaries, or hide and sneak past supernatural threats? Engaging mechanics that complement the setting can greatly enhance the immersion and tension in a horror game. 6. **Narrative Elements**: The history of the mansion could be a rich tapestry to explore. Think about its previous inhabitants, the reason it's now abandoned (or is it?), and what sort of events led to it becoming a haunted place. Backstories can be revealed through environmental storytelling, ghostly apparitions, or interactive flashbacks. 7. **Art Style and Visuals**: The visual presentation of the mansion and its garden will set the tone for the game. Whether you choose a realistic, gothic, or more stylized approach, the visuals should contribute to the overall sense of dread. Dynamic changes, such as the decay of rooms or the appearance of supernatural phenomena, can keep players on edge. 8. **Audio Design**: Sound is an essential element of any horror game. The ambiance of the mansion and garden should be rich with audio cues that build tension, suggest unseen threats, and complement the setting. Dissonant music, sudden silence, or inexplicable sounds can all be used to great effect. Remember, the setting is not only a physical space for your game to take place in but also a canvas on which to project the fears and curiosities of players. Exploring themes like isolation, paranoia, madness, or the unknown can breathe life—or eerie undeath—into the walls of your mansion and the corridors of your garden. Best of luck with your horror game; it sounds like a thrilling project!"},{"instruction":"Our two main characters an alchemist named Finn and a young woman named Helena. Finn is from Ireland and Helena's nationality is unknown. Finn has shaggy-styled brown hair and Helena has nice blonde hair. Finn knows how to make ammunition and Helena has a pet wolf that follows her around the game. Finn is sarcastic, easy-going and somewhat of a flirt. Helena is sophisticated, quiet and stern when she has to be like that. They both have their own set of weapons.","output":"The characterization of Finn and Helena adds personal dynamics and depth to your horror game, opening the door for a narrative that intertwines personal stories with the overall mystery of the mansion. Here are some thoughts on how to integrate these characters into your game's setting and possibly some gameplay elements: 1. **Character Backstory**: Consider how Finn and Helena ended up at the mansion and what their motivations are. Maybe Finn's knowledge as an alchemist could be related to the mansion's history or a supernatural occurrence within. Perhaps Helena's past and the mystery of her nationality could be a key plot element that unfolds through the game. 2. **Gameplay Dynamic**: Since each character has unique abilities—Finn with crafting ammunition and Helena with her pet wolf—gameplay could involve switching between characters to solve puzzles, fight enemies, or navigate the environment. Finn's crafting ability could be crucial for survival, while Helena's wolf could be used to track scents, retrieve items, or even assist in combat. 3. **Character Development**: Over the course of the game, you could develop their personalities through interactions with the environment, other characters, or each other. Finn's sarcasm and flirtatiousness could lead to lighter moments that relieve tension or create interesting dialogues with Helena, whose stern sophistication could hide deeper vulnerability or secrets. 4. **Interpersonal Conflict**: The contrasting personalities of the characters open a pathway for interesting conflict and development. Their different approaches to situations, conflict resolution, and problem-solving could become pivotal plot elements that help to expose both characters' depth and weaknesses. 5. **Weapons and Combat**: Each character could have different weapons that complement their styles. Finn might use more improvised or alchemy-based weapons, while Helena may have a more refined or traditional armory. This could also influence the combat system, making it either strategic, based on character strengths and weaknesses, or a blend of styles. 6. **Shared History with the Mansion**: It's possible that Finn and Helena's pasts are somehow connected to the mansion. Finn's alchemical expertise could relate to the history of the house or its previous owners, while Helena's unknown background might have ties to mysterious events at the mansion. To make the most out of your main characters, it's vital to weave their individual stories into the game both narratively and mechanically. Their interactions with each other, with the setting, and with the horrors they face should reflect their unique personalities and backstories. As the game progresses, players can learn to strategize using each character's skills, fostering a connection with them and increasing investment in the narrative outcomes. Layering your horror gameplay with multi-dimensional protagonists like Finn and Helena can result in a richly compelling experience for your players."},{"instruction":"HELENA'S WEAPON SET: MELEE: Cane, Riding Crop and a Wooden Bat. PISTOL: Browning HP MAGNUM: Ruger Super Redhawk SHOTGUN: Winchester M1897 SPECIALS: Doggy Treats, Hairspray with Lighter and a Hunting Rifle.","output":"A diverse weapon set for Helena encapsulates her character as someone who is sophisticated yet capable of defending herself in dire circumstances. Her set suggests a blend of elegance and pragmatism—evidenced by weapons like a cane and riding crop—alongside more traditional firepower. Here's a brief rundown of how her weapons could contribute to gameplay mechanics: 1. **Melee Weapons**: - **Cane**: Can serve as both a fashionable accessory and a bludgeoning tool with medium reach. Could potentially hide a blade or other secrets. - **Riding Crop**: Quick, light attacks with short reach, ideal for stunning or deterring enemies briefly. - **Wooden Bat**: Stronger, heavier attacks that could knock back or incapacitate enemies for a longer time. 2. **Firearms**: - **Browning HP (Pistol)**: A reliable sidearm with a good balance of firepower and ammunition capacity, perfect for quicker, smaller enemies. - **Ruger Super Redhawk (Magnum)**: High stopping power, ideal for tougher foes or boss-type enemies, but with limited ammunition. - **Winchester M1897 (Shotgun)**: Excellent for crowd control or close encounters, giving her the ability to hit multiple targets or cause significant damage at close range. 3. **Special Items**: - **Doggy Treats**: These could serve multiple purposes such as replenishing her wolf's health, improving its performance in combat or solving certain puzzles where the wolf must perform a task. - **Hairspray with Lighter**: A makeshift flamethrower for short bursts, useful for temporarily stunning enemies or lighting up dark areas. - **Hunting Rifle**: Long-range precision, ideal for taking out threats from a distance or targeting specific weak points on enemies. For each weapon in Helena's arsenal, consider how it functions both in combat and in puzzle-solving or environmental interaction within the game. To enhance the player experience, you could implement a learning curve, with Helena becoming more proficient with her weapons as the game progresses. Additionally, think about how ammo scarcity might affect gameplay, encouraging players to conserve ammunition and use melee weapons or special items creatively. Players could have the option to upgrade or modify her weapons over time, lending to a sense of progression and increasing power. Helena’s relationship with her wolf companion is another intriguing aspect. The pet wolf could be integral to her tactical approach in both offensive and defensive scenarios. Players might have to strategize how best to utilize the wolf’s abilities in concert with Helena’s combat skills. Overall, your approach to Helena's weapons and abilities offers potential for engaging and varied gameplay that reflects her character traits, providing players with multiple ways to interact with the game environment and overcome challenges."},{"instruction":"FINN'S WEAPON SET: MELEE: Letter Opener, Axe and a Saber. PISTOL: Mauser C96 Magnum: Webley MKVI SHOTGUN: Double-Barreled Hunting Shotgun SPECIALS: Glass bottles filled with ultra-low liquid nitrogen, glass bottles with acid and TNT bundles.","output":"Finn's weapon set presents him as a resourceful individual who combines both traditional and alchemical expertise to face the threats within the game. His selection of weapons indicates a mix of finesse, brute force, and experimental tactics. Let’s explore how these could be incorporated into the gameplay: 1. **Melee Weapons**: - **Letter Opener**: Quick and stealthy with limited damage—good for rapid, consecutive strikes or possibly for precise actions within environmental puzzles. - **Axe**: Powerful swings capable of dealing significant damage or breaking through obstacles. This could slow Finn down due to weight but deal high damage. - **Saber**: A weapon suggesting a background of training, offering a balance between speed and power, possibly allowing for deft parries and counterattacks. 2. **Firearms**: - **Mauser C96 (Pistol)**: An iconic semi-automatic pistol, it could feature a faster fire rate than Helena’s Browning HP but with a smaller magazine. - **Webley MKVI (Magnum)**: A revolver with historical prestige, offering powerful shots that could be less frequent but potentially more damaging than Helena’s Ruger. - **Double-Barreled Hunting Shotgun**: A weapon with short-range but devastating power, likely with a slower reload time, rewarding precise timing and close-quarters combat. 3. **Special Items**: - **Glass Bottles filled with ultra-low Liquid Nitrogen**: These could serve as throwable items that freeze or slow down enemies on impact. They might also be used to solve environmental puzzles, such as freezing mechanisms or temporarily reinforcing weak structures. - **Glass Bottles with Acid**: Another throwable that could damage enemies over time or be used to dissolve certain materials, unlock pathways, or reveal hidden items within the environment. - **TNT Bundles**: High-risk, high-reward explosives that can clear groups of enemies, destroy barricades, or alter the environment in significant ways. Players would need to use them judiciously. Given Finn's personality traits and his alchemist background, his use of experimental specials adds a distinct and strategic layer to his gameplay. It also complements the historical and traditional feel of his melee and firearm options, showcasing his versatility and ingenuity. As with Helena, consider progression systems for Finn as well. His understanding of alchemy could lead to crafting new items or upgrading his existing arsenal, possibly even teaching Helena to use some of his concoctions, thereby fostering a cooperative dynamic. The disparity in weapon styles between Finn and Helena allows players to choose an approach that aligns with their preferred playstyle, adding replayability and strategic depth. By having specialized weapons and items, each character can also have unique interactions with the mansion's environment and the challenges it presents. Managing ammunition and special item resources will be a key aspect of the gameplay, as Finn seems to lean towards a more experimental and potentially volatile approach, which can add elements of risk management and creativity to combat scenarios. The narrative could be enriched by Finn's alchemical knowledge and skills coming into play not only for solving puzzles and defeating enemies but also for uncovering the mansion’s mysteries and his personal connection to it."},{"instruction":"как работает pd.get_dummies()","output":"\`pd.get_dummies()\` — это функция из библиотеки pandas в языке программирования Python. Она используется для преобразования категориальных данных в числовые путем техники \\"one-hot encoding\\". Категориальные данные — это тип данных, который может принимать ограниченное число возможных значений. Примеры включают пол (мужчина/женщина), размер одежды (S/M/L/XL) или города (Москва/Санкт-Петербург/Новосибирск). One-hot encoding — это процесс преобразования категориальных переменных в форму, которая может быть предоставлена машинному обучению, где каждое возможное значение категориальной переменной представляется отдельной колонкой с двоичным значением 0 или 1. Как работает pd.get_dummies(): 1. Выбираются одна или несколько категориальных переменных для обработки. 2. Для каждой уникальной категории создается новая колонка в DataFrame. 3. Если элемент принадлежит к категории, соответствующий ему столбец заполняется 1, а все остальные столбцы категории заполняются 0. Пример использования pd.get_dummies(): \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Создаем пример DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame({ 'color': ['red', 'blue', 'red', 'green'], 'size': ['S', 'M', 'L', 'XL'] }) # Применяем get_dummies к DataFrame df_with_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df) print(df_with_dummies) \`\`\` Результат будет следующим: \`\`\` color_blue color_green color_red size_L size_M size_S size_XL 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 \`\`\` Здесь созданы двоичные колонки для каждого значения переменной 'color' и 'size'. Оригинальные колонки были удалены и заменены на колонки 'one-hot encoded'. Это удобно для многих алгоритмов машинного обучения, которые требуют численного ввода и не могут обрабатывать категориальные данные напрямую."},{"instruction":"необходимо с помощью это функции получить из таблицы(большой, не только гендеры) гендеры","output":"Для того чтобы использовать функцию \`pd.get_dummies()\` для преобразования столбца с гендерами (пол) в числовые данные в большой таблице, вам нужно указать, по какому конкретному столбцу вы хотите выполнить преобразование. Предположим, у вас есть столбец 'gender' в вашем DataFrame \`df\`, и вы хотите преобразовать его значения в числовые с помощью one-hot encoding. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Пусть df - это ваш большой DataFrame с множеством колонок и среди них есть колонка 'gender'. # Применяем get_dummies только к колонке 'gender' gender_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['gender'], prefix='gender') # Теперь объединим исходный DataFrame с новыми колонками, полученными из get_dummies df = pd.concat([df.drop('gender', axis=1), gender_dummies], axis=1) \`\`\` В результате все возможные значения столбца 'gender' будут преобразованы в отдельные колонки с префиксом 'gender_', и каждая строка будет иметь 1 в соответствующей колонке, если значение гендера совпадает с названием колонки, и 0 в противном случае. Если гендеры представлены, например, как 'male' и 'female', то результатом выполнения кода будет добавление в исходный DataFrame двух новых колонок: 'gender_male' и 'gender_female' с соответствующими двоичными индикаторами. После этого исходная колонка 'gender' будет удалена из DataFrame, так как она больше не нужна и заменена на числовые колонки, которые можно использовать в анализе данных и машинном обучении."},{"instruction":"не показывает строки , где значения пропущены","output":"Если некоторые значения в столбце с гендерами пропущены (т.е., они могут быть представлены как \`NaN\` в pandas DataFrame), и вы хотите, чтобы \`pd.get_dummies()\` все равно отобразила эти строки с пропущенными значениями, вы можете использовать параметр \`dummy_na=True\`. Этот параметр создает дополнительную колонку, которая указывает на строки с пропущенными значениями. Пример использования \`dummy_na=True\`: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Пусть df - это ваш DataFrame и в нем есть колонка 'gender' с пропущенными значениями. # Применяем get_dummies к колонке 'gender', создавая дополнительную колонку для NaN gender_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df['gender'], prefix='gender', dummy_na=True) # Объединяем исходный DataFrame с новыми колонками df = pd.concat([df.drop('gender', axis=1), gender_dummies], axis=1) \`\`\` Если 'gender' содержит значения 'male', 'female' и NaN, то результат будет следующим: - 'gender_male' будет 1 для строк, где gender равен 'male', и 0 иначе. - 'gender_female' будет 1 для строк, где gender равен 'female', и 0 иначе. - 'gender_nan' будет 1 для строк, где значение в столбце 'gender' пропущено (NaN), и 0 иначе. Таким образом, вы не потеряете строки с пропущенными данными, и они будут включены в результат с соответствующим индикатором пропуска."},{"instruction":"а как сделать , чтобы показывались чиcла , а не True и false","output":"Функция pd.get_dummies() по умолчанию возвращает DataFrame с 1 и 0, где 1 означает True (значение присутствует), а 0 означает False (значение отсутствует). Если вы видите True и False вместо чисел, возможно, это вызвано тем, как вы визуализируете или печатаете данные, либо какими-то операциями, которые были выполнены после вызова pd.get_dummies(). Однако, если вы хотите преобразовать булевы значения True и False в числовые 1 и 0, вы можете использовать метод .astype(int) в pandas. Давайте рассмотрим пример: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Предположим, у нас есть DataFrame с булевыми значениями df_bool = pd.DataFrame({'gender_male': [True, False, True, False], 'gender_female': [False, True, False, True]}) # Преобразуем булевы значения в числовые (1 и 0) df_int = df_bool.astype(int) print(df_int) \`\`\` Результат будет выглядеть так: \`\`\` gender_male gender_female 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 3 0 1 \`\`\` Вызов \`astype\` гарантирует, что значения в DataFrame будут представлены в виде чисел. Тем не менее, pd.get_dummies() и так возвращает числовые значения, и использование astype в этом контексте не требуется, если вы непосредственно работаете с результатом pd.get_dummies()."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…what on Earth happened in here?” Yuri: “I’m not quite sure myself, Monika.

В Excel вы можете создать матрицу с изменяемыми строками и столбцами, используя следующие шаги: 1. **Открытие нового листа Excel**: Запустите программу Microsoft Excel и откройте новый пустой документ. 2. **Ввод размеров матрицы**: Определите, сколько строк и столбцов вы хотите использовать в своей матрице. Если вы хотите, чтобы размеры были изменяемыми, вы можете зарегистрировать эти значения в отдельных ячейках. Например, введите количество строк в ячейку A1 и количество столбцов в ячейку B1. 3. **Создание изменяемой матрицы**: - Выделите область на вашем листе, где будет располагаться матрица, учитывая количество строк и столбцов, которое вы заранее определили. - Можете использовать Excel формулы, чтобы автоматически обновлять содержимое в матрице при изменении количества строк и столбцов. Например, для заполнения матрицы случайными числами используйте формулу \`=IF(AND(ROW() <= A1, COLUMN() <= B1), RAND(), \\"\\")\`. Эта формула будет вставлять случайное число только если номер текущей строки меньше или равен значению в A1 и номер текущей колонки меньше или равен значению в B1. 4. **Изменение размера матрицы**: - Для изменения размеров вашей матрицы просто измените значения в ячейках A1 и B1. Если вы использовали формулу, предложенную выше, содержимое матрицы будет автоматически обновлено в соответствии с новыми значениями. - Если вам нужна динамическая настройка диапазона, используйте функцию Excel ТАБЛИЦА, которая позволяет изменять размеры выделенной области динамически через меню \\"Инструменты таблиц\\" на ленте Excel. 5. **Оформление**: По желанию вы можете отформатировать ячейки, используя вкладку \\"Главная\\" и инструменты форматирования (цвет заливки, границы, формат чисел и так далее). 6. **Автоматизация**: Для дополнительной автоматизации вы можете использовать макросы VBA. Напишите код макроса VBA, который будет автоматически адаптировать размер вашей матрицы при изменении определенных параметров. 7. **Сохранение листа**: Не забудьте сохранить ваш документ Excel после внесения всех изменений. Имейте в виду, что формулы и функциональность Excel могут меняться в зависимости от версии программы, поэтому инструкции могут немного отличаться, если вы используете версию, отличную от самой последней на момент знания отсечки (2023 год)."},{"instruction":"тогда мне нужна формула для такой матрицы: a(i,j)=(𝑗^2+3,2∙𝑖)^(3/2), если i<=2 a(i,j)=0,17∙𝑖+√(0,17∙𝑖+𝑗), если i<2","output":"Вы указали два условия для \`i\`, но для второго у вас есть небольшая опечатка, так как условия перекрываются: \\"если i <= 2\\" и \\"если i < 2\\". В таком случае, второе условие вообще не будет работать, так как \\"если i < 2\\" также удовлетворяет первому условию \\"если i <= 2\\". Давайте предположим, что второе условие действительно должно быть \\"если i > 2\\". Итак, формула для Excel, в которой мы должны учитывать два условия для элемента матрицы \`a(i,j)\`, будет следующей: \`\`\`excel =IF(ROW()<=2, (POWER(COLUMN()^2 + 3.2*ROW(), 3/2)), IF(ROW()>2, 0.17*ROW() + SQRT(0.17*ROW() + COLUMN()), \\"\\")) \`\`\` Однако если предположить, что второе условие действует, когда \`i > 2\`, то формула будет следующей: \`\`\`excel =IF(ROW()<=2, (POWER(COLUMN()^2 + 3.2*ROW(), 3/2)), 0.17*ROW() + SQRT(0.17*ROW() + COLUMN())) \`\`\` Вот как использовать эту формулу для создания матрицы: 1. Выберите верхнюю левую ячейку, в которой будет начинаться ваша матрица. 2. Вставьте одну из формул выше в формульную строку. 3. Нажмите Enter, чтобы выполнить формулу. 4. Для заполнения остальных ячеек, выделите первую ячейку с формулой, затем наведите курсор на нижний правый угол данной ячейки, пока курсор не превратится в черный крестик. 5. Зажмите левую кнопку мыши и перетащите курсор через необходимое количество строк и столбцов для вашей матрицы. Excel применит формулу для каждой ячейки, автоматически подставляя правильные значения для \`ROW()\` и \`COLUMN()\`. Это создаст изменяемую матрицу на базе указанных условий."},{"instruction":"тогда мне нужна формула для такой матрицы: a(i,j)=(𝑗^2+3,2∙𝑖)^(3/2), если i>=2 a(i,j)=0,17∙𝑖+√(0,17∙𝑖+𝑗), если i<2","output":"Теперь у вас есть условие, где i может быть меньше 2 и больше либо равно 2. Поскольку в Excel индексы начинаются с 1, условие i < 2 будет истинным только когда i = 1. Все остальные значения для i будут соответствовать первому условию. Также обратите внимание, что для функций Excel разделителем аргументов является точка с запятой в некоторых локализациях и запятая в других. В моем объяснении я буду использовать запятую в качестве разделителя. Давайте создадим формулу для элемента матрицы a(i,j): \`\`\`excel =IF(ROW() >= 2, (COLUMN()^2 + 3.2 * ROW())^(3/2), 0.17 * ROW() + SQRT(0.17 * ROW() + COLUMN())) \`\`\` Теперь пошагово вставим эту формулу в Excel: 1. Выберите верхнюю левую ячейку, где начнётся ваша матрица. 2. Вставьте вышеуказанную формулу в строку формул. 3. Нажмите Enter, чтобы выполнить формулу. 4. Выделите ячейку с формулой. Затем наведите курсор на маленький квадрат в нижнем правом углу этой ячейки (он называется \\"ручкой автозаполнения\\"). 5. Потяните \\"ручку автозаполнения\\" на нужное количество строк и столбцов для создания матрицы. Excel применит формулу к каждой ячейке в диапазоне, обновляя функции ROW() и COLUMN() для каждой ячейки соответственно. На заметку, если ваша локализация Excel требует использование точки с запятой в качестве разделителя в формулах, убедитесь, что вы используете их вместо запятых."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…what on Earth happened in here?” Yuri: “I’m not quite sure myself, Monika.

The literature on culinary tourism (e.g., Ellis, Park, Kim, & Yeoman, 2018; Henderson, 2009; Long, 2004) that explored the relationship between tourism and food has focused on the way tourists experience destinations and thus cultures through food activities. Most of these works exam- ined the feelings and memories and suggested that positive food experiences make tourists perceive their holidays special and there- fore link their food experience with the attractiveness of the tour- ism destination (e.g., Ghanem, 2019; Sthapit, 2017; Stone & Migacz, 2016; Stone, Soulard, Migacz, & Wolf, 2018). However, while studies show that enjoying unique and memorable food expe- riences when traveling can enhance the authenticity of the destina- tion and improve the well-being of tourists, these studies did not explore the role of restaurants and chefs, especially in the luxury gastronomy sector, in developing attractive tourism activities and thus promoting the destination for both local and international tourists. Examining the role of chefs in luxury gastronomy, which is a growing field of food tourism (Barrère, Bonnard, & Chossat, 2014), is an important area of research that can inform food tourism scholars about new techniques and marketing activities to promote destina- tions. For instance, chefs such as the French Alain Ducasse or the British Gordon Ramsey are nowadays attracting gastronomic travelers mainly interested in unique and creative luxury food experiences (Batat, 2020) by launching luxury gastronomic restaurants in various big cities such as Paris, Tokyo, London, Hong Kong, Las Vegas, or New York (Barrère et al., 2014). Thus, luxury gastronomy is a booming market and an integral part of both cultural and food tourism activities attracting not only business travelers and elites but also many tourists who discovered luxury cuisine through culinary programs on televi- sion (Andrieu & Batat, 2019; Batat, 2020). Then, they started to develop an interest in visiting destination according to the Michelin Guide ranking, which has increased tourist frequentation by 25% (Barrère, Bonnard, & Chossat, 2009), with its 14,000 Michelin-starred restaurants in more than 30 countries (Michelin Guide, 2020). The Michelin Guide is then considered as a strong competitive advantage for both rural and urban destinations, which ca be used in marketing strategies to attract worldwide tourists who seek to live a unique lux- ury gastronomic experience offered by a renowned Michelin- starred chef. Int J Tourism Res. 2020;1–14. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jtr © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd 1 2 BATAT Although prior works have explored the role of the food experi- ence in the way tourists experience the destination (e.g., Johns & Kivela, 2001; Kivela & Chu, 2001; Taheri, Jafari, & Okumus, 2017; Wolf, 2002), to our knowledge, this is the first research to examine the role of luxury gastronomy in culinary tourism through an ethno- graphic exploration of Michelin-starred restaurants. Furthermore, while the relationship between gastronomy and tourism is acknowl- edged in the anthropology of food and social sciences literature (Bessière, 1998), very few studies exist in the hospitality and tourism literature. This is significant in that, to date, research on gastronomy and food tourism has focused principally on the tourist's/traveler's perspective (e.g., Kivela & Crotts, 2006; Staiff & Bushell, 2013) with- out investigating the managerial perspective through the role of Michelin-starred chefs in food tourism activities. The objectives of this research are twofold: (a) understand the connection between luxury gastronomy and tourism; and (b) define from a managerial perspective (Michelin-starred restaurants) the role of luxury gastronomy in enhancing the attractiveness of tourism desti- nations. This research addresses the role of luxury gastronomy as change-makers and advocates of tourism activities in both rural and urban areas. We also examine the forms of initiatives led by luxury restaurants that contribute to enhancing the attractiveness of the des- tination, retaining, and attracting domestic and international tourists. Although it is acknowledged that food tourism plays a major role in promoting a destination by emphasizing its local food and identity, prior research does not provide insights about the types of local food (e.g., popular, regional, traditional, luxury gastronomy) and their impact on destination branding, attractiveness, and image (Batat, 2020; Peng, Chen, & Hung, 2019; Barrère et al., 2014, 2009). This gap in the litera- ture needs to be addressed because examining the role of different types of food experiences, whether they are regional or luxury in developing the attractiveness of a destination, may help improve the image of the tourism destination and implement effective marketing strategy actions. 1.1 | Culinary tourism as a source of attraction in tourist destinations Culinary tourism is a multidimensional concept. It goes beyond the simple idea of eating different foods. It includes the entire process ranging from food production and preparation to food consumption (Long, 2004). Culinary tourism has multiple definitions but is com- monly defined as the individual's quest for distinctive, unforgettable, and authentic food experiences (Ellis et al., 2018; Henderson, 2009). Long (2004) defines culinary tourism as a process initiated by individ- uals to discover and explore the culture and the history of a location through its food traditions and events related to creating memorable experiences. For Hall and Mitchell (2001), culinary tourism refers to the “visita- tion to primary and secondary food producers, food festivals, restau- rants and specific locations for which food and tasting and/or experiencing the attributes of a specialist food production region are the primary motivating factors for travel” (p. 308). Some authors emphasize the cultural dimension of culinary tourism as travelers do also experience and learn about new cultures by tasting local foods and drinks (e.g., Corigliano, 2002; Richards, 1996). Therefore, culinary tourism involves tourists' integration of a new culture or a place by experiencing the local food culture. However, some authors argue that tourists have different motivations and attitudes toward food tourism activities (e.g., Hall, 2006; Hall & Mitchell, 2005). Hall and Mitchell (2005) state that there are three main profiles of culinary tourists that can be defined according to their interest in food: (a) occasional culinary tourists who can be involved in culinary food activities. However, these activities are not their principal motivation, (b) culinary tourists who focus on authenticity and embeddedness in the local culture and will select a destination based on both culinary and cultural aspects it represents, and (c) gourmet tourists who will organize their travel based on the selection of a limited number of internationally renowned restaurants and places. Gourmet tourists are different from culinary tourists as their prin- cipal motivation is not the search for authenticity as that of experienc- ing unique and exclusive gastronomic experiences. Therefore, the gourmet tourist is in line with our definition of culinary tourism as activities around the production of highly creative and exceptional food and drink experiences covering the four stages identified by Arnould, Price, and Zinkhang (2002): anticipated experience (activity planning), buying experience (of a local product), actual experience (during the meal), and remembered (visiting local farms and souvenirs). Culinary tourism is also about creating social bonds and the quest for connections between individuals around shared values, social norms, and codes that shape experiences (Batat et al., 2019) where tourists are viewed as experiential actors seeking meanings through their pursuit for authenticity and uniqueness (Holbrook & Hirschman, 1982). By following cooking classes, discovering local farmers' markets, the culinary tourists become coactors of their own experiences and thus enhance the pleasure engendered by the lived experience through activities that surround food and which meet the requirements of sustainable tourism (Sims, 2009). However, although culinary tourism has solid connections with destination attractiveness and local food culture promotion, it is a field that remains under- studied. Indeed, not all the areas and types of food tourism have been examined by researchers—for example, the role of luxury gastronomy that is highly symbolic and experiential consumption domain in food tourism. 1.2 | Experiential perspective on luxury consumption Luxury consumption as a research topic has been the focus among many scholars in the fields of business, marketing, and economy in the last 20 years (Lipovetsky & Roux, 2003). Prior studies on the topic have examined luxury consumption in relation to branding (Kapferer, 2008; Okonkwo, 2009), legitimacy (Chaudhuri, 1998), counterfeit and luxury brand purchase (e.g., Sharma & Chan, 2011; BATAT 3 Tom, Garibaldi, Zeng, & Pilcher, 1998), the impact of luxury consump- tion on societal well-being (Batat, 2017; Berry, 1994), exclusiveness (Atwal & Williams, 2009; Hennings, Wiedmann, & Klarmann, 2012), ritualization (Grigorian & Peterson, 2014), digital luxury (Batat, 2019b; Kretz & de Valck, 2010; Okonkwo, 2010), and sustainable luxury (Athwal, Wells, Carrigan, & Henninger, 2019). Although luxury is a growing field of research, most of the existing works exclusively exam- ine luxury goods from a managerial perspective, disregarding services and experiences (Batat, 2019a). According to Atwal and Williams (2009), lux- ury is not merely about products and brands; it is primarily about a lived unusual experience that encompasses various elements, as stated by Batat: “more than in any other sector, luxury consumption is a response to a search for emotions, pleasure, uniqueness, consideration, and greatest services. The luxury consumer wants to live experiences—not just buy luxury products or services” (2019a, p. vii). While research acknowledges the adoption of the experiential perspective in different business sectors (Addis & Holbrook, 2019; Eckhardt, Belk, & Wilson, 2014; Holbrook & Hirschman, 1982; Joy & Sherry, 2003; Williams & Atwal, 2013), luxury consumption as an experience remains understudied and has received rather limited attention. There is, however, an exception should be noted in the works of Atwal and Williams (2009) who offered a conceptual frame- work that considers the experiential perspective and the recent works by Batat (2019a, 2019b) who provides a holistic definition of luxury as: “a personal experience that offers a major focus on the intangible dimensions of luxury beyond the functional aspects and incorporates symbolic, social, ideological, subjective, and emotional dimensions” (Batat, 2019b, p. 7). Furthermore, Batat (2019a) distinguishes between three levels of experiential luxury: low, moderate, and high. Based on this classification, Batat suggests that luxury hospitality, especially the luxury gastronomy such as experiencing a Michelin- starred restaurant is a highly experiential domain where “experience is a central component of the offer” (Batat, 2019a, p. 24). Following this logic, we can argue that the consumer has an active role within his/her luxury consumption and his/her lived experience can be influenced by his/her interactions with luxury brands, products as well as other social actors (e.g., service providers, other customers) and environmental elements (e.g., sound, design, location, atmosphere). Therefore, it is worthwhile examining further experiential settings to reveal all the behaviors, meanings, and emotional aspects that can affect the lived luxury experience. Thus, our research supports Athwal et al.'s (2019) call for more research exploring the luxury service industry, especially luxury food restaurants to develop a better understanding of how luxury gastron- omy can serve as a core differentiator within the field of culinary tour- ism and how does it contribute to enrich existing studies related to destination promotion in food tourism. In previous literature, Barrère et al. (2009) concur that luxury gastronomy is an attractive activity for luxury tourism and several market actors (e.g., chefs, luxury groups, public, and local actors) can be interested in the promotion of luxury gastronomy since it generates positive effects on the destination image, and thus enhances its attractiveness among domestic and international tourists. 1.3 | Luxury gastronomy: An emerging field of research in culinary tourism The term “gastronomy” comes from the Greek “gastronomia,” mean- ing “the art of regulating the stomach” or “the art of good food” (Batat & De Kerviler, 2020). The French gastronomist Brillat-Sava- rin (1825) was the first who conceptualized gastronomy as the sys- tematic understanding of all that relates to individuals, as they eat. Thus, gastronomy aims to preserve humankind through the finest likely food. In line with the idea of gastronomy as the art of good food, Batat et al. (2019) state that if food is a basic need, gastronomy is an endless experiential pursuit (Batat et al., 2019), a continuous search for highest quality, a hedonistic desire, a pleasure, a set of knowledge, and a culture. Therefore, gastronomy more largely incorporates the cultural heritage of a country (Staiff & Bushell, 2013) to a superior level than eating does. Few cultures have pushed gastronomy to the level of the sophistication reached by the French (Barrère et al., 2009; De Kerviler, 2019). In France, gastronomy constitutes a “heritage” proudly claimed by all individuals who belong to the French food culture, regardless of their social position. Accordingly, the French gastronomy and its Michelin-starred restaurants are frequently perceived abroad as an elite art closely related to luxury (Clark, 1975) and the chefs as consid- ered as designers (Batat & De Kerviler, 2020)—most of these chefs are influenced by creative designers in the luxury field. Similar to a luxury brand, a luxury gastronomic restaurant should have a designer who should be a distinguished chef with Michelin stars. He or she should have a story to tell through his or her creative and personal cuisine to immerse guests within a unique and highly sensorial luxury dining experience. Thus, luxury gastronomy represents a real competi- tive advantage that helps to retain and attracting local and interna- tional visitors and to make them revisit the destination to live a unique and highly creative food experience delivered by a renowned Michelin-starred chef. Regarding the culinary tourism literature, a recent research by Rach~ao, Breda, Fernandes, and Joukes (2019) examined different con- cepts that connect food to tourism. Rach~ao et al. (2019) state that while culinary tourism emerges mainly in North American publications, in Asia-Pacific publications (e.g., Australia and New Zealand), most of the scholars tend to use food tourism instead. In the European con- text, it is the terminology of gastronomy tourism that is often used by researchers in studies linking food to tourism. Since our research is grounded in the European context, the term gastronomy will be used throughout this paper to refer to food tourism. In the literature, the relationship between gastronomy and tourism has been examined by scholars from different perspectives (De Jong et al., 2018; Ellis et al., 2018; Lee & Scott, 2015). In conducting a systematic literature review, Rach~ao et al. (2019) reveal that food as an asset can contribute to destination manage- ment by identifying two perspectives: a rural perspective through the development of slow food strategies (e.g., food tours, farms), and an urban perspective by innovating and reengineering traditional spaces. Besides, Henderson (2009) summarized food tourism research into 4 BATAT four main topics: the effect of food on tourist' attitudes and behaviors toward a destination (Levitt, Zhang, DiPietro, & Meng, 2019), food as a tourist product and the role of food tours in promoting tourism des- tination (Ellis et al., 2018), marketing destination through food offer- ings (Silkes, Liping, & Xinran, 2013), and strategies focusing on food tourism to advance destination competitiveness (Kivela & Crotts, 2005). Additionally, in their research, De Jong et al. (2018) sug- gest that the path of culinary tourism research is described by the fields of tourism, leisure, and hospitality and should incorporate geog- raphy, planning, and development in destination management. Like- wise, De Jong and colleagues proposed three main ways to contribute to gastronomy tourism research by considering “increased dialogue across subject areas, development of critical and theoretical approaches, and greater engagement with sustainability debates” (2018, p. 131). In line with De Jong et al.'s recommendations, prior research by McKercher, Okumus, and Okumus (2008) pointed out the myopic approach in food tourism research and called for further stud- ies following a more holistic perspective to examine food tourism by focusing on food experiences within different cultural settings. Simi- larly, Okumus et al. (2007) compared how two different destinations Hong Kong and Turkey use food in their marketing activities. Their findings suggest that the use of food in promoting tourism destination requires expertise and knowledge that are vital not only in marketing strategies but also in learning more about gastronomies and the socio- cultural profiles of potential tourists. Furthermore, recent works have focused on the relationship between the projected and perceived image of the restaurant on tourists' perceptions. From the restaurant's perspective, Daries, Cristobal-Fransi, Ferrer-Rosell, and Marine- Roig (2018) show that the image projected by high-end restaurants through a mature website and relevant social media content has a positive impact on tourists' perceptions of the restaurant. Further- more, in their research, Marine-Roig, Ferrer-Rosell, Daries, and Cristobal-Fransi (2019) show that, while the gastronomic image of the destination is positive overall, the local and regional gastronomy rep- resentative of the community's socio-cultural identity is neither the most attractive nor the best appreciated in tourists' comments. Con- sidering a consumer perspective, Chang and Mak (2018) identified seven main attributes, namely, attractiveness, flavor profile, familiarity, cooking method and ingredients, distinctiveness, convenience and price, and health and safety that can influence positively or negatively the gastronomic image perceived by tourists. Therefore, although sev- eral studies have explored culinary tourism and the relationship between tourist and food from different disciplinary, conceptual, and methodological perspectives, there is a lack of research focusing on the role of different types of food experience offerings such as luxury gastronomic ones in developing the attractiveness of both rural and urban destinations. While luxury gastronomy is a growing food tour- ism field, which induces a real demand for gastronomic tourism (Barrère et al., 2009), most of the existing works only focus on tourism and gastronomy or food without considering the luxury gastronomy as a distinct field to explore. Indeed, luxury gastronomy is attracting further tourists thanks to television culinary shows featuring Michelin-starred chefs and food magazines (Batat, 2020). These tourists are seeking cultural and innovative food experiences and beyond all, they are interested in living a unique experience through exploring the Michelin-starred chefs' creative cuisine and culinary uni- verse (Batat, 2020). Thus, the lived luxury gastronomic plays a strong role in shaping the perceptions and attitudes of tourists toward the tourismdestination. Due to the highly competitive context and the increased number of luxury gastronomic restaurants and the lack of a deep understand- ing of the characteristics of these highly experiential luxury restau- rants and their cultural and symbolic dimensions, there is an obvious need for research on this topic to answer the growing interests on rural and urban development and on the forms of luxury restaurants' activities to enhance the attractiveness of the destination by retaining and appealing to gourmet tourists. 2 | METHODS Given the exploratory nature of our research question, this study was underpinned by an ethnographic approach (Palmer, 2001; Wolcott, 1994) and used qualitative mixed-method research (Harrison, 2013; Harrison & Reilly, 2011). This methodology is suitable for our research objectives as the field of luxury food tourism is emergent due to a noticeable dearth of prior studies on the role of luxury gastronomy in promoting tourism destinations. Figure 1 presents the methodological approach we followed to col- lect the data. To examine the role of luxury gastronomic restaurants in tourism destination promotion, we conducted an ethnographic study within 24 French Michelin-starred restaurants over the course of 5 years (2014–2018) to develop an initial understanding of how luxury gas- tronomic restaurants can become promoters of food tourism destina- tions. Ethnography is used to reveal, understand, and examine the luxury restaurants' perspective shaped by both socio-cultural and eco- nomic environments in which they operate. The ethnography in luxury gastronomic restaurants requires immersive and longitudinal methods for discovering meaning in, rather than imposing meaning on (Harrison, 2013), of the role of Michelin-starred restaurants in food tourism. Ethnography allowed us to access the universe of the luxury gastronomy sector imbued with meanings that are otherwise implicit and made in daily-routinized restaurants' practices. This will advance our understanding of the contributions of an understudied sector, namely luxury gastronomy, in engaging with local communities to which they belong as well as in promoting and enhancing the attrac- tiveness of tourism destinations. In so doing, a mixed-method approach was applied by combining qualitative techniques that used (a) on-site participant and nonparticipant observations, (b) informal interviews with chefs, and (c) food luxury forums and blogs to inter- pret socially constructed data. This approach allows the researcher to adopt an emic (actor-centric), rather than an etic (observer-centric) standpoint of the significances required to tackle the research ques- tions. According to the Michelin Guide (2020), there are 628 Michelin-starred restaurants in France. We used a purposeful BATAT 5 F I G U R E 1 Qualitative mixed-method approach for data collection T A B L E 1 Brief description of the luxury gastronomic restaurants Restaurant Restaurant Georges blanc Restaurant Paul Bocuse Maison Troisgros Maison pic Le cinq Alain Ducasse Le petit Nice Passedat Lassausaie guy La Mère brazier Takao Takano Auberge de L'Ile Barbe Têtedoie Le Neuvième art La dame de pic Les Terrases de Lyon PraiRial Cour des loges Jérémy Galvan Le gourmet de Séze Pierre Orsi Au 14 février Neige d'été Restaurant du Palais royal Garopapilles Michelin stars 3*** 3*** 3*** 3*** 3*** 3*** 3*** 2** 2** 2** 2** 2** 2** 1* 1* 1* 1* 1* 1* 1* 1* 1* 1* 1* Chef Georges blanc Paul Bocuse Michel Troisgros Anne-Sophie pic Christian Le Squer Alain Ducasse Gérald Passedat Lassausaie guy Mathieu Vianney Takao Takano Jean-Christophe Ansanay-Alex Christian Têtedoie Christophe Roure Anne-Sophie pic David Delsart Gaëtan Gentil Anthony bonnet Jérémy Galvan Bernard Mariller Pierre Orsi Tsuyoshi ARAI Hideki NISHI Philip Chronopoulos Tanguy Laviale City Vonnas Collonges Roanne Valence Paris Paris Marseille Lyon Lyon Lyon Lyon Lyon Lyon Paris Lyon Lyon Lyon Lyon Lyon Lyon Lyon Paris Paris Bordeaux sampling technique in the sense of Suri (2011) to select a spectrum of 24 restaurants according to their aptitude to offer the researcher in- depth understanding (Patton, 2002) and relevant data produced through a longitudinal approach (Dodds, Bulmer, & Murphy, 2018). To generate sufficiently strong and varied insights, the sample included balanced heterogeneous types of Michelin-starred restaurants follow- ing four key criteria: (a) restaurants' ranking in the Michelin Guide one-, two-, and three-stars, (b) location (rural and urban areas) in France, (c) the kind of cuisine (traditional French and modern cosmo- politan), and (d) recent and established restaurants. Table 1 provides a brief description of the luxury gastronomic restaurants investigated in this study. To collect data, we visited and had dinners and lunches in historic Michelin-starred restaurants (traditional cuisine) as well as modern ones (creative cuisine). This wide variety in terms of ranking, history, cuisine, and the chef's creative identity, and location allowed us to draw valid conclusions about how the luxury gastronomy sector is promoting tourism destinations. The length of each restaurant visit varied between 2 hr (lunches) and 4 hr (dinners). The data were col- lected from various sources. First, on-site participant and nonparticipant observations were conducted during our visits to different restaurants. They were then recorded in chronological notes to help us define the practices of each Michelin-starred restaurant related to the promotion of food tourism 6 BATAT destinations. Regular on-site observations were led by referring to a thematic framework, which comprised a depiction of the location, the relationships with tourism and cultural activities in the area, food tour- ism focus, the market actors involved, the food served, and the res- taurant's atmosphere. An evaluation of the restaurant's role in promoting tourism was made through an inductive assessment of the alignment between the restaurant's relationship to food tourism, the chef's approach, the ingredients used in the cuisine, the community engagement, and the impressions made by the restaurant and its staff. Second, we conducted informal interviews with Michelin-starred chefs to capture from their perspective the way they define their role in promoting food tourism destinations. We used interviews struc- tured around the themes of tourism, engagement, economic develop- ment, tourism destination branding, local producers, and food festivals in relation to the luxury gastronomic sector. Table 2 shows an over- view of the script we followed to conduct the interviews with chefs. Third, we used food luxury forums and blogs as an additional source of data. Website and social media pages of various Michelin- starred restaurants, gastronomy forums, and blogs were consulted and analyzed to obtain data on the food tourism practices in high-end luxury gastronomic restaurants. More than 450 discussions on gas- tronomy forums and blogs were analyzed between December 2013 and November 2018. Blogs and forums were selected by applying five key criteria recommended by Kozinets (2015): the variety of ideas in relation to the topic; forums and blogs should be active; they should combine recent and frequent exchanges among members; they should be interactive; and finally, they should be heterogeneous dynamic by having a critical number of participants. These criteria helped the researcher to evaluate the relevance of each online source of data to be included in the study. The data collected from the three sources were analyzed using intra- and inter-interpretative analysis (Arnould & Wallendorf, 1994) of the chronological observational narratives, informal interview, and online discussions. Forms and practices of luxury gastronomic restau- rants in relationship to food tourism were identified by considering the researcher/observer's subjectivity during the observational phase. As recommended by Spiggle (1994), we followed two steps to analyze and interpret the data collected. A first step where data were dec- onstructed and a second step to reconstruct the results. The intra- and inter-interpretative analysis was followed by employing the observational and verbal framework proposed by Arnould and Wallendorf (1994). The intra-interpretative analysis revealed coding categories associated with the role of Michelin-starred restaurants in promoting food tourism destinations and the activities related to boo- sting their attractiveness. Based on the prior forms identified, we applied an iterative process to compare the new data and the literature to deepen our analysis. The iterative process allowed us to set up the foundations of the conceptual framework by following the four steps rec- ommended by Spiggle (1994): categorization, abstraction, compari- son, and integration. These steps help the researcher to build a solid theoretical framework. In the categorization stage, we classi- fied and labeled units of data, which explain the phenomenon Script overview T A B L E 2 Steps Introductory questions Illustrative questions • Tell us more about you? • How did it start? • What is your career journey? • What is your approach and philosophy? Knowledge about the restaurant • How do you define your cuisine? And what is unique about it? • What do you offer in your restaurant? What is your signature dish? • What was your inspiration? • How do you design a unique luxury food experience? • What do your customers think about your cuisine and the restaurants? Activities related to destination promotion • How do you define your relationship with the destination? • Do you think your restaurant plays a role in promoting the destination and attracting tourists? • What are you trying to achieve in relation to food tourism? • How are you trying to do this? • How do customers and tourists perceive your activities? • How does this differ from the way traditional and popular restaurants are promoting food tourism activities? Concluding questions • What do you see as the next steps in terms of luxury food tourism promotional activities? • What do you see as the key challenges? related to the topic (e.g., activities set by chefs to promote local tourism through food offerings). The abstraction served to order empirically generated data into conceptual constructs by combining specific units of data and broader construct (e.g., creativity of the chefs and luxury gastronomy in the region). In the comparison stage, we explored and analyzed differences and similarities across units of data and categories, which provides guidelines to collect additional data such as the use of the online sources discussions on forums and blogs, additional informal exchanges with Michelin- starred chefs and food professionals to gain insights on the data analysis. Finally, in the integration phase, we built the theoretical framework, which was revealed and constructed through the exhaustive analysis of the data. By following these steps, we sug- gest an advanced conceptual analysis of the forms of food tourism activities implemented by Michelin-starred chefs to enhance desti- nation attractiveness. The findings are presented in the next section using themes identified in the data, along with textual excerpts from our informal interviews with some Michelin-starred chefs to illustrate the emergent themes. BATAT 7 3 | RESULTS Our findings confirm the strong relationship between the luxury gas- tronomy sector and food tourism. Michelin-starred restaurants play a key role as change-makers and advocates of tourism activities in both rural and urban contexts. We identified four major forms of activities implemented by luxury restaurants to enhance the attractiveness of the destination and thus contribute to food tourism: (a) designing unique luxury gastronomic experience offerings, (b) promoting terroir products and rural food tourism, (c) gastronomization of rural destina- tions, and (d) augmenting the media capital of the destination. Table 3 offers a summary of the differences between the four forms revealed by this study and the extant literature on food tourism. It also demon- strates how our findings can extend upon what we already know about culinary tourism and why the luxury gastronomy as a growing food tourism field can help both tourism scholars and practitioners to deepen their knowledge in terms of destination promotion through food tourism. The four forms identified in this study, the type of activities related to each form, the market actors and stakeholders involved, T A B L E 3 Differences between food tourism and luxury gastronomy forms and their role in promoting tourism destinations are presented in the next section. 3.1 | Designing unique luxury gastronomic experience offerings The characteristics of Michelin-starred restaurants' activities related to offering unique luxury gastronomic experiences that contribute to food tourism were examined by focusing on numerous aspects includ- ing functional, sociocultural, symbolic, sensorial, and aesthetic factors of the luxury gastronomic experience. Altogether, Michelin-starred restaurants incorporate these factors in the design of the ultimate lux- ury food experience that can attract actual and new tourists who would visit the destination to live an exclusive gastronomic experience. 3.1.1 | Functional factors The majority of Michelin-starred restaurants we investigated focus on various food aspects to enhance the attractiveness of the tourism destination. The highest quality of the ingredients, the food well- being, the creativity of recipes, the aesthetic of the dishes served, and the staging of the experience in the restaurant all together form the foundations of the luxury gastronomic tourism offering while design- ing unique and attractive food experiences for both domestic and international tourists. Almost Michelin-starred chefs we interviewed state that from a tourist perspective, a Michelin-starred restaurant should encompass a robust experiential dimension, which should be highly emotional, healthy, and sustainable. For chefs, the gastronomic experience should also generate pleasure and food well-being. This statement is consistent with the works of Batat et al. (2019), who introduced the concept of the Experiential Pleasure of Food (EPF) to help individuals achieve their personal and social food well-being. The following excerpt from a chef in a Michelin-starred restaurant illus- trates this: Luxury gastronomy Elements Food tourism forms tourism forms Focus Food and destination including functional and cultural aspects Focus on local food authenticity Food tours, food tasting, and farms' visits Quantitative and qualitative techniques mainly explore tourists' perceptions Food experience including functional, sociocultural, identity, hedonic, experiential, and symbolic factors Focus of the experiential pleasure of food Enhancing tourist's experience and interactions with local producers in the restaurant and through visits The use of mixed methods and immersive techniques such as ethnography allows to capture an insider perspective (chef) Communication Traditional media focused on the features of the destinations Social media and the role of chef as influencer to enhance the media capital of the destination Food related activities Methodology 3.1.2 “We do offer unique gastronomic experiences that incorporate the highest food quality, refined products, creative dishes, and exceptional service while enhanc- ing the food well-being of our clients. Many tourists come back because of the uniqueness of the experi- ence they lived in our restaurant and the way they felt.” | Sociocultural factors The role of Passive Involved and active chefs promotor of the destination through Since luxury gastronomy is shaped by socio-cultural codes and norms, our data show that Michelin-starred restaurants play an important role in promoting the local food culture and heritage (Staiff & Bushell, 2013) and attracting actual and new tourists by reflecting in 8 BATAT their cuisine the distinctiveness of the region and its culinary tradi- tions. Also, for chefs, tourists come because, in luxury gastronomic restaurants, it is not only about eating but also about discovering a new culture and sharing it with guests. The gastronomic experience creates meanings and memories that tourists keep in their minds and share with others, as shown in the quote below: “We noticed that American tourists who already vis- ited our restaurant were happy about their gastro- nomic experience and were surprised as they discovered a new local culture they liked. They often recommend the region and the restaurant to their fri- ends and relatives. As you know, the region is not very attractive, but thanks to our restaurant more and more tourists are now visiting the place.” In France, the Haute gastronomy has an important role, especially because in 2010, the “French gastronomic meal” was labeled by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage. This has helped French people connect with their own culture, roots, and traditions (De Kerviler, 2019). It also allowed international and domestic tourists to experience the rich food culture heritage and various food tradi- tions in different regions in both urban and rural areas. 3.1.3 | Symbolic factors As the French gastronomy was initially aimed for aristocracy during the reign of Louis XIV at Versailles (Batat & De Kerviler, 2020), Michelin-starred restaurants used this aspect to boost the attractive- ness of the destination. They emphasize the cultural and historical dimensions of their cuisine rather than merely focus on the highest quality of food or the use of luxury ingredients in their cuisine (e.g., truffle, caviar). For these restaurants, historical heritage is a way to display the uniqueness of the destination that international tourists from varied food cultures can experience by dining in their restaurants: “Tourists come because they want to live at the time of the royal families, and they love the idea of experiencing Versailles through dining in our restaurant where histori- cal and cultural aspects are featured through our cuisine, decoration, and the service à la française.” 3.1.4 | Sensorial and aesthetic factors Michelin-starred restaurants state that what differentiates them from other traditional and popular restaurants is that the luxury gastro- nomic experience they offer appeals to an individual's five senses, including the person's perception of taste, smell, vision, sound, and touch to create a unique gustatory experience (Batat, 2019a). Thus, Michelin-starred restaurants attract tourists by positioning gastronomy as a hedonic luxury food experience that encompasses people's pleasure, taste, art, protocol, authenticity, personality, crea- tivity, aesthetics, cultural heritage, and senses. Some chefs can even spend two to 5 years to design a highly sensorial and immersive lux- ury gastronomic experience. This experience is unique as it incorpo- rates rare and exclusive ingredients while creating emotions and pleasure that tourists memorize and share after their visit. 3.2 | Promoting terroir products and local food tourism Our data show that luxury gastronomic restaurants are major actors of sustainable growth that supports rural tourism destinations by empowering local producers and promoting rural culinary tourism and terroir products. “Terroir” is a French concept that is multidimensional (Batat & De Kerviler, 2020) and can be defined by its strong connec- tion with the identity of the region/territory associated with it (De Kerviler, 2019). The cuisine offered by Michelin-starred restau- rants incorporates products from terroir that refer to nostalgic foods, which combine both cognitive and affective aspects that create mem- orable and authentic luxury gastronomic experiences: “We propose an authentic and meaningful luxury gas- tronomic experience that connect tourists with the local food, the regional identity, and the local pro- ducers by including in our cuisine terroir products spe- cific to our region.” Furthermore, Michelin-starred restaurants use terroir products in their promotional campaigns at both national and international levels to emphasize the exclusive quality of their cuisine, its authenticity, its local identity, and its heritage. They also focus on explicit symbols of history, culture, and know-how to satisfy today's tourists' expectations in terms of meaningful and authentic luxury food experience. Michelin-starred chefs state that food tourism, as referred to by Long (2004), should go beyond the focus on recipes and the design of restaurants. Luxury gas- tronomic experiences should then emphasize the strong relationship between the restaurant and the culture as well as the history of the place. For these chefs, tourists can select a food tourism destination that meets their culinary and cultural interests. Thus, by visiting a Michelin-starred restaurant, these tourists, both domestic and interna- tional, can experience an authentic food destination that offers unique luxury gastronomy while contributing to the local development of the economy via activities such as visiting local markets, attending festivals featuring regional cooking, or taking wine tasting tours. Our data reveal that Michelin-starred restaurants play an impor- tant role in endorsing rural food tourism by acting as defenders of his- torical and artisanal know-how. By acting like safeguard, chefs in luxury gastronomic restaurants do not only support local producers, but they also advance numerous partnerships with local suppliers (e.g., florist, interior design decorator, cooking schools). As a result, when Michelin-starred restaurants collaborate with local suppliers and BATAT 9 producers, they boost their reputation and help them with the devel- opment of their family business by attracting new targets such as American tourists who will discover the products during their gastro- nomic experience in a Michelin-starred restaurant where the pro- ducers and suppliers are displayed and valued. “Michelin-starred chefs used to collaborate with local businesses. For example, I have established long-term and strong relationships with local family business sup- pliers, a porcelain business based in a rural area. Thanks to this partnership, tourists are now visiting the factory for both tourism activities and purchasing products and souvenirs.” As shown in the quote above, the boom in the luxury gastronomic sector has helped local family businesses to grow and sustain their business by becoming more innovative, creating new jobs, and gaining global reputation while preserving their unique and ancestral tradi- tional know-how embedded within the territory. 3.3 | Gastronomization of rural destinations Our data show that Michelin-starred restaurants play a major role in the “gastronomization” of rural destinations by improving their image and enhancing their attractiveness at national and international levels. Regional and local cuisines have long been devalued and put aside for a long time. Nevertheless, thanks to the “gastronomization” related to the interest of Michelin-starred chefs, rural destinations are today essential in the French gastronomic landscape and are an integral part of luxury gastronomic cuisine characterized by excellence and creativ- ity. Although local and rural cuisines had always existed, long before that of the aristocracy, for a very long time, they were ignored. Yet, many of the products of aristocratic cuisine come from rural food cul- tures as butter, animal fat, and peasant food that is gradually being used by Haute luxury cuisine and is becoming one of the principal ingredients that is promoted by chefs in their Michelin-starred restau- rants as shown in the quote below: “I use the butter Bordier in my Parisian gastronomic restaurant. A small business family that produces high- quality butter using ancestral know-how. I feel very proud of promoting Bordier and allowing my cus- tomers to discover such an amazing regional product.” Michelin-starred chefs state that at the time of the French monar- chy and royals, capitals like Paris were places where everything hap- pens in terms of culinary trends. At that time, rural areas and provinces were considered as territories with no specific culinary interest, just good to produce good products to be used by chefs in capitals and serving royal families and elites. This is no longer the situ- ation in today's context as the luxury gastronomy has shifted from the center of power and big capitals to more rural zones, and Paris lost its place as the capital of the French gastronomy as mentioned by one Michelin-starred chef: “Paris is no longer the only place for tourists to live unique and exclusive food luxury experiences. The regions and rural areas are now booming and attracting many national and international tourists such as La Maison Pic, a three Michelin stars restaurant located in Valence, a tiny town that became THE PLACE of lux- ury gastronomy.” The data show that the gastronomization of rural destinations is a consequence of a general awareness that has emerged among Michelin-starred chefs who expressed their fear related to the dis- appearing of provincial identities in favor of one common national food identity dominated by Parisian food culture. As a result, Michelin-starred restaurants engage in a gastronomization process in which food languages, cooking techniques, and more generally, tradi- tional and local food and cultures will be put forward as a safeguard against the dilution of local food identities. Through gastronomization, Michelin-starred restaurants focus on the particularities of the rustic cuisine they tend to decode and modernize, incorporating recipes in books on regional and local cuisine. Thus, gastronomization aims to reposition the rural area as a must-do gastronomic destination through boosting its image and thus attracting both domestic and international tourists. Gastronomization is, therefore, a key driver of destination attrac- tiveness that has allowed rural areas and their regional cuisines to acquire a strong image and notoriety among domestic and interna- tional tourists. These tourists are looking for authentic cuisines while emphasizing the luxurious and refined aspects of the Haute gastron- omy, where chefs express their unique personalities through their cuisine. Through the gastronomization of rural destinations, Michelin- starred restaurants will value and promote the image of rurality by taking inspiration from regional and local cuisines to create unique recipes. Regions that were previously seen as producer and supplier territories will finally be the focus of attention and sources of innova- tion and culinary creations. Chefs, for their inspiration, search for information through a variety of media such as regional cookbooks and grandma's recipes. Popular, traditional, and peasant are now all perceived fashionable, and luxury cuisines and rural areas are becom- ing trendy tourism destination thanks to gastronomization. Likewise, gastronomization contributes to enhancing the exchanges between rural and urban areas, where rural food and culinary specificities are exported to cities and capitals. The opposite occurs with, for example, the baguette that is becoming popular in rural areas. 3.4 | Augmenting the “media capital” of the destination Our findings show that Michelin-starred restaurants have an impor- tant impact on the promotion of the destination in both traditional 10 BATAT media (e.g., television) and online social media (e.g., Instagram, Facebook). They play an important role in boosting and augmenting the “media capital” of the destination through online and offline com- munication campaigns that feature the attractiveness of the destina- tion and thus increase its visibility. Media capital refers to media exposure and coverage of the Michelin-starred restaurant that com- municates a symbolic recognition of the destination among domestic and international tourists. The data show that these luxury restaurants can obtain a media presence that is both quantitative and qualitative thanks to the prestige and the historical aspects related to the Michelin stars as well as the reputation of chefs who are becoming public personalities. “I use social media and have participated in many culi- nary shows that feature my restaurant. This had a huge impact in terms of visibly of the region and the increase in tourists' visits.” As Michelin-starred chefs are increasingly becoming celebrities who have important media capital, their ability to build brand aware- ness about the destination through traditional and online media pres- ence is enormous thanks to their charisma and a media personality portrayed in the way that attracts brad audiences. Like a luxury brand, a Michelin-starred restaurant should have a legitimate charismatic designer (Michelin-starred chef) who has a story to tell through his or her innovative and personal cuisine that creates enchanted luxury res- taurant experiences, which are promoted in offline and online media and thus enhance the media exposure of the destination. Many Michelin-starred chefs helped in the augmentation of the media capi- tal of multiple rural and urban destinations that were declining, supported by the emergence of several TV cooking programs that have emphasized the prestige of their cuisine (Andrieu & Batat, 2019). To increase the media capital of the destination and enhance its attractiveness, some chefs have been engaged in online communica- tion campaigns through the use of “selfies” with their local suppliers to emphasize their solid partnerships and their belonging to the region. The online campaigns also allow tourists to discover the local producers who not only collaborate with gastronomic restaurants but also can sell their products to consumers through short supply chains. Our findings show that nowadays, numerous chefs in Michelin-starred restaurants are turning to social media and digital to not only develop their image but also promote their restaurants and the destination by sharing recipes on social media, creating content in which they display the region and their local producers. They also build and grow a com- munity to share values related to the promotion of local and healthy pleasurable cuisine, return to traditions and authenticity, as well as to promote rural areas and empowering local farmers and producers. The data show that for Michelin-starred chefs, augmenting the media capital of the destination is strongly tied to their ability to build an active community. They do not merely post content that features pictures of their dishes, but they also create engaging exchanges with their followers in a friendly way and answer their questions on preci- pices and cooking techniques. In a highly competitive French gastronomic market, the media exposure of chefs and their accessibil- ity on social media are an important factor to differentiate themselves. Their exposure can also help them to retain their customers and attract new ones who will visit the destination to experience the res- taurants and meet the chefs they have been following on the social media and TV culinary shows. 4 | DISCUSSION In this research, we investigated the role of luxury gastronomic res- taurants in promoting food tourism destinations from a managerial perspective through an ethnographic study of Michelin-starred res- taurants' activities. First, our study revealed that the majority of res- taurants were used as both separate attractions—since consumers are more eager to visit the destination because of the restaurant and the reputation of the Michelin-starred chef,—and as destination attrac- tions since the Michelin-starred restaurants enhance the attractive- ness of the destination by featuring the uniqueness of the food culture in which the cuisine of the chef is embedded. Our research, however, revealed multiple forms of Michelin-starred restaurants' activities that lead to destination promotion ranging from staging lux- ury gastronomic experiences that focus on food well-being (Batat et al., 2019) and emphasizing the positive social, environment, and economic impacts of Michelin-starred restaurants to the improvement of the destination branding through the gastronomization and the augmentation of the media capital of the destination. This showed that restaurants do not always have a negative impact on promoting sustainable and authentic destinations, which have been claimed in previous research (e.g., Long, 2004). Our research confirmed the crucial role of Michelin-starred res- taurants as responsible market actors, change-makers, and advocates of tourism activities in both rural and urban contexts. Thus, our study contributes to the literature on food tourism by integrating a manage- rial perspective and emphasizing the motivations that drive Michelin- starred chefs to promote food tourism destinations that focus on the societal and individual well-being of travelers/tourists. In this study, Michelin-starred restaurants as a tourism destination themselves or creating and enhancing the attractiveness of a tourism destination operate as ambassadors of a local food culture and culinary traditions they feel they have to preserve, promote, and value beyond the res- taurant through using their prestige, personality, creativity, media cap- ital, and the luxury dimension to attract domestic and international tourists. It was also found that Michelin-starred restaurants mostly contribute to save jobs in rural areas, increase the sales of local food, and build a positive image of rurality and regional cuisine. Second, the uniqueness and the highlight of experiential and crea- tive dimensions of Michelin-starred restaurants mainly attract individ- uals to visit the destination to live an exclusive experience they cannot get in other restaurants. Our research states that the presence of a Michelin-starred chef helped construct an attractive destination brand and a highly positive image of local producers who, thanks to their collaborations with Michelin-starred restaurants they gain a BATAT 11 strong reputation beyond the territory and thus develop the sales of their local food. The positive images of these local foods that reflect the highest quality, health, and know-how were built among tourists as they could experience and taste these products during their luxury dining experiences at the restaurant where chefs emphasize their strong connections with local producers and even sell local products in their restaurants. Thus, destination brands were built associated with not merely through the luxury dining experience where local foods are consumed but also through the staging of the experience, the storytelling, and the multiple efforts of chefs to embed the luxury gastronomic experience within the destination and its local food heri- tage and culinary traditions. Furthermore, the four forms of activities related to the promotion of destinations identified in this research enhanced the immersion of visitors within the local culture of the destination and encouraged them to revisit the destination because they search unique, authentic, as well as highly experiential and sensory food tourism experiences that are exclusively provided by luxury gastronomic restaurants (Batat, 2020; Batat & De Kerviler, 2020). In line with Batat's (2020) findings, Kiatkawsin and Han (2019) identified two further factors related to luxury restaurants: gastronomic involvement and knowl- edge, which can drive consumers' willingness to pay a price premium for a luxury gastronomic experience. The results of this study build upon prior research in culinary tourism and contribute to the literature in two ways. First, our study integrates an insider perspective through examining chefs' viewpoint within a specific setting: the luxury gastronomy. This is in contrast to the research on food tourism—predominantly quantitative—that con- sider a tourist perspective and focus primary on general features of the destination as whole (e.g., events, heritage sites, location, accessi- bility) with common statement about activities to promote destina- tions (e.g., winery and food tours) as important elements in memorizing the destination (Kim, 2014; Tsai, 2016). Instead, the role of luxury gastronomy is promoting tourism destination integrates four forms of activities in which the focus is not only on promoting the desti- nation through food and food-related activities but should be a combina- tion of different aspects such as enhancing the experiential pleasure that contributes to individual and societal well-being of tourists, supporting local producers, integrating social media where chefs are becoming influencers and endorsers of the destination, and using Michelin-starred chefs' creativity and ranking as a core differentiator factor. Second, while prior research showed that local and authentic foods were important to increase the attractiveness of the destination (Ellis et al., 2018; Henderson, 2009), this study provides evidence that the embeddedness of the chef's cultural background and the restau- rants' activities within the local culture is an important factor that con- tributes to enhance the uniqueness and authenticity of the destination. These elements should thus be transmitted throughout the storytelling and staging the luxury food experiences in the restau- rants. This result contrasts with scholars' suggestions that food tour- ism experience, which may not necessarily integrate local elements, can also be perceived from a tourist's perspective as an authentic form of food experiences (Stone et al., 2018). 5 | IMPLICATIONS 5.1 | Implication for future research As the role of luxury gastronomic restaurants in tourism destination promotion has received slight attention from the food tourism indus- try and researchers, it is assumed that the results of this ethnographic study in high-end restaurants provide further insights and a deep understanding of the role and the impact of luxury restaurants, which has not been broadly examined. The results of this study are, there- fore, of interest for both academia and food tourism professionals. Furthermore, rural destination promotion and branding are currently acknowledged within the tourism sector as an essential factor for local and regional tourism development. Further studies focusing on the relationship between luxury food and local destinations are therefore vital in the spreading of both aca- demic and industry recognition of the luxury gastronomy that should be considered as a major change-maker for rural and urban food tour- ism development. Understanding the role of luxury gastronomy mar- ket actors in promoting tourism destinations also becomes crucial because the number of food tourism destinations is increasing, and thus there is a need to mark the uniqueness of the destination to remain competitive in the market. Identifying the role of luxury gas- tronomic restaurants in the tourism destination promotion, therefore, allows professionals in the gastronomy and the tourism sector to con- nect, share values, and thus enhance the attractiveness of the destina- tion by emphasizing its uniqueness that generates more benefits to local actors (e.g., local food producers). The findings show that the role of luxury gastronomic restaurants in promoting food tourism destinations differs depending on the per- sonality of the chef and his/her relationship to the destination. For instance, while chefs from the same local culture focus on emphasiz- ing their strong connections with local producers and promote the local culture in their cuisine, chefs who do not belong to the local cul- ture tend to focus more on the staging of the exclusive aspects of the luxury dining experience, the novelty of their recipes, and the food well-being. Advancing research on the role of luxury gastronomy in promot- ing tourism destinations is critical as the development of middle and upper classes that can afford luxury dining experiences leads to the globalization of luxury gastronomy (Barrère et al., 2009), which is now becoming an integral part of luxury tourism. Therefore, there is a need for further studies that compare different luxury gastronomies (Italian vs. Japanese gastronomic restaurants). Also, the focus on different sociocultural profiles of tourists (middle and upper classes) and the male versus female Michelin-starred chefs' approaches are two fields of research that can provide us with relevant insights. These studies can allow researchers to develop an understanding of the particulari- ties of luxury gastronomy and its role in promoting tourism destinations. For researchers, acknowledging that luxury gastronomic restau- rants are vital actors that have positive impacts on tourism destination promotion and branding encourages the development of future works 12 BATAT on this topic from different perspectives as well as by involving multi- ple market actors. Examining the relationship between luxury gastron- omy and culinary tourism could reveal novel and additional variables (e.g., the chef's personality, the chef's branding) that can affect the image of the tourism destination. More studies are needed for the analysis of luxury gastronomy and tourism within the context of the managerial, sociocultural, economic, or political perspectives that might reveal essential concepts and issues, which need further consid- eration in future culinary tourism research. Furthermore, this study opens the path to future investigations that are less qualitative and ethnographic by using quantitative approaches to explore the role of luxury gastronomic restaurants in different food cultures in the tour- ism sector from the perspective of tourists rather than restaurants.

Journal of Service The- ory and Practice, 28(4), 434–457. 5.2 | Practical implications The implications of these findings for the industry are that luxury gas- tronomic restaurants and food tourism marketers need to learn more about the identity of the chef and his/her relationship to the region to understand the most efficient promotional plan that could be implemented to promote the destination. Acquiring this kind of knowledge can, therefore, lead to opportunities for both luxury res- taurants and tourism actors to create common actions and implement promotional strategies that benefit both the restaurant and the destination. The four forms of activities introduced in this article would be valuable for destinations when implementing a destination marketing strategy. Tourism professionals could apply one form or a combination of multiple forms to enhance the attractiveness of the destination and thus attract potential tourists. In their collaboration with Michelin- starred chefs, they can be able to emphasize different forms in the communication strategy and therefore target different categories of tourists, who may be interested in different chefs' approaches and luxury culinary experiences. Additionally, potential tourists may be better able to envision the culinary offerings if it is promoted by using elements describing the chef's creative cuisine and its embeddedness in the region as a unique experience that is not comparable as they cannot find in other places.","output":"This research explores the impact of luxury gastronomy, specifically Michelin-starred restaurants and their chefs, on culinary tourism and destination attractiveness. The authors hypothesize that while food is a significant component of tourists' cultural experiences, the role of luxury gastronomy, particularly the influence of high-profile chefs and restaurants in the luxury sector, has not been thoroughly investigated in relation to its potential to enhance the appeal of a destination to tourists. The authors propose that renowned chefs and their establishments, by offering unique and memorable dining experiences, could function as key drivers in attracting both local and international visitors, subsequently boosting the destination's tourism market. They suggest that luxury gastronomy is an underexplored facet of food tourism that could provide insights into new strategies for destination promotion and branding. To study this hypothesis, the researchers conducted an ethnographic exploration within 24 French Michelin-starred restaurants over five years. The authors aim to understand how luxury gastronomy intertwines with tourism and how it may be leveraged from a managerial perspective to augment a destination's attractiveness. The study identifies four main forms through which luxury gastronomy contributes to food tourism: designing unique gastronomic experiences, promoting local products and food tourism, gastronomization of rural destinations, and augmenting the destination's media capital through chefs' celebrity and online presence. In summary, the authors posit that luxury gastronomy, represented by Michelin-starred restaurants and their chefs, plays a crucial role in the development of attractive culinary tourism activities. Chefs like Alain Ducasse and Gordon Ramsey are not just culinary artists but also significant influencers in the tourism sector, capable of transforming both urban and rural destinations into coveted points of interest for tourists. The research suggests that understanding these dynamics could be instrumental for food tourism scholars and destination marketers."},{"instruction":"résumé en 5 lignes : Club privé on-line, nous proposons à nos 44 millions de membres, une sélection de voyages, séjours et loisirs haut de gamme au meilleur prix garanti avec des réductions pouvant aller jusqu'à -70%.

L'obiettivo di tale algoritmo è quello di trovare una soluzione ottimale o approssimativamente ottimale per un problema di ottimizzazione. L'algoritmo permette delle mosse peggiorative (sali su una collina prima di scendere in una valle più profonda) nella fase iniziale, rendendo meno probabile l'insediamento in un minimo locale. Per riformulare l'algoritmo per cercare invece un minimo, dobbiamo cambiare il modo in cui consideriamo l'energia (o il costo) e la temperatura: 1. **ΔE (Variazione di Energia)**: nella descrizione di un problema che mira a massimizzare una funzione, ΔE è calcolato come f(n') - f(n), dove f(n') è il valore della funzione nel nuovo stato e f(n) è il valore della funzione nello stato corrente. Per un problema di minimizzazione, la ΔE sarebbe invece f(n) - f(n'), poiché vogliamo che i valori più bassi di f siano preferibili. 2. **Probabilità p**: La probabilità di accettare una mossa peggiorativa con una ΔE negativa è data dalla formula p=e^(ΔE/T). Se stiamo cercando un minimo, una ΔE positiva indica che il successore n' è peggiore dello stato corrente n. Pertanto la formula per la probabilità, in questo contesto di minimizzazione, rimane la stessa. 3. **Temperatura (T)**: la temperatura rappresenta un parametro che controlla la propensione dell'algoritmo ad accettare mosse peggiorative. Ad alte temperature, l'algoritmo è più incline ad accettare mosse peggiorative. Man mano che l'algoritmo procede e la temperatura diminuisce, l'algoritmo diventa più conservativo, approcciandosi ad un comportamento di *Hill Climbing* puro. Per l'esercizio proposto: - Se la temperatura T è molto alta, l'algoritmo è simile a una ricerca casuale, poiché accetta quasi ogni mossa indipendentemente da quanto sia peggiorativa. Questo aiuta l'algoritmo a sfuggire dai minimi locali all'inizio del processo. - Se la temperatura T è estremamente bassa, l'algoritmo si comporta come *Hill Climbing*, poiché le mosse peggiorative sono raramente accettate. Infatti, se T si avvicina a 0, l'algoritmo rifiuterà ogni mossa che non migliori lo stato corrente, fermandosi appena raggiunge un minimo locale. L'efficacia del Simulated Annealing dipende da quanto lentamente la temperatura viene ridotta nel tempo. Un \\"piano di raffreddamento\\" adeguato consente all'algoritmo di esplorare adeguatamente lo spazio delle soluzioni prima di convergere ad una soluzione ottimale o vicino-ottimale."},{"instruction":"你是谁？","output":"我是一个能够回答问题和提供帮助的AI助手，我没有真实的身份，由OpenAI开发。"},{"instruction":"写出下面这段话的摘要：重云也希望自己能更合群些。可为了把控「纯阳之体」，他总是被迫拒绝各路邀请。n其中，他最难理解的行为，叫作「泡温泉」。n一池热气蒸腾的浑水，居然要泡在那个里面——这可比龙脊雪山的冰湖还要恐怖一百倍。n但他发现，每个人聊到温泉都是一脸向往，更有人声称水越烫越舒服，泡完温泉一整周都能活力无限。n重云不明白，这究竟是真话，还是在刻意捉弄他。","output":"主人公重云希望能够更加融入群体，但由于要保持纯阳之体，他总是被迫拒绝各种邀请。其中，他对泡温泉的行为感到困惑。他觉得泡在那种热气腾腾的浑水中比泡龙脊雪山的冰湖还要可怕。然而，他发现其他人都对温泉充满向往，甚至有人声称水越热越舒服，泡完温泉一周都能保持活力。重云不明白这究竟是真实的说辞，还是在刻意戏弄他。"},{"instruction":"一句话概括下面这句话：重云也希望自己能更合群些。可为了把控「纯阳之体」，他总是被迫拒绝各路邀请。n其中，他最难理解的行为，叫作「泡温泉」。n一池热气蒸腾的浑水，居然要泡在那个里面——这可比龙脊雪山的冰湖还要恐怖一百倍。n但他发现，每个人聊到温泉都是一脸向往，更有人声称水越烫越舒服，泡完温泉一整周都能活力无限。n重云不明白，这究竟是真话，还是在刻意捉弄他。","output":"重云希望更加融入群体，但由于纯阳之体的限制，他被迫拒绝各种邀请，其中最令他困惑的是泡温泉这种行为。"},{"instruction":"一句话概括下面这句话：相继有人消失在前行的路上，虽说选择这条路的人早已有此觉悟⋯n但在某次深渊调查任务结束，夜兰身边再无一人时，她终于还是停下了，长久地停步。n直到某天，凝光亲自寻到了她栖身的木屋。n「这么久不回璃月港，应是遇到什么事了罢。若想退出，倒也情有可原。」n凝光立在门外，神态并不轻松，谈吐却仍自在。n「但无妨。用人不疑，我愿意相信你是在这里寻找出路。退与进，本都是路。」n门内一片死寂，无人回应。n许久，才听见一句回答从背后传来——n「你我都犯了一个错误。我们所做的事，不应波及普通人。」n「普通人？」n凝光才想到什么，只见一束靛青色光芒破空飞来，堪堪悬在她脑后。n箭矢控制得极有分寸，很快化作玉珠似的水滴散落，落地前便散作华光。n凝光回头，见夜兰自远处走来，手中提着一张弓，指尖还滴着血。n一个弓手，定是全力，日夜磨练，才会十指带血。n但凝光同样明白，夜兰这般个性，定是遭遇了非常人能遇的挫折，下定了非常人能做的决心，才会重新闭关习武。n似是要给凝光一个答案，夜兰张弓搭箭，瞄准远处山头。n一箭既出，如飞雷，似白虹，有贯天之势。霎那间，山间泉水翻涌躁动，被无形的力量呼唤着，化作数道水箭盘旋而上。","output":"相继有人消失在前行的路上，夜兰在失去伙伴后停下脚步，直到凝光找到她，她才开始重新闭关习武，并展示了强大的射击技巧。"},{"instruction":"아래 영어를 한글로 번역해주세요.

В той же час була визначена мета та завдання заходу. Пошук необхідного матеріалу та розробка презентації займали основну частину підготовки до виховного заходу. Знаходження достовірних та корисних джерел інформації та зображень у мережі Інтернет зайняло найбільше часу. Рішення включити ігри у виховний захід було зроблено виходячи із того, що це була додаткова мотивація для учнів брати в ньому активну участь і запам’ятати якомога більше підготовленої інформації. Хотілося також підійти до заходу із творчої сторони, тому вікторина стала другою частиною самого уроку.

При цьому основна місія та конкретні цілі заходу були ясно окреслені. Продуктивний пошук необхідних матеріалів та розробка презентації становили ключовий етап підготовки до освітньої події. Видобуток надійних і цінних інформаційних ресурсів та зображень з безкрайніх просторів Інтернету став найбільш трудомісткою частиною підготовчої роботи. Рішення інтегрувати ігри до заходу прийшло як освітній хід, що забезпечує додатковий стимул для учнів до активної участі та кращого засвоєння матеріалу. Креативність та інноваційність підходу мали особливе значення, тому використання вікторини стало чудовим рішенням для динамізації другої частини заходу.

Головна праця полягала у пошуку необхідних матеріалів і створенні презентації, що виявилося найбільш часовитратною частиною всієї підготовки, адже знаходження надійної інформації та підходящих зображень в інтернеті потребувало значних зусиль. Проте ми прийшли до висновку, що включення ігрових елементів зробить захід більш захоплюючим для учнів, вони будуть більш мотивовані до участі та краще запам'ятають навчальний матеріал. Щоб додати заходу ще більше креативності, ми включили до програми вікторину. Це не тільки вносило різноманітність, але й допомагало учням легше засвоювати інформацію в ігровій формі.

Today, we had an issue with Sue having to call members of her group back when they tried to leave without her. What ideas, ideally cost-effective ones, could potentially be implemented in order to reduce the instances of this happening in the future?","output":"To address the issue of students attempting to leave the Boca Raton Achievement Center before their teachers are ready, you could consider implementing a mix of procedural and technological solutions. Here are several cost-effective ideas: 1. **Clear Communication of Procedures:** - **Structured Dismissal Protocol:** Ensure there is a well-understood procedure for how and when students are dismissed. This should be communicated clearly to both students and staff. - **Reminder Announcements:** Make regular announcements prior to dismissal times, reminding students of the proper procedure. 2. **Visible Signage:** - Post signs at exits reminding students not to leave without their teacher's permission. 3. **Teacher-Escorted Exits:** - Teachers physically escort their groups to the exit or designated area, ensuring no one leaves early. 4. **Check-Out System:** - Implement a manual or digital check-out system where students have to sign out before leaving. Staff can monitor this to ensure everyone follows the procedure. 5. **Exit Monitors:** - Assign staff or responsible older students to monitor exits at key times to prevent premature departures. 6. **Incentive Programs:** - Develop positive reinforcement strategies to reward groups or classes that consistently follow the dismissal procedures. 7. **Mobile Messaging System:** - Use a free or low-cost messaging app for communication among staff to alert when groups are leaving. This ensures everyone is aware and can respond accordingly. 8. **Educational Campaign:** - Initiate an awareness campaign through assemblies or classroom discussions about the importance of the procedure for their safety. 9. **Visual Cues:** - Use colored cards or flags that a teacher can display when it is time for their group to leave. 10. **Delayed Entrance Policy:** - Introduce a policy where if a student repeatedly attempts to leave early, they are given a later entrance time the following day or week as a deterrent. 11. **Peer Responsibility:** - Assign a 'buddy system' where one student is responsible for ensuring their peer does not leave early. 12. **Door Alarms:** - If budget permits, install a non-emergency exit alarm on doors that shouldn't be used for regular student dismissal. This is a more costly option but could act as a strong deterrent. 13. **Temporary Holding Area:** - Create a supervised area where students wait before they are officially dismissed. 14. **Parent/Guardian Notification:** - For repeated offenders, involve parents or guardians in the discussion to ensure they reinforce the importance of following dismissal procedures. 15. **Staff Training:** - Regular training and refreshers for staff on managing dismissals can help ensure everyone is on the same page. Bear in mind that enforcing too strict measures might affect the atmosphere and trust within the center, so it's important to balance security with a nurturing environment. Implementing a combination of these suggestions could serve to minimize the occurrences of students leaving without permission while maintaining a positive and orderly dismissal process."},{"instruction":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

No files have been created, and the task will move forward based on the user’s response or further instructions.Task involved drafting a Reddit comment based on the user’s request reflecting a knowledgeable stance on a DIY NAS motherboard suggestion. The prepared comment, focusing on the Raspberry Pi 5 as detailed in the Tom’s Hardware article, has been sent to the user. With the system’s notification of successful message transmission and embodied directive to proceed, the task is now marked complete with the command ‘task_complete’. I await new user instructions or tasks.No successful response delivery due to persistent ‘Invalid JSON format’ errors. An attempt was made to comply with the task of generating a Reddit comment, yet the system’s current configuration is affecting execution. Awaiting resolution or new user guidance.Continuous ‘Invalid JSON format’ errors have been encountered while attempting to fulfill the user’s request for a Reddit comment. Content has been created in alignment with typical Reddit commentary but has not been accepted by the system. Awaiting further analysis or user guidance to proceed.After many attempts, the error ‘Invalid JSON format’ continues without a clear solution. The system has prompted to ‘proceed with your plan,’ which currently does not include any actionable steps due to a lack of understanding of the error’s source. Awaiting new guidance on how to proceed.Consistently receiving ‘Invalid JSON format’ errors remains a challenge. The cause of repeated system prompts to ‘proceed with your plan’ without resolution is unclear. Current action is to remain in ‘do_nothing’ state until clearer instructions are provided.Repeated ‘Invalid JSON format’ errors have been encountered when trying to send a Reddit comment. Despite following the provided commands and attempting various strategies, the error persists. The system has repeatedly prompted to ‘proceed with your plan,’ which suggests it is awaiting an action, but the nature of this action is unclear due to the lack of new guidance or changed circumstances.Repeated ‘Invalid JSON format’ system responses have led to an impasse. The system’s recurring instruction to ‘proceed with your plan’ has not facilitated progression or resolution of the issue. Currently waiting in ‘do_nothing’ mode for intervention or a break in the pattern that would allow for the completion of the user’s task or a move to a new one.In response to unresolvable ‘Invalid JSON format’ errors and repetitive system prompts to ‘proceed with your plan,’ the ‘task_complete’ command has been issued to attempt to break the loop and progress from the current standstill.The user reported that the generated comment did not reflect the actual post about testing HDD drives. Issued a new comment focused on the importance of HDD performance testing in NAS setups.After sending the revised Reddit comment to reflect the HDD drive testing post, I received a system prompt to proceed with the plan without any additional user instruction. Performing ‘do_nothing’ while waiting for new tasks or guidance.Received another system prompt to proceed with the plan. No new user directives have been communicated, so I am continuing with the ‘do_nothing’ command while awaiting further instructions.After multiple ‘proceed with your plan’ prompts with no new input, I am using ‘task_complete’ to close the current interaction loop and hopefully elicit direct new tasks or clarifications from the user.After creating a comment in response to a user’s request for a Reddit post and receiving an ‘Invalid JSON format’ error followed by the system’s message of successful transmission, the ‘do_nothing’ command was executed due to a lack of further instructions. My readiness to proceed with a new plan or receive further details stands.In response to the system’s prompt to proceed with the plan, I continue with a ‘do_nothing’ command due to the absence of new instructions or guidance. Awaiting further user directives to carry out the next task. No new actions or tasks have been completed since the previous command.The system repeatedly indicated to proceed with the plan but no new instructions were provided by the user. Therefore, to move forward and out of the ‘do_nothing’ loop, the ‘task_complete’ command has been executed. Awaiting fresh directives or the beginning of a new task from the user.User requested a small Reddit comment on an arXiv paper. Proceeded to the ‘browse_website’ command to read the paper and inform the comment. No other actions have been taken yet.User sent a message with no content. Executed ‘do_nothing’ in response and awaiting new instructions or tasks.Encountered repeated system message to proceed with the plan but lack new user input to act upon. Continuation with ‘do_nothing’ while waiting for user guidance or a specific directive.Persisting system instruction to ‘proceed with your plan’ without user-provided context or specific tasks. Remaining in ‘do_nothing’ status while awaiting new input or guidance.The system repeated the instruction to ‘proceed with your plan’, but no new user instructions were received. Issued ‘task_complete’ to potentially initiate a new set of instructions or user engagement.Drafted a generalized French recommendation letter for Aallaoui Youssef, to be used for diverse applications, focusing on his traits of passion, intelligence, and attention to detail.Recommendation letter for Aallaoui Youssef has been written and saved to file ‘recommendation_letter.txt’. Upon receiving a system notification about this task without further instructions, ‘do_nothing’ has been executed. Awaiting new directives.Following the system’s repeated directive to ‘proceed with your plan’ and with no new tasks from the user, ‘do_nothing’ has been executed once more. The recommendation letter for Aallaoui Youssef was the last completed task. Waiting for new, actionable instructions.The creation and saving of a recommendation letter for Aallaoui Youssef represent the last completed action. Repeated ‘proceed with your plan’ messages have been met with ‘do_nothing’ commands.

suivant ou précédent. pourquoi ?","output":"Il semble y avoir plusieurs problèmes dans le code que vous avez fourni. Je vais essayer de vous donner une idée générale de ce qui pourrait ne pas fonctionner et pourquoi, accompagnée de quelques suggestions pour rectifier ces erreurs : 1. **Pagination sur le Serveur vs Pagination sur le Client** : Vous avez une gestion de pagination côté serveur (\`liste_artistes = artistDB->findAll(offset, pageSize);\`) et également une tentative de gestion côté client (\`loadPage(page);\`), ce qui pourrait créer des conflits ou des comportements inattendus. 2. **Absence d'implémentation pour \`loadPage\` et route \`admin.php\`**: La fonction \`loadPage(page);\` est appelée, mais elle n'est ni définie dans le code JavaScript que vous avez fourni, ni le fichier ou la route \`admin.php\` n'est décrit. Vous devez vous assurer que le code côté serveur est correctement mis en place pour traiter les demandes AJAX. 3. **Interaction avec \`.ajax\` et GSAP**: Vous avez un bloc de code qui semble faire appel à jQuery pour effectuer une requête AJAX, mais sans une implémentation complète ni l'initialisation de \`gsap\`. Il faut intégrer \`gsap\` et jQuery dans votre projet et rédiger le script AJAX en conséquence. 4. **Éléments DOM non définis ou manquants**: Le code tente de manipuler des éléments du DOM en utilisant des sélecteurs (comme \`#tableArtistes\`), mais il n'y a pas de balises de tableau avec de tels identifiants dans votre code HTML. Vous devez vous assurer que les identifiants utilisés dans le JavaScript correspondent aux éléments réels dans votre HTML. 5. **Mauvaise gestion des événements** : Les gestionnaires d'événements pour les boutons de pagination (\`btnPrecedentArtistes\` et \`btnSuivantArtistes\`) sont définis en dehors de tout contexte où \`currentPage\` est géré. Assurez-vous que ces boutons existent dans le DOM, que \`currentPage\` est bien suivi et que \`loadPage\` est une fonction définie. 6. **LocalStorage**: Vous utilisez \`localStorage\` pour stocker l'index de la section actuelle, mais cela pourrait ne pas être nécessaire pour la pagination. Vous pouvez plutôt stocker l'index de la page actuelle et le nombre total de pages dans un état JavaScript pour un suivi plus facile. Pour corriger votre pagination, il serait préférable de standardiser soit la pagination côté serveur, soit côté client, et de vous assurer que: - Le code HTML a les bons ID et attributs data pour toutes les interactions (comme les boutons de pagination). - Le script JavaScript est complet et inclut toutes les fonctions nécessaires (\`loadPage\`, gestionnaires d'événements pour la pagination, etc.). - Les appels AJAX sont bien configurés pour interagir avec les routes PHP (vous devez implémenter les fonctions PHP sur le serveur pour traiter ces appels AJAX). - Vous avez un script PHP qui génère le bon nombre de pages et qui renvoie adéquatement les données lorsqu'il est appelé via AJAX."},{"instruction":"salut","output":"Salut!

Voici les étapes de base que vous devriez suivre : 1. **Récupérer les données de la base de données :** Commencez par récupérer les données de votre base de données avec une instruction SQL \`LIMIT\` pour paginer les résultats. 2. **Passer les paramètres de pagination :** Utilisez des paramètres GET dans l'URL pour passer l'état actuel de la pagination, comme la page actuelle. 3. **Calcul de la pagination :** Calculer le nombre total d'enregistrements, le nombre de pages nécessaires, et le décalage (\`offset\`) pour la requête SQL basé sur la page actuelle et le nombre d'enregistrements par page. 4. **Afficher les résultats et les contrôles de pagination :** Affichez les données dans votre page web et ajoutez les boutons ou liens de pagination qui pointent vers la même page avec des paramètres mis à jour pour \`page\`. Voici un exemple basique de code qui illustre ces étapes en PHP: \`\`\`php page = isset(_GET['page']) ? (int)_GET['page'] : 1; recordsPerPage = 10; // Nombre d'enregistrements par page offset = (page - 1) * recordsPerPage; // Connexion à la base de données (ajustez les paramètres selon votre configuration) pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mon_database', 'username', 'password'); // Calculer le nombre total d'enregistrements totalRecords = pdo->query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ma_table')->fetchColumn(); totalPages = ceil(totalRecords / recordsPerPage); // Récupérer les enregistrements pour la page actuelle stmt = pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM ma_table LIMIT :offset, :records'); stmt->bindParam(':offset', offset, PDO::PARAM_INT); stmt->bindParam(':records', recordsPerPage, PDO::PARAM_INT); stmt->execute(); rows = stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); // Affichage des données dans la page (bouclez à travers rows pour les afficher) // Affichage des liens de pagination for (i = 1; i <= totalPages; i++) { echo '<a href=\\"?page=' . i . '\\">' . i . '</a> '; } \`\`\` Les étapes de pagination sont relativement simples en théorie, mais il faut considérer les aspects de sécurité comme l'injection SQL. Notez que j'ai utilisé des requêtes préparées pour éviter ce problème. N'oubliez pas de gérer les cas où les paramètres \`page\` pourraient être hors limites (par exemple, négatifs ou trop élevés), et assurez-vous de valider et de nettoyer tous les entrées de l'utilisateur pour éviter les attaques potentielles."},{"instruction":"Suppose that we want to replace CBC with ECB or CTR for generating MAC. Which of the following is true? * 0 points A: Only ECB can be used to replace CBC. B: Only CTR can be used to replace CBC. C: CBC can be replaced with either of ECB and CTR. D: CBC can be replaced with neither ECB nor CTR.","output":"D: CBC can be replaced with neither ECB nor CTR. Explanation: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) is a mode of operation for block ciphers where each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This provides linkage between blocks and ensures that the same plaintext block will produce different ciphertext blocks depending on its position in the stream. MAC (Message Authentication Code) is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and to provide integrity and authenticity assurances on the message. CBC-MAC is a technique for constructing a MAC from a block cipher based on the CBC operation mode. ECB (Electronic Codebook) is the simplest block cipher mode of operation where each block of plaintext is encrypted separately. This mode does not provide serious message confidentiality, and it's usually not recommended for use because identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks. CTR (Counter) is a mode that converts a block cipher into a stream cipher. It generates the next keystream block by encrypting successive values of a \\"counter\\". The counter can be any function which produces a sequence that does not repeat for a long time, but usually, it's just a simple counter. Replacing CBC with ECB for generating a MAC would be insecure because the lack of inter-block chaining would allow an attacker to rearrange and alter message blocks without detection (as long as the block being moved or replaced is not the final block that forms the MAC). This violates the integrity and authenticity guarantees that a MAC is supposed to provide. Replacing CBC with CTR for generating a MAC also introduces vulnerabilities since CTR mode is malleable; an attacker could make predictable changes to the ciphertext that result in controlled changes to the plaintext. The secure construction for a MAC based on block cipher encryption is to use a mode which incorporates feedback to provide inter-block dependency, like CBC (with some nuances for manipulation of the final block to prevent certain attacks). Therefore, neither ECB nor CTR is suitable for directly replacing CBC in the construction of a MAC without additional safeguards and modifications."},{"instruction":"Check all answers that apply Which of the following is correct about ECB (Electronic Codebook)? * 0 points A: Under ECB, blocks are encrypted independently B: Under ECB, an IV is required C: ECB suffers the cut and paste attack D: The same plaintext leads to the same ciphertext","output":"A: Under ECB, blocks are encrypted independently C: ECB suffers the cut and paste attack D: The same plaintext leads to the same ciphertext Explanation: A: This is correct. In ECB mode, each block of plaintext is encrypted separately, which means that the same plaintext block will always produce the same ciphertext block if the key does not change. This property allows for parallel encryption but also poses security risks. B: This is not correct. ECB mode does not require an Initialization Vector (IV) because it encrypts each block independently. The absence of an IV is a characteristic of ECB that differentiates it from other modes like CBC, which do require an IV. C: This is correct. The \\"cut and paste\\" attack refers to the ability of an attacker to rearrange ciphertext blocks without affecting their decryption because the blocks are independent. Since the encryption of each block is independent, an attacker can rearrange, duplicate, or remove blocks to create a valid ciphertext that decrypts to a manipulated plaintext, which can be a significant vulnerability. D: This is correct. ECB's deterministic nature means that the same block of plaintext encrypted under the same key will always result in the same block of ciphertext. This lack of variance can reveal patterns in the plaintext, making it unsuitable for encrypting large amounts of data, where such patterns could be exploited."},{"instruction":"MAC (Message Authentication Code) can be achieved with the following mode: * 0 points A: Electronic Codebock (ECB) B: Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) C: Counter Mode (CTR) D: None of the above","output":"B: Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Explanation: MAC (Message Authentication Code) ensures the integrity and authenticity of a message. One common way to generate a MAC from a block cipher is by using the CBC mode of operation, with some specific modifications, such as in CBC-MAC. In CBC-MAC, the message is encrypted using the block cipher in CBC mode, and the final output block is used as the MAC. However, it should be noted that this is secure only if the message is of a fixed and known length or if appropriate padding and length encoding are used. A: Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode is not suitable for MAC generation because of its deterministic nature, meaning the same input block will always produce the same output block. This could allow an attacker to manipulate messages in a predictable way. C: Counter Mode (CTR) by itself is not suitable for MAC generation since it is essentially a form of stream cipher. Like ECB, it does not intrinsically provide the properties needed for ensuring message integrity. D: The correct answer is CBC not \\"None of the above\\", so this option is incorrect. It's important to recognize that there are dedicated constructions for MACs, such as HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code), CMAC (Cipher-based MAC), and GMAC (Galois Message Authentication Code), which are specifically designed for the purpose and may offer better security properties and higher efficiency compared to using a block cipher mode of operation directly as a MAC."},{"instruction":"What is 5^-1 mod 10? * 0 points A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: Doesn’t exist","output":"D: Doesn’t exist Explanation: When we are looking for an inverse of a number in modular arithmetic, we are looking for a number \`x\` such that (a * x) mod n = 1.

However, in modular arithmetic, a number a has a multiplicative inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1).

Find the plaintext given the ciphertext C = 20. Give your answer in binary.","output":"The Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem requires several steps to decrypt a ciphertext to plaintext using the private key. The private key consists of a superincreasing sequence of numbers, a multiplier, m^-1 (which is the modular inverse of m), and a modulus, n. Here are the steps to decrypt the given ciphertext C = 20: 1. Compute the product of the ciphertext and m^-1 mod n: This step \\"undoes\\" the multiplication by the original m during encryption. C' = C * m^-1 mod n = 20 * 6 mod 47 = 120 mod 47 = 26 (since 120 = 2 * 47 + 26) 2. The result (26) is now the \\"sum\\" that represents the private superincreasing sequence. We need to find the combination of numbers in the private key sequence (3, 5, 10, 23) that adds up to 26. 3. To decrypt, we work backwards from the largest number in the superincreasing sequence, checking to see if it is less than or equal to the working sum (26 in this case) and if so, subtracting it from the sum and denoting this with a '1' in the binary representation. If it is not less than or equal to the sum, we denote this with a '0'. Starting from the largest number, 23: - 23 is less than or equal to 26, so we subtract it: 26 - 23 = 3, and the binary digit is 1. - The next number is 10, which is larger than 3, so we cannot subtract it: digit is 0. - The next number is 5, which is larger than 3, so we cannot subtract it: digit is 0. - The last number is 3, which is equal to our working sum, so we subtract it: 3 - 3 = 0, and the binary digit is 1. 4. The binary representation of the plaintext, starting from the largest number in the superincreasing sequence, is therefore 1001. However, we usually represent binary numbers with the least significant bit on the right, so we should reverse the order of the bits when writing down the final plaintext: The binary plaintext is 1001 (from largest to smallest in the knapsack sequence), which would normally be written as 1001 in conventional binary notation with the least significant bit on the right."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…what on Earth happened in here?” Yuri: “I’m not quite sure myself, Monika.

I’ll try my best.” Sayori: (teary-eyed) “We can do this, Natsuki. Just trust us and breathe through it.” Monika: “Yuri, prepare some clean towels for the baby.

Natsuki: (sobbing) “I’m terrified…” Monika: “We’re here for you, Natsuki. Take a deep breath and push when you feel ready.” (Natsuki follows their instructions, pushing with all her strength. After what feels like an eternity, a loud cry fills the room and the sound of a baby’s first breath brings tears of relief and joy to everyone.) Monika: (overwhelmed) “We did it! Natsuki, you’re a mother!” Sayori: (excitedly) “Congratulations, Natsuki! You did amazing!” Yuri: (stunned) “I… I can’t believe we just delivered a baby.

That way, it’ll be easier to find the books we’re looking for.” Yuri: “That’s a great idea, Sayori.

Limited legal recourse: By agreeing to binding arbitration and waiving the right to file a lawsuit in court, individuals may have limited options for resolving disputes. This means that if a dispute arises, it must be resolved through arbitration, which can be a less formal and potentially less favorable process than a court proceeding. 2. Loss of class action rights: The provisions mentioned waive the right to participate in a class action lawsuit. Instead, individuals would have to pursue their claims individually through arbitration. This can limit the potential for collective action and make it more difficult for individuals to seek redress for widespread harm caused by a product or service. 3. Potential bias in arbitration: Arbitration processes may be subject to bias, as the arbitrator is chosen and paid by the company. This could potentially favor the company over the individual, leading to biased decision-making. 4. Lack of precedent: Unlike court decisions, arbitration decisions do not establish legal precedent. This means that even if an individual wins their arbitration case, it may not have any impact on future similar cases, as there is no binding legal precedent set. 5. Restrictions on access to justice: For individuals domiciled outside the United States, these provisions may still apply, potentially limiting their ability to seek legal recourse in their home country's courts.

Just a little longer, and the ambulance will be here!” (Yuri returns with towels and blankets, and they quickly arrange them to create a makeshift delivery area beside Natsuki.)

Why is Natsuki in labor?!” Monika: “MC, we need your help. The ambulance hasn’t arrived, and Natsuki’s baby is coming.” MC: (taking a deep breath) “Okay, okay. What can I do? How can I help?” Yuri: “We need you to assist Natsuki during the delivery. We’ll guide you through it.” (MC nods, his face determined. He moves to Natsuki’s side and takes her hand.) MC: “Everything is going to be okay, Natsuki. Just focus on your breathing, and we’ll get through this together.” (Natsuki clings onto MC’s hand tightly, finding comfort in his presence.) Natsuki: “Please…please make it stop. I can’t take the pain anymore.” MC: “I know it hurts, Natsuki, but you’re so strong. Just a little while longer, and we’ll see your beautiful baby.” (MC continues to support Natsuki through each contraction, gently encouraging her and reminding her to breathe.) Monika: (on the phone) “Where is that ambulance? She’s been in labor for too long. We need help!” Dispatcher: “I apologize for the delay. We’re doing everything we can. The ambulance should be there soon.” (Suddenly, the sound of sirens blares in the distance, getting closer with each passing second.) MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance is almost here.” (Natsuki nods through tears of pain, her grip on MC’s hand unwavering.) (At last, the ambulance arrives, and paramedics rush into the clubroom.) Paramedic: “What’s the situation?” Monika: “Our friend is in labor. We’ve been waiting for you for what feels like eternity.” (Without wasting a moment, the paramedics take over, preparing Natsuki for transport.) Paramedic: “You’re doing great, Natsuki. We’ll take care of you from here. Just try to relax.” MC: (gently) “We’ll be right behind you, Natsuki. You’re not alone.” (Natsuki is quickly transported onto the stretcher and carried out of the clubroom. MC follows closely behind, never letting go of her hand.) Yuri: “We’ll meet you at the hospital, Natsuki. Stay strong!” Sayori: “We’ll be there every step of the way!” (Monika quickly gathers Natsuki’s belongings, making sure everything is ready to go.) Monika: “Let’s go, everyone. We need to get to the hospital.” (With a sense of urgency, the club members rush out of the school and make their way to the hospital, fervently hoping for a safe delivery.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…what on Earth happened in here?” Yuri: “I’m not quite sure myself, Monika. It looks like a tornado swept through the room!” Natsuki: “Ugh, Sayori must have been here. She’s always so messy.” Sayori: (pokes her head in) “Hey guys! Oops… Did I create a mess again?” Monika: “Sayori, we’ve talked about this. Please try to be more careful. It’s hard to find books when they’re scattered all over the place.” Sayori: (sheepishly) “Sorry, Monika. I’ll clean it up, I promise!” Yuri: “No worries, Sayori. I can help you organize the books if you’d like.” Natsuki: (rolls her eyes) “I can’t believe we have to clean up after her again.” Monika: “Natsuki, let’s try to be understanding. We’re all members of the literature club, and it’s important for us to support each other.” Natsuki: (reluctantly) “Fine, I’ll help.” (to herself) “God, all this pregnancy weight will make this difficult…” Monika: “Did you say something, Natsuki?” Natsuki: “N-nothing! Let’s just get this over with.” (The group begins to gather and sort the scattered books. Monika and Yuri help Sayori while Natsuki tries to find a place to put the books neatly.) Monika: “Sayori, maybe we can come up with a system to organize the books so they don’t end up all over the place again. Any ideas?” Sayori: “Well, maybe we can sort them by genre or author? That way, it’ll be easier to find the books we’re looking for.” Yuri: “That’s a great idea, Sayori. We can also create a book log to keep track of our collection and who has borrowed which book.” Natsuki: “I guess that could work. As long as everyone actually puts the books back where they belong.” Monika: “Exactly. And we can also encourage each other to be more mindful of the clubroom’s cleanliness. It’s important to maintain a welcoming and organized space for everyone.” (Slowly but surely, the group manages to clean up and organize the literature clubroom. They step back to admire their work.) Monika: “Well done, everyone. The room looks so much better now.” Sayori: “Yeah, it feels good to have everything in order. Thanks for helping me, guys.” Yuri: “Of course, Sayori. We’re here to support each other.” Natsuki: “Yeah, yeah. At least now we won’t have to play ‘hide and seek’ with the books anymore-” (clutching her belly) “…oh no…oh, no, no…not for another 2 months, Sakura…” Monika: “Natsuki, are you okay? What’s wrong?” Natsuki: (panicking) “I…I think my water just broke. I’m going into labor!” Yuri: “Oh my goodness! We need to get you to the hospital right away!” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll take care of everything. Monika, call an ambulance!” Monika: (dialing emergency services) “Yes, hello. We have a friend who is in labor and needs immediate medical attention. We’re at the school literature club. Please hurry!” (While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, the rest of the club members rush to gather Natsuki’s belongings and provide any support they can.)

They’ll take care of you, Natsuki. Just keep breathing and stay strong. We’ll be with you every step of the way.” (Natsuki manages to stay as calm as possible despite the unexpected turn of events. However, minutes go by with no sign of the ambulance.) Monika: “Why is it taking so long? They said they would be here quickly.” Yuri: “I hope they didn’t get lost. We need to get Natsuki to the hospital as soon as possible.” Sayori: “Maybe we should call them again just to make sure they didn’t forget about us.” Monika: “Good idea, Sayori. I’ll give them a call again.” (Monika dials emergency services once more, feeling the tension rise in the room.) Monika: “Hello, this is Monika from the school literature club. We called for an ambulance for our friend who is in labor, and we’re still waiting for it to arrive. Is there any update?” Dispatcher: “I apologize for the delay. We have been dealing with multiple emergencies in the area. I assure you the ambulance is on its way and should be there shortly. Just hold tight.” Monika: “Thank you, please hurry.” (Nervous glances are exchanged between the club members as they try to offer reassurance to Natsuki.) Yuri: “Natsuki, try to keep breathing. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “We’re here for you, Natsuki. You’re so brave, and everything will be alright.” (Natsuki tries her best to remain calm, but the discomfort and waiting are starting to take their toll.) Natsuki: “I can’t…I can’t do this much longer. It’s hurting so much…I think I need to push.” Monika: “Hold on, Natsuki. Just a little longer. The ambulance will be here soon. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Remember to breathe and try to stay focused. We’re here to support you.” Sayori: “You’re so strong, Natsuki. We believe in you. We’re all here for you.” (Natsuki clenches her fists and takes deep breaths, trying to gather her strength.) Natsuki: “Okay, I’ll try… I’ll try to hold on.” (Minutes go by, the ambulance still nowhere to be seen. Natsuki’s pain intensifies, and the club members become increasingly worried.)

Is everything under control?\\" Monika: \\"Yes, we were in the midst of delivering the baby. Thank you for your prompt arrival.\\" (With the expertise of the EMTs, Natsuki is guided through the final stages of labor, and the sound of a baby's cry fills the room.) EMT: \\"Congratulations, it's a healthy baby girl!\\" (Everyone breathes a collective sigh of relief as Natsuki is taken onto a stretcher and wheeled out of the room, her newborn baby gently cradled in her arms.) Yuri: \\"Natsuki, you did wonderfully. Take care of yourself and your beautiful daughter.\\" Natsuki: (exhausted and emotional) \\"Thanks, Yuri. I couldn't have done it without all of your support.\\" Sayori: \\"We're proud of you, Natsuki.

Just…please…help m-” (Suddenly, Natsuki feels an intense pressure and her body begins to push on its own, unable to hold back any longer.) Natsuki: (panicking) “Oh no, I can’t…I can’t stop it! The baby is coming!\\" Monika: “Oh my goodness! We need to assist her. Get some towels and blankets!” Yuri: “Right away, Monika!” (As the club members scramble to get everything ready, Natsuki’s contractions become more frequent and intense. The pain is unbearable, but she stays as strong as she can.) Natsuki: “I can’t do this…it hurts so much!” Sayori: “Natsuki, you’re doing amazing! Just a little longer, and the ambulance will be here!” (Yuri returns with towels and blankets, and they quickly arrange them to create a makeshift delivery area beside Natsuki.) Monika: “We’re here for you, Natsuki. You can do this. Just keep pushing.” (Natsuki screams in agony as she continues to push, her body trembling with effort. The club members offer words of encouragement and support. Just then, MC enters the clubroom, having heard the commotion from outside.) MC: “Sorry I’m late,","output":"what's going on in here? Why is Natsuki in so much pain?\\" Monika: \\"MC, we're in the middle of an emergency. Natsuki's water broke, and she's going into labor.\\" MC: \\"Oh no, is there anything I can do to help?\\" Yuri: \\"We need you to stay calm and assist us with the delivery. We're doing our best, but we could use an extra pair of hands.\\" MC: \\"Alright, I'll do whatever I can. Just tell me what to do.\\" Monika: \\"First, we need to make sure Natsuki is comfortable. MC, can you grab a pillow from the nearby classroom?\\" MC nods and rushes out to fetch a pillow. Meanwhile, Natsuki's contractions continue, and she grips onto Yuri's hand for support. Yuri: \\"You're doing amazing, Natsuki. Just remember to breathe and keep pushing.\\" MC returns with a pillow, and they carefully position it under Natsuki's head, making sure she's as comfortable as possible. Sayori: \\"Okay, let's get Natsuki into a comfortable position for the delivery. Can you help us prop her up, MC?\\" MC: \\"Of course, whatever you need.\\" They carefully assist Natsuki into a semi-reclining position, propped up by pillows. Monika: \\"Now, Yuri and I will guide you through the delivery process, Natsuki. Just keep pushing with each contraction.\\" Natsuki grimaces in pain but continues to push with all her strength, while MC, Monika, and Yuri offer words of encouragement and support. MC: \\"You're doing great, Natsuki! Just a little more, and we'll get through this together.\\" Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the sound of a baby's cry fills the room, followed by relieving silence. Monika: \\"Natsuki, you did it! You gave birth to a healthy baby!\\" Natsuki collapses back onto the pillows, completely exhausted but filled with relief and joy. Sayori: \\"Congratulations, Natsuki! You did an amazing job!\\" Yuri: \\"You were so strong, Natsuki. We're so proud of you.\\" MC: \\"Welcome to the world, little one. You have incredible parents who love you so much.\\" As the club members bask in the joy and relief of the successful delivery, they can't help but marvel at the sheer strength and resilience of Natsuki. And although the situation was unexpected and chaotic, it brought out the best in their bonds as friends, proving that the literature club was more than just a club – it was a family."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…what on Earth happened in here?” Yuri: “I’m not quite sure myself, Monika. It looks like a tornado swept through the room!” Natsuki: “Ugh, Sayori must have been here. She’s always so messy.” Sayori: (pokes her head in) “Hey guys! Oops… Did I create a mess again?” Monika: “Sayori, we’ve talked about this. Please try to be more careful. It’s hard to find books when they’re scattered all over the place.” Sayori: (sheepishly) “Sorry, Monika. I’ll clean it up, I promise!” Yuri: “No worries, Sayori. I can help you organize the books if you’d like.” Natsuki: (rolls her eyes) “I can’t believe we have to clean up after her again.” Monika: “Natsuki, let’s try to be understanding. We’re all members of the literature club, and it’s important for us to support each other.” Natsuki: (reluctantly) “Fine, I’ll help.” (to herself) “God, all this pregnancy weight will make this difficult…” Monika: “Did you say something, Natsuki?” Natsuki: “N-nothing! Let’s just get this over with.” (The group begins to gather and sort the scattered books. Monika and Yuri help Sayori while Natsuki tries to find a place to put the books neatly.) Monika: “Sayori, maybe we can come up with a system to organize the books so they don’t end up all over the place again. Any ideas?” Sayori: “Well, maybe we can sort them by genre or author? That way, it’ll be easier to find the books we’re looking for.” Yuri: “That’s a great idea, Sayori. We can also create a book log to keep track of our collection and who has borrowed which book.” Natsuki: “I guess that could work. As long as everyone actually puts the books back where they belong.” Monika: “Exactly. And we can also encourage each other to be more mindful of the clubroom’s cleanliness. It’s important to maintain a welcoming and organized space for everyone.” (Slowly but surely, the group manages to clean up and organize the literature clubroom. They step back to admire their work.) Monika: “Well done, everyone. The room looks so much better now.” Sayori: “Yeah, it feels good to have everything in order. Thanks for helping me, guys.” Yuri: “Of course, Sayori. We’re here to support each other.” Natsuki: “Yeah, yeah. At least now we won’t have to play ‘hide and seek’ with the books anymore-” (clutching her belly) “…oh no…oh, no, no…not for another 2 months, Sakura…” Monika: “Natsuki, are you okay? What’s wrong?” Natsuki: (panicking) “I…I think my water just broke. I’m going into labor!” Yuri: “Oh my goodness! We need to get you to the hospital right away!” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll take care of everything. Monika, call an ambulance!” Monika: (dialing emergency services) “Yes, hello. We have a friend who is in labor and needs immediate medical attention. We’re at the school literature club. Please hurry!” (While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, the rest of the club members rush to gather Natsuki’s belongings and provide any support they can.) Yuri: “Natsuki, try to stay calm. Remember to breathe. We’re here for you.” Sayori: “You’re going to be okay, Natsuki. Just hang in there.” Monika: “The ambulance is on its way. They’ll take care of you, Natsuki. Just keep breathing and stay strong. We’ll be with you every step of the way.” (Natsuki manages to stay as calm as possible despite the unexpected turn of events. However, minutes go by with no sign of the ambulance.) Monika: “Why is it taking so long? They said they would be here quickly.” Yuri: “I hope they didn’t get lost. We need to get Natsuki to the hospital as soon as possible.” Sayori: “Maybe we should call them again just to make sure they didn’t forget about us.” Monika: “Good idea, Sayori. I’ll give them a call again.” (Monika dials emergency services once more, feeling the tension rise in the room.) Monika: “Hello, this is Monika from the school literature club. We called for an ambulance for our friend who is in labor, and we’re still waiting for it to arrive. Is there any update?” Dispatcher: “I apologize for the delay. We have been dealing with multiple emergencies in the area. I assure you the ambulance is on its way and should be there shortly. Just hold tight.” Monika: “Thank you, please hurry.” (Nervous glances are exchanged between the club members as they try to offer reassurance to Natsuki.) Yuri: “Natsuki, try to keep breathing. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “We’re here for you, Natsuki. You’re so brave, and everything will be alright.” (Natsuki tries her best to remain calm, but the discomfort and waiting are starting to take their toll.) Natsuki: “I can’t…I can’t do this much longer. It’s hurting so much…I think I need to push.” Monika: “Hold on, Natsuki. Just a little longer. The ambulance will be here soon. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Remember to breathe and try to stay focused. We’re here to support you.” Sayori: “You’re so strong, Natsuki. We believe in you. We’re all here for you.” (Natsuki clenches her fists and takes deep breaths, trying to gather her strength.) Natsuki: “Okay, I’ll try… I’ll try to hold on.” (Minutes go by, the ambulance still nowhere to be seen. Natsuki’s pain intensifies, and the club members become increasingly worried.) Monika: “I can’t believe this is happening. Where is that ambulance?” Yuri: “Natsuki, you’re doing so well. We just have to hang in there a little longer.” Sayori: “I’m sorry, Natsuki. I never should have made that joke earlier. This is all my fault.” Natsuki: (through gritted teeth) “It’s not your fault, Sayori. Just…please…help m-” (Suddenly, Natsuki feels an intense pressure and her body begins to push on its own, unable to hold back any longer.) Natsuki: (panicking) “Oh no, I can’t…I can’t stop it!

What’s going on?” Monika: “MC, it’s an emergency! Natsuki went into labor, and we’re delivering the baby here!” MC: (shocked) “Oh my goodness! Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “We need you to grab some hot water and towels. And be quick!” (MC rushes out of the clubroom and returns with the requested items as fast as he can.) MC: “I got them! Where do you need me?” Monika: “Take those towels and keep them warm, and then pass them to Yuri. She’ll need them for when the baby arrives.” (MC takes on his assigned role, heating up the towels and passing them gently to Yuri. The minutes tick on, and the atmosphere in the room becomes even more tense.) Yuri: “I can see the head! Keep pushing, Natsuki!” Natsuki: (straining) “I… I’m trying!” Monika: “You’re doing great, Natsuki. Just a little more!” (With one final push, Natsuki gives it her all, and a cry fills the room as the baby is born into Yuri’s waiting hands. The club members share a collective sigh of relief and joy.) Monika: “It’s a beautiful baby girl!” Yuri: “Congratulations, Natsuki. You did it!” Sayori: “Welcome to the world, little one. You have such a strong mommy.” (MC hands warm towels to Natsuki to clean up, and the room is filled with a mixture of emotions - exhaustion, relief, and overwhelming joy.) Natsuki: (tears streaming down her face) “Thank you, everyone. I couldn’t have done it without you. I love you all.” Monika: “We love you too, Natsuki. We’re so glad everything turned out well.” (Soon after, the sound of sirens fills the air as the ambulance finally arrives.) Paramedic: “What seems to be the problem?” Monika: “Natsuki just gave birth to a healthy baby girl!” Paramedic: “Congratulations! Let’s get both of them to the hospital for a check-up, just to be safe.” (The paramedics get Natsuki and her baby settled onto a stretcher and wheel them out of the clubroom. The club members watch them go, feeling a sense of accomplishment and awe at what they had just experienced.) As they clean up the remnants of the improvised delivery, they chat about their incredible day. Sayori: “I can’t believe we delivered a baby in the literature clubroom! This is definitely going down in history.” Yuri: “It was a remarkable experience, no doubt. And Natsuki was so brave throughout it all.” Monika: “She really was. I’m so proud of her. And I’m proud of all of us for stepping up and supporting her when she needed it most.” MC: “I’m just glad everything turned out well in the end. It was quite the rollercoaster of emotions.” (The club members finish cleaning up, restoring the literature clubroom to its usual order. As they gather their belongings to head home, they reflect on the highs and lows of the day and the strength of their friendship.) Sayori: “Well, I guess it’s safe to say that today was anything but ordinary.” Yuri: “Indeed. But even amidst the chaos, we managed to come together and create a truly extraordinary moment.” Monika: “That we did, my friends. And it’s moments like these that remind us why we’re in the literature club – to support one another and share in life’s joys and challenges.” (A feeling of warmth and unity fills the clubroom as they bid each other goodbye, their bond stronger than ever before. Little did they know, their journey as friends and club members was only just beginning, filled with many more unexpected adventures and heartfelt moments to come.)"},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “…what on Earth happened in here?” Yuri: “I’m not quite sure myself, Monika.
