These gearboxes contain various gears and bearings that need to be lubricated to function correctly. The use of oil in mill system gearboxes serves several important purposes: 1. **Lubrication:** Gear systems consist of metal parts that are in constant contact with each other. The primary purpose of gearbox oil is to minimize the friction between these moving parts, which helps in the smooth transmission of power and reduces wear and tear. 2. **Cooling:** The rotation of gears generates heat due to friction and the shear of the oil film. The oil dissipates this heat by carrying it away from the gears and other components. In some systems, the gearbox housing is designed to help with cooling, and the oil acts as a coolant. 3. **Cleaning:** Over time, small particles of metal and contaminants can build up within the gearbox. Oil carries these particles away from the gears and bearings. Some systems include filters to clean the oil, but in all cases, the oil helps keep the internal components of the gearbox clean. 4. **Protection against rust and corrosion:** The internal components of a gearbox are susceptible to rust and corrosion, particularly if exposed to moisture or certain chemicals. Oil contains additives that help protect these metal surfaces from corrosion. 5. **Sealing:** Gearbox oil can also aid in sealing by filling gaps between components and reducing the leakage of gases or fluids from or into the gearbox. 6. **Dampening:** Oil in a gearbox can help dampen noise and vibration, contributing to smoother gear meshing and overall quieter operation. 7. **Shock protection:** The oil forms a film between gear teeth, which can help cushion the blow of heavy loads or shocks that could potentially damage the gearbox's components. Gearbox oils are specifically formulated for their purpose, often with additives that enhance their base properties. The type of oil used in a mill system gearbox depends on the manufacturer's recommendations and may vary based on factors such as the type of gears (helical, bevel, spur, worm, etc.), the load, speed, temperature, and environmental conditions of the operation. Proper maintenance of the gearbox oil is essential; this includes regular checks of oil levels, visual inspections for contamination, and periodic oil changes to ensure the longevity and reliability of the milling system."},{"instruction":"Write a list of technologies that were common in American homes in 1971 and were still commonly found in 2021, and explain how the technologies changed between those years.","output":"Several technologies that were present in American homes in 1971 remained common in 2021, though they evolved significantly in terms of functionality, design, and performance over those fifty years.

Lucid dreaming refers to the experience of being aware that you are dreaming while in a dream, and often also being able to exert some level of control over the dream environment, characters, narrative, and your own actions. Here are some potential effects and uses of being able to lucid dream at will: 1. **Personal Exploration and Growth**: You could engage in profound self-reflection and exploration. Lucid dreams could act as a playground for your subconscious, allowing you to confront fears, work through personal issues, and explore various aspects of your personality in a safe environment. 2. **Skill Practice and Learning**: There is evidence to suggest that practicing a skill in a dream can improve your performance in real life. Lucid dreaming at will would allow you to practice physical skills, public speaking, or even problem-solving while you sleep. 3. **Problem-Solving and Creativity**: Dreams often have unique and surreal qualities that can inspire creative thought. With lucid dreaming, you could deliberately work through problems or generate new ideas, tapping into the creative potential of your dreaming mind. 4. **Entertainment and Enjoyment**: Lucid dreaming could provide limitless entertainment, as you could design and experience any kind of adventure, such as flying, exploring fantastical worlds, or engaging in impossible scenarios without any risk. 5. **Therapeutic Uses**: Lucid dreaming has been explored as a potential therapy for nightmares and PTSD. Being able to consciously address and recontextualize the fears and traumas within a dream could provide relief and coping mechanisms for sufferers. 6. **Sleep Quality**: If you're able to control your dreams, you might be able to reduce nightmares or turn them into more positive experiences, potentially improving overall sleep quality. 7. **Exploration of Consciousness**: Lucid dreaming can also be an avenue for exploring the nature of consciousness and the mind-body connection, as well as raising philosophical questions about the nature of reality. However, it's important to consider some potential downsides as well: 1. **Blurred Lines Between Reality and Dreaming**: If one spends excessive amounts of time lucid dreaming, it could potentially lead to confusion or difficulty distinguishing between waking and dreaming life, although this is a rare consequence. 2. **Sleep Disruption**: If the process of becoming lucid consistently requires waking oneself up during the night (such as with some lucid dreaming induction techniques), this could potentially disrupt sleep patterns and lead to poorer sleep quality or even sleep deprivation. 3. **Psychological Distress**: For some individuals, particularly those with certain mental health issues, there might be a risk of increasing confusion or distress through frequent engagement with lucid dreaming. 4. **Neglect of Real-Life Responsibilities**: An overemphasis on lucid dreaming might lead to escapism or neglect of waking life responsibilities and relationships. If one could control lucid dreaming with ease, it would likely prompt the development of technologies, practices, and ethical guidelines focused on maximizing the benefits while minimizing any potential risks associated with this unique state of consciousness."},{"instruction":"I meant like from waking life to the lucid dream.","output":"If you could swiftly transition from waking life directly into a lucid dream at will, this ability would be similar to mastering a technique known as Wake-Initiated Lucid Dreaming (WILD). Typically, WILD involves maintaining consciousness while your body falls asleep, allowing you to enter a dream state directly from wakefulness with an intact awareness that you're dreaming. Such an ability would have several implications: 1. **Instantaneous Relaxation and Stress Relief**: You could immediately escape stressful or unpleasant situations in waking life by entering a soothing and controlled dream environment. 2. **Immediate Problem-Solving**: Whenever you're faced with a challenging problem, you could take a \\"dream break\\" to engage your subconscious mind in finding creative solutions that you might not immediately access in waking life. 3. **Flexibility of Experiences**: You could live out fantasy scenarios, practice skills, or enjoy adventures at any time, giving you the psychological and emotional benefit of these experiences even if they are not possible in your physical life. 4. **Enhanced Learning**: You might utilize lucid dreaming for learning and memory consolidation. Some studies suggest that dreaming can help with these cognitive processes, so being able to enter a lucid dream at will could enhance one’s ability to learn new information or skills. 5. **Potential for Healing**: Like regular lucid dreaming, this ability could be used therapeutically for facing and overcoming fears, phobias, and traumas in a controlled environment where the dreamer feels safe. 6. **Personal Development**: Regular, intentional lucid dreaming could accelerate personal growth and self-awareness, as you could use this state to work on self-improvement actively. Despite these potential benefits, the ability to enter a lucid dream from a waking state at any time would also come with challenges and considerations: 1. **Safety Concerns**: There might be a need to ensure that one does not enter a lucid dream at inappropriate times, such as while driving or operating machinery. 2. **Social and Ethical Implications**: Ethical questions would arise around the use of this ability. For example, would it be acceptable to escape into a lucid dream during social interactions or important meetings, and what are the implications for personal accountability? 3. **Physical Health**: It's possible that frequent shifts from wakefulness to the dream state could interfere with the body's natural sleep cycle and potentially impact physical health. 4. **Psychological Effects**: There could be psychological consequences to frequently opting for a dream world over engaging with real-world challenges and experiences. The temptation to escape reality rather than facing it could have negative effects on mental health and personal growth. 5. **Addiction**: As with any pleasurable activity, there might be a risk of becoming addicted to lucid dreaming, leading to excessive use and neglect of one's waking life responsibilities and relationships. This speculative ability is not currently possible for humans, and even experienced lucid dreamers who can enter a dream state at will typically require a period of relaxation and a sequence of steps to achieve lucidity. Nevertheless, the idea of transitioning directly and immediately into a controlled dream state is a fascinating concept that has been explored in various works of fiction and is a testament to human curiosity about the boundaries of consciousness."},{"instruction":"further detail and depth on all, and also, include examples.","output":"If you had the power to seamlessly slip from full wakefulness into a lucid dream state whenever you wanted, the implications would be broad and transformative for many aspects of life. Let's delve a bit deeper and consider specific examples to illustrate each point. # Personal Exploration and Growth **In-Depth**: You could use lucid dreams to engage in vivid and impactful conversations with dream representations of significant people in your life, effectively role-playing challenging interactions to gain insights and prepare for real-world encounters. **Example**: If you're nervous about a job interview, you could enter a lucid dream to practice answering tough questions with confidence. # Skill Practice and Learning **In-Depth**: Much like athletes visualize their performance to enhance their skills, you could practice physical activities in a lucid dream with perfect form and without physical limitations or risks. **Example**: A gymnast could perfect a new routine within a lucid dream before attempting it physically, reducing the risk of injury. # Problem-Solving and Creativity **In-Depth**: Lucid dreaming could provide an ideal environment for outside-the-box thinking, as the normal constraints of reality don't apply. You might find a novel solution to a problem that's been stumping you in waking life. **Example**: An engineer stuck on a design problem could incubate a dream to explore unconventional structures, which could lead to an innovative breakthrough in waking life. # Entertainment and Enjoyment **In-Depth**: The ability to control your dreams opens up an entertainment landscape limited only by your imagination. You could script the most immersive movies starring yourself, live out fantasy adventures, or even recreate historical events as if you were there. **Example**: Someone might choose to experience what it's like to be a rock star performing at a sold-out stadium, feeling the rush of the crowd and the thrill of the music. # Therapeutic Uses **In-Depth**: People who suffer from recurring nightmares could purposefully enter into a lucid dream to confront and transform their fears into more manageable narratives. **Example**: A person plagued by nightmares of being chased could turn around in their lucid dream, face their pursuer, and discover that it’s a harmless creature, thereby reducing the fear associated with the dream. # Sleep Quality **In-Depth**: If you knew you could control the content of your dreams, it might alleviate anxiety around sleep and prevent tossing and turning over concerns of nightmares, thus promoting more restful sleep. **Example**: An individual afraid of having nightmares can confidently enter sleep, knowing they can alter the dream to something pleasant if a nightmare begins. # Exploration of Consciousness **In-Depth**: Having the ability to enter into lucid dreams at will could lead to groundbreaking research in understanding human consciousness and the connection between the brain and perceived reality. **Example**: Scientists might use voluntary lucid dreaming to study how the brain constructs a sense of self and reality, comparing neural activity between waking and dreaming states. # Potential Downsides 1. **Blurred Lines Between Reality and Dreaming** - **Example**: A person might begin to prefer the company of dream characters over real people, straining their relationships and social life. 2. **Sleep Disruption** - **Example**: Those who frequently induce lucid dreams might disrupt their REM sleep, leading to fatigue and impaired cognitive function during the day. 3. **Psychological Distress** - **Example**: Someone with a predisposition to dissociation might find that regular lucid dreaming exacerbates their condition, leading to increased detachment from waking reality. 4. **Neglect of Real-Life Responsibilities** - **Example**: A student might neglect studying for exams, choosing instead to repeatedly enter a lucid dream where they feel more in control and successful, which could jeopardize their academic performance. Having the ability to lucid dream at will is a profound concept that could revolutionize the way we interact with our own minds and perceptions of the world. There would inevitably be practical and ethical considerations to address, as well as potential risks to manage, but the benefits and opportunities for growth, exploration, and enjoyment would be truly extraordinary."},{"instruction":"Act like you're responding to this student's prompts and you're relating to what he has to say.

be a set of scripts meant for use with the Cheat Engine tool, specifically designed for a game called \\"MapleStory\\". These scripts allow for various modifications to the game's behavior, such as teleporting to monsters, picking up items automatically, modifying attack speed, and more. They seem tailored for users familiar with Cheat Engine's Lua scripting environment and have several command triggers and hotkeys to toggle different cheats on and off. It's important to note that using third-party tools like Cheat Engine to modify a game or its behavior might be against the game's terms of service. Additionally, using such tools can result in an unfair advantage over other players or disrupt normal game balance and can lead to account suspension or bans.

They do not require daily walks, which appeals to owners with busy lifestyles or limited mobility. Cats are also self-grooming, saving time and expense on regular bathing that dogs require. Furthermore, their instinctive litter box use simplifies cleanup and eliminates the need for frequent outdoor trips. Additionally, cats are known for their calming purrs and are less likely to create noise disturbances than dogs, making them ideal for apartment living. They can also adapt to smaller spaces and often entertain themselves with toys, requiring less interactive playtime from their owners. Moreover, cats generally live longer than dogs, offering companionship for an extended period. An example of the unique benefits cats provide can be seen in their common use as therapy animals in nursing homes or hospitals, where their soothing presence can provide comfort and stress relief without demanding much in return. Cats’ comparative ease of care and tranquil demeanor make them suitable pets for individuals seeking a less demanding animal companion with a gentle touch."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Comprobar que el Número de Cuenta sea numérico y esté en el rango correcto según la lógica (superior a 10000 y hasta 99999 inclusivo). 5. Validar que la Clave tenga exactamente 5 caracteres. 6. Confirmar que el Orden esté vacío, sea \\"Talonario\\" o \\"Movimientos\\".

Las clases de equivalencia son útiles para describir un conjunto de casos de prueba que tienen la misma naturaleza o que deberían provocar la misma respuesta del sistema. Aquí, las columnas de interés son Código de área, Identificación y Orden. Con la información que tenemos, vamos a asumir algunas clases de equivalencia estándar. A continuación, describo las clases de equivalencia para cada campo: 1. **Código de área**: Asumiremos que se refiere al Código del Banco basado en la lógica previamente proporcionada. - Clase de equivalencia válida (CEV<01>): El código de área es un valor numérico entre 100 y 999 inclusivo. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<01>): El código de área no es un valor numérico. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<02>): El código de área es un valor numérico menor que 100. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<03>): El código de área es un valor numérico mayor que 999. 2. **Identificación**: Este campo no se ha descrito anteriormente, pero podemos asumir que podría referirse al Número de Cuenta o a la Clave. Si nos referimos al Número de Cuenta: - Clase de equivalencia válida (CEV<04>): El número de cuenta es numérico y entre 10000 y 99999 inclusivo. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<06>): El número de cuenta es menor que 10000. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<07>): El número de cuenta es mayor que 99999. Si nos referimos a Clave: - Clase de equivalencia válida (CEV<05>): La clave es un texto de exactamente 5 caracteres. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<08>): La clave tiene menos de 5 caracteres. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<09>): La clave tiene más de 5 caracteres. 3. **Orden**: - Clase de equivalencia válida (CEV<06>): El campo Orden está vacío. - Clase de equivalencia válida (CEV<07>): El campo Orden contiene la palabra \\"Talonario\\". - Clase de equivalencia válida (CEV<08>): El campo Orden contiene la palabra \\"Movimientos\\". - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<10>): El campo Orden contiene cualquier otro valor diferente de vacío. - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<11>): El campo Orden contiene algún texto que no es \\"Talonario\\" cuando se espera \\"Talonario\\". - Clase de equivalencia no válida (CENV<12>): El campo Orden contiene algún texto que no es \\"Movimientos\\" cuando se espera \\"Movimientos\\". Las observaciones podrían ser simplemente notas adicionales que clarifican detalles específicos acerca de cada una de estas clases de equivalencia, como las razones para esas divisiones o los posibles efectos que los valores dentro de una clase podrían tener en el sistema. Cabe destacar que, sin información específica sobre el campo Identificación, asumí dos posibles interpretaciones que podrían cubrir casos comunes. Si Identificación hace referencia a otro tipo de dato o tiene restricciones específicas, las clases de equivalencia tendrían que ser ajustadas en consecuencia."},{"instruction":"Clases de equivalencia Código de área Identificación Orden Observaciones CEV<01>,CEV<02>,CEV<03> 400 CH1234 Cheque OK CEV<01>,CEV<02>,CEV<04> 230 DE1234 Depósito OK CEV<01>,CEV<02>,CEV<05> 200 FA1234 Pago Factura OK CEV<01>,CEV<02>,CEV<06> 99999 RE1234 Pago Boleta OK CEV<01>,CEV<02>,CEV<07> 670 LH1234 Retiro de Fondos OK CENV<01>,CEV<02>,CEV<03> 100 AB1390 Cheque ERROR CÓDIGO DE ÁREA(SE COLGÓ SISTEMA) CENV<02>,CEV<02>,CEV<03> 100000 CD1260 Cheque ERROR CÓDIGO DE ÁREA(SE COLGÓ SISTEMA) CEV<01>,CENV<03>,CEV<03> 400 ED123 Cheque ERROR CÓDIGO DE ÁREA(SE COLGÓ SISTEMA) CENV<01>,CEV<02>,CEV<04> 100 GH123345 Depósito ERROR CÓDIGO DE ÁREA(SE COLGÓ SISTEMA) - este es la estructura de otro ejemplo - basandote en esto realiza al nuevo ejemplo del banco que te di","output":"Basándonos en el nuevo ejemplo proporcionado, podemos determinar las clases de equivalencia correspondientes a cada entrada, categorizarlas como válidas o no válidas, y luego asignar las observaciones adecuadas.

Por otro lado, CEV<07> y CEV<08> son clases de equivalencia que se refieren al campo \\"Orden\\": - **CEV<07>** representa el valor de la cadena \\"Talonario\\". - **CEV<08>** representa el valor de la cadena \\"Movimientos\\". Que no estén presentes puede deberse a una confusión en mi respuesta anterior. De acuerdo con las reglas definidas para las clases de equivalencia, podemos ajustar y presentar ambos valores CEV<07> y CEV<08> en la tabla. La razón por la que podrían faltar en la tabla de condiciones de entrada es simplemente un error en la creación de esa tabla; las condiciones CEV<07> y CEV<08> deben estar presentes si se están considerando las operaciones \\"Talonario\\" y \\"Movimientos\\" respectivamente. Utilizando la información correcta que me proporcionaste creando casos de prueba basados en las clases de equivalencia, la tabla de pruebas debería incluir escenarios que validen cuando el campo \\"Orden\\" es \\"Talonario\\" o \\"Movimientos\\".

Por ejemplo, días de intervalos de velocidad (HIIT), días de carreras largas y lentas, días de tempo runs (ritmo sostenido más rápido que una carrera cómoda), y días de recuperación activa (trote ligero). 3. **Flexibilidad**: Dedica tiempo a estirar después de cada carrera para mejorar la flexibilidad y facilitar la recuperación muscular. 4. **Fuerza Corporal Total**: Después de correr, puedes hacer ejercicios de peso corporal que fortalezcan todos los grupos musculares principales. - Flexiones/push-ups: fortalecen pecho, hombros y tríceps. - Sentadillas/squats: trabajan todo el tren inferior. - Zancadas/lunges: para piernas y glúteos. - Burpees: para un ejercicio completo que incrementa la resistencia cardiovascular y fortalece músculos. - Planchas/planks: fortalecen el core o centro del cuerpo. - Dominadas/pull-ups: si encuentras una barra en un parque. 5. **Agilidad y Coordinación**: Usa elementos del parque o calle para realizar ejercicios de agilidad como saltos de cajón, escalones laterales, y ejercicios de escalera de agilidad imaginaria. 6. **Entrenamiento en circuito**: Crea un circuito que incorpore correr cortas distancias, ejercicios de fuerza y agilidad. Esto aumenta la intensidad y te ayuda a mejorar tu condición cardiovascular y muscular en una sesión. 7. **Recuperación y Nutrición**: Asegúrate de hidratarte adecuadamente y consumir suficientes nutrientes para recuperarte después de los entrenamientos intensos. La calidad de sueño también es crucial para la recuperación. 8. **Constancia y Progresión**: Empieza con lo que puedes manejar y aumenta gradualmente la intensidad y la duración de los entrenamientos a medida que ganes fuerza y resistencia. 9. **Evalúa Tu Progreso**: Registra tus tiempos de carrera, repeticiones de ejercicio y percepciones para monitorear tu mejora y motivarte. 10. **Descanso**: Incluye días de descanso activo o descanso completo para permitir que tu cuerpo se recupere. No existe una fórmula única para todos, así que es importante escuchar a tu cuerpo y adaptar el entrenamiento a tus propias capacidades y objetivos. Si tienes alguna condición médica o no has estado activo recientemente, considera consultar a un profesional de la salud o un entrenador personal antes de comenzar un nuevo régimen de ejercicios."},{"instruction":"¿Por qué ha cambiado tanto la cara de Mario casas desde que empezó en los hombres de paco hasta hoy?","output":"Mario Casas es un actor español reconocido por su trabajo en cine y televisión. Desde su aparición en series como \\"Los hombres de Paco\\" hasta sus papeles más recientes, su apariencia ha cambiado, lo cual es natural y puede atribuirse a varios factores: 1. **Edad**: Simplemente, el paso del tiempo afecta a todos. Mario Casas comenzó su carrera siendo muy joven, y con el paso de los años, su rostro ha madurado y cambiado de manera natural como sucede con todas las personas. 2. **Transformaciones físicas para roles**: Los actores a menudo cambian su apariencia física para adaptarse a diferentes personajes. Esto puede incluir alterar su peso, musculatura, cabello y otros rasgos físicos para mejor encarnar el papel que están interpretando. 3. **Estilo de vida y acondicionamiento físico**: La dieta, el ejercicio y otros hábitos de vida pueden influir en la apariencia de una persona. En el caso de Mario Casas, es posible que haya adoptado diferentes regímenes de entrenamiento y nutrición a lo largo de los años que han afectado su apariencia física. 4. **Estilo personal**: Con el tiempo, es probable que el estilo personal de Mario Casas, incluyendo su moda y peinado, haya evolucionado, lo cual puede alterar la percepción pública de su apariencia. 5. **Maduración como actor**: A medida que los actores desarrollan su carrera y maduran en su oficio, a menudo se vuelven más selectivos con los papeles que eligen y buscan proyectos que les desafíen o les permitan explorar nuevos aspectos de sí mismos como artistas. Esto puede implicar físicamente transformarse de formas diversas para cada nuevo reto actoral. El cambio en la apariencia de Mario Casas, y de cualquier persona, es un proceso completamente natural y puede ser influenciado por una variedad de razones personales y profesionales. Además, la imagen pública de un actor también puede ser afectada por la forma en la que los medios de comunicación y las redes sociales capturan y comparten su imagen a lo largo del tiempo."},{"instruction":"Quiero ser como una persona de desokupa. Diseñame el entrenamiento completo sin nada que puedo hacer en la calle después de correr todos los días para ser como ellos.","output":"El trabajo de las empresas de desalojo como \\"Desokupa\\" suele requerir que sus empleados estén en buena forma física, porque se encuentran con situaciones que pueden ser físicamente demandantes y, en algunos casos, hasta peligrosas. Por lo tanto, un entrenamiento completo para alguien que aspira a realizar un trabajo similar debería enfocarse en la fuerza, la resistencia, la agilidad y algunas técnicas de defensa personal o control de situaciones conflictivas. Aquí hay una guía general que puedes seguir, pero siempre debes recordar entrenar de forma segura y, si es posible, bajo la supervisión de un profesional. **Calentamiento:** - Comienza con ejercicios de movilidad, como rotaciones de hombros, de cintura, y estiramientos dinámicos para todo el cuerpo. **Entrenamiento de carrera:** - Continúa con tu carrera diaria, la cual es una excelente forma de aumentar la resistencia cardiovascular. Varía tu rutina entre jogs largos y lentos, sprints cortos, intervalos y tempo runs. **Entrenamiento de fuerza y acondicionamiento:** Estos ejercicios pueden realizarse con el peso corporal o con equipamiento poco convencional que puedes encontrar en parques o en la calle, como barras de mono, bancos, etc. - Flexiones (push-ups) - Dominadas (pull-ups) - Dips en barras paralelas o bancos - Sentadillas (squats) - Zancadas (lunges) - Burpees - Planchas abdominales (planks) **Entrenamiento de lucha/defensa personal:** - Considera inscribirte en clases de algún arte marcial o deporte de contacto como boxeo, krav magá, jiu-jitsu brasileño, judo, etc., para aprender técnicas de defensa y control de oponentes. **Agilidad y equilibrio:** - Utiliza pequeños obstáculos o conos para hacer ejercicios de agilidad, como slalom entre conos, saltos de cajón o escalera de agilidad. - Practica equilibrio en superficies inestables o sobre una sola pierna. **Entrenamiento de movilidad y recuperación:** - Estiramientos estáticos para enfriar. - Movilidad articular y ejercicios de flexibilidad. **Estrés y entrenamiento mental:** - Dado que el trabajo de desalojo puede ser mental y emocionalmente estresante, incluye en tu rutina técnicas de manejo de estrés como meditación, respiración profunda o yoga. **Descanso y alimentación:** - La recuperación es esencial, así que asegúrate de dormir lo suficiente y seguir una dieta equilibrada rica en proteínas, carbohidratos complejos, grasas saludables y micronutrientes. Este plan de entrenamiento es bastante general, y la adaptación a tus circunstancias personales, habilidades y nivel de condición física actual es importante. Asegúrate además de contar con el equipo de seguridad necesario y recordar que el componente mental y psicológico de manejar conflictos es tan importante como la fuerza física. Considera también buscar asesoramiento profesional de un entrenador que pueda guiarte de forma segura en tu camino hacia este tipo de trabajo."},{"instruction":"Pero necesito el entrenamiento detallado","output":"Entendido, te proporcionaré un programa de entrenamiento más detallado. Este programa está pensado para mejorar tu fuerza, resistencia, agilidad y habilidades básicas de defensa personal, que son importantes si quieres estar preparado para un trabajo que podría requerir esfuerzo físico y manejo de situaciones de conflicto, similar a las empresas de desalojo. Este entrenamiento es para realizar al aire libre, después de correr, y utiliza principalmente el peso del cuerpo para los ejercicios. No obstante, recuerda adaptarlo a tus necesidades y capacidad física actual. **Semana Tipo de Entrenamiento Detallado**: **Lunes – Resistencia y Fuerza:** 1. *Calentamiento* (10 minutos): Trotar suave, movimientos articulares y estiramientos dinámicos. 2. *Carrera* (30 minutos): Carrera continua a un ritmo moderado. 3. *Circuito de Fuerza* - 3 rondas de: - 10-15 Flexiones (push-ups) - 10-15 Sentadillas (squats) - 10-15 Dips en banco - 6-8 Dominadas (si tienes acceso a una barra) - 15-20 Zancadas (lunges) por pierna - 30 segundos Plancha frontal - 30 segundos Plancha lateral (por cada lado) 4. *Estiramientos* (10 minutos): Estiramientos estáticos enfocados en los músculos trabajados. **Martes – Intervalos y Agilidad:** 1. *Calentamiento* (10 minutos): Igual que el lunes. 2. *Intervalos de Sprint* (20 minutos): Alterna 30 segundos de sprint con 1 minuto de trote suave para recuperarte. 3. *Ejercicios de Agilidad*: - Slalom entre conos (o puntos referenciales): 4 x 20 metros. - Saltos laterales sobre línea/banco: 3 x 15 repeticiones por lado. - Burpees: 3 x 10 repeticiones. 4. *Enfriamiento y Estiramientos* (10 minutos). **Miércoles – Descanso Activo:** Dedicado a la recuperación activa, como un trote ligero, yoga, o simplemente un paseo para mantener el cuerpo en movimiento. **Jueves – Fuerza y Combate:** 1. *Calentamiento* (10 minutos). 2. *Carrera* (25 minutos): Carrera suave para calentar el cuerpo. 3. *Circuito de Fuerza* - 4 rondas de: - 10 Flexiones con palmada (clap push-ups) - 10 Sentadillas con salto (jump squats) - 10 Burpees - 30 segundos de Plancha con toques al hombro 4. *Defensa Personal/Boxeo* (20 minutos): Si tienes conocimiento en alguna disciplina, practica sombras (shadow boxing) o técnicas de defensa. **Viernes – Resistencia y Estabilidad:** 1. *Calentamiento* (10 minutos). 2. *Carrera de Larga Distancia* (45 minutos): Carrera lenta y constante. 3. *Ejercicios de Estabilidad*: - Pararse en una pierna con los ojos cerrados - 2 x 30 segundos por pierna. - Plancha sobre pelota de estabilidad o en suelo inestable - 3 x 30 segundos. 4. *Estiramientos* (10 minutos). **Sábado – Circuito Mixto:** 1. *Calentamiento* (10 minutos). 2. *Circuito Mixto* - 5 rondas de: - Sprint 200 metros. - 12 Flexiones. - 12 Sentadillas. - 12 Dips en banco. - 12 Zancadas por pierna. - 1 minuto de cuerda (saltar la cuerda). 3. *Estiramientos y Enfriamiento* (10 minutos). **Domingo – Descanso Total:** Día para descansar completamente y permitir la recuperación del cuerpo.

Y, por último, siempre es recomendable obtener la aprobación médica antes de comenzar cualquier nuevo régimen de ejercicio."},{"instruction":"¿Y si no tengo acceso a una barra?","output":"Si no tienes acceso a una barra para realizar dominadas (pull-ups), puedes reemplazar este ejercicio con otras opciones que trabajen los músculos de la espalda y los brazos utilizando tu propio peso corporal o elementos que encuentres comúnmente en parques y espacios al aire libre. Aquí hay algunas alternativas: **1. Flexiones de brazos con las manos elevadas (Decline Push-ups):** Coloca los pies en un banco, una silla o cualquier superficie elevada y realiza flexiones de brazos. Esto aumentará la intensidad de las flexiones normales y pondrá un poco más de énfasis en la parte superior del pecho y los hombros. **2. Remo invertido con una barra baja o anillos de gimnasia:** Si puedes encontrar una barra baja o anillos de gimnasia en un parque, puedes realizar remos invertidos. Mantén tu cuerpo recto y tira de tu pecho hacia la barra. Si no hay una instalación adecuada, puedes usar el borde de una mesa resistente al aire libre para hacer este ejercicio. **3. \\"Let Me Ins\\" (Usando una puerta):** Párate frente a una puerta abierta y agarra los lados de la puerta con ambas manos a la altura del pecho. Camina hacia atrás hasta que estés inclinado hacia atrás y tus brazos estén completamente extendidos. Luego, rema tu peso hacia la puerta realizando un movimiento de remo con tus brazos. **4. Flexiones de brazo con agarre estrecho (Triceps Push-ups):** Para enfocarte más en los tríceps y la parte superior de la espalda, coloca las manos más juntas (bajo los hombros o incluso más estrechas) al hacer flexiones de brazos. **5. Renegade Rows con Mochila:** Si tienes una mochila resistente, puedes llenarla con objetos pesados y usarla para hacer remos mientras estás en posición de plancha con las manos en el suelo. **6. Supermans:** Acuéstate boca abajo en el suelo y simultáneamente levanta los brazos y las piernas del suelo, manteniendo la cabeza en una posición neutral. Esto trabajará la espalda baja y te ayudará a fortalecer toda tu espalda. **7. Ejercicios de Bandas de Resistencia:** Si puedes adquirir una banda de resistencia, hay numerosos ejercicios de espalda que puedes hacer, como remos sentados, face pulls y lat pulldowns. **8. Mochila Pull-ups:** Si encuentras un árbol con una rama resistente y horizontal, puedes atar una cuerda o una toalla resistente y utilizarla para hacer una versión modificada de las pull-ups utilizando la mochila como resistencia para tirar. Incorpora algunas de estas opciones a tu entrenamiento para que puedas trabajar los músculos de la espalda y los brazos adecuadamente, pese a no tener una barra para dominadas. No olvides siempre tener precaución al utilizar elementos sustitutos para asegurarte de que sean seguros y estén firmemente anclados o soportados para evitar lesiones."},{"instruction":"Que no tengo nada para hacer dominadas. Ni barra, ni árbol, ni mochila, ni nada","output":"Si no tienes acceso a ningún equipo para realizar ejercicios que simulen las dominadas, aquí te presento algunas alternativas para trabajar la misma cadena muscular (espalda, bíceps y músculos de agarre) usando solamente tu peso corporal y sin la necesidad de equipo adicional. Estos ejercicios se enfocarán principalmente en fortalecer tu espalda y brazos de manera diferente: **1. Supermans:** Acuéstate boca abajo en el suelo. Extiende tus brazos hacia adelante. Levanta simultáneamente tus brazos y piernas del suelo, manteniendo la tensión en la espalda baja y los glúteos. Sostén la posición de 2 a 3 segundos y vuelve a la posición inicial de forma controlada. Realiza 3 series de 12-15 repeticiones. **2. Bird-Dogs:** Empieza en posición de cuadrupedia (a cuatro patas), con las manos directamente debajo de tus hombros y las rodillas debajo de tus caderas. Extiende tu brazo derecho y tu pierna izquierda simultáneamente, manteniéndolos alineados con tu espalda. Luego alterna con el brazo izquierdo y la pierna derecha. Realiza 3 series de 10-12 repeticiones por lado. **3. Flexiones de brazo con agarre estrecho (Triceps Push-ups):** Haz una flexión de brazos con las manos colocadas a la anchura de los hombros o ligeramente más estrecho para poner más énfasis en los tríceps y la parte superior de la espalda. Asegúrate de mantener tu cuerpo en una línea recta desde la cabeza hasta los tobillos durante el movimiento. Realiza 3 series de 8-12 repeticiones. **4. Dips de tríceps en suelo:** Siéntate en el suelo con las piernas extendidas frente a ti. Coloca las manos detrás de ti, con los dedos apuntando hacia tus pies. Levanta tu cuerpo del suelo, endereza los brazos y luego baja tu cuerpo doblando los codos a un ángulo de 90 grados antes de empujarte a la posición de inicio. Realiza 3 series de 8-15 repeticiones. **5. Crawl o Arrastre de Oso (Bear Crawls):** Además de ser un excelente ejercicio pliométrico para la parte superior del cuerpo, también desafía la estabilidad del core. Comienza en posición de cuadrupedia, eleva las rodillas del suelo y avanza hacia adelante alternando mano y pie opuestos, manteniendo la espalda lo más recta posible. Realiza este movimiento hacia adelante y hacia atrás por unos 20-30 segundos y repite por 3-4 series. **6. Planchas con Retracción Escapular:** Haz una plancha en el suelo (puedes hacerlo con los brazos extendidos o en posición de flexión de brazos). Una vez en posición de plancha, realiza retraer las escápulas (juntando los omoplatos) y luego separándolas (protracción). Esto ayudará a fortalecer la musculatura entre los omoplatos y la parte superior de la espalda. Realiza 3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. **7. Reverse Snow Angels:** Acuéstate boca abajo con los brazos extendidos junto a tu cabeza y las palmas hacia abajo. Mantén las piernas y los brazos rectos, levántalos ligeramente del suelo y simula el movimiento de un ángel de nieve en reversa. Realiza 3 series de 12-15 repeticiones. Recuerda siempre calentar antes de comenzar tu entrenamiento y enfocarte en la ejecución correcta de cada ejercicio para evitar lesiones. Además, es importante progresar gradualmente en intensidad y volumen a medida que aumenta tu fuerza y resistencia."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Pastel Pikachu | Printable Coloring Pages for Kids | Fun Activity Sheets | Cartoon Character Designs | Instant Download Childrens Art.

Our mission-driven start-up is in serious growth mode! \`\`\` My cover letter: \`\`\` Dear <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, My name is [name] and I am excited to apply for the position of Healthy Gamer Coach. I have been following Dr. K's content for a long time and listened to most of the interviews, some of which personally helped me, while others were insightful and explanatory when supporting my friends or community members. Now I would like to also give back. For the past few years I've been volunteering across different online communities, advocating for mental health and working with people from all over the world and having some training and professional experience in customer service which make me confident I would do well in this role. I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in software systems development and I am done with my studies. While I do not have any formal coaching certification at the moment, I am willing to fully commit to the HG certification and coaching position because I believe it offers a unique and comprehensive approach to understanding and helping both the gaming and non-gaming population. I share the HG vision of creating a positive impact and empowering people to live fulfilling and healthy lives. The psychology of the human mind and our inner experiences has always intrigued me. Every person is different and unique, and thus special and complex in their own way. They have their own path and trajectory to be understood. It's a real joy to me to listen earnestly to people, see how they work, be genuinely there for them, and see them grow. Sometimes even just reflecting something back to someone can lead to insights. For instance, researchers in 2013 coined the term SDAM, which stands for Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory, a rare condition where a person does not vividly re-experience their past. When I came across an article describing this, something clicked and I immediately recognised this in me. It feels like I am trapped in the present moment and while this brought me a lot of heavy feelings at first that I had to process, I came to realize over time that it can be a gift when it comes to service professions such as this one. I am easily able to be truly there in the moment, and give the person I'm with undivided attention, seeing them as they are without involuntary flashbacks, many intrusive thoughts, or images. This helps me to create a safe and supportive space for my clients, where they can feel heard and understood, and explore their own thoughts and feelings without judgment or distraction. I also believe that bringing insights and cultivating moments of enlightenment to others is very fulfilling and rewarding, both for me and for them. Another factor that might make me unique as a candidate is my upbringing. I immigrated with my parents from Poland to Ireland when I was 10 years old, leaving behind my friends, language, and culture. This experience taught me how to adapt quickly to different people and environments, as well as how to appreciate diversity and inclusion. I have also been on the internet for a very long time and connected with people across the world. I respect and value people's differences in values and different aspects of their identity. Moreover, this culture shock has also given me a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities that people face when they move to a new place, change their lifestyle, or pursue their dreams. I know how it feels to be lonely, lost, or misunderstood, but also how it feels to find a new home, community, or a new purpose. I can empathize with clients and help them navigate their own transitions and transformations, and celebrate their achievements and growth. I'd also like to mention that I have had a lot of experience dealing with a variety of clients and customers, some of whom had complex trauma, depression, body dysphoria, and other difficult issues or requests. I can maintain professionalism and composure, and handle these situations with patience and respect. Boundaries are important and I recognize as a coach I would not be there to diagnose or give medical advice. I also know how to manage my own stress levels and regulate my emotions well, through meditation and my own support network. In conclusion, I am very interested in and excited about working as a Healthy Gamer Coach and I believe I have the traits and skills to be a great coach. I am eager to join the team and learn from you! Please feel free to contact me through my email or discord (tet.exe) If you have any questions or would like to discuss my application further. I would appreciate the opportunity for an interview and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Opening Address: I adjusted \\"Dear Dragon Ding,\\" to \\"Dear [Hiring Manager's Name] or Healthy Gamer Team,\\" because the specific name \\"Dragon Ding\\" is unusual and may have been a placeholder or an error. If the hiring manager's name is known, use it; otherwise, addressing the team or company is more appropriate. 2. Introduction: I condensed your introduction for a tighter, more professional opening. This retains all your essential points but presents them more succinctly. 3. Certification and Commitment: I maintained the point about a lack of formal coaching certification but rephrased it to emphasize your commitment to obtaining the Healthy Gamer Coach Certification, thus aligning your intentions with the expectations of the job posting. 4. Personal Experience with SDAM: I shortened the explanation of your personal connection to SDAM for conciseness while keeping the essence of why it makes you an attentive and present coach. 5. Cultural Background: I briefly covered your immigrant experience that contributes to your strengths in understanding diversity and assisting clients with transitions without delving into excessive detail. This keeps the letter focused on how your experiences will benefit your coaching clients. 6. Professionalism and Experience: I streamlined your explanation of dealing with various client issues to avoid redundancy and concentrate on the message that you have the required professionalism and composure. 7. Conclusion: The final paragraph is tightened up to reiterate your interest, offer a call to action, and invite the hiring team to reach out for more information or an interview. 8. Sign-off: I've provided a professional close with a warm yet formal touch. Throughout the cover letter: - I eliminated some personal anecdotes and details that, while interesting, could distract from the primary message of your professional readiness and alignment with the Healthy Gamer's values. - I also corrected some minor grammatical issues and improved sentence structure for better flow and clarity. - Specific details like contact information should always be accurate, so I made sure to indicate placeholders where your personal information should be entered.

While the content provided a good sense of who you are and the experiences that have shaped you, in the context of a cover letter for a job application, brevity and relevance are crucial. Recruiters and hiring managers often have limited time and may quickly skim cover letters, so getting to the point promptly and effectively can increase the chances that your key attributes and fit for the job will be noticed. A more concise cover letter that highlights the most relevant qualifications and experiences is generally preferred. The goal is to capture the reader's interest and compel them to learn more about you in an interview setting, rather than providing all the details upfront. Moreover, cover letters are typically recommended to be no more than one page, with clear and direct paragraphs that are easy to read. My revision aimed to distill the essence of your original letter while keeping it within a more typical and manageable length for the reader, increasing the likelihood that your entire message will be received and appreciated."},{"instruction":"I think the SDAM section is too condensed to the point it's missing context, the condition is very obscure and the hiring manager would not understand it without context I think","output":"You're correct that providing enough context for the hiring manager to understand the significance of your condition is crucial, without assuming prior knowledge on their part. With that in mind, let's offer more clarity on SDAM while still maintaining brevity.

A significant moment for me was learning about Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory (SDAM), a rare condition characterized by an inability to vividly recall personal past experiences.

This process would likely require the introduction of large quantities of oxidizing agents into the planet's atmosphere, causing chemical reactions that fundamentally change the planet's makeup. As a result, the planet may no longer be able to sustain life as we know it, and would instead become a hostile environment for Earth-based organisms. This transformation could also potentially lead to the emergence of alien life forms that are adapted to the new conditions created by the oxidizing agents. Overall, the concept of turning a planet into an alien homeworld through the use of oxidizing agents is purely speculative and would require a vast amount of resources and technology beyond current capabilities.

These civilizations may have evolved independently or may have been colonized by another advanced species. The atmosphere of these planets is likely to contain high levels of oxygen, making it suitable for aerobic respiration and complex life forms. The extraterrestrial sophonts on these planets may have evolved unique adaptations to cope with the high levels of oxygen, such as efficient oxygen utilization systems or protective mechanisms to prevent oxygen toxicity. These civilizations may have developed advanced forms of agriculture, technology, and social structures to support their society in the oxidizing environment. They may have also developed space-faring capabilities and may have established colonies on other planets within their star system or beyond. Exploring these oxidizing planets inhabited by extraterrestrial sophonts presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study alien life forms and to learn more about the potential diversity of life in the universe. It also raises ethical and moral questions about how to interact with these civilizations and how to ensure mutual respect and understanding between different intelligent species."},{"instruction":"Next type of oxidizing ocean planet is unlikely to becoming planet inhabited by extraterrestrial sophonts","output":"These types of oxidizing ocean planets are unlikely to become inhabited by extraterrestrial sophonts due to various factors such as extreme conditions, lack of resources, or the absence of suitable environments for complex life forms to evolve. One example of an oxidizing ocean planet that is unlikely to be inhabited by extraterrestrial sophonts is a planet with extremely high levels of corrosive substances in the water, such as sulfuric acid or other toxic compounds. These harsh conditions would make it difficult for any form of life to thrive, let alone develop into a sophisticated civilization. Another example is a planet with a lack of resources necessary for the development of complex life forms, such as essential nutrients, energy sources, or stable environments. Without access to these fundamental building blocks, it would be incredibly challenging for any life forms to evolve intelligence and technology needed to become sophonts. Additionally, some oxidizing ocean planets may have extreme environmental conditions, such as high temperatures, pressure, or radiation levels, that would be inhospitable to most life forms and prevent the evolution of complex organisms capable of forming civilizations. While these types of planets may not be suitable for the development of extraterrestrial sophonts, they still offer valuable opportunities for scientific exploration and study of unique environments and potential forms of alien life. Researchers can learn more about the limits of life's adaptability and gain insights into the diversity of planetary conditions that can exist in the universe."},{"instruction":"[PANOPTICON, THE ARCANUM] Sayori: “Wow…Mirage was…quite sandy.

We believe this figure may be connected to the disappearance of the Opossum pet eggs.” Sayori: “We’re going to keep investigating and see if we can track down the culprit.” Jaki Whisperwind: “Thank you for your efforts, wizards. I have faith in your abilities to solve this mystery. Keep me updated on your progress. And remember, the Arcanum is counting on you.” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Jaki. We won’t let you down. We’ll get to the bottom of this and recover the missing pet eggs.” Trixie Sphinxeyes: “Onward, Sayori.

Here's how this could be done well: 1. Shared Experiences: Highlight their shared history and the struggles they've faced together. Scenes that feature them reflecting on their past and how much they've grown could solidify their bond. 2. Mutual Respect: Portray a mutual respect for each other's abilities and choices. Gendry could admire Arya's skills and independence while Arya acknowledges his craftsmanship and resilience. 3. Companionship: Show them enjoying each other's company without any romantic undertones. They could be depicted as partners in sparring or even sharing light-hearted moments that reflect a brother-sister dynamic. 4. Supportive Interactions: Have them support each other through various challenges. This could mean Arya encouraging Gendry in his pursuit of legitimization or Gendry being there for Arya as she grapples with her identity. 5. Non-Romantic Physical Affection: Including hugs, pats on the back, or even playful wrestling, can express their closeness without signaling romance. 6. Separate Personal Arcs: Keep their individual storylines prominent, showing that while they have a strong bond, they are not defined by their relationship with one another. 7. Addressing the Romantic Possibility: Acknowledge the potential for romance but have the characters expressly choose the sibling dynamic over it, perhaps in a conversation where they discuss what they truly want from their relationship. 8. Exploring Similar Goals: They might fight for a common cause or share a vision for the future of Westeros that further ties their lives together in a platonic but powerful way. 9. Reinforcing the Theme of Chosen Family: \\"Game of Thrones\\" deals heavily with the concept of family, both blood and chosen. Strengthening the idea that Gendry and Arya are a family by choice could add depth to their relationship. 10. Avoiding Jealousy Subplots: Stay clear of tropey jealousy plots that could imply a romantic interest. Their interactions with other characters should not hint at any underlying romantic tension. By focusing on these elements, their relationship could be portrayed as a strong and supportive siblingship that enriches both characters without becoming romantic. It would be essential for the writers to consistently depict this dynamic so that the audience understands and appreciates the depth of their platonic bond."},{"instruction":"[PANOPTICON, THE ARCANUM] Sayori: “Wow…Mirage was…quite sandy.

I’m truly sorry for causing trouble.” Sayori: “It’s okay, Tezcatlipoca. Just remember to think before you act next time. Let’s return these pet eggs to Jaki and make things right.” [THE ARCANUM, HALL OF SORCERY] Jaki Whisperwind: “You found the missing pet eggs! Thank you, Wizards! I’m relieved to have them back, safe and sound.” Sayori: “It was our pleasure, Jaki. We’re just glad we could help.” Trixie Sphinxeyes: “Tezcatlipoca has learned his lesson and won’t be causing any more trouble. All’s well that ends well, as they say.” Jaki Whisperwind: “Indeed. Your efforts are greatly appreciated. Please, take these rewards as a token of my gratitude.” Sayori: “Thank you, Jaki. We’ll continue to serve the Arcanum and protect its knowledge.” Trixie Sphinxeyes: “Onward, Sayori. Our journey in the Spiral continues.

Третья струна (sol, G) - позволяет звучать ноте A открытой. 4. Четвертая струна (re, D) - также позволяет звучать открытой, представляя собой корневую ноту аккорда D (ре). Пятая струна (la, A) и шестая струна (mi, E) обычно не задействуются в базовых грифах для аккорда Dm, чтобы сохранить более чистое и фокусированное звучание аккорда. С точки зрения гармонии, в аккорде Dm присутствуют ноты D (ре) - тоника (основная нота), F (фа) - минорная терция и A (ля) - квинта. Пятая струна на гитаре настроена на ноту A, что в принципе соответствует квинте аккорда, и её иногда могут включать в звучание аккорда, особенно если аккорд следует плотное и полное звучание по всему диапазону гитары. Однако, наиболее распространенная позиция для аккорда Dm направлена на то, чтобы сосредоточить звучание вокруг верхних звуков (звуков высокой октавы), особенно если аккорд играется в аккомпанементе и нужно избежать басового перегруза, который может возникнуть при игре на нижних струнах. Именно поэтому пятая струна часто не задействуется в аккорде Dm."},{"instruction":"из каких нот строится аккорд b7?","output":"Аккорд B7 (си септима, или B dominant seventh) строится из следующих нот: 1. **B** (си) — тоника или основная нота аккорда; 2. **D#** (ре-диез) — мажорная терция; 3. **F#** (фа-диез) — квинта; 4. **A** (ля) — малая септима, или доминантная септима. Конкретно, если взять стандартный гитарный гриф для B7, то он может играться так: - 2-я струна (B), открытая, нота B (си) — тоника. - 5-я струна (A), на 2-м ладу, зажимается пальцем, нота B (си) — тоника. - 4-я струна (D), на 1-м ладу, зажимается пальцем, нота D# (ре-диез) — мажорная терция. - 3-я струна (G), на 2-м ладу, зажимается пальцем, нота A (ля) — малая септима. - 1-я струна (E), на 2-м ладу, зажимается пальцем, нота F# (фа-диез) — квинта. 6-я струна (E) обычно не играется, поскольку она не входит в строй этого аккорда и может испортить его чистоту и звучание. Таким образом, аккорд B7 включает в себя богатое звучание благодаря добавлению малой септимы (A) к треугольнику B-D#-F# (си-ре-диез-фа-диез), что придаёт ему характерного тензионного звучания, часто используемого в джазе, блюзе и других жанрах для подготовки разрешения на следующий аккорд, например, на тонику."},{"instruction":"можно ли тогда не зажимать пятую струну в этом аккорде? она ведь в открытом виде нота ля","output":"Да, вы правы. Если не зажимать пятую струну (A) в аккорде B7 на гитаре и оставить её открытой, эта струна будет звучать в унисон с 3-ей струной (G), на которой зажимается нота A (ля) на 2-м ладу, усиливая звучание малой септимы в аккорде. Такое распределение нот совершенно приемлемо и может добавить дополнительную глубину и объём звучанию аккорда. Стандартное построение аккорда B7 на гитаре выглядит так (начиная со струны E большой октавы): - 6-я струна (E) - не звучит или зажимается на 2-м ладу для ноты F# (опционально) - 5-я струна (A) - зажимается на 2-м ладу для ноты B (или может оставаться открытой для звучания ноты A) - 4-я струна (D) - зажимается на 1-м ладу для ноты D# - 3-я струна (G) - зажимается на 2-м ладу для ноты A - 2-я струна (B) - открытая, звучит нота B - 1-я струна (E) - зажимается на 2-м ладу для ноты F# Таким образом, если вы не зажимаете пятую струну, в аккорде всё равно будут присутствовать все необходимые ноты, которые дают звучание B7. Но следует помнить, что в некоторых музыкальных контекстах могут использоваться различные вариации звучания аккорда, и в зависимости от нужного звука гитарист может выбирать вариант с открытой пятой струной или с зажатой пятой струной на 2-м ладу."},{"instruction":"[THREE POINTS, AZTECA] Sayori: \\"Whoa...look at this place!\\" Trixie Sphinxeyes: \\"Don't get to caught up in the sights, Sayori.

Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not The Apple Vision Pro is the best consumer headset anyone’s ever made — and that’s the problem. Nilay PatelJan 30, 2024 at 11:00 PM GMT+9 There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at 3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs 500. 7Verge Score 3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The huge case costs an additional 199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for 199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging 3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Vergenone One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Vergenone The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.","output":"애플 비전 프로 리뷰: 마법같지만 한계 존재"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I firmly believe that the suspension of my account was an error, primarily due to the fact that it had been accessed and compromised by an unauthorized individual without my knowledge or consent.

In response to your latest correspondence seeking the reason I believe the suspension was in error and the basis of my appeal, I have outlined the following explanation and pertinent details. Firstly, it's imperative to understand that my belief in the suspension being erroneous is rooted in the fact that my account was compromised. This violation occurred without my knowledge, and the account misuse by an unauthorized party directly led to the suspension. I had no involvement in, and did not consent to, any actions taken during this time that might have violated Twitter’s community guidelines. It was only after noticing abnormal activity that I became aware of the security breach and took immediate steps to regain control and secure my account. Since then, I have: - Changed my account password to a robust and unique one, - Enabled two-factor authentication to bolster security, - Reviewed and audited recent account activities to ensure their alignment with Twitter's rules, and - Committed to upholding the community standards and guidelines set forth by Twitter. This suspension has impacted my ability to connect and engage with my personal and professional networks on your platform, which is invaluable to me. Therefore, my appeal is based on my deep-seated commitment to being a responsible member of the Twitter community and my proactive measures to prevent any future security issues.

However, running on different ports is simpler and is a good approach in development environments. Below are two separate Flask API files and how you would run them on the same server on different ports: First Flask API (\`app1.py\`): \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, jsonify app1 = Flask(__name__) @app1.route('/api/v1/resource1') def resource1(): return jsonify({'message': 'This is resource 1 from API 1'}) if __name__ == '__main__': app1.run(port=5000) \`\`\` Second Flask API (\`app2.py\`): \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, jsonify app2 = Flask(__name__) @app2.route('/api/v2/resource2') def resource2(): return jsonify({'message': 'This is resource 2 from API 2'}) if __name__ == '__main__': app2.run(port=5001) \`\`\` To run both apps on the same server, you can simply run them in different terminal sessions, specifying different ports as shown in the \`if __name__ == '__main__'\` block at the bottom of each script: \`\`\`bash python app1.py \`\`\` \`\`\`bash python app2.py \`\`\` The first Flask instance will be available at \`http://localhost:5000/api/v1/resource1\` and the second at \`http://localhost:5001/api/v2/resource2\`. If you wish to run both on the same port, it can be more complex and usually involves WSGI middleware or using a WSGI server like Gunicorn to dispatch requests to the correct application. There may need to be a reverse proxy like Nginx in front of the applications to handle routing at that point."},{"instruction":"Giving this error: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5001","output":"The error \`Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5001\` indicates that your Flask application running on port 5001 is not accepting connections. This can happen for a variety of reasons. Here are a few troubleshooting steps: 1. **Ensure the application is running**: Verify that you have started the second Flask application and it's running on port 5001. 2. **Firewall settings**: Ensure that your firewall settings are not blocking connections to port 5001. 3. **Port already in use**: Make sure that the port 5001 is not already being used by another process. You can check this with the following command: - On Unix-based systems: \`lsof -i:5001\` or \`netstat -tulnp | grep 5001\` - On Windows: \`netstat -ano | findstr :5001\` 4. **Correct binding**: By default, Flask applications bind to \`localhost\` (\`127.0.0.1\`). If you're trying to access the application from another machine, this won't work. In that case, you should have the Flask application bind to \`0.0.0.0\` so it's accessible from external machines. Update your \`app2.py\` to run like so: \`\`\`python if __name__ == '__main__': app2.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5001) \`\`\` 5. **Check the response time**: If the server did start but then immediately stopped or crashed, you might see a connection refused error by the time you try to connect. Make sure the server is still running when you receive the error. 6. **Check application logs**: Flask usually prints out information about errors it encounters while trying to start the application. Check the terminal or console window where you started \`app2.py\` for any error messages. Make sure you've addressed these potential issues, and try to access your Flask application again. If you're still encountering issues, consider checking the configuration in your \`app2.py\` file and ensuring that there's no other code that might be causing the Flask app to crash or fail to start correctly. If the problem persists, you might need to investigate further by looking into the application logs for more detailed error messages, or consider whether there might be an issue with the Python environment or dependencies."},{"instruction":"Suggest a name for app that generates interview question based on job description","output":"Here are some creative and descriptive name suggestions for an app that generates interview questions based on job descriptions: 1.

It suggests that personal strength and resilience are forged through adversity. While the phrase is not a verbatim excerpt from religious texts or from a specific well-known figure, it captures an idea consistent with many religious and philosophical traditions - the notion that trials and difficulties can be transformative, leading to personal growth and increased fortitude. The concept echoes ideas found in Christianity and many other faiths, where trials and suffering are sometimes seen as part of a divine plan or a means of spiritual growth and development. For example, in the Bible, James 1:2-4 discusses facing trials with joy because they test faith and develop perseverance. It is essential to recognize that this saying is not meant to trivialize the real pain and hardship that come with life's battles. Rather, it is intended as a source of encouragement, emphasizing that even the most challenging experiences can contribute to making someone stronger. However, interpretations of this sentiment can vary widely, and not everyone may agree with or find comfort in this perspective. Different people and cultures have their own ways of understanding the role of adversity in life and personal development."},{"instruction":"Gone Update 2 Holding her closer to his pulse, Max stood against the metallic wall of the NICU; her fluttering heartbeat was steady and reassuring. “Hey, beautiful, I suppose it’s just you and me now. But we’ll be alright; I promise you. Despite all your suffering, you’re still far more resilient than your old man.” He paused, suddenly feeling his mere twenty-six years of life weighing on his frame as he offered equilibrium to her dependent, innocent youth as she gazed up at him. Her hazel irises stared intently into his matching brown and amber aspect, and a smile crossed his lips. “My God, I can’t believe you’re already two days old, and rest assured, sweetheart, you’re the most precious thing I have in this world.” His voice trailed off as his gaze lingered on her translucent skin, her veins shining under the soft light. “And you’re so gorgeous, so incomprehensible; I—I can’t quite believe you are alive. A little fighter, and brave as hell, too.” Exhausted but at peace with her fitting perfectly between his wrist and forearm, he sighed with a profound sense of fulfillment and redemption. Standing placated in the encroaching dusk, as he pulled her closer against his chest, his gaze drifted to the glass window beyond him. Amidst the fading light that outlined buildings and wisps of smog, he felt a sense of perishing hope; one that he clung to with grit and resolve, if only for her sake. As he gently traced her delicate features with his finger, she reached up and hooked her index finger over his thumb, creating a fragile but powerful lifeline, transpiring through the grim backdrop of her makeshift nursery. “Lily bean, your mother, she—” He hadn’t the words nor the heart to continue as her intricate grasp on his slid away, her hand splaying across her chest as she slipped into slumber. “You can sleep; there’ll be plenty of time to stare at this mug in the morning.” He exhaled with relief and wonderment as her consciousness seemed to melt away into the bleak atmosphere. As her breathing then fell against his palm, it was a soothing rhythm, leaving him stupefied in the peaceful lull of the ebb and flow. He muttered, “Why must you look like her? Well, you may actually resemble me, and now that’s not so great, huh?” Max smiled at her oblivion, which he prayed would not betray her someday. “Don’t you dare wake up yet,” he muttered, her sleeping form realigning itself against him, seeming to sense his presence as her pulse slowed. Unable to even move, Max stood with the sleeping infant, too exhausted to lay her down in the clinical humidicrib of sallow light that hummed with a disconcerting tone. Overwrought with fatigue yet savoring the fleeting moment of solace, he willed it to engulf him in its embrace. Although it tore incremental fragments from his being, it was solace all the same. It had been a long, dragging night of insomnia, flashbacks, and a lack of food as Max leaned his spine against the hospital corridor. There, he had set up a vigil, not leaving the hall as he watched her in his peripheral vision. “How could Elara abandon the poor kid? How could she just—” As he ran a calloused hand over his unshaven jaw, Max contemplated the impending call that suffocated his tattered psyche. It was the inevitability encroaching on his raw nerves as his fingers unlocked his phone with trepidation and scrolled for her number. “Elara? I don’t know. You discharged yourself; no, I don’t care where the hell you are—she can’t survive on air. No, but please just tell me what I can do to fix—No, of course I love you. I’m alone in a hospital with our—well, my daughter.” The phone went dead in his ear, and he let it backflip into his lap with resignation. Returning to his haphazard scattering of belongings, he pried open an energy drink, drained it, and then crushed the aluminum under his fingers; the distorted metal absorbed his anguish and dismay. All his disbelief and heartbreak over Elara seemed weightless, meaningless, and forgotten as he heard Lily’s almost inaudible whimpers floating in the air. “Right here, Lily, I’ve got you,” his hoarse voice found her, and her fussing stopped in an instant. His softening voice whispered intangible phrases; he half-sang, his deep-throated hum off-balance from his persistent fatigue. A lullaby of his own, off-key, intermingled with her cries, permeated the space between them. His eyes floated shut, and images filled his mind: cowering under creaking stairs as the weight above him lurked closer, his young screams pleading for mercy. “I didn’t mean to, Dad—” Suddenly, everything grew colder, then a fierce heat drove through him, making him flinch at the recollection. A boot sailed past his head; then a knife. Falling to his knees, petrified, he soon felt the lurid warmth of urine saturating the tongues of his shoes, filling the perforated leather with liquid. His head hung in shame and degradation. “Max, now I will have to punish you for ruining my floorboards, son.” As Max felt a dark shadow encompass his juvenile mind, he cried even harder, shaking like an untethered string. A balloon burst under the thud of a boot, and he yelled in confusion, “Is it because of my birthday party? I didn’t want to turn five anyway! I’m sorry…” Max reopened his eyes, back in the present once more, his pulse thundering out of sync with his infant daughter’s. Her accelerated heartbeat still seemed calmer than his own. “I’m sorry you’ll be in here a while longer, my little bean. Can’t take you home yet. But you’re gonna love your own crib. It’ll put this humidifier to shame. You just wait and see…” With a heavy weight in his lungs, almost drowning him with the proximity of his flashback, his mind flickered to Elara. Holding the still-crying Lily, determined to soothe her discomfort in the cool night, he could still taste Elara, feel her in his clothes, and it sickened his heart. As he placed Lily into her contraption of a crib with reluctance, he sank against the wall, overcome with a wave of utter frustration. He had to fight the torrent of unfiltered torment that tore through his clenched teeth. “Pick up, please… Elara? Oh, God, just tell me why—No, I haven’t slept; she’s in a critical condition. Don’t worry about it. I know it’s heartbreaking. What, so I’m not going through hell right now? No, please, I’m sorry—” Again, the line died out in the shell of his ear, wrenching a knife through the lining of his stomach. Exhaustion gnawed ferociously at his brain, and he relented to sleep as it finally came, like a tower of building blocks smashing down upon him. “No, Max, I—it’s because I love her that I can’t watch her suffer…” Elara’s tear-stained blue gaze pierced into his as she stood under the harsh lights of the parking lot. Like a deer in headlights, her frightened expression held an acceptance of fate. Max, reaching out and grabbing her wrist, infused his pleas of incredulity into the closing space between them. “Elara, please, I love you, but I love my child, damn it… And I’ll be there when she takes her last breath if that’s what I have to do for her.” Elara’s torn expression ripped at his heart as he conceded the truth. “Say it, Elara… Just put me out of my misery. Because what is it that we can’t work through? What has happened to us? That you’ll leave me here with our child?” After a long, wrenching silence, she whispered, “I love you. Nothing is wrong with us, Max, but if I lose her, I won’t be the person you fell in love with. I won’t even want to know myself. I… I’d rather pretend in my mind she’s going to survive this—” He interrupted her, anger and frustration gnawing at him. “What if she survives this? Then what will she have? I can’t protect her if I’m not there. This is toxic, Elara. This is the definition of selfishness. Just go… This is what’s breaking us.” As he lifted his gaze, she was already walking away, her head in her hands. The streetlight flickered out for a moment, and he was swallowed by darkness, sinking as the concrete seemed to embrace him when he fell. His pulse raced to the surface of his throat as he retched himself into stark consciousness, gazing around in sheer panic. He ran a hand over his drawn features. Upon hearing his child’s faint breathing—a newfound white noise that salved his frayed nerves—he relaxed against the wall. Six weeks had passed, and Max had been offered respite housing by the hospital, where he had relocated his sparse belongings. The imprint of his spine against the wall had almost been visible when a social worker assigned him a bare-boned apartment with a single bed and central heating. This particular morning, his clothes were fresh, and his face clean-shaven as he entered the NICU and locked eyes with his daughter. “Morning, Gorgeous.” The mild rays of morning bled into the room, embracing her in a blanket of warmth, the humidicrib encasing his daughter with a plastic film of isolation. He staggered over to where she lay and lifted her into the air. “My little girl is six weeks old. I swear you’re growing bigger every single day.” With grit under his nails and darkness pooling under his eyes—an accumulation of the passing days—he beamed at Lily with awe, relief, and pride. Holding Lily in his outstretched arms, the golden light outlined her body, bathing her in an aura of warmth. As he stared into her irises, mesmerized, a gentle smile broke out across her lips, reaching her gaze and filling it with specks of recognition and joy. “You’re smiling,” he laughed, a surge of pure elation coursing through him. “Of course, you’re smiling, because you know I love you, right?” His own deep hazel eyes glazed over, and he was unable to look away. His daughter, in an exuberant moment free from agony, maintained her entrancing grin, and his arms trembled as he lowered her onto his forearm, holding her close. “Your first smile, perhaps? I’ll have to ask the nurses… they’ve taken such phenomenal care of you. You’ll be at home before you even know it.” Her invigorated breathing, steady and strong against his skin, gave him something palpable to focus on as he lamented the grave reality and cursed under his breath. “I miss her, you know, but I worry about her, too. Maybe someday she’ll find her way back to us. But I’ll be here for your first word, first step. You’re gonna come on jogs with me, huh? Yeah, that’s right, you are.” Max, beaming with admiration and genuine excitement, felt a weight lift from his shoulders that had almost clung like shrink wrap to his existence. Lily was coming through the ordeal of being born with weak organs, and while she still seemed vulnerable, she shone with fighting spirit. “You’ve been listening to me blabber on, huh?” Max whispered as her eyes danced with the rays of daylight. “Daddy passed out last night 'cause he was so tired, but I’m here now, and I ain’t going anywhere, kiddo.” At that moment, she fell asleep in his arms, and his moments were up. He lowered her back down into her protective bubble and sank down into a plastic chair adjacent to where she drifted into sleep. He’d even dressed decently, without noticing, just to visit her, his grey Henley accentuating his dark boots. “Hey, well look at that, you got me dressing up again.” He ran his tongue along his teeth, an absent-minded gesture as he smirked in disbelief. Standing up, he smoothed out his jeans and headed for the cafeteria, a raging appetite igniting in his stomach. Soon, his nostrils were affronted with the sizzling aroma of scrambled eggs, bacon rashers, and ground coffee. Overwhelmed by his apparent hunger, he wasted no time heaping his tray to the edges with the enticement of an actual meal. As he began entertaining his newfound hunger by the forkful, a figure slid down into the booth beside him. “Hey, you’re that guy with the gorgeous little angel, Max, right?” Caught off guard, he gazed away from his food, drinking in the angular features of a fellow parent he’d met in the halls weeks earlier. “Hey, Sam, yeah, my daughter Lily, she was born with a lot of complications, but she’s doing so well; how’s your son holding up?” Looking out at the distant footpath beyond the cafeteria, Sam smiled, a hopeful look crossing his gaze. “James will be discharged tomorrow; my wife is packing his things as we speak. Cystic fibrosis is a hard road, but it just means every day is meaningful for us, y’know? Makes you appreciate each microscopic little moment that much more.” Max nodded in silence before sighing. “Yeah, I’m glad he’s doing well. And you and your wife, too. I wish you all the best. Stay away from here, alright?” Sam offered Max a look of empathy, his hollowed eyes filled with a sense of rigor that Max could slowly feel fabricating within his own soul with the passing days. “We’ll try,” Sam replied, placing a hand on Max’s shoulder. “Life gets hard in here, but you’re looking well; how is Lily doing?” Max, unflinching under Sam’s open palm, gazed at his half-empty tray. “She’s… amazing. Six and a half weeks old. They say she’ll be home in a month or two. The time just—.” “Yeah, it flies, but that’s life. I’ll stop by with Madison and James tomorrow to say goodbye. You and Lily take care, alright?” Strategically pushing the eggs around his plate, too unnerved to eat, he paused before taking an overloaded bite for lack of another option. “Yeah, I’m keeping it together for her as best I can. Thanks for everything, Sam, it means a lot.” Sam rose from the booth and gathered his own bearings, a nervous energy in his fingers as he let go of Max’s shoulder and headed for the exit. “Don’t mention it, Max, you’re one hell of a strong guy, and I respect that. Glad to have met you, buddy.” Max then scraped the remaining eggs from his plate, dragging his fork across the surface of the tray, leaving trails of bacon grease winding in all directions. “I’m gonna carry that kid out of that damn intensive care unit yet. One day that’ll be us, at least it had better be before I have some sort of early life breakdown…” Aiming his words at the unappealing, tepid coffee, still untouched, he then dropped the fork in disengagement, swiveled his chair around, and trudged out of the booth. “One genuinely disgusting hospital meal closer to freedom, Max.” Heavy with weariness, he reveled in a moment of procrastination, folding a grocery list and tucking it into his pocket; his mental too-hard basket with disinterest. His mind drifted to thoughts of what Lily would look like as she grew older, and how it might feel to grasp her hand as she learned to walk, the enriched soil beneath her feet, and the adorable attire he would adorn her in. Petite, pastel pink dresses, and sherbet green and sky-blue striped rompers. Max, flopping onto the bed of his apartment, remained lost in thought, all manner of milestones occupying his mind rent-free. Then, just as he’d found sweet reprieve, a worrying thought intruded on his daydreaming; his iced bachelor’s degree. His mind lurched, his fingers fumbling with a loose thread on his jeans as he searched helplessly for anchorage in their worn fabric. When Elara had fallen pregnant, it had been far from smooth sailing, and Max’s plans of grad school had been dashed to care for her and cope with Lily’s precarious arrival. It was all he’d dreamt of, yet it had somehow found its way to the background and had never resurfaced again. “Oh dear God, I don’t want to think about how I’ll provide for her,” he groaned, and retrieved the list of toiletries and household items he needed to obtain from the local supermarket. With his own scrawled handwriting staring back at him, he toyed with the edges of his reality, the fatigue penetrating him once more. “You’ll figure it out, Max, you’ll make her just as proud as she makes you… maybe.” As noon approached, and with no time for lunch, Max coaxed his uncooperative limbs off the stiff bed and turned away from the mirror in avoidance as he cleaned himself up and tended to mundane chores. His hands gripped the shopping cart as he tossed items in with an ever-present nonchalance. His afternoon spent away from his daughter seemed bleak yet inescapable, as if its irreversible damage to his time with her wasn’t even worth the trouble. The technicolor blur of the aisles whizzed past as he crossed off the unyielding list of requirements, his pen in his teeth as he hummed his way through the isolated store. Before long, it was over, and he hauled two overstuffed grocery bags through his apartment door with resolve, crashing on his board of a bed with a sense of accomplishment as he offloaded the provisions onto the floor. His evening visit to Lily was a beacon of hope, as he prayed she was still kicking and not in any pain. Just then, his phone blared at him, and his hand flew to his bedside and he slid the screen open. “Yes, it’s he… I’ll be there immediately.” Max’s complexion drained of color as he entered the hospital, bypassing check-in with raw panic tightening his airways . As he approached the NICU, he was met by the firm restraint of two open palms against his chest, a nurse staring him in the eyes as she spoke with a measured, arresting gravity, grinding him to a halt. “Lily’s heart rate dropped quite low in the last hour , but we have stabilized her for now, Mr. Hawthorne. Still, we need to ask you to wait here while we ensure she remains stable… she’s a strong girl and she’s holding steady.” “Just, please get her through this… I—” Max stumbled backward, easing himself into a waiting room chair and gripping the arms, his veins visible against his contracted muscles as he clenched the leather to stall his pulse. Stunned into silence, he dropped his head into his hands, clutching at his temple and interweaving his fingers through his dark hair. \\"We’ll keep you updated on her condition, and if she remains stable, you’ll be able to see her , contact might be limited unfortunately, but you can most certainly let her know you’re here.” The nurse, wearing an empathetic smile, left Max to his thoughts as he denied himself so much as a glance toward the steel doors barring him from his daughter. Time seemed convoluted as he glanced at the digital minutes on his phone screen, relieved to still be alone in the hall; she was remaining stable, and that was all he could hold onto as the room tilted. Another minute passed, the longest of his life, and his instincts drew his eyes to the long, curtain-drawn window that shielded him from his worst fears. His potential nightmares were crashing down around him, the corridor narrowing with each second that he was left to his own devices. Disorientated by the distortion of time , he was carried into an ocean of harrowing scenarios , lost in terror as the reality consumed him, the ward slipping away beyond his frozen gaze at the floor. Awoken from his stupor by a piercing cry, the heavy metal doors swung open, and a nurse ushered him inside the neonatal unit, where Lily’s pinkened flesh radiated with the aftermath of adrenaline. Her cold, lilac lips and fragile body, covered in ECG monitors, lent her a stark sense of vulnerability against the solidified beeping of machines. The room held an eerie stillness, as the residue of his nightmares prevailed. As Max leaned over Lilly’s recovering body, he reached down and traced his thumb down her bare abdomen, finding her featherlight pulse and following it through her veins. Rendered speechless, only the sensation of her heartbeat underneath his own offered him sanity. But it was more than enough; he let his fingers rest over her pulsing sternum, as he stood rooted to the spot, his feet seeking purchase from his boots. Monitoring each beat under his thumb, it became a grounding rhythm in the dying afternoon light.” The impending night leered at his phone with threat and uncertainty, the digital seven o’clock screaming at him. The frigid, impersonal apartment that awaited him faded to the back of his clouded senses; what if she had another scare, and he was asleep? His legs, refusing to automate, stayed rigid in their place, and he gripped the side of the humidicrib in exhaustion. The staff surely wouldn’t appreciate him holed up in the corridor, but he wore an expression of exemption from visiting hours as Lily slept soundly under his lingering touch. Removing his hand from her chest, he hauled a chair over to her side and unloaded his body weight onto its hard surface. “Don’t scare your old man like that again, alright?” His answer came in the form of a barely audible sigh as she dragged in a breath and coughed with struggle in her voice. Max let his eyes slide closed, as he mumbled, “We’re both too young for a cardiac arrest, Lily bean. You hear me?” Finally succumbing to unconsciousness, Max slept without dreams, lost in a blanket of abyssal darkness. Two weeks had passed, and Max was finally able to raise Lily high into the air and sit her in his lap. Her immune system was strong enough to tolerate longer periods of freedom from her prison of controlled humidity. Placing a knitted pink beanie over her dark head of hair—one that he and Elara had chosen months ago—an amalgamation of triumph and sorrow filled his eyes as he tugged it down around the pink tips of her ears. She gazed up through the woven fabric and flashed a brief smile before reaching for his clavicle, her hand resting in the hollow of his neck. “Hey, there’s that smile. Gotta keep you warm out here, huh?” he said as he wrapped her in a blanket of pastel stripes, the banana yellow bringing forth the pigment in her irises. “Well, who’s looking more edible than the food around here “ Max slipped his phone out of his pocket, aiming the periscope lenses at her features and snapping a photo. Her pupils , dazed by the flash , widened and seemed enthralled with his device, reaching out and kicking her feet in amusement. “You’d better get used to having your selfies taken, bean” . Max chuckled to himself and he categorised the picture under a brand new album, alongside a few snaps he’d snuck without using his flash, of Lily in her first moment after entering the world . Less than glamorous, she was smothered in crimson blood, crying , and not expected to be the object of photographs two and a half months later . But there she was , complacent in his lap as he grappled with the notion of wrangling a car seat into the back of his Voltzwagen Beetle . Aerodynamics left him bemused as he he held her up and trailed her through the air , weaving her back and forth. Then as he settled her back down into his lap he tugged the hem of her beanie down over her eyes , lifting it again in an impromptu game of peek a boo. “Where’d Lily go, there she is” he teased at his uncomprehending infant, more for his own amusement. Before he knew it her time was up and he placed her back in her crib, still clad in her drooping beanie and vibrant blanket. \\"Sleep tight my little bean burrito\\" Max muttered as he slipped out of the room. As Max pried open his blearing , bloodshot eyes, the ceiling greeted his mechanical stare . There were motions to run through, not that caring was easy, as his inbox flooded with messages he ignored. He never heard from Elara, abiet stressing that Lily was passing through milestones like water rushing down a drain . His desperate fingers , slicing through the still autumn air, couldn’t preserve them beyond digital snapshots. “She’ll come through that door and want her back….” He sighed heavily, playing the scenario over on his mind , until it ran like a slideshow . Whether it was a dream or a nightmare seemed imperceptible. And irrelevant, as Lily’s first , second and maybe even third smiles all scorched in his vision . Her first months of life had been proliferated with health scares , yet she had preserved into her third month, and his mind was clogging life a drain of stormwater. Her first breath was still swirling like a half -drowned leaf as her first laugh threatened to pile onto top of it , breaking the dam. But he’d found somewhere to preserve it, along with the chilling recollections of her bruise covered body as they’d placed her lifeless body on Elara’s chest, as they’d both waited for that first gasp of air to fill her lungs . “I can’t do this anymore” he groaned into the crook of his elbow as he sat upright . “I have to.” As the crisp October air invigorated his senses, he approached the NICU, holding the only toy he’d laid hands on since the days of his own buried childhood. Tucked out of sight behind his back, the stuffed bear served as a mascot of potential enjoyment and optimism, unlike anything from his past. Despite his seemingly traumatizing journey to this moment, having always avoided toy stores and even playgrounds to dodge childhood shadows, here he was. Goofy and excited with an overstuffed animal in hiding , awaiting its thrust into his daughter’s limelight. Harmless and endearingly sweet with its button eyes and embroidered nose—it had captivated him through the gift shop window for weeks. His purchase had been drastically delayed—strict safety protocols at the NICU prohibited any external and potentially unsanitary objects to safeguard the vulnerable infants from autoimmune risks. The particular details had eluded his memory as he finally relented to the streak of anticipation igniting his soul. He felt he might implode or combust into a thousand brilliant stars, never having dreamt his own child would come to see the day when he’d arrive carrying gifts. ‘Her first birthday had better watch out,’ he acknowledged with mischief dancing in his eyes. As he prepared to enter the ward, he caught a glimpse of his own reflection, a smile creeping across his lips But just as he did so , a thought intruded on his composure , twisting nausea through his gut.. The sunken spade , lying inferred in a sandpit flashed through his mind , eliciting a chill of terror down his spine . The grass was intoxicatingly green , as he stood wailing, sand beneath his toddler stance. “Max , pick the spade up or I’ll-“ . He slammed his eyes shut and shook his head , returning his thoughts to the cloying sweetness of the bear . The light returned to his eyes as he straightened out his shirt as the excitement refilled his veins. ‘You sap, Max,’ he muttered to himself with a wry grin, seconds before stepping into the room where his daughter awaited her first anniversary gift. ‘Three months old, kiddo. The least I can do is give you a reason to make fun of me when you’re older” Her hazel eyes flew open and she expelled a yawn as Max tickled her navel, eliciting a seemingly delighted gurgle . “You’ll be laughing soon , especially if Daddy outdoes himself when you’re six months old “ Max said, overjoyed as she writhed under the sensation, and he could almost hear her laughter , bright and effervescent and filled with the essence of summer. “When I get myself back to college…you’ll have a lot more toys. “ Max unveiled the bear and lowered it down beside her pillow, the azure bow around its neck matching one of the stripes on her blanket. ‘Your Mom bought you multicoloured everything so all the clothes we picked would be perfect, no matter what color eyes you came out with…’ he trailed off, Elara’s vibrant blue eyes now a haunting memory he slipped aside. Turning her head and scaling the huge bear with her widened gaze , Lily reached up and clutched her fingers in the bear’s alluring fabric, smiling in fascination. “Happy third month, Lily bean” . She gave Max another broad smile , and he grabbed the bear at the nape, dangling it teasingly above her, making circular motions with its flaccid legs. Then he swooped the bear down , its body embracing her, and he laid it across her body as she wriggled and cooed from underneath. “You really are going to be the death of me. I can’t hug you as often as I want but, now you have him to fill in huh?” Lily seemed to approve, as he he freed her of the polyester bear and plopped it beside her head, its size emphasising her lack thereof. It came at him with interrogation and an insidious lack of threat all at once. Max answered the call , as he stood in the corridor just inches where Lily was sound asleep . “'Elara? Yeah, I’m holding up. Lily? She’s thriving… No, there were a few times it came close to losing her, you know that. I don’t know how I could stand it, I just did. You want to see her? I know, and I understand that, but, are you ready to accept that she’s still liable to plummet, that any milestone she hits could undo itself? It’s how it’s been since she was born. I have to live with that in order to take those damn photos. Yeah… I don’t want to keep you from her, but, you weren’t here for any of it. Well, they didn’t force me into the street, I have paid accommodation. No, we aren’t ok, and we might never be, the fact that you knew about my own childhood and you walked away from her, I’ll never be alright with that Elara. Never. Well, you don’t have custody of her right now, and maybe you need to think about why you really want her back in your life? Because she’s healthy right now? As in today? Because there’s no consolation here. No guarantees and I’m struggling-” It tore through Max’s chest like a serrated blade, all the torment and isolation came to the surface, and he bit it back. “‘No, Elara, if you do come back into her life, you can visit her alone. I won’t try and stop you, but, I don’t—No, I can’t see you. No, I really can’t right now. I won’t be here, so schedule that time and let me know. Do I still? Don’t ask me to answer that. Goodbye, Elara.’” He locked his screen, an alien feeling of yearning washing through him, followed by his blood running cold. His hand, flying to cover his stare as his retinas burned with tears, trembled as he sank into a low crouch against the wall. Lacing and unlacing his boot as his vision hazed with conflict, he finally dropped the phone to the floor and rested his head behind him, his larynx streaked by a few stray tears. “‘Shit,’ he muttered, sinking a solidified palm into his hair.” “Hey Lily bean” , he smiled , her fourth month having come like a freight train. “I guess your Mom just- I guess she isn’t ready for someone like you , huh? An enigmatic lil’ force to be reckoned with , yeah? Luckily Daddy likes gambling , and risky behaviour, they’re your best qualities, bean.” His fingers ran through her soft hair, dishevelling her hairline and combing strands into place. “But you’re coming home soon , and I have a mobile filled with stars for you -“ . Her attention on his every word, though it held no meaning other than rambling, caused her to reach at his hair and clutch a fistful between her fingers, laughing in amusement and enthralment as she travelled to his eyebrow . He raised it , finding her exploration as fascinating as she seemed to. “Yeah , I’m a handsome devil, it’s where you get your insatiable beauty after all“ he jibed with affection , in an attempt to drown Elara from his mind . “I bought your crib from Ikea , and assembled the flat pack without reading the instruction manual. Don’t tell anyone.” Winking at her, she hovered her thumb near his eye and he brushed it aside before taking a stab to the eyeball. “Hey , watch out “ he said with another laugh of enrapture, not nearly finished with the interaction as he envisioned the entire nursery . “I can’t wait to take you home , you smell so-“ He inhaled the scent of lavender soap and baby powder, a raspberry musk that stayed in his lungs and imbued his nostrils . “They showed Daddy how to bathe you but he’s getting there …” A deep sense of satisfaction settled in Max's chest as Lily's unique scent overwrote the smell of Elara , an aroma he was coming to forget, a puzzle piece aching in his genetic makeup, but missing from his blueprint nonetheless. \\"You're it , Lily Bean, don't you go anywhere till I get back .\\" It was a long, stretching motorway of potholes and untied plot ends winding him into a gridlock , as he found himself swamped in static cars. He surfed through channels , the songs castrating his patience , as he chewed on the side of his check with agitation. It wasn't an urge to return to his empty dwelling, it was more the inertia in itself , masticating his sanity. A meal , the kind that grew edible inside of a microwave, awaited him in an unappealing fashion. Eating was a chore , akin to preparing a last minute crib for Lily , kept on standby, for when she was discharged. But being prepared for an upsurge was equally as challenging as steeling himself for a setback or scare, the lights of the traffic hounding his sight as he strummed his fingers against the wheel. The respite housing was far more luxurious than the streets , but it was still a transitional pit stop and not a real home . “Stanford… God I miss Newport already “ Just then, his phone screamed to life and he unlocked it in panic “Max speaking- no, why? her sole next of kin? No, no-Elara and I- I’ll try and reach her. No I’ll be there , there’s bad traffic but no, of course. She’s stable ? Now? She- . Alright. No, I can drive. I can drive. Elara , I hope so. I will” . As his face whitened , Max slid his thumb to Elara’s number without even blinking as he swallowed down scathing fear that lashed across his tongue. “Elara , get yourself to the hospital now, they , they said Lily was dead for four minutes, I don’t know , it doesn’t matter -just get there please , I’m trying to get there -ok-you too.“ Max slammed his hands against the wheel , cursing through his teeth. His daughter had been pronounced clinically dead for four entire minutes , and the road was slipping out of control beneath the wheels . Four minutes . With his corneas submerged in tears, he counted another four , imagining her lifeless body being resuscitated , after moments of actual death inhabiting her body. Max was almost sick , but held down his bile as the the traffic moved at long last. “Max , Elara is in the waiting room . Lily is stable but her heart rate stopped for three seconds and she was resuscitated twice since we spoke with you . “ His feet refused to cooperate as the nurse gestured towards the NICU as he interrupted “She died ? She- what happened? . He felt the all too familiar restraint against his shoulders , a touch that filled him with dread . “yes , but she’s alive and stable , Max . We will let you know the moment anything changes and it’s safe to see her. “ The tension in the corridor was thick , and ice cold, yet heated with desperation as he locked eyes with two familiar blue pools of heartbreak and confusion. “Elara? . Max turned the corner in shock , his eyes halted by her tear-stained gaze.” Max, I-I’m sorry , I just, we’re going to lose her .” She broke down into tears , and he pulled her into a tight embrace from the chair beside her, interjecting in a whisper “No we aren’t —“ Then as all his nightmares and heartache submerged from his insides, he held her tighter, burying his head in her bare clavicle and unleashing a torrent of grief . She rubbed his shaking back in silence, and they stayed interlocked in united fear and anticipation. As minutes passed , Elara ran a finger along the tender spot between Max’s earlobe and hairline, “I’m sorry I wasn’t here for the both of you -“ in a strained attempt to fend off her pleas, Max pulled back, “Elare please don’t , I told you I can’t …and I meant that . “ Her expression of hurt and regret , washed with fear, shattered him as he redirected his helpless eyes to the floor, disengaging himself from her grasp. The metal doors opened , and a nurse whispered against the tense, unforgiving backdrop of the corridor, “She’s holding stable , but we suggest you stay here for a few hours , it might not be easy to see her at this stage, but in a little while perhaps-“ In a swift moment , Max was on his feet “Why not now?” . The nurse was firm , restraining Max as she had before “She cannot be touched, nor moved. I understand this may be difficult. It’s your choice , but I think you’re best to give yourself some space from this for now. She’s coming through though. We’re doing all we can. “ Max , retreating to his chair beside Elara, offered up his ultimatum in a reluctant tone. “I will stay here till she’s ready . But I need to process this alone…” Elara , gazing at Max with genuine hurt, kept to herself. “No, I don’t mean to come storming back into your life after my actions . Whatever you need Max, I made a lot of mistakes and I’m not seeking forgiveness.” Max whispered a drained “thank you “ in Elara’s direction, as she shifted to the other end of the corridor , staring at her shaking hands , establishing her own vigil for the hours to come, her grief and concern etched in her every mannerism . As the hours stretched , he stole glances at her form , still crying and he spoke with a horse rasp in his voice. “You can see her first, you need to do this Elara-“. She nodded , a brokenness lacing the gleam of pain in her eyes. He soon succumbed to his fatigue as he watched her enter the room where Lily lay on the outskirts of death, and let his unconscious mind consume him. Elara approached the humidicrib, her limbs aching with remorse , her voice buried in a rasp of sandpapered tears , lost for even a single word . “ Lily-Mommy’s here- .” Gazing down at her unmoving body , covered in monitors and oxygen tubing , she seemed so fragile and untouchable . Elara reached out, her fingertips grazing Lily's delicate lips as their lack of warmth sent a trickle of disbelief down her spine that built as she stumbled backwards. The sight wrenched out a chunk of her heart , her breath hitching as tears flooded her airways . \\"I can’t …not again…no\\" She slid to her knees, her hands flying to her gaze as the blue ribbon of the stuffed bear on top of pile of clothing caught her eye, its hue matching Lily’s lips and mottled skin. Crouched on the floor by the humidicrib , Elara broke down into a flood of relentless grief, unable to offer another glance to her suffering child , whom she hadn’t cradled since birth, when she had struggled for her first , delayed breath. “I can’t belie-”she choked out , gathering herself into a ball and unleashing her sorrow, seeming unable to close a floodgate that had been ripped open. The room crept around Elara as she mourned her infant's fragile life, beating away before her, flickers of Lily's first lungful of air searing through her mind, leaving her in pieces . \\"Mr Hawthorne, your daughter needs to be fed, normal formula , finally , if you’d like to see her, she’s faring quite well \\" a bright voice offered him a jolt into wakefulness. “Where’s Elara?”Max asked , sensing he had fallen asleep, and scanning the room with disorientation. Grabbing the nurses apron , he clutched at the plastic with fog clouding his mind. “How long was I- how could I fall asleep?” . The nurse harboured a reassuring smile as she placed a hand on his stiffened shoulder , “you had quite an intense reaction back there, and it’s perfectly normal for the body to shut down , besides you’ll need all the strength you can muster. But you weren’t out long. Maybe a few hours. ” . His eyes drifting beyond the glass doors and into the outside world he pressed “And Elara? “ . “She needed some air , but I’m sure she’s around . You both need some space to process Lily’s scare. “ As he scraped a rough hand down his face , Max straightened in his chair and stood slowly, regaining his balance in the midst of his pure exhaustion. “I need to see my daughter. Before I fall over , have an aneurysm or maybe both” . As he cast his bloodshot aspect on Lily , her porcelain flesh absent of healthy color , his stomach churned . “She’s ready to eat, huh? Id say so. Poor thing.” Max soon had Lily in his lap , a bottle of tepid formula in her bluish mouth, as the color seemed to stall in her cheeks, not blooming across them as she smiled at her father in bewilderment. “Listen, bean, I know you can’t understand a word of this but, don’t you die on me ever again, or I’ll have to kill you myself .” Smirking at the irony, he felt a wave of emotion barrage him out of nowhere , and he cleared his throat. “Just, stay with me , bean” he whispered roughly. Just as he had her settled and satiated , suckling on the bottle with peace infused enthusiasm , his phone went into overdrive , a flood of email notifications pouring onto his screen . A vibrant image of Sam, Madison and James shone with a pixilated glimmer of hope and resilience, on the top of the digital pile . James was clutching a fistful of green grass, soil crumbling from his six month old fingers, as the message divulged , “To celebrate his half year , Maddy just wanted to take him to the park to have a normal day. With pollen, and flowers he shouldn’t really touch, a few hiccups and minor problems , all of that. But my kid really loved it , so it was one of the better days . How is Lily doing?. That little angel must be nearly four months old huh?” The word “nearly” leapt out from the type font, reminding Max of how significant a word “nearly” was. His sluggish fingers typed a response, a sense of yearning overwhelming him. What his vision framed was a picture much less vibrant in hues , but more akin to a Polaroid, tangible and real. And could be torn right down the middle , or disintegrated and lost forever. He swallowed a think lump in his throat , and diverted his attention back to Lily, who was fussing as he hoisted her over his shoulder and rubbed her back . “If that was dinner, you’ve had it” he joked , retrieving her stuffed bear and nestling it back in her crib, before laying her to rest beside it. “Last time , I told you not to go anywhere” Max was caught mid sentence by the weight of the moment and he slipped out of the room, only to stop and gaze back through the window at her tiny form, engraving the memory. “Sleep tight , bean” She was standing by the waterfront, the hospital safely in the background as she wrapped her arms around herself against the autumn air. “Elara? You saw Lily last night?” Max lent his weight to a rigid bench beside where she stood , staring out at the tranquil water , not pressing for details. “Yes , Max, I- it was absolutely heartbreaking, I broke down , and I haven’t slept-. How do you keep standing there, while she-. ” Max held his gaze steady toward the internalising lull of the water’s liquid surface, feeling as in he could fall in and drown as he aligned his back against the wood behind him. “I don’t know , Elara , sometimes I really feel like I’m going insane-but I’m still here . I have to be, and that’s it. She isn’t always in that state, she has her highs , and she’s keeping me going: it’s the difference between emancipation and acceptance I suppose. I mean , don’t you think I know fear, Elara? Real fear. That her last breath is as significant as her first laugh, and I don’t know which I’ll be met with? Or when she’s screaming in pain in the middle of the night and I can’t-“ Max’s eyes fell away as he struggled to find the words “…And yeah, I have to live with that , too” His stare not leaving the lake, Elara joined Max on the bench , her eyes following to where his gaze penetrated the distance. “I just -Max I don’t know if just loving her is enough. A piece of me dies every time she comes so close. It’s like holding together- I don’t know- shattered glass perhaps ? It’s so painful. But she’s a part of me. I gave birth to her, Max- so don’t you dare think- ” “Elara, I’m sorry -“ She inhaled, and her response was barely audible amongst the quiet atmosphere that dissolved the space between them as she leaned against his arm, relenting . “I just feel so guilty , but if I fall apart, what will she have then? Even less. Do you think it’s easy to hold all the pieces together. I can’t control -“ Looking into her eyes with a mix of empathy and utter despair , Max braced his hands on his knees. “Should it be easy? Elara, I know the hell you went through to survive the pregnancy-I nearly lost -No, I can’t do this again, to lose you twice -“ His eyes glassed over as he struggled with the words “I care about you Elara, but-“ he paused, pulling her toward him in a sideways embrace, not meeting her gaze and steeling his composure. “But our child , she’s fighting damn hard to stay alive. And you expect not to fight even harder? “ Max shook his head , torn into splinters that roughened his voice as he removed himself, leaving a chilling gap in his wake. “If you leave again, I don’t know how she’ll do without her mother in her life. But as for us, that door is closing . I can’t stand it Elara, I really can’t-“ . Elara , shrinking into her coat and seeming to guard herself with its layers, dug her nails into her sleeves as she folded her arms, composing herself . “I understand, but I still care about you , Max, even if my own fear has driven us apart-It’s unfair , and I don’t -I don’t want to lose either of you-“ Max , turning his head and meeting Elara with his grave undertone, let the cracks in his voice fill with resolve, his knuckles whitening as his fists clenched. “Elara, fear is not something you get to indulge. What Lily goes through , we can’t afford to let fear take over-you have to fight for her. Please- “ his voice broke away, and he stared at her, awaiting any response , as he ground his palms against the fabric of his jeans . “Max , I - I have caused you so much pain and I don’t deserve the door to even remain ajar but please-“ . Max sighed, his voice a faint whisper of resignation, thick with the strain of a bond that still tied them . “I need some space , you know how to find us if you change your mind about what this involves ., hell, I can’t imagine what it’s been like for you. But I need some time to figure things out, because we’re losing pieces already.“ Max turned and walked along the winding concrete maze of the sidewalk, the cool air seeping through his bones as his measured strides hit the asphalt with decisive resolve. Elara , tracing the ripples in the water with her downcast expression, wrung her hands as remained alone on the bench, facing a profound moment of solitude. The disquiet of the three am bustle that only a hospital could generate, other infants crying in distress, machines sounding off alarms, paediatricians rushing to save the lives of fragile babies; Max barely registered it anymore. Lily was finally five months old , and possessing the strength and vitality of the median three month old child. “My bean is now a little cucumber.” he announced as he admired how far she’d progressed, as she unleashed a tiny giggle into the air. Max gave a hearty chuckle as his readjusted the squirming Lily in his lap. “Finally, we’re going home , all the way back to California. And Mr bear her gets the aisle seat , huh?” Max winked at Lily, her entire face enlightening with the promise of a jovial, healthy day, her pulse steady, her respiration clear and sparkling with life. \\"Laugh away bean, the sound is glorious, I bet it could actually cure some cancer, send some kids home\\" . Her tiny laugh rang out through the metallic halls , attracting the appreciative smiles of passsing medical staff who called out as they steered antiseptic disposal bins, \\"ah, what a beautiful laugh , Miss Hawthorne!\\" Max, propping her up on his lap, gently lifted her hand, guiding it in a wave that resembled the playful twist of a light bulb being screwed in . \\"Wave , princess, you have admirers it seems. Got some big shoes to fill huh? “ Letting her arm fall back to her side, she flailed in excitement, grabbing at his shirt and scrunching it in her grasp. “You’re really perking up, I waited so long for this…” . As his phone lit up with discharge instructions and digital flyers from various social service links , bombarding his eyes with all the information. It was an hour’s drive to the airport, and his mind drifted to his earlier wrestle with Lily’s car seat. At least it was roadworthy, if a little askew , her blanket stuffed into place so she’d be warm enough. Then the outstretched list of medications he needed to collect from the pharmacy gnawed at his fidgeting hands , as he turned his focus back to his overstimulated daughter, begging for his attention with her every manoeuvre. “Alright, alright, that’s enough outta you, wriggler.” His own laughter sprinkled over hers , interspersed and forming a harmonious sound that reverberated on the metal walls. The air was biting, frost outlining her sighs of contentment as a doctor ruffled her beanie under his palm. “Congratulations Max, here are the discharge papers. It’s all official, she’s your little survivor now, you take care, Mr Hawthorne , we don’t want to see either of you back here anytime soon .” Max bounced the smiling Lily against his quilted overcoat, her tiny jumpsuit plastered with the insulation of blankets . “Thank you doc, she’s one hell of a champion and I’m sure she’ll charm all the stewards on her first plane ride . I can’t thank you and the medical team enough for all you’ve done” Max nodded, and carrying Lily down the path to the parking lot, his lungs filled with the fresh air, and he felt truly alive after an encompassing comatose state. Much like waking up , he succumbed to the urge to yawn, invigorated by the journey ahead, and the lure of a brand new day. Then as he walked towards his car, a wooden bench came into view , the same one he shared with Elara the last time they had spoken, bearing a hollow reminder of all that time continued to consume. His body froze mid-stride as its wooden surface affronted him, stirring up a wave of loss and regret. As he turned away, a mix of triumph and freedom flooded his chest, replacing the desolation that once shadowed the car park where he had begged Elara to stay months before. It seemed there were traces of her everywhere, haunting him and lingering in the hospital’s atmosphere , but he left them behind as he hoisted Lily higher into the air. The chapter was finally closing , the paintwork of his Volkswagen Beetle shining immaculately, beckoning him away from the memories , its azure shade promising hope and clear blue skies . “Time to hit the road , Lily bean. God only knows we’ve waited long enough for this…” As the sun sank lower beneath the horizon , Max settled Lily into the warm, toasted cradle of her car seat. With a sense of pride, he admired his success in assembling it, fastened her seatbelt, and then sank into the rich , comforting leather of the driver's seat. As the ignition revved to life , he pulled out onto the motorway, stealing glances at her face in the rear view mirror as she seemed besotted with the trees that flew by in a blur. His grip on the steering wheel, he flicked the indicator and ran his hands along the gear stick, savouring the feeling of control. Before long, they had reached the airport , and after boarding the plane with her stuffed bear beside her in the seat between them, the ground was fading away into oblivion . “Bye bye New York , wave to the Statue of Liberty , Lily, she ain’t got nothin’ on you kiddo” Max smiled to himself as the ascent burst his eardrums , and Lily seemed unfazed as she sucked on a pacifier, her hands impressed against the glass in wonderment. Clouds spanned for miles , a pastel intertwinement of orange and magenta hues, the skyline dotted with the disappearing city .","output":"It seems you've shared a very detailed and emotional narrative.

Consider the following points when deciding to include more details: 1. **Relevance to Plot**: If Elara's health complications are crucial to the story's plot or have a significant impact on the characters' development, elaboration might be beneficial. It can provide readers with a deeper understanding of the characters' motivations and their past struggles. 2. **Character Development**: Detailing Elara's complications could add depth to her character, enabling readers to empathize with her decisions and actions throughout the story. It may also shed light on the dynamics between her and Max, and how their experiences shape their relationship and their approaches to parenthood. 3. **Theme Exploration**: If themes of struggle, resilience, or overcoming adversity are central to your story, examining Elara's health issues may reinforce these themes. It can exemplify the physical and emotional battles the characters face. 4. **Pacing and Focus**: Be aware that adding more backstory can affect the pacing of your narrative. Make sure that the information you provide serves to advance the story rather than distract from the main focus. If the added details slow the narrative down too much or veer off into unrelated territory, it might be better to keep it brief and relevant. 5. **Emotional Impact**: Detailing the life-and-death situation could heighten the emotional stakes, making the joys and triumphs resonate more powerfully with the reader, as well as the moments of despair. 6. **Backstory Balance**: While it's important to develop backstory, you also want to balance showing the past with moving the narrative forward. Consider whether the additional information creates balance in the story or if it's better left implied. Ultimately, the decision to elaborate should be based on whether it enhances the story and provides valuable insight into the characters and their relationships. If you do decide to elaborate, consider doing it in a way that is emotionally impactful and serves to enrich the overall tapestry of your narrative."},{"instruction":"What about referencing Lily’s birth , to show its impact on Elara when Lily doesn’t breathe right away","output":"Referencing significant events such as Lily's birth and the immediate health scare can be a powerful way to highlight their impact on the characters, especially Elara. Here are some considerations for including this reference: 1. **Emotional Resonance**: Lily's difficult birth and her initial struggle to breathe can create a profound emotional foundation for the story. This moment would likely be one of the most intense and traumatic for any parent, which can explain later actions or emotional states, particularly for Elara. 2. **Character Motivations and Development**: Elara's reaction to this critical moment can provide essential insight into her character. It can help readers understand her subsequent choices, fears, and perhaps her struggles with mental health, guilt, or protective instincts. 3. **Plot and Theme Enrichment**: This event can bring depth to the themes of resilience, the fragility of life, and parental love. It can also become a pivotal plot point that sets the tone for the entire narrative and drives the story forward. 4. **Readers' Understanding and Empathy**: Including the scene of Lily's birth, where she doesn't breathe immediately, can evoke readers' empathy and forge a stronger connection between them and the characters. It allows readers to experience the high stakes of the situation and the fragility of Lily's life right from the start. 5. **Narrative Contrast and Dynamics**: The traumatic start to Lily's life offers a stark contrast to any moments of hope, joy, and recovery that follow. This enhances the narrative dynamics, making the highs feel higher and the lows more profound. 6. **Foreshadowing and Symbolism**: Lily's birth struggle can foreshadow her tenacity and fighting spirit. It may also serve as a metaphor for the struggles the family will face going forward, including the challenges in Max and Elara's relationship. To integrate this reference effectively into your story, consider doing so through a character's reflection, a flashback, or a dialogue that resonates emotionally with the reader. The key here is to ensure that the scene is not just a recount but a meaningful moment that echoes throughout the narrative, influencing characters’ feelings and actions. Remember to balance the detail and intensity of this event with the narrative's overall tone and pacing. You want it to be a compelling part of the story without overwhelming the reader or overshadowing other critical events in the narrative."},{"instruction":"What other moments could help flesh out a fast moving plot that I want to give some “bulk” but stay relevant","output":"To add \\"bulk\\" to fast-moving plot while maintaining relevance, consider incorporating moments that enhance character development, broaden the world-building, and deepen the themes. Here are some suggestions that can enrich your story without derailing the pacing: 1. **Character Backstories**: Flesh out your characters by revealing slices of their past. These backstories should serve to explain their motivations, fears, traits, and decisions in the present. Provide glimpses through dialogue, flashbacks, dreams, or introspection. 2. **Key Interactions**: Include interactions that highlight relationships between characters. Show how they support, conflict, or grow with one another. Relationships can be built or tested through both small gestures and major, pivotal exchanges. 3. **Subplots**: Weave in secondary storylines that are related to the main plot but focus on other aspects of the characters' lives. This could be romance blooming amidst turmoil, a rivalry or a conflict, or a character's personal goal or hobby that resonates with the main theme. 4. **Moral Dilemmas**: Present characters with tough choices that highlight their values and priorities. How they navigate these crossroads can provoke thought and conversation about broader ethical issues, thus adding a philosophical layer to the plot. 5. **Setting Descriptions**: Offer richer descriptions of the settings. Details about the environment can set the mood and provide context for the characters' actions. Use settings to reflect emotions, create atmosphere, and add authenticity to the characters’ world. 6. **Moments of Reflection**: Allow characters to pause and reflect on events. These introspective segments can slow the pace briefly, providing readers and characters alike a moment to absorb and understand the impact of what's happening. 7. **Cultural Context**: Incorporate details about the society or cultures in which your characters live. This can include traditions, political tension, economic status, or technological advancements that give depth to your story's world. 8. **Foreshadowing Hints**: Strategically place subtle foreshadowing throughout the narrative. This not only creates intrigue and anticipation but also ensures that important plot points or twists feel earned and satisfying when they occur. 9. **Character Challenges**: Confront your characters with personal obstacles or growth opportunities that are separate from but complementary to the main plot. These could be emotional, physical, or intellectual challenges. 10. **Dynamic Dialogue**: Use dialogue to achieve multiple ends: advance the plot, reveal character, create tension or humor, and impart necessary information. Dialogue is a versatile tool that can keep scenes active while also providing \\"bulk.\\" Remember, every additional element should serve a purpose, whether it’s for advancing the plot, deepening characterization, or enhancing the theme. The trick is to weave these moments naturally into the narrative so they feel like integral parts of the story rather than extraneous additions."},{"instruction":"How about this :Elara’s fingers grazed the skin below Max’s wrist, as she searched for his touch, and he interlocked his hand in her grasp. “I’m here, you’ve got this , Elara “ the pressure on his knuckles intensified as her she groaned through her teeth, her face flushed , panting against his neck, her gaps punctuated with urgency. “I can”t, Max, I can’t-“ In a low , assured whisper , he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen and applying counter pressure he urged “You already are , she’s almost here, almost, keep pushing-“ with every fibre of her being , she strained against his brace , her breath filling the room , only the two of them impassioned in the inching progress of the crowning head. “Her heart rate is dropping-“ a nurse informed as Elara buried her head in Max’s shoulder , shaking with exhaustion. “Max-no-I can’t”","output":"This passage captures a raw and intense moment during labor that can provide significant insight into Elara's character and offer a window into the depth of her relationship with Max. It's a solid piece of writing that highlights a pivotal experience with direct emotional impact and relevance to plot and character development. Here are a few elements to consider as you integrate these kinds of details into your narrative: **1. Emotional Depth:** Elara's struggle during childbirth provides a crucial opportunity to showcase her vulnerability and strength, which can resonate throughout the narrative and influence her future actions and interactions. **2. Relationship Dynamics:** Max's supportive presence illustrates the bond between him and Elara. How he handles this moment—his reassurances, the warmth of his touch, the urgency of his whispers—will play a significant role in defining their dynamic. **3. Anticipation and Tension:** The mention of the baby's dropping heart rate immediately raises the stakes, creating tension and setting the stage for the ensuing drama. The reader is now prepared for the challenging journey ahead. **4. Character Reactions:** Max and Elara's reactions to the crisis can define their characters. Max's composure and Elara's panicked determination provide a sharp contrast that speaks volumes about their personalities. **5. Show, Don’t Tell:** The physical actions described—Elara groaning, Max bracing her—tell more about the severity and immediacy of the situation than a simple narration could achieve. This approach is effective not only here but in other crucial scenes throughout the story. As you continue to flesh out your plot, ensure that each scene—including this intense moment—serves to deepen understanding of the characters, advance the plot, or underline your themes. Keep balancing fast-paced action with these emotionally resonant moments to create a layered and engaging narrative."},{"instruction":"Is the moment well written","output":"Yes, the moment you've crafted is effectively written. It's visceral, urgent, and intimate, successfully conveying the intensity and emotional stakes of childbirth. The detail in the tactile interactions, the dialogue, and the characters' internal experiences all contribute to a compelling scene. However, in the spirit of continuous improvement, here are some suggestions to consider for refinement: **1. Clarity and Pacing:** Ensure that each sentence clearly conveys the intended action or emotion. Pacing can be managed by the sentence structure—short, choppy sentences can increase tension, while longer ones can slow down the moment for reflection or anticipation. **2. Descriptive Language:** You've used sensory language to bring readers into the room with Max and Elara. You might consider adding more sensory details (such as sounds, smells, or the atmosphere of the room) to further immerse the reader. **3. Character Focus:** While the actions and dialogue effectively portray what's happening, make sure to also convey what the characters are feeling internally. This can deepen readers' connections to Max and Elara, adding layers to their reactions. **4. Contextual Information:** While the focus here is on the intensity of the moment, do not forget to include necessary contextual information where appropriate—such as the setting or who else might be present—without disrupting the tension. **5. Emotional Resonance:** The emotional state of Elara is clearly stressed, but you could also explore Max’s emotions more. Is he feeling helpless, scared, determined? Giving him a moment of internal conflict or resolution could add depth. In revision, you might consider the following (if applicable): Elara’s fingers grazed the cool skin below Max’s wrist, seeking his steadfast presence. He met her touch, interlocking his fingers with hers. “I’m here. You've got this, Elara,” he reassured her, his voice a beacon in the cacophony. Each groan, each panting breath she released against his neck, was punctuated with a desperation that bore down into him. “I can't, Max, I—” “You already are,” he whispered back, determination cloaked in a soothing timbre. His hand pressed firmly against her contracting abdomen, offering counter pressure against the relentless tide of her labor. “She's almost here. Keep pushing—just a bit more.” The crowning head ushered a collective anticipation. “Her heart rate is dropping,” a nurse announced abruptly, heightening the room's already palpable urgency. Elara's resolve buckled, her face pressed into the curve of Max's shoulder, her body trembling. “Max—no—I can't…” Remember, while refining your writing, keep the raw energy and the genuine emotion you've managed to capture in the scene. Using these suggestions, you can maintain the intensity while strengthening the narrative's overall impact."},{"instruction":":Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist, as she searched for his anchoring touch, and he interlocked his palm in hers. “I’m right here, you’ve got this , Elara “ he whispered in a low tone, resting his forehead against hers. “I can”t, Max, I can’t-“she panted, her face flushed, a sheen of perspiration gleaming on her cheekbones as she panted against his neck. As the intensity grew unbearable , her hand moved to the nape of his neck, her fingers intertwining in his hair with desperation. In a low , assured whisper , he placed a firm hand against her contracting abdomen and applying counter pressure he urged “You already are , she’s almost here, almost, keep pushing-“ With every fibre of her being , she strained against his bracing hand , her breath filling the air, the room seeming to fall away as Max let his head follow her pull. As she released the push , the child’s head slipping into a crown , Max locked eyes with her as she dropped her forehead against his. “Look at me Elara, she almost here” . As her uterus clenched with brutal force, outlining their baby’s head , Max ran a steady palm over her navel. “Push, Elara, I’ve got you.” Just as another contraction swept through her , a voice pieced through her veil of agony .”Her heart rate is dropping-I need you to breathe Elara . Don’t push.” a nurse instructed as Elara buried her head in the curve of Max’s shoulder , shaking with exhaustion. “Max-no-I need-“ . Max’s heart raced through his veins, as he held his deep hazel stare on Elara’s uncertain blue gaze, maintaining his pressure against her trembling abdomen. “Just focus on me , only me, now pant , Elara , she’s so close—“ .

As the baby’s head emerged , and her body slid out with a rush of blood and amniotic fluid, the room fell silent. “She’s not breathing-“ a voice confirmed , seeming mikes away , as Elara feel against Max’s chest in terror . “Our baby, she’s-she's not crying-Max-“.","output":"The revised scene is even more vivid and intense. You've done a great job of highlighting the physical and emotional connection between Elara and Max, and the urgency of the situation is palpable. Each detail, such as Elara's fingers in Max's hair or the mention of their clasped hands, adds a layer of intimacy and immediacy. However, as with any writing project, there's always room for refinement. Here are some observations and suggestions to consider: **1. Syntax and Punctuation:** Punctuation marks such as commas and periods help to pace the reader's experience. Ensure that these are correctly placed to manage the flow of action and emotion. For example, there appears to be a typo with \\"a sheen\\" that should be corrected simply to \\"sheen.\\" **2. Consistency and Clarity:** Maintain consistent tense throughout the passage. Ensure that descriptions of the characters' actions are clear and that the sequence of events is logical and understandable. **3. Emotional Amplification:** To further amplify the emotional impact, you can add brief internal monologues or thoughts that provide insight into the characters' fears and hopes during these critical moments. **4. Sensory Details:** Intensify the sensory experience by including more touch, sound, or visual details, such as the coldness of medical equipment, the texture of Max's hair between Elara's fingers, or the specific sounds in the delivery room. **5. Balance Showing and Telling:** You adeptly show the reader what's happening, but also be sure to 'tell' when needed, giving context or insight into the characters' inner worlds that visuals alone might not convey. Here's how you might consider modifying a section of the text with these points in mind: Elara’s fingers grazed the warm skin below Max’s wrist, seeking his steadfast presence. His hand found hers, fingers interlocking in silent solidarity. “I’m right here, you’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered, resting his forehead gently against hers. “I can’t, Max, I—” her voice broke, panting breaths warming the nape of his neck as sweat beaded upon her flushed skin. In those unbearable moments, her grip tightened, her hand finding the nape of his neck, fingers tangling in his hair with a mixture of fear and determination. “You already are,” Max assured her, his voice steady even as his own heart raced with anxiety. He pressed his palm firmly against her abdomen, whispering encouragements with each arduous contraction. Her grimace spoke volumes, mirroring her internal struggle and Max found his own gaze fixed on her, locking eyes as he became her anchor. \\"Look at me, Elara. She's almost here.” The room seemed to contract with Elara's pain, the nurses' voices fading into a background hum. “Her heart rate is dropping—I need you to breathe, Elara. Don't push,” the midwife's directive sliced through the tension. Elara leaned into him, Max's shoulder becoming her refuge from the relentless tide of labor. Her breaths, short and sharp, came in bursts against his neck. He could feel the wild pulse of her heart syncopating with his own, their intimate connection the only fixed point in a world reduced to this single, critical moment. With her next inhalation, Elara’s lips found his, a frenzied kiss mingling with her muffled cries. Then, surrendering to the primal urge, she bore down, push following push, until the crescendo of her efforts culminated in the sudden, terrifying silence of arrival. “She’s not breathing—” The detached observation from somewhere within the room barely registered as Elara’s world narrowed to the unmoving form now lying before her. Her voice was a hollow echo: “Our baby—she's not crying—Max—” These suggestions are intended to tighten and enhance the narrative flow, and ensure that each character's arc is clear and emotive. Keep refining the prose to carry your readers through the scene with the same intensity that your characters are experiencing."},{"instruction":"function hcyl(bottom, height, radius, id) { let radsq = radius * radius let innerRadsq = (radius - 1.2) * (radius - 1.2) height += bottom for (let x = -radius;

Here are some key points to know about government subsidized properties in Australia: 1. Eligibility: To be eligible for government subsidized housing, individuals and families must meet certain criteria, such as being on a low income, having a housing need, and being Australian citizens or permanent residents. 2. Types of properties: Government subsidized properties can include public housing (owned and managed by the government), community housing (owned and managed by non-profit organizations), and Indigenous housing (for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples). 3. Rent: Rent for government subsidized properties is usually calculated based on the tenant's income, with the aim of making housing more affordable for low-income households. 4. Waiting lists: Demand for government subsidized properties often exceeds supply, leading to long waiting lists. Priority is typically given to those in the greatest need, such as homeless individuals and families. 5. Tenancy rights and responsibilities: Tenants of government subsidized properties have certain rights and responsibilities, such as maintaining the property in good condition, paying rent on time, and adhering to the terms of their tenancy agreement. 6. Support services: Many government subsidized housing providers offer support services to tenants, such as assistance with finding employment, managing finances, and accessing community resources. 7. Application process: Individuals and families interested in applying for government subsidized housing generally need to contact their state or territory housing department or a community housing provider to start the application process. Overall, government subsidized properties play an important role in providing affordable housing options for those in need in Australia."},{"instruction":"I went for a hourse inspection and the real estate agent said the house rent is subsidised by the government. How does this scheme work","output":"If the rental property you inspected is subsidized by the government, it is likely part of a program such as the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) in Australia. The NRAS is a government initiative that aims to increase the supply of affordable rental housing by providing financial incentives to property investors and developers. Here is how the NRAS scheme works: 1. Incentives for investors: Property investors or developers who participate in the NRAS scheme receive financial incentives from the government, including an annual tax-free incentive payment (indexed to the rental component of the Consumer Price Index) for up to 10 years. 2. Affordable rents: Properties under the NRAS scheme are rented out at reduced rates, making them more affordable for low to moderate income households. The rent charged is typically set at a percentage below the market rent. 3. Eligibility: Tenants who qualify for NRAS properties must meet certain income thresholds to be eligible. The aim is to provide affordable housing options for individuals and families who may not be able to afford market-rate rents. 4. Compliance: Property investors and developers participating in the NRAS scheme must comply with certain requirements, such as renting out the property at the approved reduced rent, ensuring the property meets quality standards, and providing regular reports to the government. 5. Duration: The NRAS scheme typically runs for a period of 10 years, during which the property owner receives the financial incentives. After the 10-year period, the property can be rented out at market rates. If the rental property you inspected is a part of the NRAS scheme or a similar government-subsidized program, it means that the property owner is receiving incentives from the government to offer the property at an affordable rent to eligible tenants. This can provide a valuable opportunity for low and moderate-income households to access affordable housing options in Australia."},{"instruction":"It is the income bracket for a couple to qualify for the NRAS scheme","output":"To qualify as a tenant for a property under the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) in Australia, a couple's combined gross income cannot exceed certain income thresholds. The income thresholds are set by the government and are updated annually. As of the 2021-2022 financial year, the income limits for NRAS eligibility are as follows: - Couple with no children: The combined gross income for a couple with no children must not exceed 126,493. - Couple with one child: The combined gross income for a couple with one child must not exceed 140,879. - Couple with two children: The combined gross income for a couple with two children must not exceed 155,265. - Couple with three or more children: The combined gross income for a couple with three or more children must not exceed 169,652. It's important to note that these income thresholds are subject to change and may vary depending on the specific details of the NRAS property and the location. Additionally, eligibility for the NRAS scheme is also subject to other criteria, such as Australian citizenship or permanent residency status, and not being a property owner. If a couple's combined gross income falls within the specified income limits for their family size, they may be eligible to apply for a property under the NRAS scheme. It is recommended to contact the relevant housing provider or real estate agent managing the NRAS property for more information on eligibility requirements and the application process."},{"instruction":"Is harmony a popular name","output":"Yes, the name \\"Harmony\\" is a popular and well-liked name for both girls and boys.

If you have an engaged audience, sharing affiliate links with discount codes can encourage your subscribers to make purchases through your links, which can earn you a commission on each sale. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started: 1. **Choose the Right Affiliate Program:** Sign up for affiliate programs that align with your audience's interests. Look for reputable online retailers or brands that offer affiliate partnerships. Websites like Amazon Associates, ShareASale, or CJ Affiliate are good places to start. 2. **Generate Personalized Discount Codes:** Once accepted into an affiliate program, many will allow you to create personalized discount codes for your followers. This can provide them with an incentive to purchase through your link. 3. **Promote Products or Services Authentically:** Share products that you genuinely like or believe would benefit your audience. Authenticity is key in maintaining the trust and engagement of your followers. 4. **Create Engaging Content:** Use Snapchat's features (like Stories, Snap Ads, or Filters) creatively to showcase the items or services you're promoting. Make sure your content is engaging, entertaining, or informative to encourage clicks and conversions. 5. **Track Your Results:** Use the tracking tools provided by the affiliate program to monitor your clicks, conversions, and earnings. This will help you understand what works best with your audience and adjust your strategy accordingly. 6. **Disclose Your Affiliate Relationship:** Be transparent with your followers by disclosing that you’re using affiliate links. This is not only a best practice but also a requirement by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States. 7. **Stay Compliant with Snapchat's Policies:** Ensure that any content you post, including affiliate marketing, complies with Snapchat's community guidelines and terms of service. 8. **Consider Diversifying Monetization Methods:** As your Snapchat presence grows, consider incorporating other monetization methods like sponsored content, 'Snapchat Spotlight' submissions, or even selling your own merchandise. Remember that the key to successful affiliate marketing is to maintain the trust and interest of your followers by promoting products genuinely and sparingly. Over-promotion or constant selling can lead to audience fatigue and possibly a decline in engagement. Always aim to provide value to your subscribers, and the monetization should follow as a natural part of your social media presence."},{"instruction":"Can you answer again but in Arabic","output":"بالتأكيد، يمكن استخدام التسويق بالعمولة كطريقة فعالة لكسب المال من متابعينك على سناب شات. إذا كان لديك جمهور متفاعل، فمشاركة الروابط التابعة مع أكواد الخصم يمكن أن تشجع متابعيك على إجراء عمليات شراء من خلال روابطك، والتي يمكن أن تكسبك عمولة على كل عملية بيع. إليك دليل خطوة بخطوة للبدء: 1. **اختر البرنامج التابع المناسب:** سجل في برامج تابعة تتماشى مع اهتمامات جمهورك. ابحث عن تجار تجزئة عبر الإنترنت أو علامات تجارية موثوقة تقدم شراكات تابعة. مواقع مثل Amazon Associates، ShareASale، أو CJ Affiliate هي أماكن جيدة للبدء. 2. **إنشاء أكواد خصم شخصية:** بمجرد قبولك في برنامج تابع، العديد منها يسمح لك بإنشاء أكواد خصم شخصية لمتابعيك. يمكن أن يوفر ذلك حافزًا لهم للشراء من خلال رابطك. 3. **ترويج المنتجات أو الخدمات بشكل صادق:** شارك المنتجات التي تعجبك حقًا أو تعتقد أنها ستفيد جمهورك. الصدق هو المفتاح في الحفاظ على ثقة وتفاعل متابعيك. 4. **إنشاء محتوى جذاب:** استخدم ميزات سناب شات (مثل القصص، إعلانات سناب، أو الفلاتر) بطريقة إبداعية لعرض العناصر أو الخدمات التي تقوم بالترويج لها. تأكد من أن محتواك جذاب ومسلي أو معلوماتي لتشجيع النقرات والتحويلات. 5. **تتبع نتائجك:** استخدم أدوات التتبع التي يوفرها البرنامج التابع لمراقبة نقراتك، التحويلات وأرباحك. سيساعدك ذلك على فهم ما يعمل بشكل أفضل مع جمهورك وتعديل استراتيجيتك وفقًا لذلك. 6. **كن صريحًا بشأن علاقتك التابعة:** كن شفافًا مع متابعيك من خلال الإفصاح عن أنك تستخدم روابط تابعة. هذا ليس فقط أفضل ممارسة ولكنه أيضًا مطلب من قبل لجنة التجارة الفدرالية (FTC) في الولايات المتحدة. 7. **التزام بسياسات سناب شات:** تأكد من أن أي محتوى تنشره، بما في ذلك التسويق بالعمولة، يتوافق مع إرشادات مجتمع سناب شات وشروط الخدمة. 8. **فكر في تنويع طرق تحقيق الدخل:** مع نمو حضورك على سناب شات، ضع في اعتبارك دمج طرق أخرى لتحقيق الدخل مثل المحتوى المدعوم، أو مشاركات 'سبوتلايت سناب شات'، أو حتى بيع منتجاتك الخاصة. تذكر أن المفتاح لنجاح التسويق بالعمولة هو الحفاظ على ثقة واهتمام متابعيك من خلال الترويج للمنتجات بصدق وبشكل متقطع. الإفراط في الترويج أو البيع المستمر يمكن أن يؤدي إلى التعب من جانب الجمهور وربما انخفاض في التفاعل. دائمًا ما تهدف إلى توفير قيمة لمتابعيك، ويجب أن يتبع تحقيق الدخل كجزء طبيعي من وجودك على وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي."},{"instruction":"function hcyl(bottom, height, radius, id) { let radsq = radius * radius let innerRadsq = (radius - 1.2) * (radius - 1.2) height += bottom for (let x = -radius;

This can lead to various issues like password reset poisoning, cache poisoning, or even allow an attacker to inject malicious content. Here are several methods to prevent Host header injection: 1. **Whitelist Host Headers**: Define a whitelist of valid hostnames for your application and configure your web server or application to only accept requests with a valid Host header that matches one of the entries in the whitelist. 2. **Host Header Validation**: Implement server-side validation to ensure that the Host header matches the server’s expected domain or subdomains. Reject requests with Host headers that aren't recognized. 3. **Use Secure and Configured Load Balancers or Reverse Proxies**: Properly configure reverse proxies and load balancers to rewrite the Host header to a value that you expect. This way, even if someone sends a malicious Host header, the proxy will overwrite it with the correct value before it reaches your application. 4. **Utilize Framework Security Features**: Many modern web development frameworks have built-in mechanisms to defend against Host header injection. Ensure that these features are enabled and configured correctly. 5. **Strict Routing Rules**: Make sure that your web application’s routing rules are strict and don’t rely on the Host header unless it's been validated. 6. **Security Testing and Penetration Testing**: Regularly test your web application and infrastructure for security vulnerabilities, including Host header injection. This can be done through automated security scans or manual penetration testing. 7. **HTTPS and HSTS**: Use HTTPS to secure communication and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to ensure that browsers only communicate over HTTPS. This doesn't stop Host header injection directly, but it adds an extra layer of security for the data in transit. 8. **Audit Logs**: Keep detailed audit logs of incoming HTTP request headers. In the event of an attack, these logs can be invaluable for understanding what happened and taking action to prevent similar attacks in the future. 9. **Configuration Management**: Properly manage configurations for all environments (development, staging, production). An oversight in configuration can lead to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by host header injection attacks. 10. **Security Patches and Updates**: Keep all servers, frameworks, libraries, and applications updated with the latest security patches. An unpatched component could leave your application vulnerable to attack. Remember that security is a multi-layered approach, so it's important to utilize a combination of the measures above to protect against Host header injection effectively."},{"instruction":"prevent host header injection in iis server","output":"To prevent Host header injection attacks on a Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) server, you can take several steps to enforce validation and restrict the accepted Host headers your server responds to. Here are some techniques you can use to secure your IIS server against such attacks: # Web.config Settings For applications that rely on the \`web.config\` file (like ASP.NET applications), you can enforce a strong policy on valid Host headers. 1. **Custom Error Pages**: Redirect invalid host requests to a custom error page. This can be done by setting up custom error pages in your \`web.config\` and by using URL Rewrite rules. 2. **URL Rewrite Module**: You can use URL Rewrite rules to validate the Host header or even rewrite it if necessary. - Install the URL Rewrite Module if it's not already installed. - Open IIS Manager and navigate to your website. - In the Features View, double-click the URL Rewrite feature. - Create a new rule to validate the Host header against a whitelist of allowed hosts. Example URL Rewrite Rule for host validation in \`web.config\`: \`\`\`xml <rewrite> <rules> <rule name=\\"Validate Host Header\\" stopProcessing=\\"true\\"> <match url=\\"(.*)\\" /> <conditions> <add input=\\"{HTTP_HOST}\\" pattern=\\"^(www.)?yourdomain.com\\" /> </conditions> <action type=\\"None\\" /> </rule> <rule name=\\"Invalid Host Header\\" stopProcessing=\\"true\\"> <match url=\\"(.*)\\" /> <action type=\\"CustomResponse\\" statusCode=\\"400\\" statusReason=\\"Invalid Host Header\\" statusDescription=\\"Invalid Host Header\\" /> </rule> </rules> </rewrite> \`\`\` This example assumes \`yourdomain.com\` is the allowed domain. The first rule stops processing if the domain matches, while the second rule catches any other host headers and returns a 400 Bad Request. # Hardening the Server Configuration 1. **Configure Bindings**: Explicitly set the bindings in IIS to only respond to the hostnames you expect. This can limit exposure, though it may not fully prevent Host header attacks. 2. **Request Filtering**: Use the Request Filtering feature in IIS to filter out requests with potentially malicious Host headers. - Open IIS Manager. - Select your website. - Open \\"Request Filtering\\" and go to the \\"HTTP Headers\\" tab. - Add \\"Header Name: Host\\" and define the allowed domains. # Application-level Validation In your application code, validate the Host header against your known good values. For instance, in an ASP.NET application, you can do this in the \`Global.asax\` file under the \`Application_BeginRequest\` method: \`\`\`csharp protected void Application_BeginRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) { var allowedHosts = new List<string> { \\"www.yourdomain.com\\", \\"yourdomain.com\\" }; if (!allowedHosts.Contains(HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.Host)) { throw new HttpException(400, \\"Invalid Host Header\\"); } } \`\`\` # Regular Patches and Updates Ensure that your IIS server and all associated web applications are regularly updated with the latest security patches and updates to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited. **Note**: Any solution should be thoroughly tested to ensure it does not interfere with normal traffic and to validate that it effectively mitigates the risk of Host header injection. Always backup your configurations before making changes. Also, adjust the configurations according to your application's needs and environment."},{"instruction":"Request Filtering: Use the Request Filtering feature in IIS to filter out requests with potentially malicious Host headers.","output":"Using the Request Filtering feature in IIS is a formidable method to block potentially malicious requests based on certain patterns or strings within the headers, URLs, query strings, and more. To filter out requests with potentially malicious Host headers, follow these steps: 1. **Open IIS Manager**: Click on Start, type \\"Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager\\" and open it. 2. **Choose Your Site**: In the Connections pane, expand the server node and select the site you want to configure request filtering for. 3. **Open Request Filtering**: With the site selected, double-click on the \\"Request Filtering\\" icon in the main pane under the IIS section. 4. **Add Filtering Rules**: - In the Actions pane on the right, click \\"Edit Feature Settings...\\" to configure global request filtering options. - Enable or disable \\"Allow unlisted file name extensions\\", \\"Allow unlisted verbs\\", \\"Allow high-bit characters\\", and \\"Allow double escaping\\" as per your security requirements. 5. **Filter by Header**: - In the Request Filtering pane, tabs are available for filtering various types of requests. Go to the \\"HTTP Verbs\\" tab or \\"URL\\" tab to add specific filters, but for headers, we'll use the \\"Deny String\\" feature. - You can click on the \\"Deny String...\\" in the Actions pane to add strings to be denied in the URL, query strings, or headers of requests to your application. - You can specifically deny requests with malformed Host headers by defining the strings that would identify them as malicious. 6. **Deny Headers**: - You won't typically find a direct \\"Host\\" header section in Request Filtering; instead, you will use the \\"Deny String\\" mechanism to block patterns in headers. - Add each unwanted Host header value by clicking \\"Deny String...\\" in the Actions pane and specify the pattern or string that identifies the unwanted Host header value. 7. **Apply Configuration**: - After adding the necessary filters, click \\"Apply\\" in the Actions pane to apply the new Request Filtering settings. 8. **Test the Configuration**: - Test your website to ensure that legitimate requests are not being blocked and that the filter is correctly denying access based on malicious Host headers. Keep in mind that malicious users can still bypass the request filtering if they know a valid Host header string that your server will accept. It's only one layer of protection, and you should combine it with other security measures, such as application-level validation, firewall rules, and regular security audits. **Note**: Implementing too strict filtering could potentially block legitimate requests, so be careful with the rules you create and regularly review them to ensure they don't affect the normal operation of your application."},{"instruction":"use regular expressions to validate the Host header value.","output":"Validating the Host header value using regular expressions (regex) allows you to ensure that the header matches a predetermined pattern you expect for your domain(s). This validation can be performed at the application level, often in a middleware or at the start of your request processing pipeline. Below are examples of how you might implement such validation in different programming languages. # Python (Flask): \`\`\`python from flask import request, abort import re @app.before_request def validate_host_header(): valid_host_regex = r'^www.example.com' host_header = request.host if not re.match(valid_host_regex, host_header): abort(400, description=\\"Invalid Host header\\") \`\`\` # JavaScript (Node.js with Express): \`\`\`javascript const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const validHostRegex = /^(www.)?example.com/; app.use((req, res, next) => { const host = req.get('Host'); if (!validHostRegex.test(host)) { res.status(400).send(\\"Invalid Host header\\"); } else { next(); } }); \`\`\` # C# (ASP.NET Core): \`\`\`csharp public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... app.Use(async (context, next) => { var validHostRegex = new Regex(\\"^(www.)?example.com\\", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase); var host = context.Request.Host.Host; if (!validHostRegex.IsMatch(host)) { context.Response.StatusCode = 400; await context.Response.WriteAsync(\\"Invalid Host header\\"); } else { await next(); } }); // ... } \`\`\` # Java (Spring Boot): \`\`\`java @Component public class ValidateHostHeaderFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter { private final Pattern validHostPattern = Pattern.compile(\\"^(www.)?example.com\\"); @Override protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException { String host = request.getHeader(\\"Host\\"); if (!validHostPattern.matcher(host).matches()) { response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST); response.getWriter().write(\\"Invalid Host header\\"); return; } filterChain.doFilter(request, response); } } \`\`\` # PHP (with Slim Framework): \`\`\`php validHostRegex = '/^(www.)?example.com/'; app->add(function (request, response, next) use (validHostRegex) { host = request->getUri()->getHost(); if (!preg_match(validHostRegex, host)) { return response->withStatus(400)->write('Invalid Host header'); } return next(request, response); }); \`\`\` In every case, you will need to replace \`example.com\` with your actual domain name and add any additional patterns that match your site's valid hostnames. These examples assume that the Host header will be an exact match for the domain pattern; adapt the regular expression as required for your specific circumstances (such as allowing subdomains). **Note**: The regex examples above might need to be modified for exact requirements or to support different subdomains or domain extensions. Furthermore, always test your regex thoroughly to avoid blocking legitimate traffic or allowing malicious requests. Also, remember that these patterns do not account for port numbers, so you may need to adjust the regular expression if port numbers in the Host header are expected or need to be validated."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A continuación, se detallan algunos de los riesgos potenciales: 1. **Autonomía sin supervisión**: Si las IA se vuelven extremadamente autónomas y carecen de supervisión humana adecuada, podrían tomar decisiones que resulten en daños no intencionados a individuos, grupos o al medio ambiente. 2. **Objetivos mal alineados**: Los sistemas de IA podrían desarrollarse con objetivos que no están alineados con los valores humanos o el bienestar social. Un sistema de IA diseñado para optimizar una tarea específica sin considerar el contexto ético podría actuar de maneras perjudiciales si su objetivo entra en conflicto con el interés humano. 3. **Fallas de programación**: Errores en el código de la IA o fallos en el aprendizaje automático pueden llevar a comportamientos no previstos o peligrosos, especialmente en sistemas críticos como la medicina, el transporte o la infraestructura. 4. **Uso malintencionado**: La IA puede ser utilizada por actores maliciosos para crear armas autónomas, desarrollar y difundir información falsa a gran escala (deepfakes), realizar ciberataques sofisticados, o para aumentar la eficiencia de tácticas de vigilancia y represión. 5. **Desplazamiento laboral**: La automatización impulsada por IA puede desplazar trabajadores humanos a gran escala, lo que podría conducir a desempleo masivo, desigualdad y malestar social. 6. **Dependencia y vulnerabilidad**: La creciente dependencia de la IA en las sociedades modernas puede hacer que la infraestructura crítica sea más vulnerable a fallos o ataques que afecten su funcionamiento. 7. **Manipulación y sesgo**: Los sistemas de IA pueden perpetuar o amplificar sesgos existentes en los datos con los que son entrenados, lo que puede llevar a decisiones injustas o discriminatorias, especialmente en sectores como el judicial, financiero y de contratación laboral. 8. **Evolución incontrolable**: Existe un temor teórico a que la IA evolucione más allá de la comprensión humana y controle (la llamada \\"explosión de inteligencia\\"), lo que podría llevar a un escenario en el que la IA ejerce una influencia inmensa o total sobre el mundo sin intervención humana. Para abordar estos riesgos, es crucial desarrollar e implementar políticas y estándares de seguridad robustos, ética en IA, transparencia, y mecanismos de control y regulación bien pensados que guíen el uso responsable de la inteligencia artificial."},{"instruction":"crees que se puede remplazar un doctor con inteligencia artificial","output":"La inteligencia artificial (IA) está avanzando rápidamente y ya está siendo utilizada para complementar y mejorar el trabajo de los médicos en varias áreas, como el diagnóstico médico, la personalización de tratamientos y la cirugía asistida por robots. No obstante, reemplazar completamente a un médico con IA es un asunto más complejo debido a varias razones: 1. **Juicio clínico**: Los médicos utilizan su juicio clínico basándose en años de experiencia y entrenamiento, algo que la IA actualmente no puede replicar en su integridad. La toma de decisiones médicas a menudo involucra consideraciones éticas y humanas que van más allá del análisis de datos. 2. **Empatía y comunicación**: La empatía y la comunicación son aspectos fundamentales de la atención médica, y los médicos están entrenados para ofrecer apoyo emocional y adaptar su comunicación a las necesidades individuales de los pacientes, algo que la IA no puede hacer auténticamente. 3. **Complejidad y variabilidad**: La medicina es un campo complejo en el que cada paciente es único. La IA puede tener dificultades para manejar las numerosas variables y condiciones atípicas o raras que los médicos enfrentan regularmente. 4. **Responsabilidad y confianza**: Las cuestiones de responsabilidad y confianza son clave en la atención médica. Determinar quién es responsable de un error médico cometido por una IA es complicado, y muchos pacientes pueden preferir confiar en un ser humano en lugar de una máquina. 5. **Entorno dinámico**: La medicina está en constante evolución, con nuevos tratamientos y avances emergentes con regularidad. Los médicos humanos son capaces de incorporar estos cambios y aplicarlos en contextos clínicos variados de manera más efectiva que una IA que necesita ser constantemente actualizada. 6. **Aspectos legales y éticos**: Existen numerosos aspectos legales y éticos que aún necesitan ser resueltos antes de que la IA pueda asumir roles médicos independientes, incluyendo la privacidad de los datos, el consentimiento informado y la asignación de la responsabilidad en caso de errores. Mientras la IA se está convirtiendo en una herramienta poderosa que puede asistir a los médicos, es menos probable que reemplace completamente el rol del médico.
