Given the question: I can use this background: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them.  Now, I have a new situation: It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear.  Answer this question please: Which coat will absorb more sunlight? The answer is:","output":"The large black coat will absorb more sunlight. This is because dark colors, like black, are more effective at absorbing light rather than reflecting it. When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of the material, making the black coat warmer in comparison to the white coat. In the given situation of winter and cold temperatures, wearing the black coat would be advantageous for Johnathan because it will absorb more sunlight, ensuring that he stays warmer while walking to work in the chilly weather. The white coat, on the other hand, will reflect more sunlight and will not absorb as much heat as the black coat, making it less effective at keeping him warm in cold conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse is dated 1498, as is his engraving of St. Michael Fighting the Dragon. He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. The Seven Sorrows Polyptych, commissioned by Frederick III of Saxony in 1496, was executed by Durer and his assistants c. Around 1503-1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the Life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the Great Passion, were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers. During the same period Durer trained himself in the difficult art of using the burin to make engravings. It is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father, as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith. In 1496 he executed the Prodigal Son, which the Italian Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari singled out for praise some decades later, noting its Germanic quality. He was soon producing some spectacular and original images, notably Nemesis (1502), The Sea Monster (1498), and Saint Eustace (c. 1501), with a highly detailed landscape background and animals. His landscapes of this period, such as Pond in the Woods and Willow Mill, are quite different from his earlier watercolours. There is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere, rather than depicting topography. He made a number of Madonnas, single religious figures, and small scenes with comic peasant figures. Prints are highly portable and these works made Durer famous throughout the main artistic centres of Europe within a very few years.  Question: \\"When did Durer first produce a set of seventeen prints illustrating the Life of the Virgin that was sold individually for several years?\\" Answer: \\"1505 - 1507\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \\"sex maniac\\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie apologises for the obscene letter, but Cecilia surprises him and confesses her secret love for him. They then proceed to make passionate love in the library when Briony walks in, and thinks that Cecilia is under attack. Cecilia and Robbie try to pass the incident off.","output":"The full name of the person who writes the note containing frequent usage of the word \\"cunt\\" is Robbie Turner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For years, people on Facebook have wanted something more than the Like button to express their feelings about the posts they see on the social network. Despite the clamoring, though, all you see to click on below posts is a thumbs up.      That could change before long, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his second public town hall meeting at company headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., which was also webcast live.      But the one thing Facebook likely won't do is provide a Dislike button, he said in answer to the first question at the meeting. \\"We’re thinking about it,\\" he said, before putting the kibosh on any intention to provide a thumbs-down button.      But he said there are other emotions he knows people want to share, such as sadness about a post of a loved one who passed, for which a Like button is clearly inappropriate. \\"But we need to figure out a good way to do it. We don’t have anything that’s coming soon but it is an area of discussion.\\"      That turned out to be one of the more interesting answers Zuckerberg provided in the hourlong event. But he also defended Facebook as much more than a waste of time, explained why there are seemingly endless privacy policy updates, and revealed that he likes fried chicken on his pizza.      Here's what else he had to say, lightly paraphrased at times:      Q: Advice on starting a company?      A: Don’t worry about making mistakes too much. Mistakes are how you learn. The real question is how you learn from them. You gotta keep on powering ahead and not stress too much about it.      Q: How can Facebook be a more productive medium, not just wasting time.      A: I’m not sure I agree with the thrust of the question. Facebook is giving people a tool to stay connected with more people that they may not be able to do. I don’t really think it’s a waste of time at all. It’s sad that it’s considered a waste of time to cultivate relationships.      Q: Why can’t I change my username?      A: I have the username Zuck. We limit each person to having just one username so they can be found more easily. The username is less important than the fact that on Facebook, people use their real names. Asking everyone to use their real name grounds everything in reality. There’s more accountability if you’re connected to your real name. It’s all part of building a safe community that’s tied into the world.      Q: What is the role of social media in bridging the divide that is now more obvious after events in Ferguson and other communities?      A: We’ve been spending a lot of time discussing this internally. We take our role in this civic debate really seriously. There are two things we want to do. The first is we want to give everyone a voice. We’re trying to make it so every single person in the world has a voice. The second thing that’s really important is diversity of opinion. If you’re a Republican or a Democrat, you probably have friends who are in the other party on Facebook. Your network of friends, or friends of friends, is going to bring you more diverse opinions than you would have gotten from any other media.      Q: Any New Year’s resolutions?      A: It’s too early! I could use some suggestions. I’ve taken them pretty seriously the past five years. I had one resolution that led me to cooking a lot. Another led me to learn Mandarin. I’m bad at languages. My resolution this year was to write one thank-you note to someone every day.      Q: How can your vision on Facebook be applied effectively in the public sector?      A: It’s only at the beginning of what we hope to see happen. One example recently is we launched Safety Check, which gives people a chance to tell friends and family they’re safe when there’s a disaster. We turned it on in the Philippines this week. Another is just enabling elected officials to communicate with the people they serve. I recently went on a trip to India and Indonesia to work on Internet.org Internet access. Both countries’ leaders used Facebook in their election. We’re just at the beginning here.      Q: There are so many privacy updates that I can barely keep up with them. Why so many?      A: A lot of people wonder that. What we try to do is update the privacy policy about once a year to reflect the policy, technical, and business changes in the previous year. On the latest one, it used to be that Facebook was one product. Now Facebook offers a lot of different services--news feed, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and a handful more we’re building. We just need to update our policy to make it clear how all these services will tie together. Also, technology advances like being able to do video or know where friends are requires that we decide what we’re going to do with that information. We don’t want to change this very often. It’s a lot to digest.      Q: Have you thought of addressing challenges such as economic disparity?      A: We spend a lot of time helping especially small businesses build their business up. We have Pages people can use for free to build up their audience.      Q: (From a resident down the street.) Thank you for upping the price of my house. I’m loving it. What kind of community outreach do people in the company plan to do?      A: That’s the first time anyone has thanked me for raising housing prices. I taught an entrepreneurship program at a local school. There are always going to be more things we want to do. We want to make the community more healthy. We would love feedback on what else we can do. Elliot Schrage, Facebook's VP of communications, public policy and platform marketing, adds: We take this idea of community outreach seriously not just in Menlo Park but around the world.      Q: Share personal habits that contributed to your success?      A: On a day to day basis, one of the most important things is focus my time proactively rather than reactively on whatever comes up. There are enough things that happen during the day that you could spend all your time on whatever comes up during the day. So I try to spend the majority of my time on things that I proactively want to be working on. The most important is to put time into things you want to see happen rather than what other folks want you to do. You do need to be open to the outside, which is why I’m doing these town halls.      Q: What advice would you give your younger self?      A: You’re going to make mistakes no matter what you do. A lot of people focus on avoiding mistakes. Most of what we do is mistakes. You’re successful because of only a few things you did well. Albert Einstein had this really pure idea of how the universe worked. His aesthetic view of the world led him to believe that black holes couldn’t exist. He got that wrong. But nobody remembers he got that wrong, except me, now.      Q: What do you like on your pizza?      A: My view on this important issue... is that as long as you’re eating pizza, you might as well have fried chicken on top of the pizza.      Q: How does coding fit into Facebook’s mission statement?      A: Growing up, one of the things that made me excited about coding is you can sit through and accomplish something in the end. What I do now is quite soft--seeing other people do the [coding.] It’s a very valuable outlet for young people to express their creativity. Also, you can have an impact without being high up in management. So it’s massively empowering. Understanding the discipline of coding gives you the skills you need for other work.      Q: Will Graph Search be released in other languages like Spanish?      A: Yes. But we want to get it right first. People always ask us for the ability to find stuff on Facebook. There’s a big opportunity here, such as recommendations on products and businesses people have tried. The ability to learn from the wisdom of all your friends is valuable, but it’s really not easy to do on Facebook. It’s a lot of work, because there are more than a trillion posts on Facebook. It’s taken a little longer than we all want to fully roll out search to everyone in the world. Please hang in there and we hope to deliver this sometime soon.      Q: How does Facebook run experiments to improve its products while avoiding ethical concerns?      A: There was this report that a Facebook data scientist that raised a lot of questions. We tightened things up a bit after that. We think the only way we can make our services better for the world is to try out new things and get feedback from the community. We want to make sure changes have positive impacts. My wife is a doctor and there’s a philosophy in medicine that there’s a cost to running a test, so you need an internal process to ensure the service is worthwhile before you potentially do any hard. Things on privacy we’re just not going to test. Anything around emotions that we made sure our people don’t have the ability to test. On the incident last summer, we wanted to see if lots of posts by friends on things they're doing made people sad. We don’t want to make people sad. But the way we did it, we could have done it a lot better.      Q: Have you thought about helping people make connections in real life too?      A: A lot of what Facebook tries to do is help people stay connected to people you know rather than help you make new friends. I wear contact lenses or glasses. Computers are the bicycle for your mind, Steve Jobs once said. What we’re trying to do with Facebook is extend this fundamental human capacity for maintaining social relationships. Through Facebook, we help people maintain relationships with many more than the 150 social scientists say we can. When I have the opportunity to see my wife or my mother in person, I’ll take that. But people don’t always have the opportunity to do that with everyone they’d like to.      Q: If you and I were married, how would we handle Facebook with our daughter?      A: I try to put myself in the shoes of having a child. On the one hand, I remember being real young and using technology and having a good sense of this stuff. I thought that was pretty positive. I think children are much more capable than we think. Bullying is really important and we try to make sure it doesn’t happen on the platform. Having real names helps. I would want my children to use technology because it’s one of the ways you become literate and acquire the tools of the modern world. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg says his site is \\"thinking about\\" how to implement a way to dislike posts (Video credit: Facebook).

Speaking at a Q&A session in California, he said it was one of the most requested features the social network receives from its users.

The system has also come under fire due to a high volume of \\"fake likes\\" - when the popularity of a brand or piece of content is inflated artificially.      Facebook has moved to combat the trade of so-called \\"like farming\\" - businesses that, for a price, will provide a huge number of likes quickly. This will be via automated robots, or by a network of humans paid a tiny sum for each click.      Image copyright AFP Image caption Fake likes could stop businesses using Facebook, the social network believes      An investigation by the BBC in July 2012 showed that a fake company, set up by the BBC, could gain thousands of \\"likes\\" - despite the fact that the company, which promised bagels via the internet, was quite clearly bogus.      On closer inspection, many of the \\"likes\\" appeared to come from accounts that were not real people. Hardly any of the \\"likes\\" originated from places like the UK or US - instead the majority originated in places such as the Philippines.      Facebook has initiated legal action against firms offering \\"fake likes\\" or other bogus business practices on the social network.      Nervous advertisers      Any enhanced method for expressing sentiment - particularly negatively - would be likely to make advertisers nervous, said Paul Coggins, chief executive of ad firm Adludio.      \\"Facebook's big concern is revenue,\\" he told the BBC.      \\"They need to keep their advertisers happy.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who promised to meet Mullah Omar in order to discuss Bin Laden?\\" is \\"Michael Sheehan\\"?","output":"No, based on the information provided in the paragraph, it was General Musharraf who promised to meet Mullah Omar in order to discuss Bin Laden.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes \\"Tomistoma\\", is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes \\"Tomistoma\\", the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharials (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.  - Rhynchosaurs were a group of Triassic diapsid reptiles related to the archosaurs .  - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included).    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'order'. Answer:","output":"The entity that has the relation 'taxon rank' with 'order' is Rhynchocephalia. This is evident from the information given about tuatara, which states that they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most of the Korean Presbyterian denominations share the same name in Korean, 대한예수교장로회 (literally means the Presbyterian Church of Korea or PCK), tracing its roots to the United Presbyterian Assembly before its long history of disputes and schisms. The Presbyterian schism began with the controversy in relation to the Japanese shrine worship enforced during the Japanese colonial period and the establishment of a minor division (Koryu-pa, 고려파, later The Koshin Presbyterian Church in Korea, Koshin 고신) in 1952. And in 1953 the second schism happened when the theological orientation of the Chosun Seminary (later Hanshin University) founded in 1947 could not be tolerated in the PCK and another minor group (The Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea, Kijang, 기장) was separated. The last major schism had to do with the issue of whether the PCK should join the WCC. The controversy divided the PCK into two denominations, The Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap, 통합) and The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong, 합동) in 1959. All major seminaries associated with each denomination claim heritage from the Pyung Yang Theological Seminary, therefore, not only Presbyterian University and Theological Seminary and Chongsin University which are related to PCK but also Hanshin University of PROK all celebrated the 100th class in 2007, 100 years from the first graduates of Pyung Yang Theological Seminary.

(Wired) -- The timeline for autonomous cars hitting the road en masse keeps getting closer. GM's Cadillac division expects to produce partially autonomous cars at a large scale by 2015, and the automaker also predicts it will have fully autonomous cars available by the end of the decade. Audi and BMW have also shown self-driving car concepts, with the former working with Stanford to pilot a modified TT up Pikes Peak. Meanwhile, Google is ripping along at its own rapid pace with a fleet of fully autonomous Toyota Prius hybrids that have logged over 300,000 miles. And the company has pushed through legislation that legalizes self-driving cars in Nevada. California is close behind, and Google has also been busy lobbying joyriding lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

In March we published a photo story about the extraordinary Zsnskar region in northern India,which is cut off from the outside world for more than seven months of the year,and only accessible  via a frozen river.We also included information about the limited use of skiing in the region and the recent creation of the Zanskar Ski School: \\"Despite the difficulties of travelling through the region when the snow comes,skiing hasn't traditionally been used as a means of transport by the locals,largely because trees don't grow here,so there is little in the way of raw materials  from which to make skis.In 1995,a group of British scientists in the region noticed the lack of skis and one of them returned to set up the Zanskar Ski School in Padam.The school provides lessons for a small fee and rents skis to the local people.Among the benefits that the school hopes to bring are improved education--children often find it difficult to get to school through the deep snow--and the possibility of offering ski tours to tourists in the future.So far,more than 300 local people have received training,and local doctors and policemen regularly borrow skis.\\" But,what we weren't able to include in the article is that the ski school is always on the look out for old skiing equipment--particularly of a size suitable for children--and,I thought.now the European ski season is drawing to a close,there might be a few of you out there who have some old equipment you'd like to see go to a good home.If that's the ease you can get in touch with the school via their website www.zanskarskischooL.org.

Jack Dorsey probably didn’t think twice when he tweeted Saturday that he had used his new Cash app to pay for a meal at Chick-fil-A. Perhaps he thought a chicken sandwich is merely a meal, but now he knows it’s also a political statement.      ... ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Rob Smith (@robsmithonline) has all the details. Buzz60      Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 6, 2016 in Sun Valley, Idaho. (Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images)      Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey started a social media firestorm and then apologized after he tweeted that he ordered food from Chick-fil-A.      Critics jumped on Dorsey for supporting Chick-fil-A during the month of June, which is Pride Month for the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning) community.      Chick-fil-A came under fire from gay rights supporters in 2012 because of comments made by the fast food chicken chain’s CEO, Dan Cathay, expressing opposition to same-sex marriage. The company had also donated millions to anti-gay groups.      The controversy spurred angry protests at stores by activists as well as supporters who came to rally behind the the company.      Dorsey's tweet reignited the debate. The backlash included comments like:      “Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth”      “Wow, I thought better of you @jack Way to support a homophobic company during Pride month.”      “Did your meal come with a side-order of homophonic bigotry or did you pay extra for it?”      FACES OF PRIDE: Memebers of the LGBTQ community and their allies sound off from all 50 states      Dorsey acknowledged the situation after former CNN host Soledad O’Brien tweeted :\\"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\\"      Dorsey responded in a tweet: “You’re right. Completley forgot about their background.”      You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018      Not all the responses were negative as some on social media rushed to support Dorsey and Chick-fil-A.      \\"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous. Go on and eat that ChickfilA and post as much as you want about it!\\"      “I don’t let politics dictate my food choices. The LGBTQ community is free to make equally tasty and “hate-free” chicken. Until it happens, there’s Chick-fil-a.”      “This just shows what a sad world we live in...when a guy feels he has to apologize for eating a chicken sandwich?!”      Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2JAtfoB ||||| Twitter's Jack Dorsey Isn't the Only One Who Forgot Chick-fil-A Is Anti-LGBT      The CEO of Twitter got a public shaming for promoting Chick-fil-A during Pride Month.      Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is getting a very public reminding that Chick-fil-A is not an LGBT-supportive company — though he’s far from the only one who has forgotten.      If the crowds at your local Chick-fil-A are any indication, much of the United States, even in progressive cities and on college campuses, has forgotten that management of the restaurant chain is opposed to marriage equality and has kept right on giving money to anti-LGBT causes.      Dorsey forgot that when he posted this tweet:      The reaction was quick:      This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack https://t.co/Wmhq6Obrp1 — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) June 10, 2018      Dorsey issued his regrets:      You’re right. Completely forgot about their background — jack (@jack) June 10, 2018      Dorsey is far from the first to forget about that background.      None other than BuzzFeed posted a fawning story in October headlined \\"15 Facts About Chick-fil-A That'll Make You Say, 'Woah, That's Crazy,” and it never mentioned its anti-LGBT history. The piece just talked about how delicious everything tastes. Even Democrats have sometimes forgotten, as evidenced during a sit-in for gun control in 2016, when they ordered out for Chick-fil-A.      Aside from its record of questionable donations via its foundation, Chick-fil-A also scores a zero on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. Although it has some vocal queer defenders, the company has taken no action that would show it welcomes LGBT customers — not a commercial, not a Pride proclamation, nothing.      Last year, ThinkProgress reported on Chick-fil-A’s most recent financial disclosures that showed it was still giving in 2015 to anti-LGBT causes. That’s two years after CEO Dan Cathy swore he would stop.      The mix of donations changed, with money going to less overtly anti-LGBT groups. But the theme remains. ThinkProgress noted 1 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which has a “sexual purity” policy that bans “homosexual acts.” Another 200,000 went to the Paul Anderson Youth Home, which teaches boys that abuse they faced as children “has produced all kinds of evil throughout the culture to include the explosion of homosexuality in the last century.” The Salvation Army got 130,000 — and yes, it’s still openly opposed to marriage equality.      The restaurant chain was recently in the news again because Scott Pruitt, the anti-LGBT head of the Environmental Protection Agency, tried (and failed) to win a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife. He praised the company as a “franchise of faith.”      In other words, the right wing has not forgotten what Chick-fil-A stands for. Just the opposite.      Mike Huckabee once hosted a national Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day in response to the backlash over its anti-LGBT donations. Now conservatives enjoy ordering Chick-fil-A just to show allegiance. They eat it so often that Sen. Lisa Murkowski once complained it was getting a little tedious to attend meetings.      With this latest incident, the use of Chick-fil-A as symbology for social conservatism continues. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio jumped into the Twitter debate to claim the left has gone too far with its dislike for Chick-fil-A.      This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatch — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 11, 2018      At least one famous Twitter user gets the sense that Republicans use Chick-fil-A as a political football. ||||| Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash after eating at Chick-fil-A. Getty      Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey ignited a backlash online after revealing that he ate at Chick-fil-A this month.      On Saturday, Dorsey posted a photo on Twitter with the caption \\"Boost @ChickfilA,\\" showing he had saved 10% on a 31.58 order at the fast-food chain. A \\"boost\\" is a cashback reward Square users can earn when using a Cash Card, which is a debit card from the payment platform.      Critics immediately seized on Dorsey's support of Chick-fil-A — whose CEO has come under fire for his views on same-sex marriage in the past — during Pride Month.      Twitter/@jack      \\"You must love the taste of bigotry!\\" one person wrote in response.      \\"Why is Twitter boosting a notoriously anti-gay company during #PrideMonth?\\" another person wrote.      Among the critics was the former CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien, who said, \\"This is an interesting company to boost during Pride month, @jack.\\"      Dorsey responded: \\"You're right. Completely forgot about their background.\\"      Twitter/@jack      Some people supported Dorsey's decision to eat at Chick-fil-A, saying that it's \\"great\\" and that he shouldn't have to apologize for eating a chicken sandwich.      One person tweeted: \\"Don't give in to these people and their complaints. I'm gay and I LOVE ChickfilA. Ridiculous. Go on and eat that ChickfilA and post as much as you want about it!\\"      The backlash shows Chick-fil-A still has lingering problems with its brand image following remarks six years ago by the company's CEO, Dan Cathy, regarding his views on same-sex marriage.      Cathy set off a fury among gay-rights supporters in 2012 that led to nationwide protests after he told the Baptist Press that the company was \\"guilty as charged\\" for backing \\"the biblical definition of the family unit.\\"      Reports soon emerged detailing Chick-fil-A's many charitable donations to anti-LGBTQ organizations.      For months afterward, protesters rallied outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country and held \\"kiss-ins,\\" where same-sex couples kissed in front of onlookers and TV cameras covering the backlash.      Since then, Chick-fil-A has worked to shed its controversial image, and over time, protests against the chain have largely dissipated.      Given the backlash against Dorsey's Chick-fil-A meal, however, it seems the fast-food chain still has some work to do to move past Cathy's comments. |||||","output":"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had a meal at Chick-fil-A and then posted about it on Twitter.

But what's in it, who hates it, and what happens next? (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)      The United States and 11 other nations have come up with a trade deal after years of negotiations. But what's in it, who hates it, and what happens next? (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)      President Obama hailed the historic 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal completed here Monday as an accord that “reflects America’s values,” but within hours the administration had turned from the negotiating table to selling the agreement on Capitol Hill, a reflection of the harsh political climate the controversial pact is expected to face in Congress.      Obama pledged that the ­Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest free-trade agreement in a generation, would open new markets for U.S. goods and services and establish rules of international commerce that give “our workers the fair shot at success they deserve.”      But almost immediately there were signs of the tough fight ahead to win final ratification from Congress next year. Lawmakers from both parties criticized the pact as falling short in crucial areas, raising the prospect that the White House could lose the support of allies who had backed the president’s trade push earlier this year.      “Closing a deal is an achievement for our nation only if it works for the American people and can pass Congress by meeting the high-standard objectives laid out” by lawmakers in the spring, said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “While the details are still emerging, unfortunately I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short.”      Monday’s announcement that trade ministers had reached consensus on the deal, after five days of negotiations, started the clock on the final stages of winning approval from national legislatures. The United States, where the 2016 presidential campaign is underway, is not the only nation where political turbulence could affect completion of the deal.      Protesters in Atlanta stage marches against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. (Paul Handley/AFP/Getty Images)      Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who backed the deal, is facing a tough reelection vote this month, and the opposition party has said it would not be bound by the terms of the deal. Leaders of Australia, New Zealand and several other countries made tough compromises that face stiff opposition at home.      On the U.S. campaign trail, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, slammed the deal, saying that “Wall Street and other big corporations have won again.” Republican front-runner Donald Trump tweeted on Monday: “The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal.” And Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton has hedged on the TPP pact, despite having supported it while serving as Obama’s secretary of state.      “I’ll leave the presidential politics to someone else,” U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said during a news conference in Atlanta. “Our job is to reach agreement and explain it fully to the American public. Given where we are in the calendar, this really is a 2016 issue for Congress to consider.”      Obama must wait at least 90 days after notifying Congress of the deal before he can sign it and send it to Capitol Hill, and the full text of the agreement must be made public for at least 60 of those days.      Congress is expected to receive the legal documents to start the 90-day clock later this week. Lawmakers will then have 30 days to review the deal before it is made public.      The next step will be for the U.S. International Trade Commission to conduct a full economic review of the deal. The agency has up to 105 days to complete that work.      Under the terms of “fast track” trade legislation approved by Congress this summer, lawmakers will not be able to amend or filibuster the TPP pact. The only leverage they have is to fully approve the deal or reject it in its entirety. Fast-track also ensures that it takes only a simple majority to pass the deal, but that majority support is far from guaranteed. Obama has battled trade skeptics in both parties this year in his quest to secure the expedited rules. The additional negotiations have done little to sway critics within his party.                  Capitol Hill staffers said votes in the House and Senate are not likely to take place before mid-April, at the earliest, and a reshuffling in the House Republican leadership after the announced resignation of Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) could produce even more uncertainty. While the GOP has been more supportive of Obama’s trade agenda, some conservatives have opposed a pact negotiated by a Democratic White House.      Opponents in Obama’s party, who believe the deal will hurt working-class Americans, have vowed to turn the trade deal into a political issue in an attempt to block it. Only 28 of 188 House Democrats supported the fast-track trade bill in June.      “Froman says this is a 2016 issue. That’s perfect timing because a presidential election year is the best opportunity to shine a light on all the bad trade provisions in this deal,” said Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a fierce critic of the pact. The Obama administration “is supposed to be fighting for the American public, not high-priced lobbyists, but unfortunately this administration’s approach has been the exact opposite.”      The TPP, which has been negotiated for eight years, is a sprawling, 30-chapter accord that addresses tariff reductions for agriculture and automobiles, as well as intellectual-property rights for movies and pharmaceutical drugs, the free flow of information on the Internet, wildlife conservation, online commerce and dispute settlement practices for multinational corporations.      The 12 TPP nations — Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam — account for 36 percent of the world’s gross domestic product.      Negotiators meeting here were under mounting pressure to close the gaps on several remaining issues. Efforts to reach final consensus during the last negotiating round in Maui in July broke off after deadlocks over dairy tariffs, rules governing where automobiles are manufactured and market protections for next-generation biologic drugs.      According to U.S. officials, the talks in Atlanta were a marathon that stretched deep into the night and early morning. Plans to announce a deal were postponed several times as negotiators hashed out the technical details, and the language of the text was still being tweaked at 5 a.m. Monday, just hours before the news conference.      But members of Congress warned in the final days that the pressure to close the deal could lead to bad compromises from the U.S. delegation. Hatch is reportedly upset over the terms that would govern how long pharmaceutical companies could maintain market exclusivity on genetically engineered drugs. U.S. law allows 12 years of patent-style protections, but the final agreement is reportedly closer to the five years allowed under Australian law.      “The United States should not settle for a mediocre deal that fails to set high-standard trade rules,” Hatch said.      Other lawmakers hailed separate portions of the agreement, including new labor standards to protect workers and a last-minute provision that would not allow cigarette companies access to a new international dispute settlement panel. Critics of such panels, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have charged that the pact would allow large corporations to sue TPP member nations for lost profits if they changed their public health laws or other regulations.      “It’s now time for Congress and the public to examine the details of the TPP and assess whether it will advance the nation’s interests,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a key party supporter of Obama’s trade push.      Officials in Atlanta emphasized that the agreement will pay long-term dividends, deepening multilateral relations in a way that develops common interests and reduces volatility in global markets. The TPP represents the largest U.S. trade pact since the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico in 1993.      Obama aides have called the deal an important part of a foreign policy strategy to maintain an economic edge on China, which has been expanding its influence in Asia. The TPP has been crafted to allow other nations to join if they pledge to meet the standards, and South Korea already has expressed interest.      “Long after details of things like tons of butter sold are regarded as a footnote in history, the bigger picture of what we achieved today will be what remains,” said New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser. “Our industry structures will change in response to the opportunities in this agreement. In future years, we will be absolutely certain of the depth of achievement we reached at this point in our collective history.”      Kelsey Snell in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Mike Drury retrieves a pallet at the Hardware Sales Inc. warehouse in Ferndale, Wash. Hardware Sales Inc. officials say the company's e-commerce division could benefit from streamlined customs regulations when the 12 Pacific Rim countries agree to a massive trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (AP Photo) Deal reached on giant 12-nation trade pact The pact is expected to tear down trade barriers and establish rules in areas like labor, the environment and e-commerce.      ATLANTA - Negotiators from the U.S., Japan and 10 Pacific Rim nations on Monday cinched the biggest trade pact in recent history, setting the stage for President Barack Obama to send the deal to a divided Congress early next year.      \\"We, the trade ministers... are pleased to announce that we have successfully concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation,\\" United States Trade Representative Michael Froman declared shortly after 9 a.m. to a loud round of applause. \\"After more than five years of intensive negotiations, we have come to an agreement that will support jobs, drive sustainable growth, foster inclusive development and promote innovation.\\"      Story Continued Below      The pact, if approved by the member nations, would tear down trade barriers and establish rules in areas like labor, the environment and e-commerce for countries that produce 40 percent of the world’s economic output, from giants like the U.S. and Japan to developing nations like Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is key to Obama’s “pivot” to Asia, aimed at anchoring the United States in a region increasingly dominated by China.      But the decision to address currency manipulation in a side deal, rather than in the pact itself, was expected to disappoint lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. U.S. auto manufacturer Ford is already urging Congress to renegotiate the agreement on that basis.      Trade ministers stayed four days past their expected departure to make the final, difficult concessions on auto, dairy and drug protections— knotty issues that will likely shape the votes in Congress, as well as in the legislatures of other nations.      A congressional vote is likely months away, next February at the earliest, and perhaps later if Obama waits for final details to be ironed out before he gives Congress the legally mandated 90-days notice that he intends to sign it.      But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch signaled trouble for the deal right out of the gate.      “While the details are still emerging, unfortunately I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short,” Hatch said in a statement, likely referring to the U.S.' inability to secure 12 years of patent protection for biological drugs, as he had sought.      House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who along with Hatch and Sen. Ron Wyden drafted the trade promotion authority bill, said he is reserving judgment until he sees the final text.      “[O]nly a good agreement … will be able to pass the House,” Ryan said in a statement.      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, without identifying specific issues, said in a statement that \\"serious concerns have been raised on a number of key issues\\" and said the deal “demands intense scrutiny by Congress.\\"      Business groups have pushed for comprehensive tariff cuts and strict intellectual property protections. U.S. pharmaceutical companies in particular wanted 12 years of monopoly protections for a new class of life-saving medicines called biologics, but U.S. negotiators faced stiff opposition from other countries and had to settle for far less — five years of guaranteed protection and the possibility of additional time under two options that countries could elect.      As for the currency manipulation side deal, it would give the administration a range of options, such as “cooperative mechanisms, enforceable rules, reporting, monitoring, transparency, or other means, as appropriate.” But it would not do what lawmakers have repeatedly requested, which is to directly punish currency manipulators by withdrawing their benefits under the trade deal.      Still, the administration is banking that the overall economic heft and geostrategic importance of the agreement will overcome concerns in Congress about individual provisions. They argue that many farmers and businesses could benefit greatly from the agreement, especially in markets like Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam, where they now face significant trade barriers.      “Whether you’re an orange grower in Florida, a rancher in Nebraska or a boat builder in Washington state, TPP will include cuts to trade barriers, like tariffs” that currently block exports, an Obama administration official said.      The agreement throws another variable into the volatile 2016 presidential election campaign, with Republican front-runner Donald Trump criticizing the pact before it was even complete and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton adopting a wait-and-see approach on a major geopolitical play she touted as Obama’s secretary of state.      The new trade deal also sets the stage for another potentially bruising battle in Congress, following this summer’s debate over trade promotion authority, which was narrowly approved in the House. That law allows Obama to submit the deal to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without any amendments, greatly easing its chances for approval. But it also allows lawmakers to strip that “fast track” provision if they feel the administration has not adequately consulted with them or followed congressional negotiating objectives.      As Froman and his team pushed for the final deal, senior members of Congress grumbled that they weren’t being kept up to date about developments on key issues. “We expect you to intensify these consultations and coordination immediately,” the top Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee said in a letter to Froman on Wednesday.      U.S. trade officials, however, bristled at the suggestion they haven’t kept Congress informed. Froman has met with 100 members since a previous TPP ministerial meeting in Maui in late July, including with the Senate and House advisory groups on negotiations, they said. Froman said on Monday that he would start briefing lawmakers about the final deal as early as the afternoon and added that he was “confident that people will see this as a very strong deal, very much consistent with the directives of Congress with regard to trade promotion authority.”      The AFL-CIO labor federation and many environmental groups lined up behind congressional Democrats in the unsuccessful attempt to defeat the fast track trade bill. Still, the administration hopes what it describes as groundbreaking labor and environmental provisions will soften the opposition if not completely quiet it.      “TPP will include the most robust enforceable environment commitments of any trade agreement, and will allow us to address pressing issues like wildlife trafficking, illegal logging and illegal fishing,” an administration official said. “TPP will put American workers first by including the strongest enforceable labor standards of any trade agreement in history, including in areas like child labor and forced labor and wages.”      As part of the agreement, all 12 TPP member nations would have to abide by international standards that allow for the right to collective bargaining, prohibit child labor and prevent employee discrimination. Vietnam would be required to allow independent unions and Malaysia would have to address human trafficking concerns.      Among the groups of lawmakers who will be taking a close look at the details of the deal will be those from dairy states, who sent letters this week expressing concern about U.S. producers giving up more sales in their home market than they gain in exports under the pact.      Another high-stakes battle involved auto trade between Japan and the three North American Free Trade Agreement partners — the United States, Canada and Mexico. There, the U.S. auto industry won long phase-outs of the 2.5 percent tax on imported passenger cars and 25 percent tax on imported trucks.      The final tussle was over how much of each vehicle had to be made from parts manufactured within the 12-nation TPP region to qualify for reduced duty treatment under the pact. Japan wanted a much lower standard than the 62.5 percent requirement for autos and 60.0 percent for auto parts under NAFTA, but had to reopen negotiations after Canada and Mexico pushed back.      Those negotiations also produced a flurry of letters and op-eds from lawmakers and union leaders as negotiators shuttled between rooms at a hotel in downtown Atlanta searching for agreement. “We must do better under the TPP by increasing rules-of-origin standards, not lowering them,” a group of 23 House Democrats led by Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, said in a letter to Froman on Thursday.      Meanwhile, many agriculture-state lawmakers were irked by Froman’s decision to insert language in the agreement that would prevent companies from challenging anti-smoking regulations and other “tobacco control measures\\" under an investor-state dispute settlement forum that is a standard feature of free trade agreements and investment treaties.      The change was driven by an unresolved case brought by Philip Morris against Australia’s plain-packaging law critics hold up as a classic example of how ISDS can undermine government public health regulation. Opponents of the move argued that it would create a bad precedent to exclude any legal product, no matter how unpopular, from investment provisions of the trade deal.      Sen. Thom Tillis said he would vote against TPP if the tobacco “carve-out” was included and 17 members of the House Agriculture Committee also expressed concern about the provision in another letter to Froman. Still, 21 Democrats who backed Obama’s request for trade promotion authority this summer urged Froman to include it in the deal.      The agreement is also expected to contain a number of other reforms to the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in response to criticisms raised by many Democrats, including Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.       ||||| Summary:","output":"The United States, Japan, and 10 other countries around the Pacific have come up with a trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

Page said he was first diagnosed with paralysis in his left vocal cord after a bad cold. However, his condition worsened last summer when his right vocal cord also became paralyzed. Experiencing paralysis in both vocal cords is extremely uncommon, according to Dr. Nicole Maronian, director of the Voice Center at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, who did not treat Page for his condition. “Since I’ve been in practice, since 1998, it’s been one patient. Having it affect both vocal cords, it’s pretty rare,” Maronian told FoxNews.com. Normal vocal cords open and then close completely every time they are stimulated by the nerves. \\"They have to close in a tight line to get the kind of strong voice out that you and I have today,” Maronian said. But when vocal cords become paralyzed, they are not able to close completely, leaving a gap. “If there’s a gap, air starts leaking through, and you start sounding breathy, softer,” Maronian explained. In addition to hoarseness, patients with this paralysis can also experience shortness of breath due to air leaking through the gap between the vocal cords. “They often get a little bit high-pitched, trying to project or pitch the voice. They get short of breath because of all that air leaking out, or have trouble getting full sentences out because of the air leaking out,” Maronian said. Some patients even experience aspiration, when recently swallowed fluids leak through the space in between the vocal cords. Aspiration can lead to coughing symptoms or even “aspiration pneumonia, which has significant morbidity and mortality,” Maronian said. While the paralysis is typically thought to be caused by a viral infection, such as a cold, pneumonia or bronchitis, other factors may be to blame as well. “Lots of things can affect the nerve: A virus, compression from a thyroid issue, other things like cancer, (or) surgeries where the nerve is ether stretched or pulled,” Maronian said. Page disclosed that he was also diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in 2008, an inflammation of the thyroid gland, which may or may not affect his vocal cord paralysis. “Sometimes the thyroid gets big which can compress the nerve and push on it. Usually though, the gland burns out and gets small and the nerve compression issue isn’t a piece of it anymore,” Maronian said. Recovery time for vocal cord paralysis can vary. Some patients rebound within months, while others take much longer to heal, Maronian noted. Depending on the needs of the patient, doctors can offer several treatment options for vocal cord paralysis. Patients can wait and see if the condition improves on its own, but many opt for vocal cord injections or surgical procedures to achieve faster relief and recovery. “In the office or operation room, we can (inject) a material next to the vocal cord that pushes it into a more natural position, so it can get closure. (We then) watch and hope it recovers on its own,” Maronian said. Page said in his statement that he plans to “fund a significant research program” through the Vocal Health Institute, led by Dr. Steven Zeitels from the Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital Voice Center.

Why did big mama in Dredd 3D(2012) not blow up the building? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"1. Task: Determine if Judge Dredd could kill Deathstroke. Step 1: Analyze the abilities of each character. Judge Dredd is a highly skilled law enforcer in a dystopian future, with advanced weapons, armor, and a strong sense of justice. He has heightened accuracy, physical abilities, intelligence, and is an experienced hand-to-hand combatant. Deathstroke, on the other hand, is a DC Comics mercenary and assassin with enhanced strength, agility, stamina, and regenerative abilities. Deathstroke is also a skilled martial artist and possesses a genius-level intellect, which makes him tactically superior. Step 2: Compare their abilities. It is essential to compare the physical and mental strengths of the characters, as well as the technology and resources they possess. Deathstroke seems to have the edge with his enhanced abilities, regeneration, and strategic advantage, but Judge Dredd is a formidable opponent nonetheless. Step 3: Justify the outcome. Given the differences, Judge Dredd could potentially kill Deathstroke, but it would likely be a very difficult task. The outcome of such a confrontation would be highly dependent on the specific circumstances, skillsets, and tools available to each combatant. 2. Task: Determine why Big Mama in Dredd 3D (2012) did not blow up the building. Step 1: Analyze the motive behind Big Mama's actions. The character Ma-Ma (Big Mama) was a ruthless drug lord who wanted to maintain control over her territory and criminal activities in the building called 'Peach Trees'. Blowing up the building would have destroyed her drug manufacturing operation, her power base, and possibly killed her in the process. Step 2: Assess her strategic options. Big Mama's priority was to eliminate the threat posed by Judge Dredd and his associate, not to destroy the building. She took a more tactical approach by attempting to trap and kill them within the building rather than causing mass destruction. Step 3: Justify her decision. Big Mama's decision to not blow up the building can be justified by her desire to maintain power and control over her criminal enterprise. Blowing up the building would have resulted in catastrophic losses for her, both in terms of her drug operation and her power within the criminal underworld. 3. Task: Analyze if the two questions are the same. Step 1: Compare the nature of the questions. The first question is about a hypothetical confrontation between two fictional characters, while the second question is related to the motives and decisions of a character in a specific movie. Step 2: Assess the similarity. The two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of the fictional works – one being a hypothetical scenario and the other focusing on a specific plot point within a movie. They are related to the universe of Judge Dredd, but each question requires a separate analysis to answer accurately. Step 3: Justify the conclusion. Based on the differences in the nature of the questions, it can be concluded that these two questions are not the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question 2: How would changing the 500 and 1000 currency notes help indian government in dealing with corruption?  -- no  -- yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, both questions 1 and 2 are asking about the potential effects of scrapping 500 and 1000 rupees notes in relation to curbing corruption and black money in India. To provide a detailed and long answer, I will collectively address the content of both questions. The decision to scrap or demonetize the 500 and 1000 rupees notes was primarily aimed at curbing corruption, black money, and counterfeit currency in India. Black money refers to income or transactions that are not reported to the tax authorities, thereby evading taxes. Corruption often involves using black money for bribery and illegal activities. Here are ways that scrapping high-denomination notes may help address corruption and black money: 1. Cash-based transactions: Black money transactions are predominantly cash-based, especially when it comes to corruption, as it's easier to hide and operate without a paper trail. By scrapping 500 and 1000 rupees notes, the government aimed at making it extremely difficult for people to carry out large unaccounted cash transactions that facilitate tax evasion, corruption, or illegal activities. 2. Bringing black money into the mainstream economy: One of the main goals of demonetization was to force those who possess black money to deposit their unaccounted cash in banks. As a result, the government could identify people who are holding large sums of money that is not accounted for, and the deposited cash can be taxed accordingly. Thus, demonetization may help in bringing that money back into the mainstream economy. 3. Elimination of counterfeit currency: A significant amount of counterfeit currency in circulation was in the form of 500 and 1000 rupees notes. By demonetizing these notes and introducing new designs with advanced security features, the government aimed at eliminating fake currency, which often funds illegal activities and terrorism financing. 4. Encouraging digital transactions: With less cash in circulation and people finding it challenging to transact in large sums, demonetization also aimed at promoting digital and cashless transactions. Digital transactions leave a digital footprint, which makes it difficult for parties involved to evade taxes and indulge in corruption. Hence, it may reduce corruption and the generation of black money in the long run. 5. Greater accountability and transparency: With more transactions moving to digital platforms and making it difficult for people to operate with unaccounted cash, the government's intention was to bring greater accountability and transparency to the economic system. This could make it difficult for people to misuse public funds or indulge in corrupt practices. However, it is essential to note that while scrapping 500 and 1000 rupees notes might have had some impact on corruption and black money, it is not a standalone solution. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach, including stricter regulation, enforcement, and creating a culture of transparency and accountability. Moreover, demonetization also had unintended consequences such as a temporary cash shortage, the distress faced by many individuals and businesses, and economic disruption."},{"instruction":"Q: Question: what is phylum cnidaria?

In the course of a long and innovative career, he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century.  Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune \\"Country Gardens\\". Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms. In 1914, Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and in Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother's suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure.

The Maronites are a Christian group who adhere to the Syriac Maronite Church with the largest population around Mount Lebanon in Lebanon. The Maronite Church is an Eastern Catholic sui iuris particular church in full communion with the Pope and the Catholic Church, with self-governance under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, one of more than a dozen individual churches in full communion with the Holy See. They derive their name from the Syriac Christian saint Maron, whose followers migrated to the area of Mount Lebanon from their previous location of residence around the area of Antioch, establishing the nucleus of the Syriac Maronite Church. Some Maronites argue that they are of Mardaite ancestry, but most historians reject such claims. Phoenicianism is an identity on the part of Lebanese Christians that has developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, but there are a few who have stood out more than others: Charles Corm, Michel Chiha, and Said Aql in their promotion of Phoenicianism. In post civil-war Lebanon since the Taif agreement, politically Phoenicianism is restricted to a small group.  Among leaders of the movement Etienne Saqr, Said Akl, Charles Malik, Camille Chamoun, and Bachir Gemayel have been notable names, some going as far as voicing anti-Arab views. In his book the Israeli writer Mordechai Nisan, who at times met with some of them during the war, quoted Said Akl, a famous Lebanese poet and philosopher, as saying;  Akl believes in emphasizing the Phoenician legacy of the Lebanese people and has promoted the use of the Lebanese dialect written in a modified Latin alphabet, rather than the Arabic one, although both alphabets have descended from the Phoenician alphabet.  In opposition to such views, Arabism was affirmed at the March 1936 Congress of the Coast and Four Districts, when the Muslim leadership at the conference made the declaration that Lebanon was an Arab country, indistinguishable from its Arab neighbors. In the April 1936 Beirut municipal elections, Christian and Muslim politicians were divided along Phoenician and Arab lines in the matter of whether the Lebanese coast should be claimed by Syria or given to Lebanon, increasing the already mounting tensions between the two communities. Phoenicianism is still disputed by many Arabist scholars who have on occasion tried to convince its adherents to abandon their claims as false, and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead. This conflict of ideas of identity is believed to be one of the pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country to the detriment of national unity.  In general it appears that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of the Lebanese history and culture whereas the older, long-standing Christian communities, especially the Maronites focus on their history, and struggles as an ethnoreligious group in an Arab world, while also reaffirming the Lebanese identity, and refraining from Arab characterization as it would deny them their striving achievement of having fended off the Arabs and Turks physically, culturally, and spiritually since their conception. The Maronite perseverance lead to their existence even today.","output":"This text is primarily about the Maronites, a Christian group that adheres to the Syriac Maronite Church, with the largest population found around Mount Lebanon in Lebanon.

If The Palais des Papes is the resulting combination of feudal fortress and opulent palace., can we conclude that \\"The Palais des Paes served multiple functions.\\"?","output":"Yes, we can certainly conclude that the Palais des Papes, or the Palace of the Popes, served multiple functions. As you mentioned, it is a combination of a feudal fortress and an opulent palace, which signifies the different purposes it held over time. To provide a detailed explanation, let's explore the history and key features of the Palais des Papes, which further supports the assertion that it was multifunctional. The Palais des Papes is located in Avignon, France, and holds immense historical significance. It was constructed in the 14th century during a tumultuous period in the church's history, known as the Avignon Papacy. From 1309 to 1377, the Roman Catholic Church suffered a crisis when the papacy was moved from Rome to France due to the political turmoil in Italy. Consequently, the Palais des Papes served as the primary residence for popes during that time. As a feudal fortress, the Palais des Papes was designed to provide security and protection to its occupants, given the uncertain circumstances. Many architectural elements pointed to the defensive role it played, such as its thick walls, high towers, and drawbridges to control access. It was also strategically located on a rock with natural defenses in place, such as steep slopes and the Rhône River. The Palais-des-Papes was initially designed by the architect Pierre Peysson, who built the first structure known as the Old Palace, followed by architect Jean de Louvres, who built the New Palace. The old palace had fewer decorative elements and was predominantly built for protection, while the new palace was built primarily to showcase the popes' opulence and power. This combination of the two palaces gives the structure we see today as the Palais-des-Papes. Being an opulent palace, the building also demonstrated the wealth, power, and influence of the church. Beautiful frescoes adorned the walls, and the layout included numerous grand rooms, such as the Pope's personal apartments, chapels, and ceremonial halls. The palace also housed an extensive library that contained a diverse collection of manuscripts, supporting the intellectual aspect of the church. As such, the Palais des Papes signifies not only the church's political power but also its investment in art, culture, and knowledge. Furthermore, the palace was surrounded by gardens (such as the Jardin des Doms), vineyards, and a papal mint, which emphasize the economic aspect of its functioning. These resources facilitated trade and commerce, benefiting both the Vatican and the local economy. In conclusion, the Palais des Papes indeed served multiple functions as a symbol of religious power, a fortress to ensure security, an opulent palace emphasizing the wealth and grandeur of the church, and a center for art, culture, and knowledge. This combination of a feudal fortress and an opulent palace cements its status as a multifunctional structure and one of the most important monuments of medieval history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The school wrote: \\"Following a misunderstanding today, we would like to confirm that the 'bottle flip challenge' is not permitted in school. \\"Students caught doing this will have an immediate C3 detention.\\" The Facebook post elicited more than 120 comments. \\"It never fails to amuse me how much schools care about ridiculous things,\\" one person wrote. \\"It's flipping lost its bottle,\\" said another while others said the school was being \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"pathetic\\". One parent, however, supported it saying \\"they are there to learn, not to mess about\\". The Facebook post was later removed after the school said \\"inappropriate language\\" was being used in comments, but the detention notice remains on the website.

Article: If you are afraid of the dark,it's not a big deal.It's perfectly normal to feel afraid After all,animals do too. \\"Fear matters,\\"says Karen Warkentin,an ecologist.\\"It's a good thing,\\" she adds, \\"because fear makes you do things that keep you alive.\\" Like kids,many animals experience fear and they respond to the feeling in variety of ways.A frightened turtle pulls its head and legs inside its shell.A  small fish will swim away when a big,hungry fish approaches. Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water. Question: We are told in the passage that tree frogs  _  .

Please briefly summarize this news article: NASA Scientist Publishes 'Colonizing the Red Planet,' a How-To Guide A manned mission to Mars would be the greatest adventure in the history of the human race. And one man knows how to make it a reality. In fact, he just wrote the book on it -- literally. Joel Levine, senior research scientist with NASA's Langley Research Center and co-chair of NASA's Human Exploration of Mars Science Analysis Group, just published \\"The Human Mission to Mars: Colonizing the Red Planet.\\" The book reads like a who's who of Mars mission science, featuring senators, astronauts, astrophysicists, geologists and more on getting to Mars, studying its atmosphere and climate, the psychological and medical effects on the crew and other details. There's even a section detailing the science of sex on Mars, should NASA attempt to create a permanent colony there. \\"For the last three years, I've been co-chairing a panel of about 30 U.S. and Canadian scientists, coming up with a blueprint, purely from a scientific perspective, of humanity's role on Mars,\\" Levine told FoxNews.com. He was asked to put together a special edition of the Journal of Cosmology exploring the topic, which was just published as the new book. \\"The United States of America is the only country that can do this successfully right now,\\" he said. And to remain the technological leader of the world, he argued, we need to do this. And it's quite possible, the book notes; after all, a trip to Mars isn't even a lengthy one. \\"The trip to Mars would take on the order of 220 days using today’s chemical propulsion technology,\\" writes Steven A. Hawley, a former astronaut now with the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Kansas, in a chapter on the challenges and sacrifices of the trip to Mars. He suggests either a short duration or longer duration stay before the return trip. \\"The longer surface mission would enable significant science, but also expose the crew to greater risk if systems don’t function as planned.\\" But regardless of whether a colony is initially established, Levine is passionate -- and poetic -- about a trip to Mars. \\"When we do this, the human species will be a two-planet species for the first time ever,\\" he said. A trip to Mars would open up countless revelations and possibly answer one of the greatest questions science today seeks to answer: is there life elsewhere in the universe? \\"The search for life outside the Earth is one of the key questions in all of science,\\" he told FoxNews.com, \\"and of all the objects in the Solar System, Mars is the most likely.\\" Many scientists speculate that life may exist on the red planet today in the form of microorganisms, and the book concludes that a manned mission could very well answer that question for once and all. \\"All of the articles here conclude that yes, it's possible that when we go to Mars we will find microorganism at the surface or below the surface.\\" Another question Levine believes the mission will answer deals with the strange history of Mars -- which he called the most intriguing, and the most confusing planet in the solar system. Today Mars has no liquid water and a very, very thin atmosphere -- it's like the Earth's atmosphere at 100,000 feet, he said. Yet we have very, very strong evidence that its surface used to be covered with water. What happened to it all? \\"What catastrophic event led to Mars going from an Earth-like planet to a very inhospitable planet today?\\" he asked. The Mars mission would send humans there to study that, and see if there's a lesson in the planet for the future of Earth. Levine has a general timeline in mind for the mission, which he hopes to launch by 2040. He believes we could launch the missions far sooner, however -- if we could afford to. Tragically, the major problem for getting humans to Mars isn't building new spacecraft, furthering science, or inventing new technologies, he says. The only hold-up is the budget. \\"NASA's budget is 18 billion a year, and I don't think we can seriously plan a launch until 2040\\" given those funds, he said. \\"If NASA's budget went up 3 billion a year, or 5 billion a year, we could do it in half the time.\\" But Levine presents a solution for that problem in his book as well, something unprecedented for NASA: advertising. \\"The suggestion is marketing to different corporations and professional sports leagues for advertising, which is something NASA never does -- it's a whole new economic plan for financing what has to be the greatest adventure in the history of the human race.\\" Read the special edition of the Journal of Cosmology here. Summary:","output":"Joel Levine, a senior research scientist with NASA's Langley Research Center, has published a book entitled \\"The Human Mission to Mars: Colonizing the Red Planet.\\" The book covers travel to Mars, the study of its climate and atmosphere, medical and psychological effects on crew members, and colonization development. According to Levine, there is a general timeline for the mission potential in 2040, with budget constraints being the main limitation. The book suggests a new economic plan for financing the Mars mission, such as incorporating advertising from corporations and professional sports leagues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Idol Meter: The finals Performance order: Studies by WhatNotToSing.com and others have established that singing first on the show is a clear handicap, while singing last is a big plus and second-to-last a lesser but still significant plus. So show-closers get 10 points, the second-to-last contestant gets 5, the opener gets minus 5, the rest zero. Performance quality: Buzz, judges' verdict and (especially) song choice are vital to a contestant's survival, but none of that would mean a thing without what we watch Idol for: the performance itself. It's worth anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points. Exceptional circumstances: Idol is live, and the unpredictable can happen. When it does, we'll dole out anywhere from minus 10 to plus 10 points for incidents including, but not limited to, emotional shout-outs or breakdowns, sickbed performances, superstar stage lighting, forgetting lyrics, false starts, major vocal gaffes, tantrums, overt sullenness, sassing a judge, being adopted as perverse causes clbres or anything else that might influence voting. Judges' verdict: Respect them or not, the judges' opinions can't help but influence voters. So positive comments from Randy, Steven and Jennifer are worth up to 6 points each, while a negative comment scores as much as minus 6. If a performance receives a unanimous, three-judge, flat-out rave, 3 bonus points will be added for a total of 21. Dial Idol: DialIdol.com, which calculates phone-voting strength from busy signals, has had a strong record of predicting eliminations over the years, though its accuracy might suffer this year as online voting is being allowed for the first time. While we monitor the situation, contestants receiving green (or safe) ratings from Dial Idol get 5 points.

As I passed another ward  , a woman asked, \\"Are there more where that came from?\\" When I explained, she seemed very disappointed. She then said that she had cancer and could eat very little other than the occasional ice cream. The next evening, I decided to buy two ice creams. On the way to dad's room, I came into the sick woman's room, and offered her the ice cream I'd bought for her. She was totally astonished that I had thought of her, and accepted the gift with tears in her eyes.

Input: By Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC News NI Health Correspondent It is looking at when women are referred for further tests after an initial breast cancer screening at their local health trust. The Health and Social Care Board says staffing difficulties have meant \\"longer than acceptable\\" waiting times. The plan is to reduce the current number of specialist breast cancer services. Instead, so-called centres of excellence are hoped to be provided. For instance, there is a question mark over the future of assessment services in the Southern Health Trust. While its two mobile screening units will remain, the BBC understands that on-going staffing levels could mean that women who require further assessment may have to attend a different health trust. It is understood three potential locations are being considered - Altnagelvin, Dundonald and Antrim Area Hospitals. Plans to transform the local health and social care system includes less duplication of services. 'Staffing difficulties' While that could mean hospital buildings not closing, services inside could be dramatically transformed. For instance a hospital might lose or gain a service. That could mean specialist staff and patients being expected to travel elsewhere, maybe even a little further, to get the expertise required. In a statement, the Health and Social Care Board (HSC Board) and Public Health Agency (PHA) said there have been challenges in recent years to meet waiting list targets due to \\"difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialist staff in a number of trusts\\". \\"While a number of measures have helped to improve the waiting times for those referred for breast assessment, the need for a more sustainable model of care which can provide an assessment, within target timescales, for all people with a suspicion of breast cancer is widely recognised,\\" it added. It says a project board was established last year, which is expected to send a report to the Department of Health in December. \\"A consultation on the recommendations is expected during early 2019,\\" the statement added.

Although Joel, who works as a mechanic in the family garage, is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage. Before locking up late one night, Lauryn goes on the stage and silently and elegantly dances, while unbeknownest to her, Russ watches from a distance.

As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight. His wedding ring falls off his finger. Louise becomes concerned when Scott points out that she no longer needs to stand on tiptoe to kiss him. Finally, there is x-ray proof that Scott is getting smaller. His doctor refers him to the prominent laboratory, the California Medical Research Institute, and after nearly three weeks of sophisticated tests, Scott and his team of new doctors learn that the mist to which he was exposed was radioactive. This, combined with an accidental exposure to a large amount of common insecticide four months later, has set off a chain reaction that has rearranged Scott's molecular structure, causing his cells to shrink. Scott continues to shrink proportionately. His story hits the headlines, and he becomes a national curiosity. He can no longer drive a car and has to give up his job working for his brother, Charlie (Paul Langton), who encourages him to make some money off his story by selling it to the national press. He begins keeping a journal, to be published as a record of his experiences. As things continue, Scott feels humiliated and expresses his shame by lashing out at Louise, who is reduced to... My question: What does the antidote arrests? Answer:","output":"The antidote arrests Scott Carey's shrinking process. In \\"The Incredible Shrinking Man,\\" Scott becomes exposed to a radioactive mist and later a common insecticide, which together trigger a chain reaction that alters his molecular structure and causes his cells to shrink. As Scott continues to shrink proportionally, his life becomes increasingly difficult, and he struggles to adapt to his new reality. Finding an antidote would enable Scott to stop the shrinking process, potentially preventing further physical, emotional, and social consequences of his condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Adults of this family are almost always confined to fresh water. This is the only family in the superfamily Atyoidea.  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:  - The telson is the posterior-most division of the body of an arthropod. It is not considered a true segment because it does not arise in the embryo from teloblast areas as do real segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked \\"tail\\" called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans.  Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments.  - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion.  - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing.

It contains the following species:  - Atyopsis is a genus of freshwater shrimp from Southeast Asia . It was erected in 1983 by Fenner A. Chace , Jr. for two species formerly treated in the genus Atya . It differs from Atya by various characters , including the form of the telson ( which is longest at the corners in Atyopsis , but not in Atya ) and the presence of a \`\` massive spur '' on the male third pereiopod . The genus comprises two species , Atya spinipes and Atyopsis moluccensis . No fossil representatives are known .

Please briefly summarize this news article: Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee Wraps Up MANCHESTER, Tenn. — The 10th Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival ended on Sunday, and more than 85,000 people returned to civilian life, their ears ringing with too much music. Because it is a brand with a mysterious grip on hale young-adult Americans with mystical tendencies, because it broke little aesthetic ground and because it’s a milestone year, let’s do consumer service first. Jim James of My Morning Jacket on Day 2 of the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Tennessee.

From left, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and Neil Young, original members of Buffalo Springfield. More Photos » Bonnaroo is convenient, more so than, say, Coachella: it takes one unhazardous hour to get from the festival site to the Nashville airport, and Manchester, in Coffee County, is central to the mid-South. Security is good-natured, even humorous. The festival is well priced: at 210 to 250, a general-admission ticket can be 100 cheaper than Coachella, for four days instead of three. (For another 750, the organizers will set you up with a nice-looking tent the size of some New York studio apartments.) It is hot, and getting hotter: this is a June of record highs for Tennessee, with temperatures in the mid-90s, about 10 degrees above what they should be. The food on the grounds, absurdly plentiful, is a step above Italian sausages and corn dogs, though those were available too. There’s an enormous tent for microbrewed beer. You can find a decent cup of coffee. The big festivals are starting to look alike, but there is still no snob appeal to Bonnaroo, which is intriguing. You couldn’t say it welcomes everyone; you could say it welcomes anyone. On the nine-stage schedule, Gregg Allman competed with Robyn; Bruce Hornsby competed with Junip; Wiz Khalifa competed with Loretta Lynn and Bootsy Collins. There was a sports bar right off the hippie-beads and glass-blowing boulevard near the festival’s center, where a forest of dudes watched the Mavs beat Miami. (This festival took root in hippie loam before it sprouted elsewhere: into metal; hip-hop; Americana; bad early-morning, glow-stick techno; general alternative tweeness; and Mongolian power-rock.) The alternative to the microbrewed ales was Miller Lite. The amount of dust on the festival part of the site — maybe a quarter of the 750-acre plot owned by Bonnaroo’s organizers — was staggering, and finally hard to live with. Often, it felt like an effort to find an area without dust; often, the areas without dust were muddy. Camping? Lots of it, well demarcated, separated into areas with funny names, and I heard tales of deer ticks, but otherwise I can’t help you; I was at a price-jacked Holiday Inn. It all happened on time, with minimal slippage. Mr. Collins ran 40 minutes late with the funk, and Sunday night’s “Superjam” took 30 minutes for a Noah’s Ark sound check. Superjam! Lots of solos, you’d think, and few songs, called on the fly. Not so. Dr. John — whose 1974 album “Desitively Bonnaroo” gave the festival its name and who performed that album in full with the Meters and Allen Toussaint late on Saturday night — collaborated with Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. They had two drummers: Patrick Hallahan, of My Morning Jacket, and Max Weissenfeldt, of the German rare-groove band Poets of Rhythm, a light-handed drummer who knows his rare 45’s, who knows the precise differences between the rhythms of James Black and Zigaboo Modeliste. (This is where snobs are useful.) They’d rehearsed and planned. They played Dr. John songs — “Jump Sturdy,” “Black John the Conqueror” — and other bits of New Orleans, like “Iko Iko” and Betty Harris’s fabulous “Break in the Road.” The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, from New Orleans, joined them with horns and bass drum. The superjammers were not too inclusive or too sloppy: they kept the funk to a quiet rustle, with few solos, except for Mr. Auerbach’s — scrappy, flavorless, short, a courtesy to his fans, no damage done. Oh, it was good. Summary:","output":"The 10th Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, concluded on Sunday, with over 85,000 attendees returning home. The festival, which appeals to young-adult Americans, is conveniently located close to the mid-South region and Nashville airport. Well-priced general admission tickets and improved security measures have further enhanced the event's attractiveness. Bonnaroo's food offerings have also grown in variety and quality, including an enormous tent for microbrewed beer. While many big festivals are starting to look alike, Bonnaroo stands out for its inclusive atmosphere, welcoming a diverse range of acts over nine stages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. According to the above context, answer the following question. How did the author come up with the idea to write the book? A:","output":"The author came up with the idea to write the book \\"Dealing With Disrespect\\" after being bothered by the negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback that creators often receive on the internet.

Here is an article: Blake Griffin missed all of what should have been his rookie season with an injury, but clearly is making up for lost time. And his 47-point performance last night isn't the only sign the Clippers' big man is headed for greatness. What matters just as much is the way he's getting under the skin of the opposition. When you get in the other guy's head, that's when you've arrived in the NBA. Such was the case Sunday when Lamar Odom got in a tussle with Griffin rather than let the final seconds of a Lakers loss tick off peacefully. The video shows Odom grabbing Griffin's jersey in the way cornerbacks snatch at receivers who are about to beat them for touchdowns. After that game Kobe Bryant readily admitted to the Los Angeles Times that Griffin had \\"punked us.\\" That was the case again in Griffin's 47-point explosion against Indiana. Most of Griffin's damage came against 11-year vet James Posey, who was in no mood to share a kumbaya afterward. Posey also refused to shake hands with Griffin. \\"He tried to, I declined,\\" Posey told the Indianapolis Star, which reported the two exchanged harsh words several times during the Clippers' victory. \\"He already gave us 40 something and I'm going to shake his hand and thank him?\\" asked Posey. \\"I'm good.\\" With that game, Griffin improved to a 27.5 scoring average over the last 10 games, and also notched his 27 consecutive double-double. Here's four writers assessing Griffin's prospects for superstardom. (The vote here is slam-dunk.) And I like the comment from the LA Times' Lisa Dillman best: \\"Just get him a decent nickname and a high-profile actress girlfriend and this superstar thing might be happening a lot faster than even the longest-suffering Clipper fan ever thought.\\" See photos of: Los Angeles Lakers, Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Lamar Odom, James Posey, Blake Griffin To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor .

Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy.

Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain.

How to cut dragon fruit  Slice the dragon fruit in half.  Place the fruit on a cutting board and get a sharp knife. Leaving the skin intact, cut the fruit lengthwise. Options are: (i) Keep cutting until the center half of the fruit is cut down to avoid scoring the skin. Don't slice the fruit too much. (ii) You should be able to cut along the fruit with the cut side facing upwards. Stop cutting once you are about half the way through, as the fruit will continue to soften as it ripens. (iii) A single cut down from the stem separates the fruit into 2 halves, revealing the edible white fruit inside. Use a spoon to separate the fruit from the skin. (iv) You will end up with a sharp side that has a number of vegetables on it and a sharp side that has a dull side.

Context: Two chains of DNA twist around each other to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.:4.1 Answer:","output":"Three hydrogen bonds connect the cytosine-guanine pairs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rodriguez accused Selig of turning a blind eye to what he said was \\"gross, ongoing misconduct\\" of the division that he claims was responsible for his suspension. Rodriguez is appealing his 211-game suspension for alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs. His legal team will present its side of the case to an arbitrator on November 18. Major League Baseball had a similarly sharp response for the three-time MVP and 14-time All-Star.

Question: Information:  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It highlights political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible narratives.  - Slowhand is a 1977 album by Eric Clapton. Released on 25 November by RSO Records, and titled after Clapton's nickname, it is one of his commercially and critically most successful studio albums. \\"Slowhand\\" produced the two hit singles \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary.  - \`\` Wonderful Tonight '' is a ballad written by Eric Clapton . It was included on Clapton 's 1977 album Slowhand . Clapton wrote the song about Pattie Boyd . The female vocal harmonies on the song are provided by Marcella Detroit ( then Marcy Levy ) and Yvonne Elliman .  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - \\"Lay Down Sally\\" is a song performed by Eric Clapton, and written by Clapton, Marcella Detroit (as Marcy Levy, the diminutive form of her birth name), and George Terry. It appeared on his November 1977 album \\"Slowhand\\", and reached No. 3 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart.  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\"  part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor  has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Marcella Detroit (born Marcella Levy, June 21, 1952) is an American soprano vocalist (perhaps best known for her backup singing on many Top 20 Billboard hits), guitarist, and songwriter. She released her debut album \\"Marcella\\" in 1982 to little success before she joined Shakespears Sister with ex-Bananarama member Siobhan Fahey. Detroit sang the lead vocals on their biggest hit, \\"Stay\\", which was number one in the United Kingdom for eight consecutive weeks. Since leaving the band in 1993, Detroit has maintained a successful solo career, and from 2002 to 2007 fronted her own self-titled blues band.  - Sydney is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds the world's largest natural harbour, and sprawls towards the Blue Mountains to the west.

Clapton ranked second in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" and fourth in Gibson's \\"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\\". He was also named number five in \\"Time\\" magazine's list of \\"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\\" in 2009.  - Patricia Anne \\"Pattie\\" Weston (née Boyd) (born 17 March 1944) is an English model, photographer and author. She was the first wife of both George Harrison and Eric Clapton. In August 2007, she published her autobiography \\"\\". Her photographs of Harrison and Clapton, titled \\"Through the Eye of a Muse\\", have been exhibited in Dublin, Sydney, Toronto, Moscow, London, Almaty, and throughout the United States.  - Bananarama are a British female pop music vocal group formed in London in 1979 by friends Sara Dallin, Siobhan Fahey and Keren Woodward. Their success on both pop and dance charts have earned them a listing in \\"The Guinness Book of Records\\" as the all-female group with the most chart entries in the world.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - George Harrison, (25 February 1943  29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Yvonne Marianne Elliman (born December 29, 1951) is an American singer who performed for four years in the first cast of \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\". She scored a number of hits in the 1970s and achieved a US #1 hit with \\"If I Can't Have You\\".

Answer the following question: Skylar got good at sport that year by practicing all the time.  Given the context: What will Others want to do next? OPTIONS: (i). tell Skylar that they are arrogant (ii). ask Skylar to practice with them (iii). be interested in sports Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it seems that Skylar's dedication and hard work towards the sport they have been practicing have yielded fruitful results that year. It's not unusual for others in the community, such as friends, classmates, or teammates, to notice and potentially be inspired by Skylar's progress and success throughout that year. Given the options provided, the most likely response of others in the context would be: (ii). ask Skylar to practice with them There are several reasons why this option seems the most fitting in the given scenario: 1. Human nature tends to gravitate towards success: People generally like associating themselves with those who are successful or excel in a particular field. They may feel that by practicing with Skylar, they too could improve their sport skills and achieve similar success. 2. Skylar could be a valuable mentor or resource: Skylar’s consistent practice and evident improvement indicate that they must have gained valuable experience and knowledge about the sport. Other participants might think that getting the chance to practice with Skylar would provide them with the opportunity to learn from a knowledgeable peer. 3. Creating a positive and supportive environment: By choosing to practice with Skylar, others are fostering a healthy atmosphere that encourages growth and development in the sport. This camaraderie can lead to elevated morale among the group, further motivating them to work harder and strive for success together. On the other hand, the other two options seem less likely based on the context: (i). tell Skylar that they are arrogant: This option assumes that Skylar's success in the sport has led to a perceived arrogance in their behavior. However, there is no mention of arrogance in the provided context, and the assumption might stem from negative emotions like jealousy or insecurity. While some may feel this way, it is not the most probable option for the majority of others. (iii). be interested in sports: Although Skylar's success might pique others' curiosity or generate interest in sports in general, it does not address a direct connection or interaction with Skylar. This option doesn't reflect the immediate impact of Skylar's achievements on the people around them. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it seems most likely that others would want to ask Skylar to practice with them, seeing the potential benefits for their own improvement and the creation of a positive, supportive environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When NASA astronaut Scott Kelly completes his yearlong mission on the International Space Station next year, he'll come back just a little bit younger than his twin, Mark, than he was before. This is because time travels more slowly in space, a phenomenon first described by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity.  This December, universities and academies around the world are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the theory's publication.  Even 60 years after his death, Einstein is still the most important scientist of the modern era. Looking back as far as 2,400 years ago, only Newton, Galileo and Aristotle were his equals.  Born in the era of horse-drawn carriages, his ideas started a technological revolution that brought about more change in one century than in the 2,000 years before.  In 1905, Einstein published four important scientific papers. These completely changed people's ideas about space, time, light and matter. In one of these papers Einstein. introduced his theory of special relativity. Two groundbreaking parts of the theory were about the relationship between mass and energy and the speed of light. Einstein was able to show that mass and energy were connected through the formula E=MC2. The theory also says that no object can travel faster than the speed of light.  About 10 years later came his theory of general relativity, the theory that modern physics is really based on. In Einstein's mathematics, space has three dimensions, and the fourth dimension is time. Space and time are part of one continuum, called space-time. The presence of mass changes space-time, which explains where gravity comes from.  Computers, satellites, telecommunication, lasers, television and nuclear power, many of the biggest developments in the modern world, can be linked to Einstein's work.  \\"We are a different people than we were a century ago,\\" said astrophysicist Michael Shara of the American Museum of Natural. History, \\"completely different, because of Einstein.\\"  However, there's more to him beyond the image of a science mastermind. Einstein, as a person, has also become a grandfatherly icon in our culture.  He liked playing Mozart on his Violin and keeping fit by hiking and walking. Power was not his goal. In 1952, the young nation of Israel asked Einstein to be its president, but he refused.  And, yes, he was eccentric. With hair like that, how could he not be? 1. Scott Kelly is what? 2.

William \\"Bill\\" Boss, a psychopathic prison warden, watches the end of The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) with his accountant, Dwight Butler. Bill says that he hates the films as his feet are massaged by his secretary, Daisy. Daisy replies that she enjoyed them. In response, Bill sucks his finger and inserts it into Daisy's vagina, telling her that women should not be allowed to voice their opinions. Dwight interrupts, attempting to pitch a \\"brilliant idea\\" to fix the prison's horrible retention and violence rates, but he is interrupted by a phone call. Bill and Dwight are then summoned to the scene of an assault within the prison. One of the officers has been stabbed by an inmate. As punishment, Bill decides to stomp on the arm of the prisoner, exposing the bone and causing immense pain. He promises to do it again when his bones are healed. Back in the Warden's office, Bill receives a mysterious package. After Dwight asks what it contains, Bill reveals that it is a jar of specially imported, dried African clitorises which he eats \\"for strength.\\" After eating a few, he receives a threatening prank phone call from one of the inmates. Bill waterboards him with three buckets of boiling water, horribly disfiguring him. The inmate tells Bill that he has lost his soul. Governor Hughes arrives immediately afterwards, ordering Bill and Dwight to put a stop to the violence and promising that they will both be fired otherwise.

U.S. Manufacturers Find the Right Shore in Mexico Mexicoâs rise makes a compelling case for the right-shoring strategy for U.S. manufacturers. By Derrick Johnson | UPS More and more these days, sophisticated U.S. imports â often from the aerospace, automotive, and high-tech industries â share a common designation: Made in Mexico. This trend reflects growing confidence among U.S. manufacturers that Mexico offers far more than affordable labor just across the southern border. The country has modern, industry-specific manufacturing hubs staffed by skilled workers. U.S. companies and their customers can gain these benefits without having to wait for goods shipped across thousands of miles of ocean or paying for higher-priced air shipping. Mexico has long been an important location for production and end delivery of goods, especially for companies that want to put manufacturing closer to U.S. demand. Mexico could be one of the primary incubators for innovation in the world. But the countryâs participation in many free trade agreements and its recent emergence as a world-class manufacturing center present an excellent opportunity for U.S. companies to balance other factors like costs or local resources to determine the proximity of sourced materials to production, warehousing, and distribution. In this case, U.S. companies establish manufacturing operations in Mexico to boost the benefits derived from just-in-time production practices while also taking advantage of Mexican skills and infrastructure. Over the last few decades, Mexico has established itself as a country where companies can build supply chains nimble enough to meet the demands of 21st-century manufacturing. Manufacturers need speed, efficiency, and the ability to ramp up and contract production depending on the demands of the day. They also face more pressure than ever before to reduce transit times. This often requires shorter supply chains. For U.S. companies that sell goods domestically, nearby Mexico is a logical choice to locate crucial supply chain links. Thatâs why weâre witnessing dramatic growth in a number of industries in regions throughout Mexico. Take the aerospace industry, for example. Mexico has several aerospace manufacturing hubs that are known for industry expertise. Of Mexicoâs 31 states, 16 have factories that specialize in aerospace, according to the Offshore Group. Between 2008 and 2013, as many as 36 aerospace factories were established in Chihuahua City. The state of Chihuahua has universities and technical schools that graduate thousands of engineers and technicians each year. These graduates enter the workforce ready to support the local manufacturing industries, including aerospace. U.S. automakers Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler also are concentrating some manufacturing operations in Mexican cities, including Ramos Arizpe, Toluca, Hermosillo, and Chihuahua. The companies gain the benefits of relatively low business costs, skilled workforces, and free trade agreements, which enable easier exporting to foreign markets. Meanwhile, the city of Guadalajara has become known as the Latin Silicon Valley. More than 600 high-tech companies have facilities there, and the city is now the top producer of software, electronics, and digital components in Mexico. Manufacturing hubs like these compete directly with rival hubs in China, which, for a long time, has been the offshore manufacturing destination of choice for companies around the world. But, as Chinese labor and transportation costs rise, U.S. companies see more value in locating manufacturing operations in Mexico where they can more easily supply U.S. markets. Mexicoâs improving transportation infrastructure is another important factor that companies consider when they decide to put operations in the country. They also take a close look at intellectual property protection, which is stronger in Mexico than in other parts of the world. This is especially important for industries like aerospace and high-tech, which develop cutting-edge products. Finally, concerns about setting up operations in Mexico are gradually dissipating as governments work to secure supply chains and improve personal safety for the people who live and work there. Mexicoâs economy is one of the most trade-integrated in the developing world, and trade between North American nations is on the rise. U.S. goods traded with Mexico in 2013 amounted to 506.6 billion, a gain of 2.8 percent from 2012, according to the U.S. Mission to Mexico. In the 20 years since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, exports from the United States to Mexico have increased by 336 percent while Mexicoâs exports to the United States have increased by 465 percent. Thatâs why UPS is so bullish on Mexico and has devoted so many resources to the region of late. For example, UPS CrossBorder Connect service bundles the necessary transportation components north and south of the U.S.-Mexico border with the companyâs leading brokerage capabilities. This provides seamless integration and supply chain efficiencies and helps companies balance the need for speed with cost concerns. UPS launched the service in 2012 in direct response to the resurgence of Mexico as a manufacturing base. We see immense opportunity in the U.S.-Mexico trade lane in the years ahead. When it comes to fostering economic growth, Mexico is a modern-day success story. But the best part of the story is yet to be told. In 20 years, Mexico could be one of the primary incubators for innovation in the world. In large part, I see that happening through expanded business ties with the United States. You may not know that Mexico is already the leading trade partner for 32 U.S. states. But reading the tea leaves, even better times are on the horizon â for both countries.

Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"US manufacturers are moving their factories to Mexico instead of China, because Mexico has become a world-class manufacturing center with skilled workers, modern industry-specific manufacturing hubs, and participation in many free trade agreements, making it a better choice for supply chains and reducing transit times for goods delivery.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use in conjunction with a...  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person, who using a German text, included some period instrumentation?

Summarize the following: As a loner, it can sometimes be hard to get out of the house as you may wonder what you can do by yourself without feeling weird. However, if you think about it you will find that there are lots of things you can go do alone to have some fun.  Going to the movies is a great thing to do alone. Find a movie you've been wanting to see, pick up some popcorn, and enjoy the film. Going to the movies with people is all well and good, but when you think about it, it seems a bit silly since you don't talk to each other the whole time the movie is showing anyways. Try out different coffee shops. Coffee shops have become very popular in the past few years, so there are more and more popping up every day. Take a book or, if you like drawing, a sketchpad. Order a nice coffee or tea, and just enjoy a few hours out of the house. Try out a restaurant you've been interested in. If there is a restaurant you're interested in, there is no reason you should feel embarrassed to go alone. If you're worried that people will stare at you, try to go during an off-peak time. Go for a walk or a run. Another great thing to do alone is just to go out and enjoy nature. Go for a walk or jog in a nearby park and you'll be doing something good for you and your health. One part of going out in public that can make a loner feel nervous is the possibility that someone will try to chat casually with you. If you want to avoid this, put on a pair of headphones or have a book to read while you are waiting around or riding public transport. This will discourage people from engaging in idle chat. This doesn't guarantee that no one will talk to you. Some especially outgoing people are hard to deter. If someone talks to you and you aren't interested in the conversation, keep your answers short and don't ask questions that will encourage the conversation. If you are not used to going out by yourself to do things, you might feel as though everyone is staring at you, which will distract you from enjoying what you are doing. Try to remember that it is unlikely that anyone is truly interested in what you are doing or why you are doing it. As you spend more and more time outside the house by yourself, you'll come to realize that most people are just trying to get on with their day. Although it will take some practice, when you go out to do something, focus on how you're feeling about what you're doing instead of on what you think everyone around you is feeling. If you aren't able to focus on yourself you may find the experience of going out alone just as draining as going with other people. Depending on your work or school setting it may be very easy for you to go days or weeks without talking to anyone. For example, if you work from home you may not have to talk to anyone at all. While this may be comfortable for you, there is evidence that socializing is good for everyone (even loners) from time to time. It doesn't have to be a huge conversation. You can simply chat with someone in your class or at a coffee shop for a few minutes. For example, you can bring up how tough that last test was with a classmate, or you can ask the barista about her favorite beverage to make. Summary:","output":"Being a loner doesn't have to stop you from enjoying various activities by yourself. Going to the movies, exploring new coffee shops, and dining alone at restaurants are just a few ways to spend time outside the house. To avoid unwanted conversations, use headphones or carry a book as a deterrent. Remember, most people are focused on their own activities, so try to focus on enjoying your own experience instead of worrying about what others might think. Although socialization might not be a preference for loners, engaging in small conversations occasionally can be beneficial. By trying out these activities, loners can step out of their comfort zones and find enjoyment in doing things independently."},{"instruction":"Q: Title: This watch delivers what was promised Review: This is at least my 4th CITIZEN watch, the first, having lasted manyyears, and second, smashed from a car accident after 8 years, the third still working fine and now, this one with the moon phase, the months,the days, etc.This watch delivers what was promised.

Answer the following question: -  Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process is the excretion of the waste products.  Step-by-step explanation: 1. Fluid and waste enter the kidneys via the renal arteries, which carry blood from the main blood supply (aorta) to the kidneys. 2. The kidneys process the fluid and waste through a series of filtration and reabsorption mechanisms. This occurs in the nephrons, the functional units of the kidneys. 3. During the initial filtration step, waste and fluid pass through a barrier that prevents larger molecules, such as proteins and blood cells, from passing through. This prevents essential components of the blood from being lost. 4. As the fluid moves through the nephrons, essential ions, glucose, and water are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream to maintain proper electrolyte balance and hydration levels. 5. Some bad waste products are actively removed from the bloodstream and added to the filtrate during the processing steps in the nephron. 6. The processed fluid, now containing the waste products and excess ions, becomes urine. 7. The last step of the process is transporting the urine out of the kidneys through the ureters, storing it temporarily in the bladder, and eventually excreting it from the body through the urethra during urination. This step ensures that the waste products and excess fluid are effectively eliminated from the body, maintaining proper fluid balance and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question. What structural element of a building protrudes from the plane of a sloping roof surface, creating usable space in the roof by adding headroom and usually enabling addition of windows?","output":"A dormer is a structural element of a building that protrudes from the plane of a sloping roof surface, creating usable space in the roof by adding headroom and often enabling the addition of windows. Dormers are commonly used to increase the available floor space and provide natural light and ventilation to an attic or loft area. Dormers come in various shapes and styles, each serving a specific function and aesthetic purpose. The most common types include: 1. Gable dormer: Also called a dog-house dormer, it has a gable roof that slopes in the same direction as the main roof. This is the most straightforward and affordable dormer, characterized by its triangular shape, which provides additional headroom and space in the attic. 2. Shed dormer: This dormer has a single, sloping flat roof that turns upward at a shallower angle than the main roof. Shed dormers are usually wider than gable dormers, giving them more usable space, making them ideal for creating larger rooms or adding more windows in the attic area. 3. Hip dormer: A hip dormer has a roof that slopes downward on all three sides, creating a more complex design. The roof merges seamlessly with the main roof, making it visually attractive and providing substantial additional space. 4. Eyebrow dormer: This type of dormer has a curved roof that resembles an eyebrow, with no vertical sides. The design is aesthetically pleasing and often used for its architectural appeal, but it provides less usable space than other dormer types. 5. Flat roof dormer: As its name suggests, a flat roof dormer has a single flat roof. While it might not be as visually appealing as other dormers, it provides a significant amount of usable space and additional light. 6. Arched or segmental dormer: A dormer with an arched or curved roof, providing an elegant design to the building's exterior and a subtle increase in usable space. Dormers can be constructed in various ways, depending on the construction materials and architectural style. The most common construction materials include wood, steel, and masonry. The choice of material for the dormer may depend on the existing roofing materials, the overall architectural style of the building, and the desired longevity and ease of maintenance. In addition to providing usable space, dormers offer several other benefits: 1. Enhanced architectural style: Dormers can add visual interest and personality to a building, enhancing its curb appeal. 2. Energy efficiency: Windows added to a dormer can improve natural lighting and ventilation, reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling systems. 3. Increased property value: Improving the usable floor space of a building and its aesthetic appeal through dormers can potentially increase its property value. In summary, a dormer is a structural element of a building that protrudes from the plane of a sloping roof surface to create additional headroom, usable space, and natural light in the attic area. The various types of dormers have different forms and functions, but they all serve to enhance the architectural style and provide practical living solutions within a building."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I heard that Skylar, walking along the path, looked down and saw the ring and made sure to return it.  And I was wondering How would you describe Skylar? Available options: - Like a good girl; - thoughtful; - absent minded; Answer:","output":"Skylar can be described as a combination of all the available options, demonstrating qualities of being a good girl, thoughtful, and absent-minded at the same time. Here's a more detailed explanation: 1. Like a good girl: In the given situation, Skylar displays a strong sense of responsibility and conscientiousness. Upon finding the ring, she goes out of her way to ensure its safe return to its rightful owner. This act showcases her as a good girl who values integrity, trustworthiness, and empathy for others. She understands that a lost item could be of great value and emotional significance to someone, and her actions exhibit a sense of moral uprightness. 2. Thoughtful: The incident also highlights Skylar's thoughtfulness towards others, as she takes the time to consider a person's potential distress upon losing something valuable. Her empathetic nature is well-reflected in her initial impulse to find the owner, rather than simply ignoring the lost item and moving on. In doing so, Skylar demonstrates that she is focused on the well-being of others, not just driven by selfish motives. She is mindful of the potential consequences of her actions and thinks through her decision, even if it means going out of her way. 3. Absent-minded: Although Skylar is diligent in returning the ring, the very fact that she is walking along a path and suddenly notices the ring suggests that she might have previously been lost in her thoughts, hence the absent-minded aspect. While she may have a kind heart and a caring nature, her mind could sometimes wander or become preoccupied with things that are not immediately relevant to her surroundings. This aspect of her character adds a touch of realism to her personality, as it shows that she is not perfect, but rather a well-rounded individual with both strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, Skylar's character can best be described as a blend of being a good girl, thoughtful, and absent-minded. Her actions in returning the lost ring demonstrate her strong sense of responsibility, empathy, and thoughtfulness towards others. At the same time, her absent-minded tendencies remind us that even the most admirable people have imperfections that make them relatable and human."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death.

Pick from: (a). unacceptable (b). acceptable","output":"A linguist would likely rate the given sentence \\"He hurt himself with it when he tried to open it\\" as (b). acceptable. While the sentence could be made clearer by specifying what \\"it\\" refers to, the sentence structure, grammar, and syntax are all used correctly in this case. First, let us analyze the sentence structure. The sentence combines two independent clauses using the conjunction \\"when.\\" This creates a complex sentence, which is a typical and acceptable structure in English. Second, the grammar and tense used in the sentence are consistent. The sentence is in the past tense, as evidenced by the verbs \\"hurt\\" and \\"tried.\\" The subject \\"he\\" is followed by the verb \\"hurt,\\" and the object \\"himself\\" aligns with the reflexive nature of the action. The pronoun \\"it\\" is used as the object of the preposition \\"with\\" and as the direct object of the verb \\"tried,\\" creating a parallel construction. However, one criticism that some linguists may raise is that the use of the pronoun \\"it\\" can result in ambiguity. A clearer sentence would replace \\"it\\" with the specific object being referred to in the context. For example, \\"He hurt himself with the knife when he tried to open the package\\" would eliminate any confusion or ambiguity. Nonetheless, even with the ambiguity, the sentence still adheres to the rules of English grammar, syntax, and structure.

Question 2: Who was awarded the economic sciences Nobel Prize in 2011? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: Why hasn't Dr. Vera Rubin been awarded a Nobel Prize for Physics? Dr. Vera Rubin was an American astronomer who made significant contributions to the study of dark matter, particularly through her pioneering work on galactic rotation curves. Her research provided some of the first compelling evidence for the existence of dark matter, a mysterious and elusive substance that makes up a significant portion of the universe. Despite her exceptional achievements, Dr. Rubin was never awarded a Nobel Prize for Physics. There could be several reasons for this: 1. Scientific recognition: The Nobel Prize is awarded to researchers whose work has had substantial impact in their field. Although Dr. Rubin's work was groundbreaking, the existence of dark matter is still an open question in physics. As astrophysics continues to advance, her contributions may receive more attention, but she may not have been considered yet for a Nobel Prize due to the ongoing debate and lack of definitive proof regarding dark matter. 2. Gender bias: Unfortunately, gender bias may have played a role in Dr. Rubin not being awarded a Nobel Prize. Throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, few women have been awarded the prestigious physics prize. It's possible that the committee didn't give Rubin's work the same consideration as they might have with male scientists working on similar topics. 3. Timing and the Nobel Prize regulations: Vera Rubin passed away in 2016, and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously. Her work was beginning to gain wider recognition in the years leading up to her death, but the prize was not awarded to her during her lifetime. This is due to the fact that there is limited time to recognize any deserving scientist before they pass away, and in many cases, scientific achievements get recognized only after a longer period of time. Question 2: Who was awarded the economic sciences Nobel Prize in 2011? The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2011 was awarded jointly to Thomas J. Sargent and Christopher A. Sims \\"for their empirical research on cause and effect in the macroeconomy.\\" They were recognized for their work in macroeconomics, specifically for their development of methods to analyze the impact of policy changes on the economy. In response to the last part of your question: No, the answer to these two questions is not the same. These questions discuss two different scientific fields (Physics and Economic Sciences) and the reasons behind not awarding a Nobel Prize to Dr. Vera Rubin and the recipients of the 2011 Economic Sciences Nobel Prize are not related. The absence of Nobel Prize recognition for Dr. Rubin can be attributed to various factors, including the ongoing debate around dark matter, gender bias, and rules pertaining to posthumous awards, while the 2011 economic sciences Nobel Prize was awarded to two male economists, Thomas J. Sargent and Christopher A. Sims, for their contributions to macroeconomic research."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's license that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Plazzy. They were driving down the road, arguing about the situation; and he used the moment to grab the wheel, causing the car to crash. Suddenly, the cougar appears; the man gives the dead body to the cougar to eat. The man now has a cell phone signal and calls for help. The man is picked up by a forest ranger.

He was pondering about how human legacy would be viewed in the future. For that, he was very interested in technofossils. He located a site with ample evidence of technofossils. He noted that site as site A. To compare site A with a site with no technofossils he located another site. He noted that site as site B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would site A see less or more litter and debris depostied than site B? A:","output":"Site A, where Mike discovered ample evidence of technofossils, would likely see more litter and debris deposited than site B, which is characterized by the absence of technofossils. The presence of technofossils indicates that the location was or still is a place where human activities involving technology have taken place, leaving behind technogenic materials and artifacts. Technofossils are essentially non-organic materials or remnants created by human activities and technological impact on the environment. They include various types of plastics, metals, electronic components, concrete structures, ceramics, and industrial waste, among other things. In such locations, one can expect to find a larger concentration of litter and debris – especially if those human activities were recent or still ongoing – as these materials have a slow rate of decomposition and persist for extended periods in the environment. In contrast, Site B, which has no technofossils, would presumably have less litter and debris, particularly from human-created sources. The absence of technofossils implies that Site B may either have been relatively unaffected by human activities or that such activities may have occurred in the distant past or at a much smaller scale. In either case, the likelihood of finding a significant amount of litter and debris in such a location would be lower as compared to Site A. As an archaeologist, Mike's interest in technofossils is likely driven by a desire to understand the long-term consequences of human impact on the environment and the manner in which our legacy will be viewed by future generations. By comparing Site A and Site B, he will be able to gain a better insight into the differences between areas with varying degrees of human involvement, which will aid him in deciphering and constructing our present and historic interactions with the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I wonder if the reader from Austin, Texas, read the same book as I did! I could find no trace of any personal attacks (nor personal glorifications, for that matter) in this highly original, provocative and exceptionally well-argued book. Interdisciplinary collaborations on complex themes are notoriously difficult to pull off, but this team has succeeded admirably. The philosophical analysis of the significance of the bonobo ape research for our currently dominant ways of thinking about language, communication and animal capacities is strikingly original. Certainly, these authors do not hold back from exploring the wider significance of their proposed interpretations, but there is a wealth of well-documented and rigorous argument here to support their contentions, and not a shred of evidence of -animus- against those whose views they dispute. A serious and significant book for everyone interested in animal cognition. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of this product review is largely positive. This is evidenced by the use of a range of approving and affirmative phrases and language throughout the text that underline the reviewer's favorable perspective on the product, in this case, a book. The reviewer recognizes the book as not only being original and provocative but also exceptionally well-argued. The use of adjectives such as \\"exceptional\\" and \\"provocative\\" demonstrate positivity clearly, indicating that the reviewer appreciates the stimulating and high-quality nature of the book. Moreover, the praise for the successful execution of the interdisciplinary collaborations, a difficult task according to the reviewer, adds strongly to the overall positive tone of the review. The reviewer's statement of the philosophical analysis as being \\"strikingly original\\" not only confirms the value they placed on originality but reinforces their overall positive perception of the book. The phrase \\"these authors do not hold back from exploring the wider significance of their proposed interpretations\\" suggests the reviewer's admiration of the authors' daring and their thoroughness in their exploration of various themes.

Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.

While all three characteristics can apply to different contexts, in this specific scenario, Jesse's action of inviting their friend to spend Thanksgiving with them shows a genuine consideration for their friend's feelings and situation. Jesse demonstrated understanding and empathy, recognizing that their friend might be lonely or isolated during the holiday season due to their family being far away. By extending the invitation, Jesse made an effort to provide warmth, companionship, and support for their friend during a time that typically emphasizes family and togetherness. Being thoughtful means having the ability to think about the needs, feelings, or interests of others and being mindful of their well-being. It is the quality of showing care and consideration for others, sometimes even putting someone else's needs before your own. In Jesse's case, they took into account the feelings of their friend, who might not have had the opportunity to be with their family, and made arrangements to ensure that their friend had a pleasant Thanksgiving celebration. While protective and thankful are also positive attributes, they do not necessarily apply directly to this context. Protective refers to defending or shielding someone from harm or danger, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Thankful refers to expressing gratitude or appreciation, which could be a sentiment Jesse feels, but does not directly relate to their actions in this scenario.

After reading the above, is \\"Bad LSD trip\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Which event drives Larry to destroy the cult?\\"?","output":"No, \\"Bad LSD trip\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Which event drives Larry to destroy the cult?\\". Instead, the crucial event that leads Larry to take on the mission of destroying Dr. Barnett's cult is when Patricia attempts suicide after Dr. Barnett advises her to have an abortion, because she realizes she is pregnant. A series of events contribute to Larry's decision to act against Dr. Barnett's cult. It starts with Patricia having a bad LSD trip at a dance, which leads to an argument between her and Larry, causing the couple to break up. After Patricia discovers her pregnancy and is advised by Dr. Barnett to have an abortion, she attempts suicide. Larry manages to save her life, and this event serves as the catalyst for Larry to focus on destroying the cult led by Dr. Barnett. Larry's ultimate goal of taking down the cult materializes when he assassinates Dr. Barnett at one of his speeches.

What's the healthcare system like in Japan compared to the U.S.? How does the healthcare system work in Japan? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The healthcare systems in Japan and the United States have some similarities as well as significant differences in terms of access to care, financing, and overall organization. Before I dive into the comparison, let me clarify that the two questions you asked are not the same but are related. The first question asks for a comparison between the healthcare systems of Japan and the U.S., while the second question focuses only on Japan's healthcare system. Now, let me compare the healthcare systems in Japan and the United States, followed by an explanation of how the healthcare system works in Japan. 1. Universal health coverage: Japan has a universal health coverage system, meaning that all Japanese residents have access to healthcare services, regardless of their income, employment, or pre-existing conditions. This is achieved through a combination of compulsory health insurance (either through employer-based or community-based pools) and a government subsidy program. In contrast, the U.S. has a mixed healthcare system with private insurance, employer-sponsored coverage, and government programs like Medicaid and Medicare. However, some U.S. residents remain uninsured or underinsured. 2. Financing: Japan's healthcare system is primarily financed by premiums paid by individuals and employers, as well as by taxes. The government plays a major role in determining the fees for medical services and sets the premium contribution rates based on income. In the U.S., healthcare financing comes from various sources, including private insurance premiums, government spending (Medicaid and Medicare), and out-of-pocket expenses from patients. 3. Cost containment: Japan has been successful in controlling healthcare costs through strict government regulations on medical fees and drug prices, and by encouraging competition among providers. This has led to lower per capita healthcare spending compared to the U.S. The U.S. healthcare system is characterized by high costs, partly due to administrative expenses, high drug prices, and the high use of expensive procedures and technology. 4. Quality of care: Both Japan and the U.S. are known for having high-quality healthcare, but there are differences in how care is delivered and accessed. Japan has a high doctor-to-population ratio, allowing for easier access to primary care. However, the country faces challenges in terms of long waiting times for some specialized services and an aging population. The U.S. has top-notch medical facilities and cutting-edge technology, but access to care can be limited due to insurance status or high out-of-pocket costs. Now, let's further examine how the healthcare system works in Japan: 1. Health insurance: Japanese residents must enroll in one of the two types of compulsory health insurance: Employees' Health Insurance for those who work in medium-large companies and their dependents or National Health Insurance for the self-employed, retirees, or those who work in small businesses. Premiums for health insurance are based on income and set by the government, with employers and employees sharing the cost for the Employees' Health Insurance. The government also provides subsidies to the National Health Insurance to reduce the financial burden on those with lower incomes. 2. Access to care: All Japanese residents, regardless of their insurance type, have access to healthcare services, including physician visits, hospitalization, prescription medications, dental care, and maternity care. Residents are free to choose their healthcare providers and can receive care at any medical facilities. 3. Copayments and out-of-pocket costs: Patients in Japan are required to pay a percentage of the healthcare costs as copayments, usually set at 10-30% for most services, depending on their age and income. The Japanese government imposes a cap on total out-of-pocket expenses, thus limiting the financial burden of healthcare on individuals and families. 4. Healthcare providers: Japan's healthcare system relies on a combination of private and public healthcare providers, with approximately 80% of hospitals being privately owned. Hospitals and clinics need to be registered with one of the health insurance systems to receive reimbursements for services provided. In summary, the Japanese healthcare system is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, with government intervention to regulate costs and ensure affordability. The U.S. healthcare system, on the other hand, has a less centralized approach, with a mix of public and private insurance providers, leading to higher costs and varying levels of coverage. While both systems have their pros and cons, they highlight the different strategies countries employ to provide healthcare to their populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many people have started taking vitamin C pills as a precautionary way. But a research has shown that vitamin C pills do not provide as much protection as they think. They are even not as good as other ways, like often washing your hands. Some German scientists have given people information and a test on the subject helping to stop incorrect ways. Whether it is caused by cold or flu , a runny nose and sore throat are signs of catching a cold. Many people overestimate  the advantages of vitamin C and other pills. For years it was believed that taking vitamin C pills not only provided protection against colds but also against cancers, helping people to live longer. But the result of the research showed disagreement on these beliefs . The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \\"Some pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\\" says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills.

The space marines killed the aliens because they were ordered to.","output":"In the sentence, \\"The space marines killed the aliens because they were ordered to,\\" the pronoun \\"they\\" refers to the space marines. The sentence implies that the space marines carried out the act of killing the aliens due to receiving orders from a higher authority. To understand who \\"they\\" refers to, we should examine the context and structure of the sentence. The sentence consists of two clauses, which can be broken down as follows: 1. \\"The space marines killed the aliens\\" - This is the main clause, and it clearly mentions the two subjects: space marines and aliens. The space marines, in this case, are the doers of the action (killing), while the aliens are the receivers of this action. 2. \\"because they were ordered to\\" - This is a subordinate clause, providing a reason for the action taken in the main clause. The word \\"because\\" is a subordinating conjunction, connecting this clause to the main one by explaining the motivation behind the killing of the aliens. Now, let's analyze the pronoun \\"they\\" in the second clause. Pronouns generally refer to the closest preceding noun or noun phrase that agrees with the pronoun in terms of number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter). In this sentence, the pronoun \\"they\\" is plural, so it cannot refer to a singular noun. The two plural nouns in the sentence are \\"space marines\\" and \\"aliens.\\" Given that the space marines (the doers of the action) are the ones following orders, it makes logical sense for the pronoun \\"they\\" to be referring to the space marines rather than the aliens. Consequently, it is the space marines who were ordered to kill the aliens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The Van de Graaff Generator Van de Graaff generators (or Van de Graaffs) are not only spectacular devices used to demonstrate high voltage due to static electricity—they are also used for serious research. The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 18.38 shows a schematic of a large research version. Van de Graaffs utilize both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages. A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere, because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits.   Q: Practical limits of van de graaff generators arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually do what to surrounding materials?

Question: Information:  - Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901  28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist, who created the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the \\"architect of the nuclear age\\" and the \\"architect of the atomic bomb\\". He was one of the few physicists to excel both theoretically and experimentally. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements. He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics.  - Induced radioactivity occurs when a previously stable material has been made radioactive by exposure to specific radiation. Most radioactivity does not induce other material to become radioactive. This Induced radioactivity was discovered by Irène Curie and F. Joliot in 1934 and received the Nobel Prize in 1935 for this discovery. This is also known as man-made radioactivity. The phenomenon by which even light elements are made radioactive by artificial or induced methods is called artificial radioactivity.  - Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), when it achieved criticality, became the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Its construction was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It was built by the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago, under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field. The first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was initiated in CP-1 on 2 December 1942, under the supervision of Enrico Fermi, who described the apparatus as \\"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\\".  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects.  - Oscar D'Agostino ( 29 August 1901 -- 16 March 1975 ) was an Italian chemist and one of the so - called Via Panisperna boys , the group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi : all of them were physicists , except for D'Agostino , who was a chemist . In 1934 he contributed to Fermi 's experiment ( that gave Fermi the possibility to win the Nobel Prize in 1938 ) to showing the properties of slow neutrons . That led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission , and later on to the construction of the first atomic bomb .  - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - The Via Panisperna boys (Italian: \\"I ragazzi di Via Panisperna\\") were a group of young scientists led by Enrico Fermi. In Rome in 1934, they made the famous discovery of slow neutrons which later made possible the nuclear reactor, and then the construction of the first atomic bomb.  - Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.

Question: How might a bird who has \\"got the moves\\" might benefit? Context: Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays. A:","output":"A bird who has \\"got the moves\\" might benefit by having a higher chance of breeding success. This is because elaborate displays and \\"dances\\" formed from complex combinations of movements play a crucial role in courtship, and a male bird's breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays."},{"instruction":"Process:  - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a blight on trees happens, how will it affect there may be more owlets.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a blight on trees may have both direct and indirect effects on the process and the possibility of more owlets.  Direct effects: 1. Destruction of nesting sites: Since owls typically nest in trees, a blight on trees would lead to loss or damage of nesting sites. This could make it challenging for the owls to find suitable locations to lay their eggs and raise their owlets. 2. Decreased food availability: A blight on trees might also impact the availability of prey (e.g., rodents, small mammals, and insects) that the owls hunt, as these animals depend on the trees for food and shelter. Indirect effects: 1. Increased predation risk: Loss of tree cover may expose the owls to a higher risk of predation from other animals, as they would be more visible and vulnerable without the protection of the trees. 2. Increased competition for resources: The destruction of trees could lead to increased competition among owls (and other species) for the limited available resources, like nesting sites and food. 3. Decreased overall fitness of the owl population: If the perturbation is widespread and long-lasting, the overall health and well-being of the owl population could be affected, leading to fewer successful owl nests and fewer owlets being born. Overall, a blight on trees is likely to have a negative impact on the ability of owls to reproduce and successfully raise their offspring, ultimately resulting in a decline in the number of owlets."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: A text is given in English.

This uncertainty leads him to acknowledge that he has no idea about what to do or suggest in the current situation. Among the provided answer options: 1. He has a good idea: This option is not accurate, as the man clearly states that he does have no idea when he says \\"I have no idea\\". Thus, he does not provide a suggestion or express confidence in a particular course of action. 2. He does not know what to do: This is the correct interpretation of the man's response. His phrase \\"I have no idea\\" indicates that he is uncertain about what steps to take next or what direction they should follow in their situation. This demonstrates a lack of knowledge or confidence in suggesting a course of action. 3. He does not know what to say: While this option might seem plausible given the nature of the conversation, it is not the most accurate interpretation of the man's response. He is not at a loss for words, but rather does not have a suggestion or proposal for the next step. His response expresses his uncertainty about what to do, not necessarily what to say in the conversation.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which plant would not see increase in growth, plant C or plant D?  Hint: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. Answer:","output":"Plant D would not see an increase in growth. This is because gibberellins were applied to plant C, which would stimulate its growth, but plant D did not receive any gibberellins.

Trujillo incorporated elements of native art and hieratic figures in a very contemporary style in his canvases . Trujillo has incorporated in his canvases elements of contemporary art and local figures in a very hieratic style .","output":"While both sentences describe Trujillo's incorporation of various elements in his artwork, they are not exactly the same in meaning. The key differences lie in the order and emphasis of certain components. Let's break down each sentence to better understand the distinctions. 1. Trujillo incorporated elements of native art and hieratic figures in a very contemporary style in his canvases. In this sentence, the primary focus is on the incorporation of two different aspects: native art and hieratic figures. Native art can refer to the traditional art forms, techniques, and symbolism from a specific cultural or regional background. On the other hand, hieratic figures suggest a more formal or stylized representation of subjects, often related to religion or sacred themes. The sentence also emphasizes that these elements are combined in a \\"very contemporary style.\\" This implies that, although the content might be rooted in traditional or sacred motifs, the execution showcases a modern and fresh approach. The style could potentially involve innovative techniques, materials, or perspectives that reflect a contemporary context or the artist's unique vision. 2. Trujillo has incorporated in his canvases elements of contemporary art and local figures in a very hieratic style. The second sentence shifts its emphasis from the direct combination of native art and hieratic figures to a more encompassing focus on contemporary art. This suggests that Trujillo's primary intention is to merge elements of current artistic practices, techniques, and trends with his work. However, the sentence also mentions that Trujillo includes \\"local figures\\" in his art, which might be a way of addressing traditional or regional subject matter. Although this aspect is similar to the first sentence, the second one narrows it down to figures specifically, while the first sentence implies a broader connection to native art as a whole. Instead of incorporating a contemporary style, this sentence highlights that Trujillo merges these elements \\"in a very hieratic style.\\" This suggests that the artist's main approach or aesthetic leans more towards a formal, stylized manner, possibly with a strong connection to religious or sacred themes. In summary, both sentences convey that Trujillo integrates various artistic elements in his work. The first sentence highlights the combination of native art and hieratic figures while emphasizing the contemporary style. The second sentence focuses on a broader incorporation of contemporary art elements and local figures, with a greater emphasis on the hieratic style. While there are similarities in the subject matter, the ordering and focus on different components lead to a subtle difference in meaning between the two sentences."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - Gorakhpur division is an administrative geographical unit of Uttar Pradesh state in northern India.

Article: Children look for plastic bottles at the polluted Bagmati River in Kathmandu March 22, 2013. REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar      LONDON (Reuters) - A quarter of all global deaths of children under five are due to unhealthy or polluted environments including dirty water and air, second-hand smoke and a lack or adequate hygiene, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.      Such unsanitary and polluted environments can lead to fatal cases of diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia, the WHO said in a report, and kill 1.7 million children a year.      “A polluted environment is a deadly one -– particularly for young children,” WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in a statement. “Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water.”      In the report — “Inheriting a sustainable world: Atlas on children’s health and the environment” — the WHO said harmful exposure can start in the womb, and then continue if infants and toddlers are exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution and second-hand smoke.      This increases their childhood risk of pneumonia as well as their lifelong risk of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma. Air pollution also increases the lifelong risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer, the report said.      The report also noted that in households without access to safe water and sanitation, or that are polluted with smoke from unclean fuels such as coal or dung for cooking and heating, children are at higher risk of diarrhea and pneumonia.      Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them, it said.      Maria Neira, a WHO expert on public health, said this was a heavy toll, both in terms of deaths and long-term illness and disease rates. She urged governments to do more to make all places safe for children.      “Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits,” she said. ||||| (CNN) Each year, environmental pollutants cost an estimated 1.7 million lives among children under 5, according to World Health Organization reports released Monday.      The causes include unsafe water, lack of sanitation, poor hygiene practices and indoor and outdoor pollution, as well as injuries.      The new numbers equate to these pollutants being the cause of one in four deaths of children 1 month to 5 years old.      One new report highlights that the most common causes of child death are preventable through interventions already available to the communities most affected. These causes are diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia, which can be prevented using insecticide-treated bed nets, clean cooking fuels and improved access to clean water.      \\"A polluted environment is a deadly one -- particularly for young children,\\" Dr. Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general, said in a statement. \\"Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water.\\"      Infants exposed to indoor or outdoor air pollution, including secondhand smoke, have an increased risk of pneumonia during childhood as well as an increased risk of chronic respiratory diseases -- such as asthma -- for the rest of their lives, one report states.      The global body also highlighted the increased risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer from exposure to air pollution.      More than 90% of the world's population is thought to breathe air that violates quality guidelines set by the WHO.      The reports further list ways in which these risk factors can be removed to prevent disease and death.      \\"Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits,\\" said Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. \\"A polluted environment results in a heavy toll on the health of our children.\\"      Top environmental causes of death among children under 5 1. Respiratory infections 570,000 deaths in children under 5 linked to indoor and outdoor air pollution and secondhand smoke 2. Diarrhea 361,000 deaths in children under 5 linked to poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene 3. Death in first month of life 270,000 deaths in children under 1 month could be prevented by access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene in health facilities, and by reducing air pollution 4. Malaria 200,000 deaths in children under 5 could be prevented by environmental improvements, including reducing mosquito breeding sites or covering drinking water storage 5. Unintentional injuries 200,000 deaths among children under 5 linked to their environments, including poisonings, falls and drowning      The growth of electronic and electrical waste is also a concern, according to the report. If not disposed of correctly, waste can expose children to toxins that can harm intelligence and cause attention deficits, lung damage and cancer.      Also among the fears: an increasing risk of climate change, due to rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels, boosting pollen growth and possibly asthma. An estimated 44% of asthma cases among children worldwide are thought to be related to environmental exposures, the reports say.      In addition to highlighting the burden borne by young children, the new reports suggest ways in which risk factors -- and therefore death rates -- can be reduced.      These include reducing air pollution, improving access to clean water and sanitation, protecting pregnant women from secondhand smoke and building safer environments in order to reduce accidents and injuries.      \\"Both indoor and outdoor air pollution have an important effect on the health and development of children, and not just in the stereotypical 'polluted cities' context but also for very poor rural families who cook indoors,\\" said Joy Lawn, professor of maternal reproductive and child health epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.      \\"Clean water is taken for granted by families in high-income countries, and yet those children in the hottest climates, facing the greatest risks of infectious diseases, are the very ones with least access to clean water.\\"      But Lawn added that pollution is not the only risk factor when it comes to child mortality.      \\"We also need to be careful in attributing these deaths just to dirty water or pollution,\\" she said. \\"To prevent deaths from pneumonia, we also need vaccines and antibiotics; from malaria, we also need bed nets and anti-malarials. It Is not just about pollution.\\"      Other potential solutions mentioned in the reports are removing mold and pests from housing, removing lead paint, ensuring sanitation and good nutrition at schools and using better urban planning to create more green spaces in cities. Safe management of industrial waste by industries is also highlighted, along with stopping the use of hazardous pesticides and child labor in agriculture.      The report \\"highlights the scale of the problem of how environmental pollution affects the health of children across the globe,\\" said John Holloway, professor of allergy and respiratory genetics at the University of Southampton. Holloway recently authored a report on the lifelong impact of air pollution.      \\"We must also remember that it is not just the acute effects of pollution on children's health mentioned in the report that we need to be concerned about, it is also the potential long-term effects of exposure to pollutants in early life that can have lifelong effects on health and well-being,\\" he said.      Holloway also stressed that this is not a concern solely for developing countries. \\"Exposures such as air pollution and secondhand tobacco smoke affects the health of children in developed countries such as the UK as well,\\" he said.      Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.      But, like the WHO, he also stressed that things can be done to help solve the problem and said authorities and individuals should act now -- as well as think long-term -- to protect the health of future generations.      \\"We all have a responsibility for reducing environmental pollution,\\" he said. \\"This is going to require changes in society such as better monitoring of pollution and taking into account the true long-term economic cost of pollution when assessing the cost of measures to reduce environmental pollution.\\" ||||| The cost of a polluted environment: 1.7 million child deaths a year, says WHO      6 March 2017 | GENEVA - More than 1 in 4 deaths of children under 5 years of age are attributable to unhealthy environments. Every year, environmental risks – such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, second-hand smoke, unsafe water, lack of sanitation, and inadequate hygiene – take the lives of 1.7 million children under 5 years, say two new WHO reports.      The first report, Inheriting a Sustainable World: Atlas on Children’s Health and the Environment reveals that a large portion of the most common causes of death among children aged 1 month to 5 years – diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia – are preventable by interventions known to reduce environmental risks, such as access to safe water and clean cooking fuels.      \\"A polluted environment is a deadly one – particularly for young children,\\" says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \\"Their developing organs and immune systems, and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water.\\"      Harmful exposures can start in the mother’s womb and increase the risk of premature birth. Additionally, when infants and pre-schoolers are exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution and second-hand smoke they have an increased risk of pneumonia in childhood, and a lifelong increased risk of chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Exposure to air pollution may also increase their lifelong risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer.      Top 5 causes of death in children under 5 years linked to the environment      A companion report, Don't pollute my future! The impact of the environment on children's health, provides a comprehensive overview of the environment’s impact on children’s health, illustrating the scale of the challenge. Every year:      570 000 children under 5 years die from respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution, and second-hand smoke.      361 000 children under 5 years die due to diarrhoea, as a result of poor access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene.      270 000 children die during their first month of life from conditions, including prematurity, which could be prevented through access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene in health facilities as well as reducing air pollution.      200 000 deaths of children under 5 years from malaria could be prevented through environmental actions, such as reducing breeding sites of mosquitoes or covering drinking-water storage.      200 000 children under 5 years die from unintentional injuries attributable to the environment, such as poisoning, falls, and drowning.      Ongoing and emerging environmental threats to children’s health      \\"A polluted environment results in a heavy toll on the health of our children,\\" says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. \\"Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits.\\"      For example, emerging environmental hazards, such as electronic and electrical waste (such as old mobile phones) that is improperly recycled, expose children to toxins which can lead to reduced intelligence, attention deficits, lung damage, and cancer. The generation of electronic and electrical waste is forecasted to increase by 19% between 2014 and 2018, to 50 million metric tonnes by 2018.      With climate change, temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide are rising, favouring pollen growth which is associated with increased rates of asthma in children. Worldwide, 11–14% of children aged 5 years and older currently report asthma symptoms and an estimated 44% of these are related to environmental exposures. Air pollution, second-hand tobacco smoke, and indoor mould and dampness make asthma more severe in children.      In households without access to basic services, such as safe water and sanitation, or that are smoky due to the use of unclean fuels, such as coal or dung for cooking and heating, children are at an increased risk of diarrhoea and pneumonia.      Children are also exposed to harmful chemicals through food, water, air and products around them. Chemicals, such as fluoride, lead and mercury pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, and others in manufactured goods, eventually find their way into the food chain. And, while leaded petrol has been phased out almost entirely in all countries, lead is still widespread in paints, affecting brain development.      Making all places safe for children      Reducing air pollution inside and outside households, improving safe water and sanitation and improving hygiene (including in health facilities where women give birth), protecting pregnant women from second-hand tobacco smoke, and building safer environments, can prevent children’s deaths and diseases.      For example, multiple government sectors can work together to improve the following:      Housing: Ensure clean fuel for heating and cooking, no mould or pests, and remove unsafe building materials and lead paint.      Schools: Provide safe sanitation and hygiene, free of noise, pollution, and promote good nutrition.      Health facilities: Ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene, and reliable electricity.      Urban planning: Create more green spaces, safe walking and cycling paths.      Transport: Reduce emissions and increase public transport.      Agriculture: Reduce the use of hazardous pesticides and no child labour.      Industry: Manage hazardous waste and reduce the use of harmful chemicals.      Health sector: Monitor health outcomes and educate about environmental health effects and prevention.      Under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) countries are working on a set of targets to guide interventions for children’s environmental health, as well as to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under five by 2030. In addition to SDG 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, other SDGs work to improve water, sanitation and hygiene, transition to clean energy to reduce air pollution, and reverse climate change – all of which will have an impact on children’s health.

If you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and I guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes. Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s-- but he's phoning it in here. In an interview, Johnny \\"Duncan\\" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape. Driving a Batmobile that looks like it rolled off Honest Al's Used Car lot at below sticker price-- the Dynamic Duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car they're driving-- in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial. The acting is wooden-- the sets are cheap-- the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following I'm sure it read along the lines of \\"Batman says something here\\" because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along. Batman's Utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets-- in one scene when Batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts-- never to be seen again. His cowl is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike. In one scene (I am not making this up), Batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods. It's radioactive so he can trace it-- the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained. Well, unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know it's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground. Thanks Batman! In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled, Batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if Batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds. Not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to Gotham City. There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale who is convinced Bruce Wayne is Batman-- she must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside of Bruce's house-- or maybe she saw Batman and Robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood. Everything about this serial is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no blood in the body happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"I understand that you are asking about the potential effects of a hypothetical scenario in which there is no blood in the human body and its connection to the greenhouse effect. To ensure clarity, I will first briefly explain the greenhouse effect process and how it is related to global warming. Then, I will address the perturbation hypothesis and its lack of direct or indirect effects on the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. When the Sun's energy reaches the Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. This trapped heat raises the Earth's average temperature, creating a warm environment suitable for life as we know it. Global warming, on the other hand, is the increase in Earth's average temperature due to human activities releasing excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This intensifies the greenhouse effect, causing the planet to warm at a faster rate, which can lead to various environmental issues and impacts on human society. Regarding the perturbation hypothesis, you propose a situation where there is no blood in the human body. It is important to note that such a hypothetical scenario is scientifically implausible, as blood is necessary for the proper functioning and survival of the human body. Blood serves many vital functions, such as transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste, maintaining body temperature, and supporting the immune system. Analyzing the connection between this hypothesis and the greenhouse effect, there is no direct or indirect link. The absence of blood in the human body would not have any impact on the greenhouse effect or global warming. The factors influencing the greenhouse effect are primarily related to the composition of Earth's atmosphere, human activities, and the planet's ecosystem processes. The proposed perturbation does not fall within the sphere of these elements and thus would not have any effect on the greenhouse effect or global warming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There were so many computers there that I didn't know how to choose a right one. \\"Hi! What can I do for you?\\" A young man greeted me with a sweet smile. He looked like not a salesman but a student like me. I sensed a strange feeling -- as if I had met him before. He began patiently showing me each model. With his help, I decided to buy one computer with enough functions at a very low price. I enjoyed this shopping experience because of his smile. A few months later, something was wrong with my computer. I went back to the store to have it fixed. When I arrived there, what I saw was still his smile. As soon as I told him my problem, he comforted me immediately and tried his best to solve the problem for me. I was quite grateful for his sweet smile and good service. When I went back to school, his smile often appeared in my mind. I don't know whether we'll meet each other again, but his sweet smile will stay there in my memory and deep in my heart.

How should you handle rejection? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"These two questions appear to be asking about handling rejection but have a slight difference in context. 1. How do I handle rejection for MS? This question is specifically asking for guidance on how to handle rejection in the context of a Master of Science (MS) program, presumably referring to graduate school applications. 2. How should you handle rejection? This question is broader and more general in nature, inquiring about handling rejection in any context, including but not limited to academic, professional, or personal situations. To provide useful information for these two questions, I will answer them separately, given their difference in context. 1. How to handle rejection for an MS program:    a. Accept your emotions: It's normal to feel disappointed or sad when you face rejection. Allow yourself to process these emotions, as it's important for your well-being.    b. Seek feedback: If possible, contact the admissions office or a professor in the program to ask for feedback on your application. This can provide valuable insights on how to improve for future applications.    c. Review your application materials: Go over your entire application to identify any weaknesses, such as low GPA, test scores, or lack of research experience. Make a plan to address these weaknesses before applying again.    d. Consider alternative options: Explore other programs or career paths that might be a better fit or have a higher likelihood of acceptance.    e. Keep persevering: Don't give up on your goal of pursuing an MS degree. Reapply after addressing your weaknesses or consider applying to a wider range of schools. 2. How to handle rejection in general:    a. Accept your emotions: As in the first scenario, give yourself time to process the feelings of disappointment or sadness that come with rejection.    b. Reflect on the situation: Think about what might have led to the rejection. Identify any areas where you can improve or grow.    c. Learn from your experience: Take the lessons learned from the rejection to grow and improve. This may involve building new skills, working on personal development, or refining your approach.    d. Maintain a support network: Surround yourself with positive influences like friends, family, or mentors who can provide encouragement and help you navigate through difficult situations.    e. Keep pursuing your goals: Don't let rejection define you.

Vampires","output":"Title: The Veil of Blood Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Logline: When a journalist, seeking answers to the mysterious deaths in a small town, encounters a group of enigmatic women, he is lured into their fierce and deadly secret that unveils itself only at the stroke of midnight. Plot: Act I:  Introduce Michael (mid-30s, a seasoned journalist). Recently unable to get over his fiancée's tragic and unexplained death, Michael moves to a small town called Hemlock in search of new beginnings. He quickly learns that Hemlock is unfamiliar with peace - it has a dark history of young men disappearing, their drained bodies, weeks later, found in the woods. During a local event, he meets Elaine (early-30s). They form an intense chemistry, and he's introduced to her friends - Isabella, Blair, and Fiona. Beautiful and mysterious, these women are the talk of the town. There are rumors about their true identities - witches? Immortal beings? Act II: Michael is convinced Elaine is innocent and doesn't belong in this group. As the two grow closer, she alludes to dark secrets she and her friends share but reveals no information. Investigating further, Michael connects more clues that place the women at the center of the disappearances. One night, he follows them into the woods. They chant by a fire, their eyes silvery, unveiling themselves as vampires. Just when their power seems to manifest, Fiona reveals she is pregnant. This fact challenges the group's beliefs, creating tension and raising doubts on whether they should continue feeding on human blood. Act III: Fiona's pregnancy establishes the notion that the women are compelled into vampirism because of a curse that binds them. They are not inherently evil. Elaine, wishing to be with Michael, decides to help them break the curse. They search for solutions exploring the old crypts and ancient libraries. However, Blair, the oldest and ruthless among them, is resolute on tradition, defying Elaine's ideas. The small group soon dissolves into a frenzy of betrayal. Michael, now far too invested and in danger, tries to protect Elaine. At midnight of the blood moon, a battle commences: the group of women amass in their full strength as vampires, aiming to kill Michael and Fiona's unborn child with the hope it would restore their power. Elaine, Michael, Fiona, and Isabella ally against them, risking life and undead alike to find redemption. Act IV: During the final battle, Elaine sacrifices herself, harnessing an ancient ritual to break the curse. Just as Blair is about to kill Michael, Elaine annuls the curse, freeing all vampires from their immortality. Mortal again, Blair and other members of the coven perish, but eternal protection is offered to Fiona and her unborn child. As the sun breaks the horizon, the women who chose eternity, except Elaine, and the defeated vampires turn to ash. Michael, mourning Elaine, leaves Hemlock but with renewed purpose, spreading the tale of the Veil of Blood that once cloaked the small town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins.  Question: suppose the rock has pockets of soil in its cracks happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER erosion of rocks.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The presence of soil pockets within the cracks of the rocks can indeed lead to less or slower erosion of these rocks. The primary reason behind this phenomenon is that the soil possesses specific properties that can help protect the rock and slow down the process of erosion, which is generally caused by physical, chemical, and biological factors. 1. Physical Protection: Soil can serve as a protective layer on the rock's surface, shielding it from direct wear and tear caused by natural elements such as rain, wind, and temperature fluctuations. In the case of rocks with soil-filled cracks, the soil can also provide reinforcement to the rock's structure, preventing further cracking and disintegration. 2. Water Retention: Soil has the ability to retain moisture, which can be beneficial in the erosion prevention process. By holding water, the soil can help maintain a damp environment, which is less conducive to the erosive forces of wind and water. This damp environment also promotes the growth of plants and their roots, which can keep the soil intact and further slow down erosion. 3. Chemical Protection: Soil often contains various minerals and organic matter, which can help buffer the rock from the effects of plant acids and other chemicals that contribute to erosion. The presence of these buffering agents can neutralize potential chemical reactions between the rock and its surroundings, slowing down the rock's breakdown. 4. Biological Protection: The presence of soil encourages the growth of plants, fungi, and microorganisms. These organisms can release certain compounds, such as humus, which can enhance the soil's structure and decrease the overall rate of erosion. Furthermore, plant roots and fungal mycelium can bind soil particles together, creating a stable and resilient network that can protect the rock's surface. However, it's important to note that these protective effects of soil are not absolute, and erosion can still occur over time. The rate of erosion in these instances would likely be slower compared to rocks without soil-filled cracks.  In relation to the second effect mentioned, which is the \\"roots of growing plants starting to break up the rock,\\" the presence of soil can have a lesser effect on this process. As the soil provides support and protection to the rock, it will make it harder for plant roots to penetrate the rock and cause it to break up. Consequently, the overall rate of erosion would be slower due to the soil's presence, contributing less to the rock-breaking effect of plant roots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.

Other regions, including south-west Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Lancashire, faced unusually heavy precipitation that led to widespread chaos, displacement, and flood warnings. As weather forecasts predict further rain today and tomorrow, this article sheds light on the current situation, the actions taken by authorities, and the likely weather prospects. Unprecedented Rainfall In what can only be described as an extraordinary deluge, Cumbria received four inches of rain overnight – more than half the average for the entire month. Neighbouring regions like south-west Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Lancashire also experienced intense rainfall, causing rivers to breach their banks and inundating low-lying areas.  Flood Warnings and Evacuations The Environment Agency has issued more than 140 flood warnings and alerts across the northern regions of the UK, as river levels continue to rise and threaten communities. In Lancashire, families had to spend the night in temporary accommodation provided by local authorities after they were evacuated from their homes. This precautionary measure became necessary as the River Darwen, among several others, overflowed its banks. Response from Emergency Services and Authorities The emergency services and local authorities have tirelessly supported those affected in the face of this natural calamity. Swift evacuation procedures were conducted, ensuring the safety of residents, and temporary accommodations were set up to house the displaced families. Emergency crews have also been deployed for rescue and relief operations, while damage assessment and repair works are expected to commence as soon as the situation stabilizes. Weather Outlook With weather forecasts predicting further rainfall in the coming hours, the situation remains precarious. However, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon, as meteorologists anticipate sunshine to break through the clouds by tomorrow morning. While it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, authorities are urging residents to stay alert, monitor weather updates, and follow official instructions to safeguard themselves and their properties. Conclusion As northern parts of the UK reel under the impact of unprecedented rainfall and flooding, the immediate focus of authorities and communities remains on ensuring safety, providing shelter, and planning for recovery. The current disaster serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable and destructive nature of weather events and reinforces the need for timely investments in infrastructure, flood prevention measures, and robust emergency response mechanisms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating.

The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland. A:","output":"The person who, in 1663, made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale was William Bruce.

First, let's move the \\"+159\\" from the right side of the equation to the left side. Because we are moving it, we change the sign: -182 - 159 = 31*d. 2. Now, let's do the subtraction on the left side: -182 - 159 = -341. So we have -341 = 31*d. 3. To find 'd', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 31 (since 31*d means 31 times d). So we do this like this: (-341) / 31 = 31*d / 31. 4. Finally, we do the division: -341 / 31 = -11. So, -11 = d. That means, d = -11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement provided \\"Compounding the issue is that some NPOs do not operate in a manner similar to most businesses, or only seasonally\\" highlights a distinguishing aspect between NPOs and businesses from the public and private sector. Step 2: Assess the given statement as an answer In order to determine if the provided statement acts as a good answer, it is necessary to analyze whether it touches upon the offerings of the public and private sectors. Step 3: Analyze the statement The statement focuses on the operation style differences between some NPOs and businesses from the public and private sectors. It does not explicitly mention any specific offerings that employers may benefit from the public or private businesses. Step 4: Identify key characteristics of the public and private sector To see if the statement relates to potential offerings, we can consider the following key characteristics of public and private sector employers: 1. Financial incentives: Public and private sector employers often have larger budgets and can offer competitive salaries, bonuses, and other financial benefits. 2. Career growth: These employers provide greater opportunities for career advancement and better job security. 3. Access to resources: Public and private sectors often have access to extensive resources, such as advanced technologies, well-funded projects, and skilled staff. Step 5: Compare the given statement to the identified key characteristics The statement emphasizes the difference in operation style between NPOs and businesses from the public and private sectors. However, it does not mention any of the offerings provided by the public and private sectors, such as financial incentives, career growth, and access to resources. Conclusion: The given statement, \\"Compounding the issue is that some NPOs do not operate in a manner similar to most businesses, or only seasonally,\\" does not answer the question explicitly. While it addresses one aspect of NPOs that differentiates them from public and private sectors, it does not enumerate the specific advantages or offerings available to employers from the public and private sectors. A good answer needs to provide more explicit information about the unique offerings of public and private sector employers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

IA-32 is the first incarnation of x86 that supports 32-bit computing; as a result, the \\"IA-32\\" term may be used as a metonym to refer to all x86 versions that support 32-bit computing.  - Opteron is AMD's x86 server and workstation processor line, and was the first processor which supported the AMD64 instruction set architecture (known generically as x86-64). It was released on April 22, 2003 with the \\"SledgeHammer\\" core (K8) and was intended to compete in the server and workstation markets, particularly in the same segment as the Intel Xeon processor. Processors based on the AMD K10 microarchitecture (codenamed \\"Barcelona\\") were announced on September 10, 2007 featuring a new quad-core configuration. The most-recently released Opteron CPUs are the Piledriver-based Opteron 4300 and 6300 series processors, codenamed \\"Seoul\\" and \\"Abu Dhabi\\" respectively. In January 2016, the first ARMv8-A based Opteron SoC was released.  - Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of x86-compatible microprocessors designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The original Athlon (now called \\"Athlon Classic\\") was the first seventh-generation x86 processor. The original Athlon was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). AMD has continued using the \\"Athlon\\" name with the Athlon 64, an eighth-generation processor featuring x86-64 (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the Athlon II. AMD also uses the \\"Athlon\\" name for some of its series of APUs targeting the Socket AM1 desktop SoC architecture.  - The Athlon 64 X2 is the first dual - core desktop CPU designed by AMD . It was designed from scratch as native dual - core by using an already multi-CPU enabled Athlon 64 , joining it with another functional core on one die , and connecting both via a shared dual - channel memory controller / north bridge and additional control logic . The initial versions are based on the E-stepping model of the Athlon 64 and , depending on the model , have either 512 or 1024 KB of L2 Cache per core . The Athlon 64 X2 is capable of decoding SSE3 instructions ( except those few specific to Intel 's architecture ) . In June 2007 , AMD released low - voltage variants of their low - end 65 nm Athlon 64 X2 , named \`\` Athlon X2 '' . The Athlon X2 processors feature reduced TDP of 45 W. The name was also used for K10 based budget CPUs with two cores deactivated .  - Pentium is a brand used for a series of x86-compatible microprocessors produced by Intel since 1993. In its current form, Pentium processors are considered entry-level products that Intel rates as \\"two stars\\", meaning that they are above the low-end Atom and Celeron series but below the faster Core i3, i5 and i7 lines as well as the high-end Xeon processors.  - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.  - Intel Corporation (also known as Intel, stylized as intel) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California (colloquially referred to as \\"Silicon Valley\\") that was founded by Gordon Moore (of Moore's law fame) and Robert Noyce. It is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers based on revenue, and is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors: the processors found in most personal computers (PCs). Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo (formerly IBM), HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.  - 3DNow! is an extension to the x86 instruction set developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). It adds single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions to the base x86 instruction set, enabling it to perform vector processing, which improves the performance of many graphic-intensive applications. The first microprocessor to implement 3DNow was the AMD K6-2, which was introduced in 1998. When the application was appropriate this raised the speed by about 2-4 times.  - Pentium 4 was a line of single-core central processing units (CPUs) for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers introduced by Intel on November 20, 2000 and shipped through August 8, 2008. They had a seventh-generation x86 (32-bit) microarchitecture, called NetBurst, which was the company's first all-new design since the introduction of the P6 microarchitecture of the Pentium Pro CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds. Intel claimed that NetBurst would allow clock speeds of up to 10 GHz in future chips; however, severe problems with heat dissipation (especially with the Prescott Pentium 4) limited CPU clock speeds to a much lower 3.8 GHz.  - The Athlon 64 is an eighth-generation, AMD64-architecture microprocessor produced by AMD, released on September 23, 2003. It is the third processor to bear the name \\"Athlon\\", and the immediate successor to the Athlon XP. The second processor (after the Opteron) to implement AMD64 architecture and the first 64-bit processor targeted at the average consumer, it was AMD's primary consumer microprocessor, and competes primarily with Intel's Pentium 4, especially the \\"Prescott\\" and \\"Cedar Mill\\" core revisions. It is AMD's first K8, eighth-generation processor core for desktop and mobile computers. Despite being natively 64-bit, the AMD64 architecture is backward-compatible with 32-bit x86 instructions. Athlon 64s have been produced for Socket 754, Socket 939, Socket 940 and Socket AM2. The line was succeeded by the dual-core Athlon 64 X2 and Athlon X2 lines.  - SSE3, Streaming SIMD Extensions 3, also known by its Intel code name Prescott New Instructions (PNI), is the third iteration of the SSE instruction set for the IA-32 (x86) architecture. Intel introduced SSE3 in early 2004 with the Prescott revision of their Pentium 4 CPU. In April 2005, AMD introduced a subset of SSE3 in revision E (Venice and San Diego) of their Athlon 64 CPUs. The earlier SIMD instruction sets on the x86 platform, from oldest to newest, are MMX, 3DNow! (developed by AMD), SSE and SSE2.  - SSE2 (Streaming SIMD Extensions 2), is one of the Intel SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) processor supplementary instruction sets first introduced by Intel with the initial version of the Pentium 4 in 2001. It extends the earlier SSE instruction set, and is intended to fully replace MMX. Intel extended SSE2 to create SSE3 in 2004. SSE2 added 144 new instructions to SSE, which has 70 instructions. Competing chip-maker AMD added support for SSE2 with the introduction of their Opteron and Athlon 64 ranges of AMD64 64-bit CPUs in 2003.

Is this movie review sentence negative or positive? Options: (1). negative (2). positive The answer is:","output":"(1). negative The movie review sentence provided expresses disappointment when comparing the movie to other recent war films or even other works by the same director, John Woo. The word \\"disappointing\\" is used as the key marker for determining the tone of the review. The term implies that the reviewer had certain expectations that were not met by the movie, thus resulting in a negative overall impression. The review also compares the movie unfavorably to other projects from John Woo, a well-known film director known for his unique action and combat sequences. By stating that the movie is disappointing even when compared to Woo's other works, the reviewer seems to suggest that the film fails to uphold the quality or excitement that audiences have come to expect from the director. Furthermore, the use of \\"or any other John Woo flick for that matter\\" demonstrates that the reviewer's disappointment is not only rooted in the comparison to recent war movies but also in the broader context of the director's filmography. This comparison deepens the negativity of the review, as it indicates that the movie underperforms on multiple levels. Overall, the answer is negative since the reviewer does not express any satisfaction or enjoyment from the movie. The unmet expectations, the unfavorable comparison to other films in the war genre, and the poor representation of John Woo's signature style contribute to the negative tone of this movie review sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - People breathe and expel carbon dioxide - Engines produce carbon dioxide - Living things produce waste - Waste decomposes - Decomposition produces methane - Water evaporates - Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane are greenhouse gases -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose An increase in population happens, how will it affect there will be less petrol consumed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've provided suggests that an increase in population leads to less petrol consumption. Let's analyze whether this change has any direct or indirect effect on the processes mentioned earlier. 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide: An increase in population will lead to more people breathing and expelling carbon dioxide. This directly increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide: If the supposition of less petrol consumption holds true, it could mean that people are using more fuel-efficient vehicles, public transportation, or alternative modes of transport that do not rely on petrol. In this case, there might be a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from engines, resulting in a lesser contribution to greenhouse gases. 3. Living things produce waste: An increase in population leads to an increase in waste production, which introduces more waste decomposing and increasing methane emissions as a result. 4. Waste decomposes: More population generates more waste, and therefore, a greater amount of waste decomposes, releasing methane as a byproduct. 5. Decomposition produces methane: As mentioned earlier, the increase in waste decomposition results in increased methane production. 6. Water evaporates: The increase in population itself does not directly affect water evaporation. However, increased human activities, such as agriculture and industrial processes, may indirectly affect the water cycle and the rate of evaporation. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere: Indirectly, an increase in population might cause changes in the water evaporation rate, leading to more water vapor joining the atmosphere. 8. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane are greenhouse gases: As discussed above, the direct and indirect effects of a population increase lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Despite the supposed decrease in petrol consumption, the processes involving waste decomposition and respiration will still contribute to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests a decrease in petrol consumption due to an increase in population would potentially have indirect effects on the process of greenhouse gas emissions. This is because the increase in population, even with a decrease in petrol consumption, will still contribute to higher carbon dioxide and methane emissions levels through other processes such as respiration, waste decomposition, and activities that affect the water cycle."},{"instruction":"Wade county was situated to the east of Gray county.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does changes in the structure of the Y chromosome do?\\" is \\"male infertility\\", given that  changes in the structure of the Y chromosome are implicated in male infertility? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, it appears that the statement \\"Changes in the structure of the Y chromosome are implicated in male infertility,\\" is accurate. In order to provide a more detailed answer, it is essential to understand the role of the Y chromosome and how structural changes can impact male fertility. The Y chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in humans and is responsible for determining male sex. It carries genes vital to the development of male reproductive systems, including the spermatogenesis (sperm production) process. The Y chromosome contains the SRY gene, which triggers the development of testes. Also, it has various regions with genes related to other aspects of sperm production and function, such as AZF regions. Changes in the structure of the Y chromosome can lead to male infertility by disrupting the normal functioning of these genes or even causing gene deletions. The structural changes can include: 1. Y chromosome deletions: Deletion of specific regions in the Y chromosome, such as Azoospermia Factor (AZF) region deletions, can result in the loss or disruption of genes essential for sperm production. These deletions can lead to impaired spermatogenesis and result in low sperm count (oligospermia) or no sperm production (azoospermia). 2. Y chromosome inversions: An inversion is a type of chromosome rearrangement where a segment of the chromosome is flipped in orientation. If such rearrangements occur in the Y chromosome, they could disrupt functioning genes and hinder the proper development of male reproductive organs and sperm production, leading to infertility. 3. Y chromosome translocations: Translocation is a rearrangement between non-homologous chromosomes, and it can cause disruptions in gene function. If a translocation occurs involving the Y chromosome, it could result in infertility if the affected genes are essential for sperm production or other aspects of male reproduction. In summary, the answer to the question \\"What does changes in the structure of the Y chromosome do?\\" would be \\"Changes in the structure of the Y chromosome can lead to male infertility, as they can disrupt the normal functioning of genes and regions responsible for sperm production and male reproductive development.\\" Given the complexities of the Y chromosome and its importance to male fertility, further study and understanding of its structure and function can lead to better diagnostic tools and treatment options for male infertility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"The process of normalizing Armenian-Turkish relations has been considered from various perspectives. The normalization of Armenian-Turkish relations is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been approached and analyzed from numerous viewpoints by both scholars and policymakers. At the core of this issue is the historical tension that has existed between Armenia and Turkey, which has significantly impacted their diplomatic relations, trade, and cultural exchange over the years. Several factors have contributed to the strained relationship between the two countries, the most prominent of which is the recognition of the Armenian Genocide that occurred during the Ottoman Empire era in 1915. This contentious topic has been the subject of debate and negotiation for decades, as Armenian officials and the international community have called for Turkey to acknowledge and take responsibility for the atrocities committed during this period. While Turkey has taken steps toward expressing condolences and admitting past wrongdoings, the official recognition of the Armenian Genocide remains a significant obstacle in the normalization process. Additionally, the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a close ally of Turkey, has further complicated the normalization of relations. Turkey has been supportive of Azerbaijan, imposing economic sanctions on Armenia and closing their borders since the early 1990s. The unresolved nature of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has hindered the development of diplomatic relations and economic cooperation, which is essential for stability in the South Caucasus region. Various political approaches and initiatives have been proposed and attempted to facilitate the normalization process, such as the \\"football diplomacy\\" initiated by Turkish President Abdullah Gul in 2008 when he attended a soccer match in Armenia. These efforts, however, have yet to produce a tangible and lasting impact on the overall relations between the two countries. Despite the challenges, ongoing dialogue and communication remain crucial in the pursuit of normalizing Armenian-Turkish relations. Several avenues for cooperation can be explored and developed, including cultural and educational exchanges, increased trade relations, and regional collaboration in areas such as energy and infrastructure projects. These efforts can contribute to fostering mutual trust and understanding, which is essential for overcoming historical grievances and establishing stable and peaceful relations between Armenia and Turkey. In conclusion, the normalization of Armenian-Turkish relations is an intricate issue with deep historical roots and various interconnected factors that have hindered the process. A comprehensive and inclusive approach, addressing both the historical grievances and contemporary challenges, is essential in order to build a foundation for meaningful dialogue and cooperation between the two countries. The potential for mutually beneficial relations exists; however, overcoming the existing obstacles will require commitment, understanding, and goodwill from both sides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - photosynthesis  - sexually  - asexually  - with spores  A: A:","output":"Fungus-like protists, such as slime molds, have an intriguing and diverse method of reproduction. Unlike plants, they do not reproduce via photosynthesis. Instead, they employ a combination of sexual and asexual reproductive mechanisms and produce spores during certain phases in their life cycle. Slime molds can be classified into two main groups: Plasmodial slime molds (Myxomycetes) and Cellular slime molds (Acrasiomycetes and Dictyosteliomycetes). Both types of slime molds exhibit a complex life cycle with distinct stages, involving asexual and sexual phases. 1. Plasmodial slime molds (Myxomycetes): In these slime molds, the vegetative phase is a single, large, multinucleated cell called a plasmodium. The plasmodium feeds on organic matter like fungi and bacteria through the process of phagocytosis. Asexual reproduction: Under favorable conditions, the plasmodium can undergo a form of asexual reproduction called fragmentation. In this process, the plasmodium breaks into smaller pieces, with each fragment having the potential to develop into a new plasmodium. Sexual reproduction: In response to unfavorable environmental conditions, such as food scarcity, the plasmodium undergoes a transformation into a sporangium - a fruiting body that produces spores. This structure forms through a series of nuclear divisions and cytoplasmic partitioning. The spores, which are formed through meiosis, are released into the environment and can germinate into new myxamoebae or flagellated cells under suitable conditions. These cells can fuse with others (in a process called plasmogamy), leading to the formation of a zygote and then a new plasmodium. 2. Cellular slime molds (Acrasiomycetes and Dictyosteliomycetes): In contrast to plasmodial slime molds, cellular slime molds exist as individual, single-celled amoeboid organisms called myxamoebae during the vegetative phase. Asexual reproduction: Asexual reproduction in cellular slime molds is not common. However, some species can reproduce by binary fission, in which a single cell divides into two daughter cells. Sexual reproduction: When environmental conditions become unfavorable, the cellular slime mold can initiate its sexual life cycle. Each myxamoeba releases a chemical signal that triggers aggregation of several other myxamoebae, which then form a multicellular structure called a pseudoplasmodium or slug. This slug is capable of migration in search of better conditions. After migrating, the slug differentiates into a fruiting body called a sorocarp, which has a stalk and a mass of spores at the top called a sorus. These spores are produced sexually through meiosis. Upon finding a suitable environment, the spores germinate to release haploid myxamoebae or flagellated cells. These haploid cells can fuse with others to produce a diploid zygote and initiate the life cycle anew. In summary, fungus-like protists such as slime molds reproduce both sexually and asexually, with spores playing a significant role in the process. Their reproductive methods are diverse and intricately linked to their unique life cycles and environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Donald was much thinner than William was because  OPT: + Donald liked eating cake way too much. + William liked eating cake way too much.","output":"Donald was much thinner than William was because he maintained a strict diet and consistently engaged in regular exercise routines. Even though Donald liked eating cake way too much, he cleverly managed to control his portion sizes and usually chose healthier dessert alternatives that satisfied his sweet tooth without jeopardizing his waistline. On the other hand, William liked eating cake way too much and, unlike Donald, did not balance his indulgences with appropriate physical activity and healthy eating habits. Donald's commitment to a balanced lifestyle enabled him to achieve his desired weight and maintain it in the long run. He was disciplined in both his diet and exercise regime, often switching up his workouts to include a mix of cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises to ensure he was not only thin but also fit and healthy. He was mindful of his nutrition, focusing on the consumption of whole foods like lean proteins, grains, fruits, and vegetables to provide his body with the essential nutrients it required. While Donald enjoyed the occasional slice of cake, he ensured that these indulgences were rare and did not impact his overall progress. He recognized the importance of moderation and practiced various strategies to resist the temptation to overindulge in sugary treats. For instance, he would often satisfy his sweet cravings with healthier alternatives such as fruit salad or yogurt topped with berries and granola. By finding ways to enjoy food without guilt, he was able to prevent unhealthy binge-eating episodes and maintain a stable weight. In contrast, William struggled with portion control and keeping his cake consumption in check. He frequently chose to indulge in large servings of cake and other high-calorie desserts, often neglecting to balance his diet with regular exercise and healthier meal choices. This led to a gradual weight gain, causing him to become noticeably heavier than Donald. William's lack of awareness and self-control around food prevented him from achieving the same level of fitness and health as his thinner counterpart. In addition to the difference in their eating habits, Donald's commitment to a healthy lifestyle also gave him a psychological edge. He had higher self-esteem and a better sense of self-confidence, which motivated him to continue pursuing his goals and maintain his thinner physique. Meanwhile, William struggled with feelings of guilt and low self-worth as a result of his constant battles with food and his inability to maintain a healthier weight. In conclusion, Donald was much thinner than William was because of his dedication to a well-balanced lifestyle, incorporating regular exercise, healthy eating habits, and proper mindfulness regarding nutrition. Even though both Donald and William liked eating cake way too much, it was Donald's ability to manage his sweet indulgences while maintaining a healthy lifestyle that ultimately set him apart from his heavier friend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the key aspects of your alien characters should be how they look. To make your aliens seem convincing and interesting, you should try to be as detailed about their physical characteristics as you can. Because you are writing fiction, you have the ability to create as many strange and interesting details about your alien characters as you like. Avoid using familiar images or descriptions of aliens and use your imagination.  Think about how the aliens walk and move their bodies. You should also think about how their bodies are proportioned. They do not necessarily need to walk on two legs and have limbs like humans. They may have physical characteristics that have evolved due to their world or environment. For example, maybe your aliens have antennas on their heads because they can feel shifts in the wind in their world, allowing them to hunt for food more effectively. You should also think about whether there are different genders in the alien world and how the bodies of different genders appear. You do not have to be limited by male or female genders. Maybe the alien race has a third gender that is asexual or a combination of male and female genders. Avoid creating the alien characters in the shadow of humans and get creative with language, thinking beyond English or other languages found on Earth. You may decide to create an alien language that may then be translated with the help of a computerized device or an implant in the human brain. Your alien race may also communicate in other ways besides language or words. Maybe they use their antennas to send messages to each other or have the ability to communicate through telepathy. Perhaps they use a system of body movements to communicate. The humans in your story may also be key characters in the narrative, so you should create humans that are just as interesting as the aliens. Your main character may be a human with a special ability or a unique characteristic. Creating nuanced humans in your story will make it that much stronger. For example, maybe your main character is a human who has been gifted with the ability to read minds. This human is then able to access the conversations of the alien overlords, who have enslaved the human race. This ability could allow the human to save the humans from the aliens and become the hero of the story. Once you have sketched out your characters, you should identify the central conflict. Doing this will give the story an end goal and frame the narrative for the reader. It will also allow you to use your characters to build tension in the story. The central conflict may be between your alien characters or between an alien character and a human character. For example, maybe the central conflict of your story is that aliens have taken over the human world because their planet is no longer habitable. This alien invasion may then result in a human hero who tries to fight the aliens with a special ability and help from other humans in his community. Or, maybe the central conflict is that humans have enslaved aliens who have crash landed on their planet. The humans may then try to hide the aliens and experiment on them. This may then result in one alien who tries to oppose his human captors. Summary:","output":"Create detailed and unique alien characters in your story, considering their physical features, communication methods, and the central conflict between them and humans to make it interesting and convincing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To do so, they compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers.      They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage. [Read full story on coastal flooding]      In both their best- and worst-case projections of sea level rise, the yearly global cost reached higher than 1 trillion. The most vulnerable city was Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China. Almost all cities at the highest risk of flooding damage were in North America or Asia.      Here are the top 20 most vulnerable cities:      1. Guangzhou, China      2. Mumbai, India      3.

Almost all cities facing the worst damage are in Asia and North America, the study showed. Three American cities — New York, New Orleans and Miami — are at particularly high risk of damage, according to the study, published today (Aug. 18) in the journal Nature Climate Change.      \\"If we did nothing about the risk, the flood damages in coastal cities would grow to huge amounts. So that's really not an option,\\" said study co-author Robert Nicholls, a coastal engineering professor at the University of Southampton in England.      Damaging storms      Climate change models generally predict that storms will grow more frequent and fierce over the next several decades. We may already be seeing its impact: Many scientists believe that climate change worsened the toll of Hurricane Sandy. [How Weird!: 7 Rare Weather Events]      After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005, Nicholls and his colleagues realized that scientists had little idea which cities around the world were most vulnerable to flooding.      So the team compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers.      They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage.      Two vulnerable continents      The researchers found that in both their best- and worst-case projections of sea level rise, the yearly global cost reached higher than 1 trillion. The most vulnerable city was Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China. Almost all cities at the highest risk of flooding damage were in North America or Asia. [See The 20 Cities Most Vulnerable to Flooding]      If cities take steps to prevent damage — by increasing the height of levees, erecting storm surge barriers, making buildings flood-resistant or converting flood-prone, low-lying areas to parks or football fields — the cost of the damage could be brought down to about 50 billion annually.      It would be cheaper and more sensible to make these changes before Katrina-like storm surges become the norm, Nicholls said.      \\"The bottom line is it shows that flood risk is rising today — it's happening\\" Nicholls told LiveScience. \\"All these cities need to be preparing for that.\\"      Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

They looked at 136 big cities near the coast and checked how high their land is, how many people live there, and what kind of protection they have against floods. They guessed how bad flooding could be by looking at how deep the water might get in the cities. They found out that the cost of damage from floods could be more than 1 trillion every year. The city in the most danger is Guangzhou in China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil in Ecuador, and Shenzen in China. Most of the cities that could be badly flooded are in North America or Asia. If cities do things to protect themselves from floods, like building higher walls or making buildings safe from floods, then the cost of damage could be much lower.

As a result, Cynthia's experience and relentless dedication gave her an undeniable edge in the competition. As the two fighters circled each other in the ring, Rachel's natural athleticism and quick reflexes kept her out of reach from Cynthia's powerful blows. Step by step, Rachel was able to dodge and counteract many of the moves Cynthia made. Both opponents showed off their unique skills and strength, keeping the crowd on the edge of their seats. But despite Rachel's impressive performance, Cynthia began to gain the upper hand. Her months of rigorous training started to pay off as she executed precise, well-timed combinations that chipped away at Rachel's defense. Cynthia's relentless focus on improving her skills had given her a deeper understanding of her opponent's weaknesses and her own strengths. Noticing that Rachel was starting to tire, Cynthia capitalized on the opportunity to launch a series of aggressive attacks. Rachel fought valiantly to deflect the blows, but her energy was waning, and it was clear she could not keep up the pace. Finally, in a decisive moment, Cynthia managed to land a powerful strike that knocked Rachel off balance. Seizing the opportunity for a finishing move, Cynthia sent a swift kick towards Rachel's side, causing her to crumple to the ground. As the referee counted to ten, it was clear Rachel would not be able to recover in time. The crowd erupted in cheers as Cynthia was declared the winner of the match. Despite her defeat, Rachel displayed sportsmanship and grace, congratulating her opponent on a well-fought victory. Cynthia's win served as a humbling reminder of the power of dedication and hard work. The process had tested her physical and mental endurance, but ultimately she came out on top. And even though Rachel had not been as prepared, the fight had proven her potential as a formidable contender. With newfound motivation, Rachel vowed to return to the ring stronger and more dedicated than ever before, setting the stage for a thrilling rematch in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The scientist who discovered them was given the right to name them, and he chose the names Enterprise and Vader. As said before, these stars are very similar, but the main difference is that Vader is a red giant, and Enterprise is not. Scientists are very eager to study these two newly discovered stars and see if they can learn anything new from them.  and a hint : A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star.

Please answer this question : Does Enterprise have more or less fusion reactions in the shell around its core than Vader does?

The Interdimensional Hypothesis (IDH or IH) posits that UFOs and related phenomena originate from other realities or dimensions, existing separately but parallel to our own. This idea, advanced by Ufologists such as Jacques Vallée, implies that the observed events are interactions between our reality and these neighboring dimensions. According to this hypothesis, beings or entities from these other realms may possess technology or powers that allow them to cross over into our reality, giving rise to the various sightings and mysteries surrounding UFOs. On the other hand, the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) proposes that UFOs are spacecraft or technology created by intelligent alien beings from other planets within our own physical universe. This viewpoint assumes that these extraterrestrial beings visit or interact with Earth, either for exploration, scientific study, or other unknown purposes. The ETH often includes the possibility of direct contact between humans and aliens, abduction experiences, and other related events.

The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and guitar), the Edge (guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's sound grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music, yet has maintained an anthemic sound. Their lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns.  - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.  - Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa (DATA) was a multinational non-government organization founded in January 2002 in London by U2's Bono along with Bobby Shriver and activists from the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name Bono, is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best known as the lead vocalist of rock band U2. Bono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, and the future members of U2. Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social, and political themes. During U2's early years, his lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members.  - Jubilee 2000 was an international coalition movement in over 40 countries that called for cancellation of third world debt by the year 2000.

Formally, a data differencing algorithm takes as input source data and target data, and produces difference data such that given the source data and the difference data, one can reconstruct the target data (\\"patching\\" the source with the difference to produce the target).  - Delta encoding is a way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences ( deltas ) between sequential data rather than complete files ; more generally this is known as data differencing . Delta encoding is sometimes called delta compression , particularly where archival histories of changes are required ( e.g. , in revision control software ) . The differences are recorded in discrete files called \`\` deltas '' or \`\` diffs '' .

Article: Clint Eastwood's potent new film is based on a true story about a newly elected black president struggling to unite citizens divided by racism. The name Obama never comes up — it couldn't, since the time is 1995 and the place is South Africa. The president is Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman), who was voted into office the year before, in the country's first free election. The challenge facing Mandela is to find a way to make peace with the apartheid forces that put him in jail for three decades. Mandela figures that battle should take place on, of all things, the rugby field.      Peter Travers reviews Invictus in his weekly video podcast, \\"At the Movies with Peter Travers\\"      For the blacks in South Africa, rugby was a symbol of the Afrikaners, the white forces behind apartheid. Mandela believed that if he could harness the power of the Springboks, the South African team captained by François Pienaar (Matt Damon), and host the 1995 rugby World Cup games, he could cross a racial and cultural divide. The source material for Invictus (Latin for \\"unconquered\\") is John Carlin's book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation. That's pushing it, since the factors that have separated powerful whites and resentful blacks for centuries in South Africa can hardly be reconciled by one game. But there's little doubt that the game pitting the Springboks against New Zealand's team was a major start in the healing process.      Get more news, reviews and interviews from Peter Travers on The Travers Take      Eastwood, shooting on location in Johannesburg and Cape Town and enlisting Chester Williams (the single black player on the Springboks) to coach Damon, wisely lets action define character. The rugby action electrifies the movie. Damon may be shorter than Pienaar's six-foot-four Afrikaner god, but he brings athletic grace to the role, and a sense of burning conscience. Freeman seems born to play Mandela, and he never delivers a false note, even when Anthony Peckham's script nudges him into sainthood. Freeman lets us see the wily politician percolating underneath Mandela's calm surface. Eastwood's modest approach to these momentous events shames the usual Hollywood showboating. In a rare achievement, he's made a film that truly is good for the soul. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| The healing power of sports      By Ann Hornaday      Friday, Dec. 11, 2009      If 2009 had a most valuable player award for the movies, it would have to go to Matt Damon. Whether he's appearing in \\"The Informant!,\\" a Sarah Silverman Web parody or in Clint Eastwood's stirring post-apartheid drama, \\"Invictus,\\" he has been consistently spot-on and almost breathtakingly self-effacing. He has become that most unlikely Hollywood rarity: a character actor with a matinee-idol face.      In \\"Invictus,\\" Damon plays Francois Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby team the Springboks, which in 1995 won the World Cup. The movie tells the story of that unlikely and politically crucial victory, which as much as anything was the result of the gentle coaxing and adamantine moral suasion of the country's new president, Nelson Mandela.      Morgan Freeman doesn't play Mandela as much as inhabit the man, in a performance that seems to embody the very transcendence that Mandela himself has come to stand for. Freeman captures with perfect pitch the inner workings of a man who, put in charge of a country still ravaged by the still-fresh violence and injustices of apartheid, sees an opportunity for healing in the rites and rituals of sport. His job is to forge within the black community a sense of identification with a mostly white team that for years has represented oppression.      Eastwood adopts a flat, uninflected style for \\"Invictus,\\" wisely letting this remarkable story tell itself with a minimum of flourish or underlining. The result is a thoroughly absorbing, inspiring movie that, like last year's \\"Milk,\\" features one of the year's most galvanizing performances. Freeman doesn't merely impersonate Mandela as much as personify not just political genius but an almost superhuman suppleness of character. Rugby is exciting, sure, but there's nothing more thrilling than radical forgiveness in action.      *** PG-13.      At area theaters.

The question asks for what metal music is about, and the answer provided offers historical background information rather than delving into the core themes and elements of metal music. To provide a more comprehensive answer, you may consider the following inclusions: Metal music is characterized by its heavy use of distortion, extended guitar solos, dark themes, and powerful vocal performances. The genre emerged in the late 1960s, drawing inspiration from blues-rock and psychedelic rock bands. As the suggested answer mentioned, early pioneers of metal music include Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath; these groups established metal as a distinctive genre with an emphasis on heavier instrumentation and darker lyrical content. The bands mentioned attracted large audiences, but critics often dismissed their work – a trend that persisted across the genre's history. What metal music is about can be summarized by its key characteristics: 1. Heavy and aggressive sound: Metal music often features distorted guitars, powerful drumming, and fast tempos, which create an aggressive, intense atmosphere. The genre typically employs electric guitars with a heavily overdriven or distorted tone, accompanied by pounding bass and powerful, driving drum beats. 2. Dark themes: Metal music tends to explore darker themes in its lyrics, such as death, war, pain, and suffering. The genre often deals with the darker aspects of human nature and experiences, providing an outlet for fans to engage with these emotions and navigate their own struggles. 3. Powerful vocals and unique singing styles: Metal singers are known for their impressive vocal range, and the genre features various singing techniques, such as growls, screams, operatic vocals, and traditional clean singing. This diversity in styles helps to convey the emotions present in the music, further amplifying the themes and messages of the songs. 4. Iconic imagery: Metal music is also characterized by its strong visual aesthetics, which can include distinct band logos, album art, and stage performances. This imagery often leans towards dark and macabre themes, reflecting the underlying concepts in the music. 5. Subgenres and diversity: Over time, metal music has evolved and expanded, encompassing various subgenres such as thrash metal, death metal, power metal, progressive metal, and many others. This diversity allows artists to explore different themes, sounds, and styles within the larger context of the genre.

Proximity: Since the kid is studying new words at home in the kitchen, it is more likely that the dictionary would be nearby, making it more accessible for the child to study. A table is a common place to keep study materials, especially when studying at home. 2. Setting: The other options provided, such as library, bookstore, and classroom, are less likely since they are separate locations that would not typically be found inside a home. The kitchen or dining table, on the other hand, is available within the home environment and provides a convenient surface for studying and placing needed materials, like a dictionary. 3. Functionality: A table provides a comfortable and practical spot to keep a dictionary for easy referencing. It offers a sturdy surface for the child to rest the book, and a suitable height that is conducive to reading. 4.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Why would a party notify the other party? Context: Treaties are not necessarily permanently binding upon the signatory parties. As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless: The answer is:","output":"A party would notify the other party in the context of a treaty to withdraw from the treaty or express their intention to denounce the treaty, as long as it follows certain procedures of notification.

Egg white is the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around fertilized or unfertilized egg yolks.

The first time I listened, I liked \\"Straightface\\" and \\"Medicine Hat\\" a lot, but nothing else left much of an impression. I figured \\"Wide Swing Tremolo\\" was one of those albums it takes a few listens to get into. Well, after lots of attempts, I still can't get into it. In fact, the songs seem to get more lethargic and boring with each listen. There's just no life to this album aside from the two tracks I mentioned above. It actually turned me off from exploring the rest of Son Volt's music and Jay Farrar's solo stuff, no matter how great \\"Trace\\" is.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  Now, I have a new situation: Two campers were in the woods over the week-end. They both had canned soup with them. Pete heated the can without venting it and it exploded, while Dan opened his can and heated it over the fire with no additional problems.  Answer this question please: Which camper learned less about kinetic energy? Answer:","output":"Dan learned less about kinetic energy because his can of soup did not explode, and thus he did not experience the effects of the kinetic-molecular theory firsthand. Pete, on the other hand, witnessed the consequences of not venting the can, which demonstrated the effects of increased kinetic energy and pressure inside the can."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

When Hepburn died in 1993, the world mourned the loss of a great beauty, a great actress and a great humanitarian. Born in Belgium on 4th May 1929, Hepburn dreamed of becoming a successful ballet dancer. She had also been a model before she entered the film industry. In 1951, while acting in Monte Carlo Baby, Hepburn met the famous French writer Colette, who was attracted by Hepburn's beauty and charm. She insisted that Hepburn was the perfect girl to play the lead role in Gigi, a play based on her novel. That event marked the beginning of Hepburn's successful career. Shortly after, Hepburn was chosen to play the lead role of a young princess in the Hollywood film Roman Holiday. It was a big success and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. She also won a Tony Award for the play Ondine.[:..] During her lifetime, Hepburn earned four more Oscar nominations. In 1989, she made her final appearance in her last film Always and played the role of an angel. Throughout her acting years, she acted in only one TV series, Gardens of the world with Audrey Hepburn. By showing us the beauty of nature, Hepburn wanted to remind us that we should protect the environment. Hepburn is remembered not just as a great actress, but also as a great humanitarian. She was honoured with a number of awards because of her efforts in her charity work. In 1992, the President of the United States presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1991, Hepburn discovered that she had cancer. In 1993, at the age of 63, she passed away peacefully in her sleep.

At their memorial, Grampa Simpson foresees the destruction of the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skate naked to the Krusty Burger restaurant and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it \\"Spider Pig\\" (later \\"Harry Plopper\\", and simply \\"Plopper\\"), and stores the pig's feces (and some of his own) in a silo, until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after Lenny calls to tell him that Lard Lad Donuts has been shut down and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the EPA captures it.

How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities.

(Associated Press)      Cole Nelson, nine months, held by his mother Deborah Nelson, inspects President Barack Obama's face as during a visit to the Iowa State Fair, Monday, Aug. 13, 2012, in Des Moines, Iowa. The president... (Associated Press)      Obama's three-day tour of Iowa by bus made the unscheduled stop Monday at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines just a few hours after the Republican vice presidential candidate, Paul Ryan, appeared at the fair.      Obama spent an hour walking along a stretch of the fairgrounds, greeting throngs of parents and their children, crouching at one point to meet 9-month-old Cole Nelson, who was resting in the arms of his mother, Deborah.      When the child swept his hand across the president's nose, Obama said: \\"What do you think? That's a pretty big nose.\\"      The president resisted the temptation of cinnamon rolls at one stand, telling people he was \\"saving my space for pork chop on a stick.\\" His stroll brought him to a quick photo-op with the Iowa State Fair queen, 17-year-old Abrah Meyer of Readlyn, Iowa, who wore a tiara, a sash and a royal purple dress.      Obama wrapped up his state fair visit with a swing by the Bud Tent, where a large crowd chanted, \\"Four more years.\\" He told them with a smile, \\"Everyone who's over 21, you gotta buy a beer,\\" prompting someone in the crowd to yell, \\"Is it on you?\\"      The president looked into his wallet as some people in the crowd started chanting, \\"Four more beers!\\"      Obama told them, \\"I'll tell you what, except for the Romney sign, I'll buy beers for ten people.\\" He walked over to the crowd, but it wasn't clear whether he bought the beers or not, any transaction occurring out of the sight of reporters. But it was clear that Obama ended up with a plate with two pork chops, handed to him by Greg Lear, the president-elect of the Iowa Pork Producers.      Taking a beer in a plastic cup, the president thanked the bartender and ate a quick dinner with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the state's former governor. \\"It's going to go well with my pork chop,\\" Obama said. ||||| DES MOINES, Iowa - Paul Ryan received a rowdy reception at his appearance at the Iowa State Fair today with some protesters trying to storm the stage as the newly minted vice presidential candidate spoke. But Ryan soldiered on in his speech, even telling ABC News his Wisconsin background prepped him for the hecklers.      \\"Nah. We're used to it. I come from Wisconsin,\\" Ryan said of the hecklers as he weaved through the fair.      Surrounded by hay bales lining the stage, Ryan spoke at the soapbox, an Iowa state fair staple, where Ryan's running mate, Mitt Romney, was heckled last year after making a comment that has stuck with him throughout this campaign.      \\"Corporations are people, my friend,\\" Romney said last year on the same stage, as protesters shouted him down.      Ryan's stop at the fair was his first solo trip as Romney's running mate, and he was greeted by a crush of supporters, media and protesters.      As he made his way to the famous Iowa Fair soapbox, he was surrounded by cameras, reporters and those trying to get a look at the GOP ticket's No. 2 man. He shook hands and introduced himself to voters with a casual statement: \\"Hi, I'm Paul.\\"      Ryan's first foray into Iowa came on the same day when President Obama began his bus tour through the Hawkeye state.      \\"I heard that President Obama is starting his bus tour today and I heard he wasn't going to come to the Iowa State Fair,\\" Paul said.      \\"Are you going to cut Medicare?\\" a woman shouted.      \\"It's funny because Iowans and Wisconsinites, we like to be respectful of one another and peaceful with one another and listen to one another. These ladies must not be from Iowa or Wisconsin,\\" Paul said, referring to the protesters.      And that's when things got much rowdier. A female protester began to climb on the small stage. She was able to get up before being dragged off by Ryan's Secret Service detail.      Ryan, dressed in a red checked shirt and jeans, continued with his pitch to the rest of the crowd, many holding Romney signs or even standing in front of protesters.      \\"My guess is the reason that President Obama isn't making it here from Council Bluffs is he only knows left turns, but as you see the president come through on his bus tour you may ask him the same question I get asked all over America and that is where are the jobs Mr. President.\\"      An older male protester with a white beard was also heckling Ryan, telling him to, \\"End the wars\\" and \\"Stop the wars on the common good.\\"      Ryan also tried to identify with the voters in this battleground state.      \\"I feel such kindred spirits here,\\" the Wisconsin congressman, 42, said. \\"We are united as upper midwesterners, but, you know what it is? At the end of the day, we are Americans.\\"      Ryan was joined at the fair by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, as well as Romney friend and confidante Bob White.

As Ryan walked out the state fair along Grand Avenue, a protester on the side yelled at him, calling him a \\"f-ing disgrace.\\"      But it wasn't just protests that met Ryan. Supporters reached out their hands to touch Ryan and shouted words of encouragement to the vice presidential candidate.      \\"I think he's conservative. He's right on the money,\\" one woman told ABC News. \\"He's correct on the money, and we need to cut back, stop spending money that we don't have.\\"      \\"Did you see his blue eyes?\\" one woman shouted at another after Ryan passed her.      And many people at the fair still didn't know quite who Ryan was two only days after he joined the Republican ticket.      \\"He's cute right?\\" one man jokingly said to his friend      \\"I guess so,\\" another woman said.      While he participated in the typical campaign fare of shaking hands and stopping to talk to babies, the health conscious Ryan stayed away from one of the fairs staples: fried food.      He stopped to talk to voters at a few stands, but didn't sample any of the tasty fried treats. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"This news article is about President Barack Obama and Paul Ryan visiting the Iowa State Fair on the same day. Obama had fun at the fair, walking around, talking to people and eating a pork chop and drinking a beer. He joked with a baby and took pictures with the Iowa State Fair queen. Paul Ryan, who is Mitt Romney's partner, also visited the fair and spoke on a stage. Some people there were not happy with Ryan and shouted at him, but he continued to speak and meet with voters.

Now let's look at the numbers: 1. Barcelona B WINS 15: This means that out of all the games Barcelona B played, they won 15 times, beating their opponents. 2. Barcelona B DRAWS 9: This means there were 9 games out of all they played where Barcelona B and the other team scored the same number of goals. 3. Barcelona B PLAYED 38: This means Barcelona B played a total of 38 games. 4.

Given the question: Information:  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months. While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body's immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. A group of medications called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence. RA affects between 0.5 and 1% of adults in the developed...  - Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints. Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden. There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis. They are all types of rheumatic disease. Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a joint replacement may be useful. Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% of have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek \\"arthro-\\" meaning joint and \\"-itis\\" meaning inflammation.  - Palindromic rheumatism ( PR ) consists of sudden and rapidly developing attacks of arthritis . There is acute pain , redness , swelling , and disability of one ( usually ) or multiple joints . The interval between recurrent attacks is extremely variable and how long the attack lasts is also variable . There is no joint damage after attacks .  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include feeling tired to a degree that normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present. The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown; however, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors with half the risk attributed to each. The condition runs in families and many genes are believed to be involved. Environmental factors may include psychological stress, trauma, and certain infections. The pain appears to result from processes in the central nervous system and the condition is referred to as a \\"central sensitization syndrome\\". Fibromyalgia is recognized as a disorder by the US National Institutes of Health and the American College of Rheumatology. There is no specific diagnostic test. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes and verifying that a set number of symptoms are present. The treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While fibromyalgia can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage. Fibromyalgia is estimated to affect 28% of the population. Females are affected about twice as often as males. Rates appear...  - Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or joint infection, is the purulent invasion of a joint by an infectious agent which produces arthritis. People with artificial joints are more at risk than the general population but have slightly different symptoms, are infected with different organisms and require different treatment. Septic arthritis is considered a medical emergency. If untreated, it may destroy the joint in a period of days. The infection may also spread to other parts of the body.  - Replacement arthroplasty (from Greek \\"arthron\\", joint, limb, articulate, + \\"plassein\\", to form, mould, forge, feign, make an image of), or joint replacement surgery, is a procedure of orthopedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface is replaced with an orthopedic prosthesis. Joint replacement is considered as a treatment when severe joint pain or dysfunction is not alleviated by less-invasive therapies. During the latter half of the 20th century, rheumasurgery developed as a subspecialty focused on these and a few other procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases.  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, neck, lower back, knee, and hips. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. Usually the symptoms come on over years. It can affect work and normal daily activities. Unlike other types of arthritis, only the joints are typically affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have one leg of a different length, and have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests occasionally used to either support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting and the use of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If...

Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called Tophill. Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of 151 metres (495 ft) near the Verne in the north, to just above sea level at Portland Bill. The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) underneath south Dorset lies a layer of Triassic rock salt, and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities. Portland Gas applied to excavate 14 caverns to store 1,000,000,000 cubic metres (3.5×1010 cu ft) of natural gas, which is one percent of the UK's total annual demand. It was proposed that the caverns should be connected to the National gas grid at Mappowder via a 37-kilometre (23 mi) pipeline. Plans had it that the surface facilities should be complete to store the first gas in 2011, and the entire cavern space available for storage in winter 2013.

Read this: The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies, they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the analytic (a priori) and the synthetic (a posteriori). On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called verification principle. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.

Employment experts have given warnings over workers' conditions.

While the efficiency of this retail behemoth has been the subject of consumer praise, its not-so-shiny part has been the subject of discussion among former employees who've claimed the company maintains an oppressive work environment to fuel its productivity. Adam Littler, a 23-year-old former Amazon employee, has revealed the unimaginable pressure employees face while working for Amazon behind the sterling image. In an interview with BBC, he has referred to the working conditions as \\"unbelievable,\\" citing the primary concerns as constant surveillance, restricted toilet breaks, and abysmal fulfillment quotas within the warehouses. Amazon staff has alleged that they are being constantly monitored with GPS as they navigate through vast warehouse spaces, putting immense pressure on them to meet strict performance targets. This tracking system, according to Littler and other employees, leaves no room for error and compels them to work at an almost unreasonable speed. Although Amazon has consistently denied the use of GPS to monitor their workers, this claim persists among former and current employees. Another alarming issue raised by the workers is the timing of their toilet breaks. Employees have asserted that they get regulated breaks with predefined timings, which has led to a widespread feeling of disrespect and invasion of privacy among the workforce. The inability to take a few minutes off when needed can have serious health implications, add to stress levels, and promote an unhealthy work culture that lacks basic human consideration. Employment experts have expressed their concerns about the working conditions within Amazon warehouses. They have stated that the constant pressure to perform, surveillance, and lack of essential breaks can lead to diminished mental and physical well-being of the workforce. These working conditions have placed Amazon under scrutiny for potentially violating labor laws and human rights standards. The Panorama programme, Amazon: The Truth Behind The Click, is an investigative documentary that delves into the controversial claims of employees and provides an inside look at the reality of working conditions at Amazon warehouses. The program offers a platform for employees and experts to share their experiences and thoughts about the systemic issues faced by the company's workforce. It is scheduled to be aired tonight at 8.30 pm on BBC1. As one of the world's leading retail giants, Amazon is looked up to as an epitome of excellence and efficiency. However, it is crucial that the company undergoes some introspection regarding the well-being of employees, as those workers are the backbone of its unparalleled success. Businesses like Amazon have the responsibility to treat their workforce with the care, respect, and dignity they deserve, for ultimately, a happy and healthy workforce leads to a prosperous company."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite all of the other comments written here, I really prefer the Bette Davis version, even though the Novak version has a more coherent story line. However: Davis' Mildred's raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute. And it is those raw emotions that constitute *part* of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, of failure, of \\"otherness\\" - strong emotions that he represses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, displays her emotions immediately and without censure. She has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of \\"otherness\\"; rather, she is merely surviving as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than was Davis', almost through the the whole movie. Davis' Mildred was **never** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance. And when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen: \\"I wiped my mouth! I WIPED MY MOUTH!!\\" Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis' realism was monumental. IMDb votes concur! Would you say this review is positive or negative? Choose your answer from: - negative. - positive.","output":"I would say this review is positive. The reviewer clearly prefers the Bette Davis version of the film due to the raw emotions displayed by Davis and the realism she brought to the role.

In each sentence, \\"touch\\" is utilized in a different context, carrying a distinct meaning in each one. In order to comprehend the dissimilarities, let's examine each sentence and clarify the meaning of \\"touch.\\" 1. The two buildings touch. In this sentence, the word \\"touch\\" refers to the physical contact between two objects or surfaces, in this case, two buildings. When one building is in direct contact with the neighboring building, it can be said that they touch each other. In this context, the word \\"touch\\" bears a literal, spatial meaning, and denotes the connection made through direct contact. 2. Are you all right? You've hardly touched your lunch. In this sentence, the word \\"touch\\" is employed metaphorically. It's not uncommon for people to use \\"touch\\" to indicate that someone has barely interacted with or consumed something — in this instance, their lunch. When someone says that a person has \\"hardly touched\\" their food, they mean that the individual in question has barely eaten or consumed any of it, often implying that there may be an underlying issue or dissatisfaction causing the lack of appetite. Here, the usage of \\"touch\\" exceeds its literal meaning and demonstrates a more abstract, metaphorical sense. In conclusion, while the word \\"touch\\" originates from the same root, its meaning varies significantly in the two sentences provided. The first sentence employs \\"touch\\" in a literal, spatial sense, suggesting direct physical contact, while the second sentence conveys a metaphorical meaning referring to minimal interaction or consumption of an item, such as food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Q My daughter is a junior in high school and has been on an individualized education program since fourth grade. She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has overcome. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? --Deborah AFirst let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/ SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. \\"Disclosing\\" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially demonstrate, for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also demonstrate an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. --Ms. Kravis Question: What is Ms. Kravis' attitude toward one's declaring his/ her learning disability?

Answer the following question: This article: In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word Chaca, but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, José Antonio Vizcarra, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were \\"of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans\\". In 1844, Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, Commerce of the Prairies. The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican–American War of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo, Francisco Hosta, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as \\"a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day.\\" Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins.

Step 1: Understand the premise The premise says that there is a division among critics that is based on national lines. This indicates that critics associate themselves with their respective nations. It is worth noting that the premise implies that national lines are not the only source of division among critics. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states \\"National lines are divided among critics.\\" This is essentially reversing the way the division is presented, suggesting that the existence of national lines leads to the division of critics. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis Both the premise and the hypothesis reference the division among critics and national lines. But while the premise emphasizes the division of critics based on national lines, the hypothesis puts the emphasis on the national lines dividing critics. Step 4: Evaluate the available options A. yes B. it is not possible to tell C. no Step 5: Choose the best option The hypothesis is essentially rephrasing the premise but maintains the same meaning, suggesting that the division among critics occurs based on national lines. While the emphasis is slightly different in each statement, both statements convey the same core idea. Therefore, option A. yes seems to be the right answer."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Title: Jacob's Ladder Movie plot: On 6Â October 1971, American soldier Jacob Singer is with the 1st Air Cavalry Division, deployed in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War, when his close-knit unit comes under attack. As many of Jacobâs comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior, including catatonia and a bloody seizure. A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be bayoneted in the gut. Jacob awakens in 1975, on a New York City Subway, with the novel The Stranger. Despite having a PhD, Jacob works as a postal clerk and lives in a rundown apartment in Brooklyn with his seductive girlfriend, Jezzie. Jacob misses his wife and their three sons, especially the youngest, Gabe, who died before the war. He is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences, including inexplicably locked subway exits, faceless vibrating people, a car trying to run him down, a nurse with grotesque teeth on the top of her head, and a bat-like monster penetrating Jezzie at a party, where Jacob collapses with a dangerous fever. The comrade who had gone catatonic, Paul, contacts him to reveal having had similar terrifying experiences, but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, the platoon-mates confess that all but one have also been living a nightmare. Jacob explains that the army must have done something to them, and they hire a lawyer to investigate. The lawyer backs out after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacobâs comrades also back out, looking scared, as Jacob demands they tell him who got to them. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who tell him to stop nosing around in military business, but he is able to jump from the moving car. Taken to the hospital, he finds himself strapped to a stretcher being wheeled over bloody body parts, past demented, disfigured inmates. Trapped with doctors wielding barbaric metal instruments, he is told he is already dead, but...

Bob and Andy are two microbiologists.  They are studying bacteria: Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria, while Andy studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes.  Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.

Nice sweatshirt!” I was passing through the hallways of school last year, being messenger boy for the teachers, when this girl walked up to me. I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That’s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the “nice sweatshirt” bit was what really got me. I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it. I was wearing Evan’s. It’s also kind of sad because that was one of the only compliments I’ve gotten from a stranger all year.

These are the reasons: 1. Ethnicity: The second premise does not specify the ethnicity of the man, making it impossible to conclude that he is Asian without additional context or information. 2. Color of the Jacket: The color of the man's jacket is also not specified in the second premise. The man could be wearing a jacket of any color - it could be blue, but we don't know for sure. 3. Color of the Candles: While not mentioned in the first premise, the second premise specifies that the candles are red. The first premise does not specify the color of the candles the man is putting into the cake. Hence, based on this detail, it might seem plausible that the two statements could be talking about the same situation, but again, we lack complete certainty without further detail. 4. Actions: The action described in both the premises are identical - a man putting candles into a cake. This is the only detail that aligns perfectly with the first premise. In conclusion, without additional specifics relating to the man’s ethnicity and the color of his jacket, we cannot confirm that both premises are describing the same situation or event. Moreover, the color of the candles introduces an extra detail in the second premise that was absent from the first, adding another layer of ambiguity.  We must be cautious in our interpretations and recognise that details such as these matter and can change the entire meaning of a scene or statement.

Four days after the events of Rush Hour, LAPD Detective James Carter is on vacation in Hong Kong visiting his friend, Hong Kong Police Force Chief Inspector Lee, whom he met and befriended after working together to save the Chinese Consul Han's daughter, Soo Yung, in Los Angeles. Their leisure is temporarily put on hold as soon as a bomb explodes at the United States Consulate General, murdering two undercover U.S. Customs agents inside of it. Inspector Lee is assigned to the case, which becomes personal when it is discovered that it somehow involves Ricky Tan, his late police officer father's former partner. Ricky, who was suspected of having a role in elder Lee's death (although never proven), is now a leader of the Triads. This, however, causes Lee and Carter to get into a brawl between them and Ricky's bodyguards, with Carter becoming shocked with Lee as they were busy with their vacation. The U.S. Secret Service, led by Agent Sterling, and the Hong Kong Police Force soon get into a fight over the jurisdiction of the case. Suddenly, Lee's office that Carter was in is bombed, causing Lee to believe he's dead and grieve for him. Carter is revealed to be alive, leaving the room before it exploded. He and a relieved Lee cross paths at Ricky's yacht where he is holding a dinner party. Ricky scolds his underling, Hu Li, who then leaves as Lee and Carter confront her boss. Just as Ricky asks for protection, Hu Li shoots him and makes her escape in the chaos. An angry Sterling holds Lee responsible for Ricky's death, and orders him off the case.

Trim an airplane.","output":"The word \\"trim\\" has different meanings in the two given sentences, as it can be used in various contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Trim lumber,\\" trim operates as an adjective. In this context, trim refers to the state of the lumber as being cut, shaped, and prepared for use in construction or any other application where wood is needed. The lumber has been processed to remove any excess material, such as bark or branches, and has been smoothed out. To put it simply, the lumber has been made neat and tidy so that it can be easily used for any carpentry, woodworking, or building projects. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Trim an airplane,\\" uses trim as a verb that has a distinct meaning. In this context, \\"trim\\" refers to adjust or set the airplane's control surfaces, typically the elevator, aileron, and rudder, to maintain the desired aircraft balance, pitch, roll, or yaw. This is done to minimize the force applied by the pilot on the controls and maintain the aircraft in a steady and stable flight condition without constant input from the pilot. The word \\"trim\\" in this scenario involves making adjustments to the control surfaces so that the airplane can achieve a specific attitude or maintain a certain flight path efficiently without requiring continuous manual intervention from the pilot. In summary, \\"trim\\" has different meanings within the two given sentences. In the first example, it describes the state of lumber after being processed and prepared for use, while in the second example, it indicates the process of fine-tuning an airplane's control surfaces to achieve a stable and efficient flight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose. Is the following statement correct based on the text do fatty acid synthesis and degradation occur in the same location of the cell","output":"No, the statement is not correct. Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytosol, which is outside the mitochondria. Fatty acid degradation, or beta-oxidation, occurs inside the mitochondria.

Summarize: If the front brakes have been squealing loudly, you may need pads only. If the car or brake pedal has been shaking when braking, you'll need to have the rotors resurfaced (called \\"turning\\"), or replace them.  If the car pulls to one side while braking, but stays straight otherwise, you may need calipers. This is a sign of uneven wear of your brake pads caused by uneven pressure in your brake lines. If the brakes have a grinding noise, this means rotors are done, spent, wasted, or whatever you want to call it, just replace them. There are two bolts that hold the caliper to the pad bracket, and two bolts that hold the pad bracket to the steering knuckle. You may need both SAE and Metric sizes of wrenches and sockets, as well as bleeder screw wrenches. Also, you may need a set of hex (ALLEN) or star (TORX) key wrenches or a hex or star bit socket set. Consider using line wrenches to remove calipers. Theses wrenches have a better bite and reduce the chances of rounding off hex nuts fitting on the hose end. You can always return what you don't use (keep your receipt and boxes and parts clean/undamaged). If you get caught without something while the car is apart, you may not have transportation to go buy anything.","output":"In summary, various brake-related issues may require different solutions. If you hear loud squealing noises from the front brakes, it's likely that you need to replace the brake pads. When the car or brake pedal shakes during braking, it's a sign that the rotors need to be resurfaced (\\"turned\\") or replaced. If the car pulls to one side only while braking but remains straight otherwise, it may indicate that you need new calipers due to uneven brake pad wear resulting from uneven pressure in the brake lines. A grinding noise from the brakes signifies that the rotors have reached the end of their lifespan and need to be replaced. To perform these repairs, you'll need various tools, including SAE and metric wrenches and sockets, bleeder screw wrenches, and potentially hex (ALLEN) or star (TORX) key wrenches or a corresponding bit socket set. It's recommended to use line wrenches for removing calipers, as they offer better grip and reduce the risk of rounding off hex nuts. When purchasing tools and parts, always keep your receipts and the items in clean, undamaged condition. This allows you to return any unused items. Moreover, it's crucial to plan and have all the necessary tools and parts ready beforehand, as you may not have access to transportation if your car is disassembled during the repair process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The other species are \\"E. constans\\", \\"E. eocenica\\", \\"E. montana\\", and \\"E. rolandii\\". Can we draw the following conclusion? Eucommiaceae thrives in various environments.","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not sufficient to conclude that Eucommiaceae thrives in various environments solely based on the fossil records of five extinct species from North America, including Eucommia jeffersonensis. While these fossils demonstrate that members of the Eucommiaceae family did exist in different regions of North America during the Eocene epoch, it does not offer enough information about the specific environments these plants thrived in or how adaptable they are. To draw such a conclusion, it would be essential to explore more extensive data on the fossil distribution, ecological preferences, and adaptations of different Eucommiaceae species. This data would include a detailed understanding of the geographic and stratigraphic distribution of the fossils, as well as the types of environments in which these plants existed. Additionally, the analysis should also address any known or hypothesized physiological or morphological adaptations that could be attributed to thriving in different environments. Furthermore, it would be relevant to compare the ecological preferences and adaptability of the extinct species with that of the extant species within the family Eucommiaceae. The modern genus Eucommia consists of a single species, Eucommia ulmoides, commonly known as the hardy rubber tree. This tree is native to China and is known to possess significant adaptability in various environmental conditions. Examining the similarities and differences between the extinct and living species may yield more insights into the environmental preferences of the Eucommiaceae family as a whole. In conclusion, while the fossil records of Eucommia jeffersonensis and other extinct North American species serve as important evidence of the past existence of the Eucommiaceae family, it does not provide enough information to conclusively state that the family thrives in various environments. A more comprehensive analysis of the fossil distribution, ecological preferences, and any potential environmental adaptations would be necessary to make such a claim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"What happened to the Federal Building?\\"  Context: \\"On April 19, 1995, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed by a fertilizer bomb manufactured and detonated by Timothy McVeigh. The blast and catastrophic collapse killed 168 people and injured over 680. The blast shockwave destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 340-meter radius, destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, causing at least an estimated 652 million worth of damage. The main suspect- Timothy McVeigh, was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. It was the deadliest single domestic terrorist attack in US history, prior to 9/11.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, located in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was a target of domestic terrorism on April 19, 1995. The tragic event unfolded when a fertilizer bomb was manufactured and detonated by Timothy McVeigh, an anti-government extremist with a deep resentment for the federal government. The bomb, which was created using a deadly combination of ammonium nitrate (a common agricultural fertilizer) and fuel oil, was hidden inside a rented Ryder truck. McVeigh parked the truck outside the north entrance of the Murrah building and ignited the explosives, leading to a massive explosion. The immense force of the blast not only obliterated the side of the building it was parked next to but also caused a catastrophic collapse of the structure. This domestic terrorist attack resulted in the tragic loss of 168 lives, including 19 children who were in the building's daycare center, and left more than 680 others seriously injured. The impact of the explosion was felt far beyond the immediate vicinity, as shockwaves from the blast damaged or destroyed 324 buildings within a 340-meter radius. In addition, 86 vehicles were either demolished or burned, and 258 nearby buildings had their windows shattered by the force of the explosion. The horrendous aftermath of the attack saw property damage estimates reach at least 652 million, making it clear that the consequences of this single event were vast and far-reaching. Moreover, the bombing struck a deep emotional chord with the American public, leaving many devastated and mourning the loss of innocent lives. Following an intense manhunt and thorough investigation, Timothy McVeigh was arrested and eventually charged with various crimes, including use of a weapon of mass destruction, malicious destruction of property, and first-degree murder. Alongside McVeigh, his accomplice, Terry Nichols, was also arrested and charged for his involvement in the attack. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison, while McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. The Oklahoma City bombing remains the deadliest single domestic terrorist attack in United States history, predating the events of September 11, 2001. The tragedy served as a stark reminder of the threat posed by domestic terrorism, which led to increased security measures at federal buildings across the nation. Furthermore, it contributed to substantial changes in law enforcement and counterterrorism strategies in the fight against domestic and international terrorism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Mike Krzyzewski, Bob Knight share unique relationship, history Bob Knight and Mike Krzyzewski, the two winningest D1 men's college coaches, shared an embrace on Tuesday night. NEW YORK -- Mike Krzyzewski became the winningest coach in the history of men's major college basketball at 9:36 p.m. on Tuesday, when his Duke Blue Devils defeated Michigan State, 74-69, at Madison Square Garden. The achievement, however, was not sealed until a minute later, when Krzyzewski walked to the broadcast table and shared a teary embrace with the man whom he had just surpassed, Bob Knight, who had analyzed the game for ESPN. \\"I know a lot of people don't tell you this, Coach,\\" Krzyzewski said. \\"But I love you.\\" As Krzyzewski spoke, Knight had his face buried in Krzyzewski's suit jacket. Then he pulled back, smiled and said, \\"Boy, you've done pretty good for a kid who couldn't shoot.\\" Knight laughed and slapped Krzyzewski hard on the shoulder. \\"I think that meant he loved me, too,\\" Krzyzewski said later. \\"I'm going to take it as that.\\" It has been a long, winding, tumultuous, heartfelt and sometimes heartbreaking ride that brought Mike Krzyzewski and Bob Knight to that embrace. But there they were, sharing the happy coincidence that allowed them both to be present for this moment in history. The record now shows that Krzyzewski has 903 career wins to Knight's 902, but their relationship cannot be defined by mere numbers. It only took five decades, but these two men finally speak each other's language, even if those closest to them don't. \\"Their relationship fascinates me. It kind of defies description,\\" Krzyzewski's wife, Mickie, said Tuesday night. \\"It's sort of unbelievable that they're a coach and player who together have 1,800 wins. But the relationship between Coach Knight and Mike, which healed years ago, is much more unique to me than the fact that they share this honor.\\" Grant Hill: A former player talks Coach K's impact on and off the court It's amazing enough that a man would surpass his former college coach to break the NCAA's most significant coaching record. What's even more amazing is that the university which brought them together wasn't a basketball factory like Kansas, Kentucky or UCLA. It wasn't even Ohio State, where Knight was a reserve guard on the 1960 NCAA championship team. Rather, it was the United States Military Academy at West Point, a place known more for churning out generals and presidents than Hall of Fame basketball coaches. Knight was just 25 years old when he walked into Bill and Emily Krzyzewski's living room in the spring of 1965 to recruit their son, who led Chicago's Catholic League in scoring while playing point guard for Weber High School. (Krzyzewski's dad used the surname Kross because he believed it would be easier for him to find work.) Mike's parents were enticed by the idea that their son could attend such a prestigious university, but to his parents' consternation Mike told Knight he wasn't interested. He hoped that he could play for a Midwestern college with a better hoops program such as Creighton, Detroit, maybe even a school in the Big Ten. When those offers never came, his parents' prodding -- their \\"ethnic pressure,\\" as Krzyzewski calls it -- eventually changed the boy's mind. As Army's point guard, Krzyzewski earned his minutes by accepting Knight's abuse and heeding his strict instructions never to shoot. During his three years on the varsity, Krzyzewski never averaged more than seven points per game, but he led the Black Knights to two appearances in the NIT. That included a trip to the semifinal his senior year, when Army lost to Boston College in Madison Square Garden. Later that night, Krzyzewski's father suffered a massive brain hemorrhage. He was dead before Mike could get home. Knight dropped everything, followed his point guard to Chicago and stayed at the Krzyzewskis' house for three days. Mike never forgot the kindness Knight showed his mother that week as he consoled her while the two of them sat in the family kitchen. \\"That's when I saw Coach Knight start to emerge as a father figure to Mike,\\" Mickie said. Following his five-year stint in the Army, Krzyzewski joined Knight's staff at Indiana as a graduate assistant. The following year, Krzyzewski took over as head coach at his alma mater. The Knights had won just three games the previous season, but they won 20 and 19, respectively, during Krzyzewski's second and third seasons. From there, however, they backtracked, and in Krzyzewski's fifth year they finished with an overall record of 7-19. During the spring of 1980, Knight got a call from Tom Butters, the athletic director at Duke. Butters was looking to hire a basketball coach, and he wanted to float a few candidates. According to Gene Wojciechowski's forthcoming book, The Last Great Game, which tells the story of the epic 1992 regional final between Duke and Kentucky, Knight actually thought Krzyzewski was better suited for a place like Iowa State, where he wouldn't have to face so much pressure. Still, he told Butters the truth: Krzyzewski was a great defensive coach, and coming from West Point he would understand Duke's academic mission. That prompted Butters to interview Krzyzewski, and he eventually shocked the public by tapping the unknown cadet to be his coach. Gallery: Classic photos of coach Mike Krzyzewski Over the next decade, Knight and Krzyzewski remained close as they circled each other from afar. As Krzyzewski built Duke into a winner -- surviving a combined 21-34 record his second and third seasons -- he often relied on his former coach's friendship and advice. On the eve of Duke's matchup with Louisville in the 1986 NCAA final, he asked Knight to speak to his team. When Duke lost, Knight called Krzyzewski every day for a week to make sure he was OK. The next year, their teams played each other for the first time, meeting in the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament. Indiana won en route to capturing Knight's second title. Five more years passed before fate again brought their teams together. It happened at the 1992 Final Four. By that time, their career arcs had begun to diverge. In the five years since their teams last played, Knight had not returned to the Final Four. Krzyzewski, on the other hand, made five more trips, and in '91 he broke through to win his first NCAA championship. In the days leading up to the game, the two men's baser instincts -- pride, combativeness, insecurity, envy -- surfaced in subtle ways. Krzyzewski was deferential in his public remarks, but he downplayed the obvious storyline by pointing out that while Knight had had the most influence on him, he also benefited from relationships with other coaches. Krzyzewski could also become prickly when Knight's specter was invoked. During a news conference the day before Duke's second-round game against Iowa, a reporter asked him whether he had called Knight for advice on how to beat the Big Ten school. \\"No,\\" Krzyzewski snapped. \\"Somewhere in my 17 years as a coach I've figured out how to scout an opponent.\\" Unbeknown to Krzyzewski, Knight, who already had an unseemly tendency to feel threatened by his friends' successes, took offense. After the game, which Duke won 81-78, a slew of cameras predictably surrounded the two men as they approached for the postgame handshake. Krzyzewski stopped to share some words and perhaps a hug. Knight, however, stuck out his hand and blew right on by. Krzyzewski was visibly stunned. He was even more surprised a short while later after Knight wrapped up his postgame news conference, stepped off the dais and came upon the Duke contingent waiting to speak. Knight congratulated the players on their win but said nothing to Krzyzewski. Later, a mutual friend handed Krzyzewski a note from Knight that essentially said, if a divorce is what you want, then a divorce is what you've got. As his players later conducted postgame interviews in Duke's locker room, Krzyzewski sat in a backroom with tears in his eyes and lamented to his assistants, \\"There are days when life's not fair.\\" The incident led to a deep freeze between the two proud men that lasted almost a year. In December, when Krzyzewski was asked about his mentor, he replied, \\"My relationship with Coach Knight is like my relationship with my wife. And I don't talk about my relationship with my wife.\\" (The statement was unconvincing considering Krzyzewski frequently talked about his relationship with his wife.) \\"I was mad because Mike was hurting, and I just knew the problem could be solved,\\" Mickie said. \\"This was a misunderstanding. It was people saying things that are being attributed to other people. It was very frustrating for me to see Mike in that kind of agony and miss Coach so much and not be able to do anything about it.\\" Finally, in January of '93, Knight reached out. At first, Krzyzewski refused to take the call, but eventually the two men talked for over an hour. Knight never technically apologized -- saying he's sorry is not exactly the man's strong suit -- but Krzyzewski forgave him anyway and decided it was time to move on. For the next few years they were friendly but not especially close, the scars from their Final Four rupture still raw. In the winter of 1995, Indiana and Duke played each other without incident at the Great Alaska Shootout. Krzyzewski assumed the two were still on good terms when they met again in Madison Square Garden during the championship game of the preseason NIT in 1996. Krzyzewski knew that Knight liked to come out on the court close to tipoff, so he went over to the Indiana bench and waited for him. The horn sounded to mark the end of warmups, but Knight had still not emerged. The player introductions began. Still no Knight. Finally, Knight walked out ... and ignored Krzyzewski while chatting amiably with legendary horse trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Indiana pasted Duke by 16 points. Afterward, Krzyzewski was more resigned than heartbroken. \\"I'm almost glad it happened that way,\\" he told author John Feinstein for his book, A March to Madness, a look inside the ACC. \\"It lets me put a period on the end of the sentence. The end. You know, it's really kind of sad. He keeps turning friends away. I'm not the first or the last. I tried to do the right thing. I'm over it now. Five years ago, that would have hurt me. It doesn't hurt anymore.\\" As Knight and Krzyzewski went their separate ways, their careers did the same. After his team defeated Indiana in the '92 Final Four, Krzyzewski coached in three more championship games, winning his third title in 2001. Meanwhile, from 1995 to 2000, Knight's Indiana teams won a total of two NCAA tournament games. In September of 2000, Knight was fired by Indiana president Myles Brand for violating the zero tolerance policy Brand had put in place just four months before. Knight was humiliated and devastated, but Krzyzewski never called to console him. Their friends and spouses weren't sure how to repair the breach, or even if they wanted to. \\"I stayed out of it because I knew that the pain came from a real place,\\" Mickie Krzyzewski said. \\"That place was anger. Mike had to work through that before he could sincerely pick up the phone.\\" The moment to do so finally arrived in 2001. Krzyzewski had been voted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., and he needed to select a member of the Hall to present him for induction. Krzyzewski and Mickie bandied names for several days. Finally, Krzyzewski told his wife he had chosen Knight. \\"I said, 'Coach Knight? Why?' And he said, 'He's the only one,'\\" Mickie recalled. \\"It was the perfect salve for that wound.\\" Knight accepted the invitation. As Krzyzewski's three daughters took the stage that night to introduce him, Knight, whom Mickie once thought was \\"the meanest man in the world\\" while he coached her boyfriend at Army, walked off the stage, took Mickie by the hand and led her up the stairs so she could stand beside her husband. Knight's speech that night was eloquent and stirring. He told the audience that Krzyzewski was a much better player than he had given himself credit for. He said the only important thing Krzyzewski had learned from him was what not to do. And his voice quavered as he brought Krzyzewski to the stage by calling him \\"the best coach that I've had a team play against.\\" Krzyzewski climbed the stairs, shook hands with a few dignitaries, and then fell into his coach's arms and sobbed. It looked exactly like what it was: a father and son, previously estranged, reconciling in front of thousands of people. Since that day, their relationship has continued to evolve, as relationships do. They're still equal parts coach-player and father-son, but they're also fellow coaches, colleagues, best friends. They're older now, more comfortable in their own skin, less susceptible to the pettiness that almost severed them for good. When Krzyzewski praises Knight these days, there is no hint of equivocation. He has also gotten smarter about avoiding potential triggers. After Brand left Indiana to become president of the NCAA, he reached out to Krzyzewski and invited him to Brand's house to talk. Before saying yes, Krzyzewski called Knight to make sure it was OK with him. (It was.) Now, thanks to Tuesday night's events, they can enjoy one more bond, a remarkable moment when they switched places atop the NCAA's record book. Krzyzewski thanked the \\"basketball gods\\" for arranging for Knight to be there -- at Madison Square Garden, no less -- but the truth is, the gods have been arranging that moment for over 40 years. When it finally arrived, it didn't matter how turbulent or hurtful their journey had been. The only thing that mattered was where that journey had taken them, and where it takes them still. Summary:","output":"Mike Krzyzewski became the winningest coach in men's major college basketball history when his team, the Duke Blue Devils, defeated Michigan State. He had just surpassed Bob Knight's record, who was there to analyze the game for ESPN. Both Mike and Bob have a special relationship and a long history together. They have shared ups and downs in their careers and friendship, but after a while, they were like father and son and best friends. They were both present for this great moment and it shows how far they've come in their journey together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write the answer: Which is the only bird in the Chinese Zodiac?","output":"The Chinese Zodiac, also known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, is a traditional Chinese system that represents a repeating cycle of twelve years, with each year being governed by a specific animal sign. These animal signs possess unique characteristics and are believed to influence the personalities, fortunes, and destinies of individuals born in their respective years. Unlike the Western Zodiac, which depends on the solar calendar and is associated with constellations, the Chinese Zodiac is based on the lunar calendar, deriving from observations of the orbit of the moon around the Earth. Out of the twelve animals in the Chinese Zodiac, the only bird is the Rooster. The Rooster is the tenth animal sign in the cycle, following the Monkey and preceding the Dog. The years associated with the Rooster include 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, and 2017, and every twelve years henceforth. People born in the Year of the Rooster are said to possess characteristics similar to the bird itself. The Rooster is associated with diligence, honesty, intelligence, efficiency, and resourcefulness. Individuals born under this sign are perceived as hardworking, self-disciplined, and goal-oriented, often taking on multiple responsibilities and excelling in their chosen careers. Additionally, people born in the Year of the Rooster are known for their punctuality, good organizational skills, and assertive communication, which makes them effective leaders in various social or professional settings. However, individuals born in the Year of the Rooster may also exhibit certain negative qualities, such as impatience, egocentricity, and an overly critical disposition. They can be sensitive to criticism and may occasionally take offense easily, leading them to be argumentative or confrontational. Learning to be more patient and empathetic towards others can help them to develop stronger relationships and achieve greater satisfaction and success in their personal and professional lives. Apart from the symbolism of the Rooster in the Chinese Zodiac, some people may consider the Rooster as a prosperous symbol in Chinese culture. The Rooster's crowing is believed to drive away evil spirits, and the bird itself is associated with good fortune, abundance, and happiness. In Chinese art and artifacts, the Rooster is often depicted as a symbol of regeneration, spiritual awakening, and protection from danger. In conclusion, the Rooster is the only bird in the Chinese Zodiac, distinguished by its unique characteristics, including diligence, punctuality, and resourcefulness. As a symbol in Chinese culture, the Rooster represents good fortune, protection, and spiritual awakening, and those born in the Year of the Rooster are believed to embody these attributes. Understanding the multifaceted qualities of the Rooster can help individuals harness the bird's positive energies and mitigate its weaknesses to thrive within their personal and professional spheres."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Today, we're going to talk about the big ice hockey league called the N.H.L. Sometimes, the players get hurt while playing, especially when they get a boo-boo on their head. This is called a concussion. It is important for people to know about concussions because they can be very serious. But sometimes, the N.H.L. is slow to tell everyone when a player gets a concussion. Let's find out why! When a hockey player falls or gets hit by someone, their head might shake really fast. This can make their brain move inside their head, like when you shake a box of crayons. This is not good because it can make the brain hurt. Sometimes, it can make the player feel dizzy, sleepy, or even forget things. The N.H.L. is a big group of people who make sure that ice hockey games happen. They also try to keep the players safe. But sometimes, they don't always tell people when a player gets a boo-boo on their head. This means that the people who watch the games and the players' friends and families don't know what happened. One reason for this is that the N.H.L. wants to make the games fun and exciting. If people know that a player is hurt, they might get worried and not want to watch the game. The N.H.L. also doesn't want other teams to know that a player is hurt because that team might try to play harder against the injured player. But there are some not-so-nice things about not telling people about concussions. Some players might not get the help they need because they don't want to tell anyone they're hurt. This can make the boo-boo on their head get worse, and it can be even harder for them to get better.  Remember, it's important to tell someone when you get hurt, whether it's a boo-boo on your head or anywhere else! The N.H.L. should help its players by letting everyone know when they get a concussion so they can get better faster. So now you know a little bit more about the N.H.L. and concussions. It's important for everyone to be safe when playing any sport, and to let others know if someone gets hurt. That way, we can all have fun and stay healthy!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As fans, we're passionate about understanding not just the outcome of a game, but about appreciating the performances of individual players. Knowing who scored the last touchdown of a game is one such fascination. So, let's unravel the mystery and uncover the player who had the last touchdown (TD) of this particular game. Step 1: Research the game specifics To determine the player with the last touchdown, we must first establish which game to analyze. Whether it's an NFL matchup, a college football contest, or even a local game, gathering detailed information on the game helps in simplifying our quest. Step 2: Compile team and player statistics For any football match, numerous sources compile thorough statistics. Websites, newspapers, and television networks can all provide useful information on team and player performance, including touchdowns scored. By examining these sources, we can form a clearer picture of how the game progressed. Step 3: Scrutinize the play-by-play In addition to summarizing player statistics, many sources also document play-by-plays. These accounts describe each in-game event chronologically, making it easier for readers to follow the action and identify specific moments, including touchdowns. Delving into the play-by-play helps us pinpoint the game's final touchdown more accurately. Step 4: Validate the information Once we have identified the player in question, it is essential to cross-verify the information. Check multiple sources to ensure the reliability of the data and prevent errors. In some instances, a play that was initially ruled as a touchdown may have been overturned upon review, so scrutinizing different sources can save us from erroneous conclusions. Step 5: Analyze the player's performance After confirming the player's identity, it might be worth exploring their overall performance in the game. Evaluate their stats, consider the importance of their final touchdown, and possibly touch on the story that led up to their defining moment during the course of the game. Conclusion: In uncovering the player who had the last touchdown in a game, it's essential to tackle the task systematically and thoughtfully. From researching the game specifics to properly analyzing the player's performance, we can confidently and accurately answer the lingering question that fans yearn to know. And as we celebrate the triumphs and achievements of the players on the field, we strengthen our love and appreciation for the beautiful game – touchdown by touchdown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Japanese scientist recorded one bamboo plant that grew almost 1.5 meters in 24 hours! Bamboo grows almost everywhere in the world except Europe. There are more than 1,000 kinds of bamboo that grow around the world on both mountains and plains. Not all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimeters wide _ . This plant also comes in different colors, from yellow to black to green. Many Asian countries have been using bamboo for hundreds of years. They often use bamboo for building new buildings. As a matter of fact, the cables  that hold up the hanging bridge across the Min River in Sichuan are made of bamboo. The bridge has been in use for more than 1,000 years, and is still holding strong. In Africa, engineers are teaching poor farmers how to find water using bamboo. These African countries need cheap ways to find water because they have no money, and their fields often die from no rain and no water. It seems that bamboo is one of the best things they can use.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Much of it inevitably focused on the impact his demise would have upon the organisation, and how far it might hinder the spread of jihadist extremism. Opinion was inevitably divided. Many analysts sought to differentiate between what you might call the ideological battlefield and the practical struggle on the ground. Conventional wisdom suggested that the planning of attacks had largely been sub-contracted to regional offshoots or franchises of the organisation, like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in the lawless territories of Yemen, or al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mahgreb, which may well have been behind the recent bomb attack in Marrakesh. In this light, Bin Laden himself was seen a founding father, an inspirational figure, probably cut off from day-to-day events, especially since he was suspected of being holed up in the border badlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan. There was considerable surprise therefore when in the wake of the helicopter-borne raid in Pakistan, US officials suggested that, contrary to the prevailing view, Bin Laden still had  a much greater role in coordinating al-Qaeda operations than anyone had imagined. The US Navy Seals seized a large quantity of computer files and other material at the house in Abbottabad which intelligence experts swooped upon with urgency. It is the initial review of this material which seems to have prompted the re-assessment of Bin Laden's role. US Attorney General Eric Holder has told the BBC that the material seized indicated that Bin Laden was operationally involved with al-Qaeda, and that he was pushing al-Qaeda to engage in more plots, in more areas of the world and on specific dates. Bruce Riedel, a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution, says that he is not surprised at all by this turn of events. \\"Al-Qaeda said that he was in charge, he took credit for attacks (like that over Detroit); he was not in a cave or some remote area but in a major town where couriers came and went,\\" he says. \\"The conventional wisdom was just plain wrong and based on wishful thinking.\\" Referring to Ayman al-Zawahiri, whom many regard as effectively Bin Laden's number two, Mr Riedel says that \\"he is also very active and if he is not found soon, will recreate the same central command post\\". Opinions though are divided. Another former intelligence officer, Paul Pillar, now at Georgetown University, says that none of the material taken during  the raid, nor the exploitation of it that has become public knowledge so far, \\"does anything to refute the prior mainstream view of Bin Laden as primarily a source of ideology and inspiration, and relatively detached in recent years from operational direction and control\\". He adds that commentary to the contrary has been \\"off the mark, motivated in part by an official desire to underscore the importance of eliminating this one terrorist\\". So how to square these apparent contradictions? Well until more of the information taken in the raid is released, and that could take some time, it's very hard to make a definitive judgement. But one answer may well lie in defining the exact sense in which Bin Laden may have still been in command. US officials have been quoted as saying that his directions tended to be big-picture in nature, focusing more on broader objectives than on granular operational details. \\"I wouldn't call it command and control,\\" one senior US intelligence official is quoted as saying in the Washington Post newspaper. Nonetheless the suggestion is that he did have contacts with elements of his organisation. And he was far from being cut off from events. One of the most intriguing images of Bin Laden in his Abbottabad villa was of the al-Qaeda leader watching the television news, and quite possibly also listening to the BBC World Service. This article was about:","output":"This article is discussing Osama Bin Laden, who was a leader of a group called al-Qaeda. People didn't really know how involved he was in the group's actions, but after some important information was found, it seems like he might have had a bigger role than people thought.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body.  I am facing a new situation today: Kevin and his cousin Darlene both enjoy jogging for exercise. One day, Kevin goes out for a jog in his local neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is quite high, and he begins to sweat a lot and starts to feel a bit dizzy. On the same day, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low and she feels perfectly normal as she continues to jog.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information and the specific situation involving Kevin and Darlene, it can be deduced that Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency. As mentioned in the background article, excessive sweating during jogging in the heat can lead to electrolyte loss that could potentially be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency include nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. When individuals are not treated promptly, they can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate, which may lead to a heart attack in some cases. In the presented situation, Kevin goes for a jog on a particularly hot day and starts to sweat profusely. He also begins to feel dizzy which, as mentioned earlier, can be an early symptom of electrolyte deficiency. The high amount of heat outside could cause Kevin's body to lose more electrolytes through sweating as he jogs, making him more susceptible to an electrolyte imbalance. On the other hand, Darlene goes jogging on a day when the amount of heat outside is low. She feels perfectly fine as she continues to jog. Since the temperature is lower, Darlene is less likely to sweat excessively, therefore reducing the chances of her losing a significant amount of electrolytes via sweat. In this scenario, she is at a lower risk of developing electrolyte deficiency compared to Kevin. To ensure proper hydration and electrolyte balance, it is important for individuals who jog in hot weather to pay close attention to their body's signals and replenish their fluids and electrolytes as needed. This can be done by consuming sports drinks or other sources of electrolytes to help restore electrolyte levels quickly in the body. In conclusion, given the combination of factors such as excessive sweating, high heat, and dizziness, Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency during his jog. Darlene, on the other hand, appears to be at a lower risk as she jogs in cooler temperatures and feels normal throughout her exercise session."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The concept of using a quotation may seem like the opposite of “writing in your own words.” However, learning to use a quote the correct way is an essential writing skill. First, you must understand when to use a direct quotation. Use a direct quotation in order to:  Argue against another author’s specific idea Continue another author’s specific idea Prove your own point with the help of another author Add eloquence or power with a very meaningful quote A quote should never appear all by itself. Instead, you need to place the quote into the context of your essay. Write a sentence or two that leads up to the quotation, demonstrating the need for this particular voice. Be sure to provide the reader with any information they may need to understand this particular quote. The first time you bring a writer’s words into your own text, introduce the quote with a “signal phrase.” This should always include the name of the person (or persons) who wrote the words, as well as the full title of the work from which the quote is taken.  Here are two examples:  In his book End of Humanism, Richard Schechner states, “I prefer to work from primary sources: what I’ve done, what I’ve seen” (15). As Dixon and Foster explain in their book Experimental Cinema, “filmmakers assumed that the audience for their films was to be an intimate group of knowledgeable cineastes” (225). The proper way to format both your quote and the citation for your quote will depend on the style-guide you are following (MLA, APA, AP, or Chicago style). The specific rules of block-quoting, citation, and even the placement of the quotation marks will be determined by the style guide you use. (The citations provided above are done in MLA format).  In general, your quote should not exceed 3-4 lines of text. If it does (and it is truly necessary), you will need to use block quote formatting. At the end of the quote, include any relevant data that you have not already stated, such as the name of the author, the page number, and/or the date of publication. No matter what style guide you choose, you must always cite the author you quote. This is a crucial step and must never be skipped. Anytime you use the exact phrasing of an author, you must place this phrase in quotation marks and include the name of the author. Forgetting this step is unethical. It also puts you at risk for plagiarism. If there is no specific author, then use the editor instead, or whatever your specific style-guide requires.","output":"This article teaches how to correctly use quotes in writing, such as when to use them, how to introduce and format them, and the importance of citing the author to avoid plagiarism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is pognophobia the fear of?","output":"Pogonophobia is the persistent, irrational fear of beards. Yes, you read it correctly - a fear of beards. The term is derived from the Greek words \\"pogon\\" for beard and \\"phobos\\" for fear. This phobia is not generally as well known as other phobias like claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) or arachnophobia (fear of spiders), but it does exist and for people who suffer from it, the fear can be quite real and distressing, and significantly impact their daily lives. Like any other phobia, pogonophobia manifests itself through a series of specific symptoms and behaviors, which can vary from person to person. These symptoms can be physical, psychological or behavioral in nature, ranging from minor discomfort when seeing a person with a beard to severe panic attacks. Physical symptoms may include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, sweating, shaking or trembling, dry mouth, and feelings of dread or terror. Meanwhile, the psychological symptoms might include an overwhelming sense of anxiety or dread, obsessive thoughts about beards, an awareness that the fear is irrational but feeling powerless to overcome it, and difficulty concentrating on anything else other than this fear. The person with this phobia might display behavioral symptoms such as actively avoiding people with beards, feeling stressed in social situations where bearded individuals might be present, making significant changes to their lifestyle to avoid beards as much as possible (such as refusing to visit certain places or attend certain events), or even secluding themselves by becoming more introverted. In severe cases, even images or thoughts of beards can provoke intense anxiety in individuals with pogonophobia. This can lead to avoidance behavior where the person goes to great lengths to avoid coming into contact with bearded individuals or even images of them. In some cases, this fear could greatly impact their social life or professional life. The causes of pogonophobia, like with most phobias, are complex and multifaceted. It is typically thought that phobias arise from a combination of external events (i.e. traumatic events) and internal predispositions (i.e. heredity or genetics). As with other specific phobias, pogonophobia could develop after a traumatic incident involving a person with a beard. For instance, a person might develop this fear after a frightening encounter with a bearded individual during childhood. The vivid memory of the beard from the traumatic event may induce future anxiety responses when the person sees others with beards. More research is needed in this field to better understand why individuals develop this unique phobia. Treatment for pogonophobia, like other specific phobias, can include exposure therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and sometimes medication for associated symptoms like severe anxiety or panic attacks. CBT works by changing the thought patterns which lead to the fear and anxiety, helping the person to develop a better understanding of their fears and how to deal with them. Exposure therapy, on the other hand, involves gradual and repetitive exposure to the source of fear, helping the person to become less sensitive over time.  In summary, while it might seem peculiar to those who do not have it, pogonophobia is a legitimate condition that can significantly disrupt a person's life. It is important that it be taken seriously and that treatment be sought if it begins to interfere with daily activities, relationships, or one's emotional well-being."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20]  Paragraph: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area,  because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which month of the year was wetter, September 2018 or September 2019? A:","output":"The paragraph doesn't provide specific information on the weather in September for either 2018 or 2019. However, it does establish that 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area due to the subtropical ridge, while 2019 was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon. Thus, we can infer that September 2018 was likely wetter than September 2019 because the year as a whole was described as a 'very wet year'. We can't say this definitively without the specific rainfall data for those months, but based on the information given, September 2018 was likely wetter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. For thousands of years, people have found fossils. The fossils caused curiosity about Earths past. How did these organisms live? What type of world did they live in? Fossils can tell us a lot about Earths history. In ancient times, fossils inspired myths and stories. These stories included tales of monsters and other incredible creatures. What type of creature do you know that could inspire such stories? Of course, dinosaur fossils were once mistaken for dragons bones. Two thousand years ago, people discovered fossils in China. At the time, they were thought to be dragon bones. We know now that these were not bones, but fossils. So what is the difference?  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of things can fossils tell us?\\" is \\"How old the creatures were\\"?","output":"While the claim that fossils can tell us how old the creatures were is not explicitly stated in the provided paragraph, it is valid and relates closely to the broader topic. It's accurate to infer that analyzing fossils may provide insights into the age of the creatures when they died, although this might not be precise in all circumstances.  However, based on the information given in the text, it specifies that fossils can primarily inform us about how these ancient organisms lived and what type of world they occupied. When mentioning fossils, the central aspect discussed is their capacity to shed light on Earth's history and the lifestyle of creatures that lived millions of years ago. For instance, through studying different types of preserved fossils from various epochs, scientists can decipher patterns of evolution, understand more about prehistoric climates, and even get clues about significant events, like extinctions.  Furthermore, the text also describes that the discovery and interpretation of fossils, such as those mistaken for \\"dragon bones\\" in ancient China, have stimulated human imagination, driving them to create myths, stories, and explanations for the unexplainable. There is a subtle, yet vital difference between bones and fossils. Bones are made of a living tissue that decomposes over time. Usually, it does not last long enough to become fossilized. In contrast, fossils represent the remains or traces of organisms that were living in the past. The process of fossilization occurs when the decomposable organic material of a creature is gradually replaced by minerals and is preserved in the Earth's crust. In certain cases, it is not the bones, but only the imprints or footprints of the creature that get fossilized, providing valuable clues about the creature’s behavior and ecosystem.  In a nutshell, while the text does not explicitly note that fossils can tell us the age of the creatures, it does indicate that fossils are crucial tools for understanding our planet's rich and diverse history. By analyzing fossils, researchers can piece together the puzzle of Earth's past, unveiling how ancient organisms lived and revealing the type of world in which they existed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.

Write a summary based on this article: Public Health      HIV Infections Rise Among Young Black Men In U.S.      i itoggle caption CDC CDC      The latest data on HIV rates in American teenagers and young adults offer a sobering message.      While the number of new infections in the U.S. is relatively stable — at about 50,000 people each year — HIV is on the rise in young people under 25.      Youths age 13 to 24 made up about a quarter of all new HIV infections in the U.S. during 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Tuesday. And more than half of the youths living with HIV don't even realize they're infected      The bottom line: 1,000 American teenagers and young adults become infected each month with HIV.      \\"Given everything we know about HIV and how to prevent it after more than 30 years of fighting the disease, it's just unacceptable that young people are becoming infected at such high rates,\\" CDC chief Dr. Thomas Frieden said Tuesday.      The upswing is driven largely by infections among young black men, who accounted for about 45 percent of new diagnoses in this age group.      Most infections occurred in men who have sex with men, the study finds. And, gay and bisexual high school kids were most likely to take part in risky behavior, such as having multiple sexual partners and injecting illegal drugs.      What's does the CDC say is needed to reverse the trend?      More testing for starters. Right now, only 13 percent of high school students get screened for HIV each year, despite the fact that both the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine testing for adolescents.      Frieden says it's also important that HIV-positive adolescents get antiretroviral drug treatment, which can lower their risk of spreading the virus to others.      Finally, the CDC plans to beef up education for kids about ways to protect themselves and avoid risky behavior.      \\"The AIDS epidemic seems very remote to young people,\\" Dr. Kenneth Mayer, the Director of HIV Prevention at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, told USA Today. \\"There is no equivalent of a young Magic Johnson. If you are young, this seems like a disease of old people.\\" ||||| The finding adds to the evidence that doctors need to routinely screen all patients for HIV.      A health educator conducts an HIV test. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) Story Highlights About 50,000 Americans are newly infected with HIV each year.      Many medical groups now recommend routine HIV testing for everyone ages 15 to 65      One-third of people with HIV are tested late and develop full-blown AIDS within a year of diagnosis      More than 30 years after the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, young people are again taking dangerous risks with their lives, according to a new report from the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention.      About 1,000 young people ages 13 to 24 are newly infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, each month, according to new data released for the first time.      About 60% of HIV-positive young people have no idea that they're infected, according to the report released Tuesday.      Young people ages 13 to 24 account for more than a quarter of the 50,000 new HIV infections each year, the CDC says. About 1.2 million Americans have HIV or AIDS.      \\"This is our future generation,\\" says CDC director Thomas Frieden. \\"That so many young people become infected with HIV each year is a preventable tragedy.\\"      Both the financial and human costs of these new infections are staggering, Frieden says. The lifetime cost of treating someone with HIV is about 400,000. That means these new infections add 4 million in new healthcare costs each month.      And while new HIV infections have leveled off among most groups, they are rising among young people, says Kevin Fenton, who leads the CDC's office on AIDS. Most of that increase is being driven by new HIV infections in young black men who have sex with men, he says.      The finding adds to the evidence that doctors need to routinely screen all patients for HIV, says Kenneth Mayer, medical research director of Boston's Fenway Health, a community health organization that provides AIDS services.      Last week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force endorsed routine HIV testing for everyone ages 15 to 65. The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics also call for routine screening, beginning in the teen years.      Yet only 13% of high school students have been tested for HIV, the report says. Frieden says doctors need to get the message that screening is essential. While the number of people who refuse an HIV test is very small, he says the number of doctors who fail to offer the test is great.      \\"They key here is to make it routine screening, just like we have cholesterol screening,\\" Frieden says. \\"If someone refuses, that is their right, but we should say this is what we do.\\"      Getting tested is the first step to treatment, which can dramatically improve patients' health and also prevent them from spreading the infection, Mayer says. People who know they're HIV-positive are less likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as sharing needles or having unprotected sex, studies show.      And people whose virus is under control, reduced to undetectable levels, are virtually incapable of spreading the infection to others, a finding that has led doctors to talk of \\"treatment as prevention.\\" Only 30% of those with HIV have their virus under control, however, due to a \\"cascade\\" of obstacles to care, including lack of insurance, poverty and other issues, Frieden says.      By getting more patients on treatment, Frieden says, the nation can reduce the total amount of AIDS virus in circulation, which would dramatically reduce the number of new infections, even if people didn't change their behavior. He adds that the country needs to do a better job of educating young people about AIDS and the need to change their behavior.      \\"It is astonishing the level of ignorance of basic physiology that many high school and middle school students have,\\" Frieden says. \\"There is not going to be an easy, quick, simple solution.\\"      Overall, 20% of all patients with HIV are unaware of their status, according to the CDC, and about one-third are diagnosed late in their infection, after having had HIV for perhaps a decade. A number of socioeconomic factors keep people from getting tested, including the stigma of AIDS, poverty and lack of access to care.      Young gay and bisexual men, along with African Americans, are disproportionately affected. About 72% of new HIV infections in this age group occur in men who have sex with men, and 57% occur among African Americans, the CDC says.      Mayer notes that there are really two AIDS epidemics in the USA. The first wave of HIV patients is aging and in care, and many have their disease under control. A second wave of newly infected young people — who weren't even born when AIDS burst into the national consciousness three decades ago — now often acts as if they're unaware of the tremendous risks they're taking, Mayer says.      According to the new CDC report, which interviewed high school students, young men who have sex with men are more likely than others to have had four or more sex partners and to have injected drugs. Among sexually active students, young gay or bisexual men were more likely to have used alcohol or drugs before their last sexual experience and were less likely to have used a condom. Young gay and bisexual men were less likely, however, to report being taught about AIDS or HIV in school, according to the CDC.      \\"The AIDS epidemic seems very remote to young people,\\" Mayer says. \\"There is no equivalent of a young Magic Johnson.

Veena ranks 73rd from the top in a class of 182 students. 2. There are 35 students who have failed. We need to find Veena's rank from the bottom, considering the failed students. Let's follow these steps: Step 1: Determine the total number of students who haven't failed. Since 35 students have failed, the total students who haven't failed = 182 - 35 = 147 students. Step 2: Find Veena's rank among the students who haven't failed. Since Veena ranks 73rd from the top, she is actually the 73rd person from the top who hasn't failed. Step 3: Determine Veena's rank from the bottom. We know that there are 147 students who haven't failed. So, if we take Veena's rank from the top (73rd) and subtract it from the total students who haven't failed (147) and add 1, we should get her rank from the bottom. Rank from the bottom = (Total students who haven't failed - Veena's rank from the top) + 1 Rank from the bottom = (147 - 73) + 1 = 74 + 1 = 75 So, Veena's rank from the bottom is 75, which corresponds to option d) 75."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The symptoms of infection were seen in the lungs but not the kidneys, as the  Pick from:  +lungs were prone to maladies.;  +kidneys were prone to maladies.;","output":"The symptoms of infection were seen in the lungs but not the kidneys, as the lungs were prone to maladies. This can be attributed to several factors such as anatomical, physiological, and environmental influences that make lungs more susceptible to infections and various diseases. Firstly, the lungs are anatomically designed to be exposed to the external environment. They are a primary component of the respiratory system, responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the blood. Due to this constant exposure to environmental particles, pathogens, and pollutants, the lungs are inherently more prone to infections and maladies as compared to the kidneys. The mucus lining in the lungs catches and removes some of these particles, but it may not be able to eliminate all harmful microorganisms. Secondly, the physiology of the respiratory system contributes to the vulnerability of the lungs. The human lungs have a large surface area that facilitates gas exchange, but it may also provide an ideal environment for the growth and multiplication of microorganisms. Additionally, the bronchial tree pattern is another physiological factor that can lead to the retention of particles and pathogenic agents within the lungs, making elimination and clearance difficult. On the other hand, the kidneys are not exposed directly to the external environment. They are part of the urinary system, performing vital functions such as filtering waste products and excess water from the blood to produce urine. Surrounded by a protective layer of fat and cushioned by other abdominal organs, kidneys are located higher up in the abdominal cavity, making them less vulnerable to infections when compared to the lungs. Furthermore, infections or maladies affecting the kidneys are mostly caused by the presence of harmful microorganisms in the blood or urinary tract, which may come from other parts of the body. Although urinary tract infections can occur, they usually involve the lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) rather than the kidneys themselves. When infections reach the kidneys, they are primarily due to the spread of existing infections from other sources in the body. Another factor that affects the lungs' vulnerability to maladies is the effect of various lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking, pollution, and occupational exposures. These factors significantly contribute to the lungs' vulnerability to infections and diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and lung cancer. In summary, the symptoms of infection were seen in the lungs but not the kidneys, as the lungs were prone to maladies due to their anatomical positioning, physiological characteristics, and constant exposure to various environmental agents. The kidneys, being more protected and less exposed, are less susceptible to infections and maladies as compared to the lungs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German border to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement. By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia. On 4 February, Soviet, British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan. In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B, while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany. Several changes in leadership occurred during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to indoor smoke leads to approximately 1.6 million deaths per year, primarily caused by respiratory illnesses, heart diseases, and lung cancer. This emphasizes the critical need for action by governments, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to devise effective strategies and policies to combat this crisis. Step 2: Collaborating to Develop Solutions The announcement of this global partnership demonstrates the firm commitment of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and partner countries to devise sustainable solutions to combat the scourge of toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires. By bringing together experts, policy makers, and researchers from multiple disciplines, this collaborative effort aims to identify the most effective and locally-appropriate interventions. Step 3: Implementing and Promoting Clean Cooking Technologies One pivotal aspect of the partnership's strategy is the promotion and implementation of clean cooking technologies. By replacing traditional, polluting cooking methods with cleaner alternatives, such as fuel-efficient stoves and solar cookers, families can significantly reduce their exposure to toxic smoke. Encouraging the use and development of these innovative technologies not only ensures their widespread adoption, but also helps boost local economies and increases energy security in resource-scarce areas. Step 4: Providing Education and Support Alongside technological solutions, the partnership also seeks to educate communities about the risks associated with indoor cooking fires and inform them of the benefits of clean cooking alternatives. Providing women with training and support in the use of clean cooking technologies is crucial to sustaining any long-term improvements in their health and well-being. Additionally, incorporating lessons on the importance of clean cooking and air quality into community health programs can raise awareness and further encourage the adoption of safer practices. Step 5: Evaluating and Expanding Efforts As part of the global partnership, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the implemented interventions will be essential to ensure the effectiveness of the efforts to combat toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires. By tracking the progress made and analyzing factors that contribute to successful outcomes, the partnership can refine its strategies and expand its efforts to reach even more communities in need. Conclusion The launch of the global partnership to tackle the scourge of toxic smoke from indoor cooking fires is a monumental step towards addressing the severe health hazards and environmental consequences caused by this pressing issue. Through a collaborative approach that combines technological innovation, education, and support, the partnership hopes to transform the lives of millions of people and contribute to the global effort to combat air pollution and climate change."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The plot is told as a series of (presumably chronological) vignettes surrounding the life of the namesake Mobile Army Surgical Hospital where it is set. While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Other characters arrive after Hawkeye and Duke, and become integrated into camp life, such as surgeon Trapper John and Nurse Margaret Houlihan. After the characters are introduced, which forms the opening act, further comedic episodes explore the evolving relationships between the characters. The main characters in the camp divide into two factions; Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper John form one faction; all three were drafted into the army and are not as dedicated to the mission or lifestyle of the military. They are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. The other faction forms around the romantic relationship between Majors Houlihan and Burns, who are both career military personnel. The two factions battle back and forth in a series of pranks and reprisals (one involving exposing a naked Houlihan to the camp when the walls of the shower tent are collapsed, another embarrassing the couple by exposing their heretofore secret romance) until Burns is goaded into punching Hawkeye and removed from the unit for...

Question: I have a new situation: The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues.  But I can use this background: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic.  What is an answer for this question: Which team had more people receiving interferon? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, we can determine that Team W, the team with many people infected with HIV, likely had more people receiving interferon. This is because interferon is an antiviral drug used to treat viral infections, and since Team W has more individuals with a viral infection (HIV), it is logical to assume that more people in this team would require treatment with antiviral drugs such as interferon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of exercising more regularly can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver's process of cleaning the blood. Direct effect: Exercise improves overall blood circulation which means more blood reaches the liver, providing sufficient oxygen and nutrients necessary for its functions. This ultimately makes the liver work more efficiently, resulting in a \\"softer\\" functioning process. Indirect effects: Exercise has broader systemic benefits for the body, including: 1. Weight management: Regular exercise helps in maintaining a healthy weight, reducing the risk of developing fatty liver disease and lessening the pressure on the liver. 2.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Understanding Pigments Different kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect the color of the wavelengths that they cannot absorb. All photosynthetic organisms contain a pigment called chlorophyll a, which humans see as the common green color associated with plants. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not from green. Because green is reflected, chlorophyll appears green. Other pigment types include chlorophyll b (which absorbs blue and red-orange light) and the carotenoids. Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is its absorption spectrum. Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; between them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider range of visible-light wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity decreases with depth, and certain wavelengths are absorbed by the water. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees block most of the sunlight (Figure 5.11).

Determining the truth of Sentence 2 given Sentence 1: - Since Sentence 1 verifies that films are usually dubbed into Spanish, it supports the claim in Sentence 2 that films are dubbed. - However, Sentence 1 does not provide any information about the reason behind dubbing films into Spanish. We cannot confirm the reason mentioned in Sentence 2 (the Spanish don't like reading subtitles) based solely on the information provided in Sentence 1. Conclusion: If the first sentence is true, it does not necessarily mean that the second sentence is true, since the reason for films being dubbed into Spanish is not addressed in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"A man fell out of his plane and fell back into it again.

He called the widow of Roger Maris a few days ago, a surprisingly bold move that surely resulted in one of the most awkward phone conversations this side of Bobby Kennedy-George Wallace. Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do. And, indeed, he was correct. Pat Maris deserved to hear the words \\"I juiced\\" straight from the artificially enhanced horse's mouth; deserved to know why she and her family had unwittingly served as his official cardboard props some 12 years ago; why her late husband's single-season home run mark (arguably the most hallowed standard in all of American sports) had been tattered by a man boasting all the integrity of a Times Square pickpocket. Think back, if you will, to September 8, 1998, when McGwire hit his record-breaking 62nd homer of the season at Busch Stadium, then immediately walked toward the stands to embrace the Maris children. Later, with tears streaming down his cheeks, McGwire told the media how, earlier that day, he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark. \\"I touched it with my heart,\\" he said. \\"When I did that, I knew tonight was going to be the night. I can say my bat will lie next to his, and I'm damn proud of it.\\" By all accounts, back then Pat Maris thought the large humanoid erasing her late husband from the record books to be an honorable fellow, one worthy of holding such a distinguished mark. And now? \\"I think she was shocked when I called,\\" McGwire said yesterday in his interview with Bob Costas  on the MLB Network. \\"She was disappointed and she has every right to be.\\" In case you haven't received the official memo, protocol dictates this as the time when we're supposed to forgive, forget and move forward. Yes, Mark McGwire used steroids and human growth hormone. Yes, it was against the law. Yes, they are termed performance-enhancing drugs for a reason. But in the world of Major League Baseball, where the phrase \\"manning up\\" is traditionally applied to an athlete playing through pain or putting on a particularly clutch display, a new, steroid-era definition has been established:. Manning Up (verb): When someone is caught cheating and, following a lengthy period of silence and/or denial, has no choice but to vaguely express remorse/regret or suffer unofficial banishment and a lifetime of Holiday Inn banquet room autograph shows for 15 a pop alongside Erin Moran and the robot girl from Small Wonder. The fawning sports media will immediately compliment his courage and welcome him back with open arms. So, like Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte and Alex Rodriguez before him, Mark McGwire finally \\"manned up.\\" Twelve years after shattering Maris' record, five years after his embarrassing, I'm-not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony, the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED, and that he was very, very wrong. Well, very wrong. Well, pretty wrong. Well, sorta wrong. Well, uh, not really wrong at all. Between the tears and sniffles and awkward pauses, McGwire apologized for, ahem, nothing. Costas asked whether he thought he would have hit 70 home runs without steroids. \\"Absolutely,\\" McGwire said. \\"I was given this gift by the man upstairs.\\" Costas asked whether the steroids made him stronger. \\"The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes,\\" McGwire said. \\"I did not take steroids to get any gain for any strength purposes.\\" Costas asked which drugs he had used. \\"The names,\\" McGwire said, \\"I don't remember.\\" Heck, Costas tossed the ultimate underhand softball question, just to help a guy out--Did McGwire feel as if he was cheating? \\"As I look back now as far as my health and my injuries, trying to help my injuries to help me feel normal, I can see why people would say that,\\" he said. \\"As far as the God-given talent and hand-eye coordination and the genetics I was given, I don't see it.\\" And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting: Mark McGwire doesn't see it. By using PED, he didn't merely take Maris' record. No, McGwire made millions in endorsements that should have gone elsewhere. He was selected to All-Star Games that should have featured other players. He won Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year as other candidates were overlooked. He convinced a nation of baseball fans that they were witnessing history--real, honest-to-goodness history--when, in fact, it was all a WWE-styled illusion. Pat Maris received her phone call. Will you be getting yours? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.

It highlights the fact that, despite his confession and apology, McGwire did not directly admit that steroids played a role in his record-breaking home run, and denied using them for strength purposes.

The contagious disease was passed to Brett and not Steven because  pick from the following. + Brett has a weak immune system. + Steven has a weak immune system.","output":"The contagious disease was passed to Brett and not Steven because Brett has a weak immune system. As the deadly virus spread through the city like wildfire, it became more apparent to the residents that no one was safe. Brett and Steven, two best friends, had taken numerous precautions to protect themselves and their families from the virus. They wore masks, practiced social distancing, and constantly washed their hands. However, despite all their efforts, tragedy struck when Brett came down with the illness. Brett had always been sickly and prone to a variety of ailments, largely due to his weak immune system. As a child, he would often catch colds and fevers, needing prolonged bedrest to recover. Through high school, as his peers participated in sports and other extracurricular activities, Brett would frequently be sidelined by recurrent infections. On the contrary, Steven possessed an incredibly robust immune system, one that left him rarely sick and always ready to take on new challenges. He and Brett were inseparable, their distinct personalities fitting together like two pieces of a puzzle. Steven often took it upon himself to help Brett during his frequent bouts of illness. The two families were neighbors and the the boys grew up doing everything together. As a result, when the virus threatened their small town, they had no qualms about teaming up to protect their loved ones. The families agreed to quarantine together, knowing they would need one another's support to navigate the challenges thrown by the pandemic. In the early weeks of the virus, Brett noticed that his energy levels were decreasing and his health seemed to be deteriorating. However, attributing his symptoms to the stress of the ongoing crisis, he brushed them off as insignificant. Days later, Brett spiked a high fever, and as his condition deteriorated, it became all too clear that he had contracted the virus. Steven, frantic with worry, used his knowledge of Brett's weakened immune system to help his friend battle the virus. He worked tirelessly, coordinating with doctors over video calls, administering recommended treatments, and maintaining a sterile environment to minimize further infections among the family members. Despite living in close quarters and interacting with Brett, Steven's strong immune system held out, and he remained infection-free. As the town continued to battle the outbreak, news spread of Brett's ordeal. The community rallied around the two families, offering support and prayers for Brett's recovery. Every day was a struggle, but Brett's determination and Steven's unwavering dedication provided hope that together, they could overcome this virus. Slowly but surely, Brett began to improve, bolstered by the love and support of his family, Steven, and the entire town. Brett's eventual recovery from the disease was nothing short of miraculous. The friends emerged from their ordeal closer than ever, their bond strengthened by adversity and the shared experience. Though they would never wish for such a life-altering event to be repeated, both Brett and Steven agreed that they had learned invaluable lessons about the power of friendship, resilience, and the will to fight against all odds. Their small town, like so many others around the world, continued to adapt and recover from the pandemic as people returned to some semblance of normalcy. Local organizations were established to help with the physical, mental, and emotional toll the virus had taken on the population, ensuring that its impact would not be forgotten. Despite the painful memories, Brett and Steven remained a beacon of hope for their community, proving that with determination, support, and love, seemingly insurmountable odds could be surmounted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The context provides information about the actresses, the show itself, and its duration, but it does not mention any specific details about their payment structure or bonuses. There are numerous factors that could determine whether the actresses received a bonus when the show concluded. For instance, their individual contracts might include clauses that mention bonuses or other financial incentives based on the success or longevity of the series. The network that aired the show might also have specific policies regarding bonuses for their acting talent. Additionally, the overall viewership and revenue generated by the show could impact whether the actresses received a bonus. In some cases, television actors might receive bonuses for meeting performance targets, critical acclaim, or successfully adhering to the terms of their contracts. Bonuses can also be awarded to teams or ensemble casts as a gesture of goodwill or to reward their contribution to a show's success.

As a result, there will be a reduction in the demand for industrial processes and a decline in business operations.

With fewer products being manufactured, industries will consume less energy and resources, leading to lesser emissions of chemical compounds. As the chemical compounds present in the air decrease, the subsequent steps of the process will also be affected indirectly. The reduced chemical compounds in the air will lead to a decrease in their mixing with the elements in the clouds. This can result in a decline in the production of acidic rain.

It is important to note that while the decrease in product consumption has not directly impacted any particular step of the process, the overall effect on the release of chemical compounds into the air and the subsequent steps is indirectly influenced.

For example, if you have very pale skin, you don't want something that is tanned or dark; it will look fake against your complexion. Instead, you could try ivory or something labeled \\"fair.\\" For example, if you have a black dress, then choose a pair of black tights or stockings. There is an exception to this rule, however; if your outfit is darker than the shoes you are wearing, choose nude-colored tights or stockings instead. The nude color should match the color of your legs, be it fair, neutral, Nubian, etc. For example, you are wearing black shoes, then you could wear black tights or stockings. You could also wear tights or stockings that are a little bit lighter than your shoes, but within reason. You don't want to wear white, opaque tights with black shoes.  If your shoes are darker than the skirt or dress you are wearing, then wear stockings that match your skin color instead. If you are wearing open-toed shoes, go sheer and nude-colored. It would be best to skip tights or stockings altogether, however. Avoid wearing black tights with brightly-colored shoes. The contrast is stark and often cartoonish.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Richard Hirschfeld Williams (May 7, 1929 - July 7, 2011) was an American left fielder, third baseman, manager, coach and front office consultant in Major League Baseball. Known especially as a hard-driving, sharp-tongued manager from 1967 to 1969 and from 1971 to 1988, he led teams to three American League pennants, one National League pennant, and two World Series triumphs. He is one of seven managers to win pennants in both major leagues, and joined Bill McKechnie in becoming only the second manager to lead three franchises to the Series. He and Lou Piniella are the only managers in history to lead four teams to seasons of 90 or more wins. In 1977, he returned to Montreal as manager of the Expos, who had just come off 107 losses and a last-place finish in the NL East. Team president John McHale and general manager Jim Fanning had been impressed with Williams' efforts in Boston and Oakland, and thought he was what the Expos needed to finally become a winner.  After cajoling the Expos into improved, but below .500, performances in his first two seasons, Williams turned the 1979-80 Expos into pennant contenders. The team won over 90 games both years--the first winning seasons in franchise history. The 1979 unit won 95 games, the most that the franchise would win in Montreal. However, they finished second each time to the eventual World Champion (the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980). Williams was never afraid to give young players a chance to play, and his Expos teams were flush with young talent, including All-Stars such as outfielder Andre Dawson and catcher Gary Carter. With a solid core of young players and a fruitful farm system, the Expos seemed a lock to contend for a long time to come.  But Williams' hard edge alienated his players--especially his pitchers--and ultimately wore out his welcome. He labeled pitcher Steve Rogers a fraud with \\"king of the mountain syndrome\\" - meaning that Rogers had been a good pitcher on a bad team for so long that he was unable to \\"step up\\" when the team became good. Williams also lost confidence in closer Jeff Reardon, whom the Montreal front office had acquired in a much publicized trade with the Mets. When the 1981 Expos performed below expectations, Williams was fired during the pennant drive on September 7. With the arrival of his easy-going successor Jim Fanning, who restored Reardon to the closer's role, the inspired Expos made the playoffs for the only time in their 36-year history in Montreal. However, they fell in heartbreaking fashion to Rick Monday and the eventual World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers in a five-game NLCS. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Sure, imagine baseball is like a big, fun game of catch and running bases in the park. Now, Richard Hirschfeld Williams was sort of like a really important dad in this game, who helped to look after and instruct the team on how to play their best. He was a strong, straight-talking kind of manager, who managed to lead his teams to win some important matches and championships. Think of it like your favorite team in a race. Williams was the person who encouraged and pushed his team to run really fast and cross the finish line, not just once or twice, but many times! He did this with three different teams, which is a great achievement.  But sometimes, he was a bit tough, like when you don't want to eat your veggies, and mom insists you do so. He was hard on some players, especially the ones who throw the ball, and that made them upset.  In the end, even though the team he managed didn't win the ultimate championship under his guidance, they did it just after he left, sort of like eating all your veggies and then getting a big ice-cream as a treat after he was gone!

Plot title: Fright Night II Movie plot: Three years after the first film, 20-year-old Charley Brewster, as a result of psychiatric therapy, now believes that Jerry Dandrige was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire. As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed. College student Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young, go to visit Peter Vincent, who is again a burnt-out vampire killer on Fright Night, much to the chagrin of Charley. While visiting Peter's apartment Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes drawn to one of the four, the alluring Regine. Charley drives Alex back to her dorm and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. An upset Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's vampires, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's group, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth, a bug-eating servant of Regine, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs. Later that night, Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day, Charley talks to his psychiatrist, Dr. Harrison, who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there, however, he sees his friend Richie with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood. Charley runs off to find Peter, and the two of them arm themselves with crosses and crash Regine's party. There, Charley finds Richie, but is shocked to find him alive and well, with no bite...

Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? I introduced her to he.","output":"By the strictest standards, a linguist would not consider the sentence \\"I introduced her to he\\" as correct in standard English based on the established grammar rules and sentence structure. In English, personal pronouns have different forms depending on their role in a sentence. There are three cases, namely, nominative (also known as subjective), objective, and possessive cases. Each of these cases has specific functions and rules. Nominative or subjective case pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) are used as the subject of a sentence, i.e., the person(s) or thing(s) performing the action of a verb. Objective case pronouns (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) are used as objects and are involved in receiving the action of a verb or are the object of a preposition. In the sentence \\"I introduced her to he,\\" the pronoun \\"he\\" is used as the object of the preposition \\"to.\\" According to the rules of English grammar, this position requires an objective case pronoun. As a result, the correct pronoun to use in this context should be \\"him.\\" So, to rewrite the sentence correctly, it should read: \\"I introduced her to him.\\" Linguists, as experts in the field of language, would apply these rules and agreed-upon conventions of standard English in evaluating the correctness of the sentence. Therefore, they would conclude that the original sentence \\"I introduced her to he\\" is not correct when adhering to the strictest standards of grammar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Rob was in the East Coast for a month. He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions.  and a hint : When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps.  Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.  Please answer this question : Which case would result in more extreme tidal conditions, case A or case B?","output":"To answer this question, let us analyze the tidal conditions of both cases (A and B) and relate them to the description provided for spring tides and neap tides. Case A - Rob observed the spring tide. Spring tides are characterized by: 1. High waters that are higher than average. 2. Low waters that are lower than average. 3. Shorter slack water time. 4. Stronger tidal currents than average. On the other hand: Case B - Rob observed the neap tide. Neap tides are characterized by less extreme tidal conditions. This means: 1. High waters that are not as high as during spring tides. 2. Low waters that are not as low as during spring tides. 3. Longer slack water time. 4. Weaker tidal currents than during spring tides. Now, let's compare both cases. Spring tides (Case A) exhibit more extreme tidal conditions, such as higher high waters and lower low waters, shortened slack water time, and stronger tidal currents. Neap tides (Case B) show less extreme tidal conditions compared to Case A.

Hypothesis: Santa Lucia is over 500 years old.","output":"Step 1: Analyze the context The context informs us that Santa Lucia is an ancient Roman Catholic church in central Bologna. The church is described as having a Baroque interior architecture and is currently being used as a large lecture hall by the University of Bologna. Step 2: Identify the relevant information The context mentions that Santa Lucia is an ancient Roman Catholic church. This piece of information is essential in estimating the age of the building. Step 3: Research the historical timeframes associated with the relevant information The Baroque period extended from the late 16th century to the mid-18th century, approximately between 1600 and 1750. The Roman Catholic Church has existed for over two millennia. Ancient Rome, as referenced in the context, can be considered a civilization existing from 753 BC to 476 AD.

O'Neill was born in a hotel, the Barrett House, at Broadway and 43rd Street, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square). A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. After suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinsons-like tremor in his hands which made it impossible for him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he had tried using dictation but found himself unable to compose in that way. While at Tao House, O'Neill had intended to write a cycle of 11 plays chronicling an American family since the 1800s. Only two of these, A Touch of the Poet and More Stately Mansions, were ever completed. As his health worsened, O'Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. He managed to complete Moon for the Misbegotten in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. Drafts of many other uncompleted plays were destroyed by Carlotta at Eugene's request.  O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University's Shelton Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: \\"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\\" Dr. Harry Kozol, the lead prosecuting expert of the Patty Hearst trial, treated O'Neill during these last years of illness. He also was present for O'Neill's death and announced the fact to the public.  O'Neill is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood.  In 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. This last play is widely considered to be his finest. Other posthumously-published works include A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967).

His career as a playwright spanned from around 1913 to 1943. Some of his notable works include: 1. Beyond the Horizon (1920), which was his first full-length play and won him his first Pulitzer Prize in 1920. 2. Anna Christie (1921), which won him a second Pulitzer Prize in 1922. 3. Long Day's Journey into Night, which was written in 1941 but not published or produced until 1956, after his death, and won him a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1957. 4. The Iceman Cometh (written in 1939, first produced in 1946). 5. A Moon for the Misbegotten (completed in 1943). As his health declined, O'Neill's ability to write diminished, and he passed away in 1953. Some of his other works, such as A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967), were published posthumously."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: the solution of the missing neutrino problem from the sun's core was resolved by the discovery of?? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the missing neutrino problem To answer this question, I must first understand the missing neutrino problem itself. The missing neutrino problem emerged when scientists noticed that the number of neutrinos detected on Earth was only a third of the number they expected to observe from the sun's nuclear fusion reactions. Step 2: Recall the neutrino properties Neutrinos are subatomic particles with a very small mass and no electric charge. They interact very weakly with other matter, making them difficult to detect. Neutrinos are produced during various nuclear reactions, including the ones inside the sun's core. Step 3: Identify the solution The solution to the missing neutrino problem came with the discovery of neutrino oscillations. According to the theory of neutrino oscillations, neutrinos can change their flavor (electron, muon, or tau neutrinos) as they travel through space. This change in flavor was not initially considered in the detection experiments, leading to the underestimation of the total neutrino count. Step 4: Summarize the answer The solution to the missing neutrino problem from the sun's core was resolved by the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which helped explain the discrepancy between the observed and expected number of neutrinos."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Bribery as a way of life in Greece has undermined the country, but attitudes might change. The phrase refers to the issue of corruption and bribery in Greece, which has negatively impacted the nation's political, social, and economic well-being. The situation poses a serious challenge to the public trust, individual morale, and the overall standing of the country in the international arena. This phenomenon is not unique to Greece, as corruption and bribery exist in various forms and degrees worldwide. However, the phrase suggests that this particular form of corruption in Greece has become ingrained as a way of life for some individuals. Historically, bribery has been a longstanding problem in different aspects of Greek society, including the public sector, the private sector, and even the healthcare industry. As public officials and other individuals engage in corrupt practices for personal gain, the nation and its people suffer the consequences. The adverse effects of these actions include slower economic growth, increased inequality, and the erosion of public confidence in the various institutions responsible for good governance. Despite the prevalence of bribery in Greece, there is hope for change, as attitudes and perspectives potentially evolve. Efforts to reduce corruption and bribery can be observed at both the grass-root level and governmental agencies. Measures such as implementing strict anti-corruption laws, raising awareness, and encouraging a culture of integrity and transparency contribute significantly to addressing this issue. Furthermore, organizations inside and outside Greece actively promote initiatives to combat corruption and bribery. These programs aim to strengthen the rule of law, support honest businesses, and encourage good governance by building capacity among relevant stakeholders. In conclusion, the phrase highlights the issue of bribery in Greece, emphasizing its negative consequences for the country's overall development. However, there is a possibility of change with shifts in attitudes and the implementation of preventive measures against corruption. Efforts from various sectors, individuals, and organizations can help create a system that upholds transparency, accountability, and integrity, ensuring a better future for Greece."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(I). no; (II). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"First, let's address each question individually: Question 1: Has anyone gotten a refund from Ramit Sethi's courses? Ramit Sethi is a recognized personal finance advisor and author, best known for his book \\"I Will Teach You To Be Rich\\" and his online courses related to personal development and business growth. Although I don't have access to specific customer experiences, there are testimonials available online from people who have participated in his courses and shared their feedback. In general, the satisfaction rate for his courses seems to be high, and many participants express appreciation for the content and the value they received from it. Like any other educational resource, the experience may vary depending on an individual's goals and commitment. Ramit Sethi's courses often come with a refund policy, which is usually mentioned on the course's sales page or terms and conditions. These policies may include money-back-guarantees within a specific timeframe (e.g., 30 or 60 days) or under specific conditions, like showing proof of having completed the coursework and still not achieving the desired outcomes. Although I cannot confirm specific instances of customers receiving refunds, it is reasonable to believe that some individuals have requested and received refunds if they were not satisfied with the course content or if they did not achieve the anticipated results within the specified time and conditions. Question 2: Has anyone received a refund from VIT? VIT refers to Vellore Institute of Technology, a renowned higher education institution in India. Being an educational institution, it is common for universities and colleges to have refund policies in place (though it depends on individual institutions and their specific policies). These policies may be applicable for various reasons, like withdrawal from the course, not being able to attend due to unforeseen circumstances, or not receiving a visa (for international students).  While I cannot provide specific examples of individuals who have received refunds from VIT, it is highly likely that some students have received refunds based on the refund policies in place. To determine if a refund is available for a particular situation, a student would need to consult the appropriate department or office at VIT to discuss their specific case and the institution's policies. Regarding whether the answers to these two questions would be the same (i.e., either both being 'yes' or both being 'no'), it is impossible to give an accurate response since Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT are two separate entities with different offerings and refund policies. In summary: 1. It is likely that some individuals have received refunds from both Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT based on their respective refund policies and individual circumstances. 2. The answers to the two questions may not necessarily be the same, as they refer to different entities and depend on differing contexts. For more accurate information, it is recommended to consult the respective customer support or administrative departments of Ramit Sethi's courses and VIT regarding their refund policies and procedures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what makes a river wider?\\" is \\"salinity\\", given that  clearing land can make a river wider?","output":"The right answer to the question \\"what makes a river wider?\\" is not solely salinity, as there are several factors that can contribute to the width of a river. Although salinity may have some indirect effects on river morphology, it is not the primary factor in determining a river's width. Clearing land, as mentioned in the question, is just one of the many factors that can impact the width of a river. Let's discuss some of the key factors contributing to the width of a river: 1. Discharge: Discharge is the volume of water in a river moving through a cross-section at a given time, typically measured in cubic meters per second (m³/s). A larger discharge typically tends to result in a wider river as the water needs more space to flow and transports more sediment, which forms and modifies river channels. 2. Erosion: Erosion is the natural process of wearing away and removing rock and sediment from the riverbed and banks. Hydraulic action, abrasion, and corrosion are types of erosion that occur in rivers. Over time, erosion can widen the riverbank through lateral erosion, by slowly removing material from the banks, causing them to recede. 3. Land use and human activities: Human factors, such as deforestation, agriculture, or urban development, can result in changes to the natural landscape. Clearing land, for example, can result in increased surface runoff and sedimentation, which can cause the river to widen by eroding more sediment from the riverbanks. 4. Geology and bedrock composition: Rivers flow over different types of rocks and alluvial deposits. Some rocks, like limestone and shale, are softer and more susceptible to erosion than other types, like granite or basalt. This also impacts the rate of erosion and, consequently, the width of the river. 5. Climate: Rainfall and seasonal variations play an important role in determining the volume and flow of a river. Rivers in regions with wetter climates will generally have higher discharges, which can lead to wider rivers as more water flows through the channel, causing additional bank erosion. 6. River gradient (slope): The slope of a river channel is a crucial factor in determining the velocity of the water and its erosive power. Steeper slopes result in higher river velocities and intense downcutting, creating deeper channels. Conversely, flatter river gradients have slower velocities, resulting in the development of meanders and lateral erosion which may cause the river to become wider. While salinity can have an indirect effect on rivers by influencing the vegetation in and around the river, as well as the types of species that live in the river, it is not the most crucial factor determining the width of a river. Factors like discharge, erosion, land use, geology, climate, and river gradient have much more significant impacts on the width of a river."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Flash is a male three-toed sloth who works at the Department of Mammal Vehicles (DMV) in the city of Zootopia. Flash plays a crucial role in a scene where the main characters, Officer Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, need to get information about a missing mammal's vehicle plate number. Knowing that the DMV is notorious for its slow service, they nevertheless turn to Flash for help. Upon arriving at the DMV, they find that the employees are all sloths, which ultimately makes their mission a test of patience. Flash, portrayed by Raymond S. Persi, is known for his excessively slow speed, both in movement and speech, true to the nature of his species. Throughout the scene, despite Judy's hurry, Flash takes his time to complete even the simplest tasks, leading to a comical and entertaining scenario. Eventually, Flash's slow demeanor gets the better of Nick, who cracks a joke and causes Flash to laugh for an extended period. This scene highlights an important aspect of Zootopia – the movie delves into real-life issues like stereotypes and prejudices, reminding audiences that they can be just as harmful and frustrating as Flash's slow speed. Despite being a relatively minor character, Flash quickly became a fan favorite due to his unique charm and crucial contribution to the movie's message.

The question asks about how much solar energy is captured by photosynthesis, while the statement describes the total amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet compared to non-renewable resources. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose. Although sunlight provides a vast amount of energy, photosynthesis is not 100% efficient. In fact, only about 3-6% of incident sunlight is converted into chemical energy through photosynthesis. The rest of the sunlight is either reflected back into the atmosphere, absorbed as heat, or utilized in other processes. Thus, the correct answer is option [II] no, because the statement given does not provide an accurate response to the question about how much solar energy is captured by photosynthesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The 30-mile road that runs through the mountains of Willie Valley makes most drivers' hands sweat. But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Valley hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine. But the higher they drove, the more slippery the road became. Rounding a sharp U-turn, Andersen saw a heavy truck off the road and immediately hit his brakes. In a minute, the car was going at 25 miles per hour down the mountain before falling down from a ten-foot dam into the extremely cold Logan River. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening that we were going fast into deep water,\\" remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken manager. Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her. \\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface. That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they rushed down into the water. Helping onto safety all the three children, they began to shout at the father, \\"Who else is in the car?\\" Andersen says respectfully, \\" _ .\\" Question: What might be the main cause of the car accident? - The bad weather. - The high dam. - The sudden brake. - The heavy truck. A:","output":"The main cause of the car accident appears to be the sudden brake. The article states that while navigating the mountain road, Andersen saw a heavy truck off the road and immediately hit his brakes. This suggests that Andersen's sudden reaction to the heavy truck led to a loss of control. The vehicle then started going downhill at an uncontrolled pace, traveled off the road, fell from a dam, and entered the Logan River. While weather conditions contributed to the slipperiness of the road, and the high dam and heavy truck were definitely components, it was the sudden braking that directly initiated the chain of events leading to the accident. The article does not indicate that the heavy truck directly interfered with Andersen's vehicle, or that the dam was an unusual or unexpected infrastructure on the road. As such, the most immediate and direct cause seems to be Andersen's abrupt braking."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What is the location of the temple built in the style that is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features in 1200? is inside the article: The modern interest in the Hoysalas is due to their patronage of art and architecture rather than their military conquests. The brisk temple building throughout the kingdom was accomplished despite constant threats from the Pandyas to the south and the Seunas Yadavas to the north. Their architectural style, an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, shows distinct Dravidian influences. The Hoysala architecture style is described as Karnata Dravida as distinguished from the traditional Dravida, and is considered an independent architectural tradition with many unique features.A feature of Hoysala temple architecture is its attention to exquisite detail and skilled craftsmanship. The tower over the temple shrine  (vimana) is delicately finished with intricate carvings, showing attention to the ornate and elaborately detailed rather than to a tower form and height. The stellate design of the base of the shrine with its rhythmic projections and recesses is carried through the tower in an orderly succession of decorated tiers. Hoysala temple sculpture replicates this emphasis on delicacy and craftsmanship in its focus on depicting feminine beauty, grace and physique. The Hoysala artists achieved this with the use of Soapstone (Chloritic schist), a soft stone as basic building and sculptural material.The Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117), the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu (1121), the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279), the temples at Arasikere (1220), Amruthapura (1196), Belavadi (1200), Nuggehalli (1246), Hosaholalu (1250), Aralaguppe (1250), Korvangla (1173), Haranhalli (1235), Mosale and Basaralu (1234)  are some of the notable examples of Hoysala art. While the temples at Belur and Halebidu are the best known because of the beauty of their sculptures, the Hoysala art finds more complete expression in the smaller and lesser known temples. The outer walls of all these temples contain an intricate array of stone sculptures and horizontal friezes (decorative mouldings) that depict the Hindu epics...., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The temple you are referring to is the Chennakesava Temple, which is located in Belavadi, Karnataka, India. It was built around 1200 AD and is a prime example of the Hoysala architectural style. This unique style, also known as Karnata Dravida, is recognized for its exquisite detail, intricate carvings, and skilled craftsmanship. Some other notable examples of Hoysala art include the Chennakesava Temple at Belur (1117 AD), the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu (1121 AD), and the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura (1279 AD).

Article: This is the most essential cooking technique you will need to know, so learn it as thoroughly as possible. You will heat a little oil in a wok or similar pan and cook food quickly over high heat.  You will usually need to slice the food or shred it into small pieces. Small pieces cook faster and more evenly, which is why they are suitable for this technique. The oil is added to the preheated wok. Fragrant ingredients are cooked after that, followed by the main ingredients. Add the sauce and spices immediately before the meat browns, then remove the meat and cook any vegetables. Even though stir-frying is the cooking technique most commonly associated with Chinese foods, if you want to master Chinese cuisine, you should also learn a few other frying techniques.  Quick stir-frying is similar to standard stir-frying, but you use a basic sauce to cook the ingredients instead of an oil. Flash-frying is also similar to stir-frying, but you use even higher heat to cook the food almost instantaneously. Meat is usually coated in eggs and starches to help contain the juices. Deep-frying is done in a heavy pot with a large amount of oil. This oil needs to be kept close to the smoke point throughout the cooking process, and the foods must be dry when submerged in the oil. The foods should also be cooked a little at a time and completely submerged. Paper wrapped deep-frying is similar to standard deep-frying, but small pieces of fish or meat are wrapped in cellophane before being submerged in the hot oil. Pan-frying or shallow frying is done with a small amount of oil and a low to moderate heat. Steaming is a fairly common technique and is often used when preparing lighter dishes without oil or sauce. For instance, you might prepare filled dumplings with a steamer. During the cooking process, the food must never come into direct contact with the boiling water below the steaming rack. Red cooking is fairly exclusive to Chinese cuisine. You would usually use it with large cuts of meat or poultry. During this method, you add dark soy sauce to the meat as it cooks, giving it a dark red tint. Usually, the dark soy sauce is added right after you add any water or stock to the wok. There are a handful of different cooking techniques used in Chinese cuisine that involve some form of boiling or simmering liquid.  Stews are fairly common, but most Chinese stews only have meat in them instead of meat and vegetables. Traditionally, these stews would be cooked in an earthenware pot over a slow charcoal fire, and the result is a thick stew with meat that is nearly like jelly in terms of tenderness. You may blanch or poach food. During this process, food is quickly cooked in boiling water or boiling stock. Blanched foods are only in the liquid for a few brief moments, while poached foods are cooked until done. Boiled foods are cooked in boiling water, as would be expected. Multiple-item boils involve several different ingredients being boiled together. Quick-stewing is a cross between stewing and boiling. Foods are quickly cooked in boiling water or stock. A thickener is then mixed in and the contents of the pot are brought to a boil until thickened. In addition to the actual cooking techniques used when preparing Chinese food, you should also be aware of various pre-cooking practices you might expect to run across. Marinating is the most important to know. Standard marinating is used for fruits and vegetables in Chinese cuisine, and involves soaking these ingredients in wine, soy sauce, vinegar, and various seasonings. Wine-steeping is a specific type of marinating that uses some form of wine.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/1/10/Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg/aid4005955-v4-728px-Cook-Chinese-Food-Step-18Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\\">Fair Use</a> (screenshot)<br>n</p></div>\\"}  Dry-marinating is usually done with meats.

Please answer the following question: Off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island swim masses of colorful tropical fish. Some of these fish will be caught and sold, ending up in aquariums around the world. Is the industry putting populations of the fish at risk? Scientists who have studied the Big Island fishery say it is well managed. Rules put in place more than 15 years ago have helped to protect the fish. Along 35% of the coastline, for example, fish collecting is banned. Two years ago, the state cut the number of fish species for the aquarium trade from hundreds to just 40. Conservationist Robert Wintner objects to the findings. Wintner, who owns snorkel shops across Hawaii, started the Snorkel Bob Foundation to protect the island's coral reefs . He says he simply doesn't see yellow tang  in the protected areas. \\"There should be millions of them,\\" he says. \\"Where are they?\\" Wintner says people believe the numbers in reports. But few people have actually dived into the coral reefs to see for themselves how many fish can be found there.

First and foremost, the phrase suggests a sense of praise or admiration for the film in question. When someone claims that something is \\"one of the best,\\" they are generally acknowledging its superiority or high quality compared to others in the same category. In the context of a film, this would indicate that it stands out among other films and delivers exceptional storytelling, visuals, acting, or other cinematic components. 2. The usage of the word \\"best\\" denotes a positive comparison. It implies that the film has surpassed many others and has reached a level of excellence. The term \\"best\\" is an inherently positive descriptor as it conveys that the film admirably meets or exceeds expectations. 3. The phrase also validates the film's worth and validates its creators' efforts and artistic choices. By labeling the film as \\"one of the best,\\" the speaker signals their appreciation and acknowledgement of the creative energy and talent involved in bringing the film to life. This recognition can be rewarding and encouraging for filmmakers, validating their hard work and potentially inspiring them to continue pursuing excellence in their craft. 4. Additionally, the phrase adds value to the film for potential viewers. Hearing that a film is \\"one of the best\\" can instill a sense of curiosity and eagerness to watch it.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: what place is mentioned first? Context: In 1901 the accession of Edward VII saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife Queen Alexandra had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as \\"the Marlborough House Set\\", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle époque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work. The answer is:","output":"The place mentioned first in the given context is the palace. It's stated that new life was breathed into the palace with the accession of Edward VII in 1901. Although the specific palace is not directly named at this first mention, further reading identifies this as Buckingham Palace, with mentions of its various sections like the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules, and galleries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other. They both convey the same basic meaning, with slight variations in word choice and structure. In both sentences, the main idea is that the URNG (Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca) was leading the leftist opposition in peace negotiations with the conservative Guatemalan government. In the first sentence, \\"The URNG led the left-wing opposition in peace negotiations with the conservative Guatemalan Government,\\" the term \\"left-wing\\" is used to describe the opposition. The second sentence, \\"The URNG led the leftist opposition in peace negotiations with the conservative Guatemalan government,\\" uses the term \\"leftist\\" to convey the same meaning. Moreover, the capitalization of the word \\"Government\\" in the first sentence is different from its lowercase form in the second sentence.

Please answer this question: What colour is the mineral rock malachite?","output":"Malachite is a mineral rock that is characterized by its striking green color, which can range from light to dark shades. Its name is derived from the Greek word \\"malache,\\" which means \\"mallow\\" - a plant known for its green leaves. This vibrant hue is primarily due to the presence of copper within the mineral's chemical composition. Malachite forms as a secondary mineral in the oxidation zones of copper ore deposits. Its chemical formula is Cu2CO3(OH)2, which reveals that it is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral. The presence of copper in the stone plays a significant role in producing the rich green color that is synonymous with malachite. The color variations in malachite can be attributed to the varying levels of copper content and the impurities present. The bands and patterns within the stone further enhance its visual appeal. These vivid green patterns and banding occur due to differences in the growth rates of the malachite crystals and differences in the concentration of copper ions. It is not uncommon to find malachite with alternating light and dark concentric circles, wavy lines, or irregular patterns throughout the stone. Some of the shades of green commonly observed in malachite include: 1. Light Green: This shade appears in samples where the copper concentration is lower, or the crystal growth is slower. It is also observed in areas with impurities that affect the brightness of the stone. 2. Medium Green: This shade generally represents the most common appearance of malachite and is usually the result of moderate copper concentration and crystal growth rates. 3. Dark Green to Almost Black: These darker shades can occur when the copper concentration in the mineral is high, or impurities interacting with the copper ions create a darker hue. In addition to its stunning color, malachite has been prized for thousands of years for its ornamental and decorative qualities. Artifacts made from malachite date back to ancient Egypt, where the stone was used for jewelry, amulets, and cosmetics. It was also highly valued by civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans, who believed it possessed protective and healing properties. Today, malachite is widely used as a gemstone, especially for beads, cabochons, and ornamental carvings. Its attractive patterns and rich green color make it ideal for use in jewelry design. Moreover, it is also considered a popular decorative stone used in architecture, sculptures, and other home décor items. However, it is essential to care for malachite items properly, as they are sensitive to heat, acids, and abrasive materials, which can cause the remarkable green color to fade or become damaged. In summary, the mineral rock malachite is characterized by its vibrant green color, which can range from light to dark shades. The presence of copper within the mineral, along with varying concentrations and impurities, can create the diverse tones and patterns observed in this eye-catching gemstone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paul Dolan, Professor of Behavioral Science at the London School of Economics, said that people only feel _ in bad weather because they think about it too much. Studies have shown that people who live in warm, sunny climates are no happier than those in chilly, wet climates, he says. So the British talking about the weather may be making us gloomier  than the weather itself.

He claimed that humans are actually very good at being able to get over tragedy and loss.

Additionally, the battery life was subpar, lasting only 4 hours on a single charge, which is far below the industry standard for wireless headphones. This makes it inconvenient to use them on long trips or for extended periods of listening. The comfort of the headphones was also an issue. After just 30 minutes of use, I found the earpads to be quite uncomfortable and they put pressure on my ears, making it unbearable to wear them for extended periods of listening.

TEXT:So many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so I duly responded. Here are some remarks.. Vanessa Redgrave is great even while lying in bed. She also looks very old and I don't think this is achieved with much make-up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema-goers. I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years. Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth. Mamie Gummer's resemblance to her mother Merly Streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that I lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance. She is surprisingly good; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor. I agree with a previous comment: Natasha Richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face. She certainly does not look like how I remember her from previous films (\\"Nell\\" for example.) Both she and Toni Collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters. Their interplay is weak. Toni Collette additionally is way too old for her character. Glenn Close and Meryl Streep had to have more screen time. Streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo. Her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film. Eileen Atkins provides some welcome dry wit, especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to Redgrave's character. As for the men; Hugh Dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed. As a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag. It is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer. Patrick Wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film. He also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people (one of them a man) are so much smitten by this man. The backstory to this should have been developed more. The cinematography is excellent as expected. However the main summer house set failed to convince me. It does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill, particularly with its grass patch in the front. A bit too cardboard like. Overall, the film is a classy production, but a seen-it-all-before, cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that I expected from a tearjerker. However, it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time, about one's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not.

Teacher:In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot and a question. You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: The film opens to the sound of a gramophone playing Axxon N, \\"the longest-running radio play in history\\". Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the \\"Lost Girl\\", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girlâs television displays a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are laugh track responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout Inland Empire.The main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace (Dern), who has applied for a comeback role as Sue in a film entitled On High in Blue Tomorrows. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman (Zabriskie) who says she is her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, \\"caused evil to be born.\\" The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, \\"discovers a palace.\\" The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler (Ian Abercrombie) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek (Peter J. Lucas) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk (Theroux) receive an interview on a talk show. The host (Ladd) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them respond negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart (Irons). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled 47. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.Immersed in her character, while the film is being shot, \\"Sue\\" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / \\"Billy\\". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked Axxon N, and enters. It leads her back to soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the roomââshe herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy (possibly her husband in the film's story, but this is never made clear). Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, \\"Billy.\\"At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's \\"Smithy\\" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.Prior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billyâs wife tells a policeman that she had been hypnotised to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in ÅÃ³dÅº during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, \\"Who is she?\\" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and \\"say whether you've known me before.\\" In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her childhood sexual abuse, disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be \\"good with animals.\\" There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced sheâs being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.Finally, Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard, and is startled to see her doppelgÃ¤nger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her \\"no more blue tomorrows.\\" Off-camera, Kingsley yells \\"Cut!\\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only On High in Blue Tomorrowsâencompassing some of the subplots of the filmâbut events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked \\"Axxon N\\". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.Nikki flees into a nearby roomâRoom 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.Nikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski, and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, \\"Sweet!\\" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone's \\"Sinner Man\\" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat., Question: What type of animal is present at Nikki's house at the end of the movie, accompanying Niko, the woman with the blond wig?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

They argue two thirds of injuries in youth rugby and most concussions are down to tackles and urge schools to move to touch and non-contact rugby. Supporters say rugby builds character and other forms are less challenging. The concerns have been raised as a seven-year programme headed by the Rugby Football Union is on target to introduce rugby to a million children in state schools across England. The RFU's programme, which began in 2012 and is running until 2019, has so far reached 400 schools, with 350 to follow. But, in their letter to ministers, chief medical officers and children's commissioners in England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, doctors say the risks for players aged under 18 are high. They say many secondary schools in the UK deliver contact rugby as a compulsory part of the physical education curriculum from the age of 11. \\"The majority of all injuries occur during contact or collision, such as the tackle and the scrum,\\" the letter says. \\"These injuries, which include fractures, ligamentous tears, dislocated shoulders, spinal injuries and head injuries can have short-term, lifelong and life-ending consequences for children.\\" The doctors say concussion is a common injury, and they highlight a link between \\"repeat concussions and cognitive impairment and an association with depression, memory loss and diminished verbal abilities\\". One of the signatories of the open letter is Prof Allyson Pollock, from Queen Mary University of London, who has long campaigned about the dangers of rugby. She said evidence collected over 12 years showed rugby players up to the age of 18 or 19 had a 28% chance of getting injured over a season of 15 matches. \\"If you're thinking of a million children playing every year with this risk of injury you're looking at 300,000 extra injuries a year, including up to 100,000 concussions,\\" she said. She added that 90% of injuries resulted in more than seven days lost from school. There are various forms of touch or tag rugby, in which tackles are replaced by touching a player or removing a tag from their clothing. Aspects of rugby such as scrums and rucks are also excluded from these forms of the game. Jonny Cross, a PE teacher at Congleton High School in Cheshire - where rugby is compulsory from the age of 11 - says the sport provides a challenge. Mr Cross says children wear gum-shields and are taught how to maintain the proper posture in scrums to avoid injury, a technique known as \\"tower of power\\". \\"Contact rugby helps build character. They are putting their body on the line in a match. The risk factor is part of it,\\" he says. \\"They enjoy the contact element. There is a 'boy factor' - it's partly about developing masculinity. They would be more likely to be bored by touch rugby. \\"I would say that some students need it.  It provides a challenge, where challenge is being taken out of everyday life.\\" Parents and pupils on tackling in rugby The RFU and the Welsh Rugby Union both said they took player safety \\"extremely seriously\\" but that rugby was a \\"fantastic sport for children\\" which offered many benefits for society. The Scottish Rugby Union said it was \\"committed to player welfare at every level of the game\\" but pointed out that every sport carried \\"an element of risk\\". South African schools allow tackling, as do schools in Australia - although there has been a recent push to make children wear protective headgear, but this is not compulsory. In New Zealand, tackling is permitted, but in some schools it is banned in lunchtime games that are not being supervised. Former England rugby player Matt Perry said: \\"I took a risk when I started rugby at seven and I'm afraid at school level if that tackle is taken out we've lost one of the great games and one of the great cultural games.\\" Former England international Brian Moore dismissed the evidence in the letter as \\"flawed\\" and \\"partial\\". Obesity would kill more children than rugby, he said. \\"If you want to ban things, you've got to do it on the right basis.\\" The Association for Physical Education said contact versions of the game should be introduced and managed only by \\"suitably experienced staff\\" following recognised guidelines. \\"Parents should be aware of what sports are taught in the schools they choose to send their children to - if rugby is taught, then parents send their children to the school in the knowledge that they are likely to be asked to play rugby at some level,\\" it added. A spokesman for the Department for Education in England said: \\"Team sports, such as rugby, play an important role in developing character. \\"We expect schools to be aware of the risks associated with sporting activities and to provide a safe environment for pupils.\\"","output":"Some doctors are worried that kids who play rugby might get hurt because of how the game involves a lot of tackling and collisions. They think it would be better for schools to teach touch rugby instead, which doesn't have tackling. Rugby supporters argue that the traditional version of the game helps kids build their character and overcome challenges. Rugby organizations say they care about player safety but also think that rugby is a great sport for kids to play and has many benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Creatine kinase Creatine kinase (CK), also known as creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or phosphocreatine kinase, is an enzyme (EC 2.7.3.2) expressed by various tissues and cell types. CK catalyses the conversion of creatine and utilizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to create phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This CK enzyme reaction is reversible and thus ATP can be generated from PCr and ADP. Is this statement correct \\"is a cpk the same as a ck\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"is a CPK the same as a CK\\" is correct. Creatine kinase (CK) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are two names for the same enzyme. Creatine kinase plays an essential role in energy metabolism in muscle and nerve cells. It is found in various isoenzymes in tissues such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain. The different isoenzymes are CK-MM (Muscle type), CK-MB (Myocardial bound type), and CK-BB (Brain type). The primary function of creatine kinase is to maintain ATP levels in energy-demanding cells by catalyzing a rapid and reversible reaction, as follows: Creatine + ATP ⇌ Phosphocreatine + ADP In this reaction, creatine kinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to creatine, producing phosphocreatine and ADP. Phosphocreatine serves as a high-energy reserve in cells and can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP, regenerating ATP. This process occurs mainly in muscles during contraction and in nerve cells when energy demands are high. The CK enzyme levels can be measured in the blood, and elevated levels often indicate muscle damage or injury. For instance, CK-MB isoenzyme is often assessed in patients with suspected myocardial infarction (heart attack), as its elevation in the bloodstream can signify damage to cardiac muscles. However, it is important to note that elevated CK levels are not exclusive to myocardial infarction, and other factors like intense exercise and certain medications can also result in increased CK levels. In summary, creatine kinase (CK) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are two names for the same enzyme involved in energy metabolism, particularly in muscle and nerve cells. The primary role of CK/CPK is to catalyze the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between creatine and ATP, allowing for rapid energy transfer in high-energy-demanding cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

The Power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang-Soo's second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film, including the multiple connected narratives (in this case, two), and stories of troubled or troubling relationships, as well as a potent dosage of irony. One thing that's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein. The two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with her friends, only to find herself drawn to a stranger, the second about a man who also goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes. Again, Hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet I don't think he's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters, drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony. I think the think I've come to love about Hong's films is that they just feel so real, especially the complex and conflicted characters. Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings, but rather, that these characters he and the actors present, feel fully developed and believable. This is not a fast moving film. There's a lot of lingering and like the previous film, things don't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways. There doesn't appear to be any element of the film that isn't intentionally placed in the film and it's made my a little hyper-aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses. Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion, regret, longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision-making. It's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row. Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear. This film doesn't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does, but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision.

How does the sentence end? The man tried to put the rock into the aquarium but the","output":"rock was too large, and it ended up displacing a significant amount of water, causing quite a mess. When the man initially conceived the idea to introduce the rock into the aquarium, he believed it would be a valuable addition to the underwater environment he had so carefully crafted for his fish. Known for their aesthetic appeal and natural aesthetic contributions, rocks are commonly used in aquariums to emulate the fish's natural habitat, provide hiding spots for the more timid species, and to anchor plants and decorations. As the man attempted to gently place the rock into the aquarium, he quickly began to realize that its size was much larger than he had initially anticipated. Given that the rock occupied a significant portion of the limited space available within the confines of the tank, the displacement of water became a significant issue. As the rock continued its descent, the water level within the aquarium rose steadily and rapidly, much to the man's increasing dismay. Unprepared for such an event, he found himself unable to prevent the impending deluge. Water spilled out from the tank, sloshing onto the surrounding surfaces and creating slippery puddles on the floor. The man found himself in a precarious situation, both frustrated and concerned for the well-being of his aquatic companions. Desperate to avert a complete disaster, the man quickly removed the rock from the aquarium, causing another wave of water to spill out and exacerbate the already messy situation. After assessing the damage and concluding that his fish were unharmed, the man couldn't help but feel a sense of relief mixed with embarrassment over his miscalculation in judgment. In the aftermath of the ordeal, the man took great care to clean up the mess, mopping up the water that had soaked the surrounding area and wiping down any surfaces that had gotten wet. With the aquarium now safe and secure, and the fish no worse for wear, the man decided it would be wise to conduct more thorough research on suitable rocks and aquarium design before undertaking any similar endeavors in the future. As the sun set and the room grew dim, the fishes swam peacefully in their watery world, unaware of the tumultuous events that had transpired that day — a testament to the resilience of nature and the well-intentioned, if somewhat clumsy, actions of a dedicated and caring aquatic enthusiast. Ultimately, the man learned an important lesson in planning, preparation, and attention to detail, and the aquarium remained a thriving and cherished part of his home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When he looks back at the bonfire, the bonfire is (A) brighter (B) dimmer  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"distant bonfire\\" and  \\"close bonfire\\". Answer:","output":"When Aiden walks away from the bonfire and into the woods at night, the bonfire he looks back at would appear as a \\"distant bonfire.\\" This is because, as he moves further away from the bonfire, the light from the fire would appear to be dimmer compared to when he was closer to it.  The perception of the bonfire's brightness changing is due to the Inverse Square Law, which states that the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of light. In simpler terms, as the distance between Aiden and the bonfire increases, the amount of light that reaches him decreases.  When Aiden was close to the bonfire, he was receiving more of the light energy emitted by the fire. As he moves away from the bonfire, the intensity of the light reaching him diminishes because the light is spread over a larger area. This makes the bonfire seem dimmer as he moves further into the woods. Other factors like ambient lighting, the presence of smoke, or the presence of trees and other obstacles between Aiden and the bonfire could also slightly alter his perception of the brightness.  Additionally, our eyes adapt to different lighting conditions, which can affect our perception of brightness. When Aiden moves into the woods, his eyes have to adjust to the darker environment, making the bonfire appear even dimmer when he looks back.  In conclusion, when Aiden walks away from the bonfire and into the woods at night, he would perceive the bonfire as a \\"distant bonfire\\" due to the decreased intensity of the light reaching him and his eyes adapting to the darker environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm. The coelom lies between the digestive cavity and body wall. You can see it in the invertebrate in Figure below . Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) and annelids (Phylum Annelida).   Q: What is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm called?   A: Answer:","output":"The fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm is called a coelom. A coelom is a significant evolutionary development in animals, providing several physiological advantages. It lies between the body wall and the digestive cavity, serving to house and protect the internal organs. It also provides the organisms with flexibility and eases their movements. Many modern invertebrates contain a coelom. These include species belonging to Phylum Mollusca and Phylum Annelida. Mollusks, for instance, include animals such as snails, octopuses, and clams. They typically have a soft unsegmented body and usually have a hard shell, either exterior or interior. Their coelom performs numerous functions including accommodating the heart, gonads, and parts of the excretory system. Annelids, on the other hand, include species like earthworms or leeches. They have segmented bodies, each of which contains a portion of the coelom. The coelomic fluid within these segments helps maintain the body structure of the annelid, allows for storage and transport of nutrients and waste products, and also assists in their locomotion. One should note that the presence of a coelom is a characteristic feature of higher order, more complex animals and is not present in simpler organisms. The evolution of the coelom is seen to have played a significant role in the advancement and diversification of animal body plans and complexities. Thus, the coelom, this fluid-filled body cavity enclosed by mesoderm, is quite an important structure in the study of animal anatomy and evolution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you don't naturally have back dimples at all, the only way to get them is with cosmetic surgery. This is accomplished by removing fat from the areas where you would like the dimples to appear. Traditionally, this is done with liposuction, in which a needle is inserted under the skin and a little bit of fat is suctioned out.  The liposuction procedure used specifically to create back dimples may go by a variety names, including V-spot treatment, Dimples En V, or Barbie Back surgery. This type of liposuction is usually performed under local anesthesia. Possible risks of liposuction include numbness around the liposuction site, infection of the skin, bleeding, or fat embolism (a blood vessel blockage caused by a loose piece of fat). Deoxycholic acid (Kybella) can be injected under the skin to dissolve fat without damaging the surrounding tissues. Targeted injections can be used to simulate back dimples. Deoxycholic injections require less downtime and are less expensive than liposuction, but you may need several treatments to get the results you want.  Common side effects of Kybella injections include swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness, and hardening of the tissue around the injection. Kybella is only FDA approved for treatment of fat below the chin. However, cosmetic practitioners may still legally use it for off-label uses, such as creating back dimples. Cosmetic surgery to create back dimples can be extremely expensive. If you go the liposuction route, you could be looking at around 6000 USD. While a single treatment with Kybella costs less than liposuction, you may need multiple treatments. Because of this, Kybella can add up to about the same or even more than what you would pay for liposuction. Most insurance plans will not cover the costs of these types of procedures, so you will almost certainly have to pay the whole cost out of pocket.","output":"This article discusses acquiring back dimples through cosmetic surgery, specifically using liposuction techniques or deoxycholic acid injections (Kybella), with both options posing potential risks, side effects, and expenses, as they are not typically covered by insurance plans."},{"instruction":"Question: Process: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion -   Question: suppose more digestion occurs happens, how will it affect LESS digestion occuring.
