I shouldn't have pushed myself to drive when I was already tired. It was a terrible decision, and I'm just grateful that everyone is okay,\\" Dad said, his voice filled with regret. Mom was quick to reassure him and said, \\"We all make mistakes, honey. The important thing is that we're safe and together now.\\" Manny was too engrossed in his Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! cartoon to pay any attention to what was happening. It was almost as if he found comfort in the familiar characters and their adventures. I couldn't blame him though; cartoons can be a great distraction from reality. Meanwhile, Rodrick was busy showing off his latest creation - a video game called \\"Loded Diper: The Game.\\" It seemed like his mind was always buzzing with ideas, and even a car crash couldn't dampen his creative spirit. Personally, I thought the name was pretty cheesy, but what do I know about video games? As Dad slowly recovered and started to regain his strength, the atmosphere in the hospital room began to lighten up. We spent the day chatting, playing games, and trying to take our minds off the accident. There was no denying that we were all shaken up, but gradually, laughter and normalcy returned. Later in the day, Mom received a call from the nurse, asking her to accompany them to the nearby toy store. She thought it would be a good opportunity to pick up some toys and games to keep us entertained during our time in the hospital. Before she left, I caught a glimpse of her worried expression. I knew deep down she was still concerned about Dad's recovery, just like the rest of us. But she masked it well, putting on a brave face for all of us. As Mom and the nurse left, I realized I knew exactly why Dad had pushed himself so hard to take us on this impromptu road trip. He simply wanted to create unforgettable memories and spend time together as a family. Even though it ended in a car crash, I couldn't fault him for his intentions. I hope that when we finally make it back home, we'll look back at this trip and remember the times we laughed, played games, and supported one another through a challenging time. Family is all about coming together in both good and bad times, and I'm grateful for moments like these that remind us of that. Now, in the hospital room, with Dad slowly recovering and the rest of us finding ways to pass the time, I can't help but feel a sense of resilience.

Stay tuned."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where Manny has a plush of Wubbzy, and Rodrick publishes his game on Roblox, but BANS Guests","output":"Tuesday It seems like Manny's obsession with \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" has reached new heights. Mom came back from the toy store with a plush of Wubbzy, and Manny clung onto it as if it was his most prized possession. He carried it everywhere, talking to it and even making it dance along to the theme song of the show. It was both adorable and slightly concerning. As for Rodrick, he took his video game, \\"Loded Diper: The Game,\\" to a whole new level. He proudly announced that he had published it on Roblox, a popular online gaming platform. He was beaming with excitement as he invited us to try out his creation. I must admit, I was curious to see what Rodrick had come up with. We gathered around the computer, and he showed us the intense zombie-fighting gameplay he had designed. It actually looked pretty decent, with detailed graphics and challenging levels. But then he dropped the bombshell - he had decided to ban all Guests from playing his game. Guests were the default avatars for players who hadn't created an account yet. Rodrick had some sort of grudge against them and insisted that only registered users should be allowed to experience his masterpiece. Needless to say, this decision didn't go down well with the rest of us. I told Rodrick that it was unfair to exclude non-registered players who might have been looking forward to trying his game. But he just shrugged it off, claiming that Guests always caused trouble and brought down the overall experience for everyone else. Mom, who had returned from her toy store trip just in time for this discussion, intervened. She reminded Rodrick that inclusivity and fairness were essential values, and that he should consider reopening the game to all players. Rodrick grumbled but reluctantly agreed to think about it. In the meantime, Manny continued to outpour his affection for Wubbzy. He found comfort in the plush toy's softness and its resemblance to his favorite cartoon character. It was his constant companion during our hospital stay, and honestly, it seemed to be bringing him a lot of joy. At least it was helping him cope with the unexpected turn of events. As the days ticked by in the hospital, I couldn't help but ponder the rollercoaster of emotions we had experienced since the car crash. We had gone from fear and uncertainty to relief and now a mix of excitement and disagreement. Life certainly had a way of throwing unexpected twists our way, but no matter what, we were still a family, figuring things out together. Wednesday, I'll share more about our adventures in the hospital and how we're finding moments of happiness amidst it all.

The doctors had determined that Dad had made enough progress in his recovery to continue healing in the comfort of our own house. With a mix of relief and slight apprehension, we packed up our belongings and bid farewell to the hospital. It felt good to leave those sterile white walls behind and breathe in the fresh air outside. As we settled back into the car, ready to embark on the journey home, Rodrick revealed some distressing news. He received an email notification on his phone informing him that his Roblox account had been banned for \\"discrimination.\\" Unbeknownst to him, his decision to exclude Guests from playing his game had caused a uproar within the Roblox community. Dad let out a deep sigh and shook his head, clearly disappointed. \\"Rodrick, I've always told you, discrimination of any kind is never right. You can't exclude people based on whether they have an account or not. Everyone deserves a fair chance to play and enjoy your game.\\" Rodrick muttered something under his breath, clearly regretting his earlier stance. He didn't respond, but his face showed a hint of remorse. I could tell that he had learned a valuable lesson about the importance of inclusivity and empathy. Despite Rodrick's ban, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. It was a wake-up call for him to think more about the impact of his actions on others. Perhaps this experience would guide him to approach future projects with a more considerate mindset. As we pulled up to our house, it felt both familiar and new after our time away. We stepped through the front door, with the weight of the past few days finally lifting off our shoulders. It was good to be back in the comfort and safety of our own home. Manny, still clutching his beloved Wubbzy plush toy, looked around with wide eyes. He seemed relieved to be back in a familiar environment, away from the sterility of the hospital. Mom and Dad exchanged a glance, silently acknowledging the resilience our family had shown throughout this whole ordeal. While the car crash had been terrifying and the hospital stay challenging, we had come out of it stronger and more united. We settled back into our routines, with a newfound appreciation for the simplest of things – like sitting together at the dinner table, laughing and sharing stories. The crash had reminded us of the fragility of life and how important it was to cherish the moments we had together. Thursday marks a new beginning as life slowly returns to normalcy.

Let me explain how this approach guarantees finding the door with the money: 1. Scenario 1: If the money is behind Door 1 - Since James' answers are random and we asked Door 1 if the money is behind Door 2, the answer could be either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No.\\" If the answer is \\"No,\\" the money must be behind either Door 1 or Door 3. Then, when we ask Door 2 if the money is behind it, it will say \\"No\\" (since it's known that Door 1 has the money), and we can confidently choose Door 1. If the answer to the first question is \\"Yes,\\" it means Door 2 has the money, and when we ask Door 2 if it has the money, it will reply with \\"Yes.\\" Therefore, we again successfully identify the door with the money. 2. Scenario 2: If the money is behind Door 2 - Similar to the first scenario, the answer given by Door 1 to the first question will determine whether the money is behind Door 1 or Door 3. In either case, when we ask Door 2 if it has the money, it will always reply with \\"Yes\\" (since it's known that Door 2 has the money). Therefore, we can correctly identify the door with the money. 3. Scenario 3: If the money is behind Door 3 - This scenario is the same as Scenario 1, but with Door 3 being the door with the money. The answers obtained when asking the questions to Door 1 and Door 2 will allow us to confidently identify Door 3 as the door with the money. In all scenarios, the specific questions allow us to eliminate possibilities and identify the door with the money using only three questions, regardless of James' random answers."},{"instruction":"What if door 1 is James?

In that case, we need to modify the approach to accommodate the randomness of James's answers. Here's an updated strategy: 1. Ask any door, \\"Are you James?\\" If the answer is \\"Yes,\\" you have found James. Move to the next step. If the answer is \\"No,\\" you can assume that Door 1 is James. 2. Ask Door 1 (James) a random yes or no question that helps you determine which door leads to the money. For example, you can ask, \\"Is the money behind an odd-numbered door?\\" Make note of Door 1's response. 3. Now, select Door 2 and ask it, \\"If I asked you, 'Is the money behind your door?'\\" Depending on the response, you will either choose Door 2 or Door 3 as the potential door with the money. 4. Finally, ask the chosen door, \\"Is the money behind your door?\\" If the answer is \\"Yes,\\" select that door as the one with the money.

Start by asking any of the doors, \\"If I asked you which door leads to the money, would you say it's Door 1?\\" This question helps us establish a baseline for each door's response. Make a note of the answer. There are three possible scenarios: - Scenario 1: If the door is James, it will give a random answer that is either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No.\\" Move to Step 2. - Scenario 2: If the door is not James, and it gives a \\"No\\" answer, we can safely assume that Door 1 is not James.

In this case, select another door and repeat Step 1 to verify a consistent pattern in their answers. 2. Ask any door, \\"If I asked you which door leads to the money, would you say it's Door 2?\\" Make a note of the answer. 3. Ask the remaining door (if not already identified as James), \\"If I asked you which door leads to the money, would you say it's Door 3?\\" Make a note of this answer as well. 4.

Wow! Wubbzy!, and Rodrick has developed a video game about fighting zombies, For some reason he named it after his band, He named it \\"Loded Diper: The Game\\". Write the next day when Dad wakes up and apologises, Rodrick publishes his game on Roblox but bans Guests, Mom says this is \\"discrimination\\"","output":"Monday Today was a rollercoaster of emotions. Dad finally woke up from his unconscious state early in the morning. He must have been disoriented because the first thing he did was apologize to all of us for the car crash. His words were filled with remorse, and we could see the guilt in his eyes. We assured him that accidents happen and that we were just grateful that everyone was going to be okay. While Dad was recovering and resting, Rodrick had some exciting news to share. He had finished developing his video game, \\"Loded Diper: The Game,\\" and decided to publish it on Roblox. As a big fan of his band, I was curious to see how the game turned out. Rodrick took some time to show me the gameplay, and I must admit, it was surprisingly fun and addictive. He even managed to incorporate some of his own music into the game, which added a nice touch. However, I noticed that he had banned guests from playing the game. As we were discussing Rodrick's game, Mom overheard our conversation and chimed in. She mentioned that banning guests from playing the game felt like a form of discrimination. Mom has always been passionate about equality and fairness, so it wasn't surprising that she spoke up about it. Rodrick defended his decision, explaining that he wanted to create a safer environment for real players. He didn't want trolls or hackers ruining the experience for others. It was an ongoing debate between Rodrick and Mom, but I had a feeling that they would eventually find a middle ground. In the midst of all this chaos, Manny continued to obsess over his newfound love for the cartoon \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" It was all he talked about, and he even started imitating the characters' voices. It was both amusing and slightly annoying, but we knew it was just a phase that he would eventually outgrow. Overall, today served as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of life. One minute, we were on an unexpected road trip, and the next, we found ourselves in a hospital. It was a testament to our resilience as a family, and despite the setbacks, we were determined to make the best of the situation."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where he said it took 5 hours to clean the journal","output":"Tuesday Cleaning my journal turned out to be quite a painstaking task. With the journal soaked in blood from the accident, it took me nearly five hours to get it back to its original state. I used damp cloths, gentle cleaners, and even resorted to meticulously scrubbing each page to ensure there were no stains or remnants of the accident left behind. As I worked on cleaning my journal, moments from the crash kept replaying in my mind. The screeching tires, the impact, and the chaos that followed. It was a terrifying experience, one that I hoped never to relive again. But as I flipped through the pages and saw my own handwriting smeared with blood, a mix of emotions washed over me. There was relief that everyone was recovering, gratitude for their safety, and a lingering sense of fear that things could have been much worse. While I was focused on restoring my journal, the rest of my family went about their own activities. Dad was still resting and recovering, occasionally waking up to check on us. His apologies persisted throughout the day, but we reassured him that we understood it was an accident and not his fault. Rodrick, on the other hand, seemed even more invested in his newly released game on Roblox. He was busy monitoring player feedback, fixing any bugs, and planning future updates. Despite the ongoing debate with Mom about limiting guest access, he was determined to create a fun and secure gaming environment for all players. Manny, true to his obsession, spent the day happily engrossed in his \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" cartoon marathon. He giggled and recited lines from the show, completely in his element. That cartoon seemed to bring a sense of happiness and escapism to him, and it was something we were grateful for amidst the chaos. As I finally finished cleaning my journal and closed its fresh pages, I couldn't help but reflect on the events of the past few days. Life had thrown us a curveball, but our family had come together to support each other through it all. We were reminded of our strength, resilience, and the importance of cherishing each moment. With newfound determination, I decided to use my journal not only as a personal diary but also as a reminder of the fragility of life and the power of family. Moving forward, I would document not just the ordinary moments but also the extraordinary ones, capturing our journey of healing and growth. And as I set my journal aside, I couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope that brighter days were on the horizon."},{"instruction":"I have a flex container. I want it max-width to be equal 218px.

It was the hot issue 'Natchisaeng,' and as soon as the prey was thrown, the media and public opinion quickly shifted. They poured on the attacks. \\"Investment money leaking from 'Natchisaeng,' insiders say 'There might be a problem with the script'\\" \\"'Natchisaeng's risky challenge leads to the recovery of investment funds!\\" In fact, the media just pounced on the opportunity, and the opposition, which had been hiding until now, openly revealed themselves. Then, starting from the 9th, the next day, nonsense without any facts began to appear. Rumors of discord between actors, differences in position between investors and Director Kyotaro, the silent writer Akari's withdrawal, Kang Woojin's non-existent scandal, and so on. \\"'Natchisaeng's Kang Woojin and cast actors' difference of opinion? Will the movie production be canceled as it is?\\" 'Natchisaeng' was shaking with numerous abusive articles. The Japanese public was also excited. -I knew it! It never made sense to cast a rookie actor from Korea as the lead! The original fans of Natchisaeng were so against it! But on the other hand. -It's all about the Natchisaeng movie! Ah! I really wasn't interested, but now that I keep seeing it, I end up watching it! The level of interest was nuclear. It was a strange picture. Despite being the biggest crisis for 'Natchisaeng,' its recognition was extremely high. It was several times stronger than when Kang Woojin was revealed to be 'a rookie actor from Korea.' This was the power of stimulation pervasive in the media world. Something salty hooks better than something bland. Anyway, 'Natchisaeng' was still benefiting from unintended 'noise marketing' two days later, on the 10th. Mentions of Kang Woojin were pouring out like a waterfall. Realistically, it wasn't such a bad picture for Woojin. \\"Kang Woojin's rollercoaster of interest, what stance will he take?\\" Even if 'Natchisaeng' failed, for Kang Woojin, it would just mean one of his prepared projects disappeared. Whether good or bad, his recognition in Japan grew. At this point. \\"PD! Have you seen these 'Natchisaeng' articles?! The issue is getting too big??\\" There was an emergency at 'Ametalk show!' which had recently finished recording with Kang Woojin and was in the midst of editing. But the skinny and dry Producer Shinjo said. \\"I know, I saw it too.\\" \\"Shouldn't we wait and see how things go for now??\\" \\"Why?? From what I see, if we air it as it is, we might hit the highest viewership ratings?\\" He made a judgment that it was rather good. Regardless, the noisy bait of 'Natchisaeng' naturally reached Korea as well. In Korea, the situation was viewed somewhat as a third party, different from Japan. \\"[Exclusive] Monster rookie 'Kang Woojin's' first Japanese lead role in Natchisaeng, investment suddenly blocked... an unexpected crisis\\" \\"'Natchisaeng' already lost half of the total investment, investment expected to freeze further after controversy\\" The same kind of speculation was rampant, but it felt lighter, didn't it? The public felt similar. Comments on articles and reactions on social media were quick, but the nuances were consistent. -Eh? What? Is that Japanese movie going down?? Ridiculous... Regardless, Kang Woojin, who was at the center of all this. \\"[Star Pick] Japan's 'Natchisaeng' in danger of collapse? The actual 'Kang Woojin' has no reaction\\" He was quiet. On the morning of September 12th, at an advertisement shooting site. Around 9 o'clock. Dozens of staff were busy setting up the shoot. Among them, the advertising director at a desk surrounded by monitors said. \\"This is the vibe - here, here, wearing jeans and running. I was wondering if it's possible to take off the top.\\" He was showing the storyboard to a man with a ponytail, of course, it was Choi Sung-gun. \\"Hmm, I'm not sure. There was no talk of that initially.\\" \\"I know. I'll talk to the client's staff when they arrive later, but I wanted to know what Woojin thinks first. I think the jeans will stand out much more without a top.\\" Naturally, the main focus of the advertisement shoot was Kang Woojin. But Woojin was not currently on set. He was inside a van parked in the parking lot. He wasn't alone. A familiar bearded face, meaning, drama mogul Producer Song Man-woo was with him in the van. -Flap. Kang Woojin had just opened the first of two thin bundles of paper he received from Producer Song Man-woo. The cover of the bundle read. -Synopsis. Woojin, with an indifferent face, read the first line of the content and met the gaze of Producer Song Man-woo, who had just swallowed his slightly nervous saliva. \\"Producer.

고마워요, 첫 촬영도 와주셔서.” “아니에요. 제가 오고 싶기도 했어요. 그런데-” 여기서 촬영존 한쪽의 무심히 앉은, 묵묵히 대본을 내려보고 있는 강우진을 확인한 수어 전문가가 조심히 물었다. “강우진씨는······생각보다 엄청 차분하시네요?” 이어 그녀의 시선을 따라 이월선 작가 역시 눈을 움직였다. 그리곤 픽 웃었다. “우진씨야 뭐 늘 저런 식이긴 해요. 계절로 치면 겨울일까?” 대체로 오류였다. 현재 의자에 앉은 강우진의 속은 펄펄 널뛰고 있었으니까. 정확하게는 약간 딴 생각 중이었다. ‘‘남사친’ 편집이 끝났다, 그런 거면 이제 런칭도 얼마 안 남았다는 거잖어?’ 몇십 분 전 최성건을 통해 ‘남사친’의 편집이 끝났다는 소식을 들었으니까. 키스씬에 심장 터질 뻔한 게 어제 같은데 벌써 편집이 끝났다. 아니, 시기상 적당한 시간이 지난 건 맞지만, 강우진의 체감상 매우 빠른 것 같았다. 여하튼 강우진은 두근거리기 시작했다. ‘으- 은근 기대되면서도 걱정되는데.’ 한량과는 달리, ‘남사친’은 그가 주연이었으니까. 주연작으로 한국이 아닌 첫 해외 진출. 거기다 이미 일본은 강우진으로 와장창 시끄럽기도 했다. 떨린다, 그러나 보는 사람이 많아 순수하게 포커페이스를 유지한다. 그런 우진을 지켜보던 다른 배우들은 작게작게 쑥떡 댔다. “감정 잡고 있나 봐요, 엄청 심각하네.” “음- 그런가? 근데 우진씨는 평소에도 좀 저렇던데. 뭐, 하루 본 게 다지만.” “여기와서 쭉 저 상탠데 감정 잡는 거 맞는 것 같아요, 아무래도 어려운 역할이다 보니까.” “대본리딩 때처럼 앉아서 하는 것과 현장 연기, 확실히 다르긴 하겠죠?” “한량에서도 장난 아니었대요, 막 연쇄살인범이 진짜 나타난 것 같았다고.” “장애 연기는 진짜 예민해서 손발 몸짓 전부 통제해야 할 건데- 흠, 어쩌려나.” 이쯤, 앉아 있던 강우진이 콜을 받았다. 의상과 메이크업을 진행하자는 사인. 뒤로 얼마 뒤. 준비를 마친 강우진의 모습이 전체적으로 공개됐다. 뭐랄까, 딱 눈에 띄게 변한 건 없었다. 의상은 간단히 청바지에 후드. 다만, 헤어는 신경 안 쓴 듯 네추럴하면서 약간 부스스했고, 메이크업도 적당한 혈색만 표현할 정도로 옅었다. 강조한 게 있다면 눈가. 짙진 않지만 묘하게 다크서클이 들어간 모습. 우진까지 준비가 완료되자. -스윽. 연출 PD와 강우진 그리고 장신의 정장환이 세트장 중간에 모였다. 간단한 대본 리허설을 위해서였다. 참고로 정장환의 모습은 깔끔 그 자체였다. 헤어는 짧았으며 의상은 칼 각 잡힌 정장이었다. 어쨌든. “이런 식으로 오케이? 첫 컷이니까 가볍게 대사 맞춰보는 느낌으로 가볼게요.” 적당히 구두로 리허설을 마친 연출 PD의 말에, 덤덤한 강우진이나 정장환이 고개를 끄덕였다. “예, PD님.” “알겠습니다.” 금세 웃음이 걸린 연출 PD가 양손을 몇 번 친 뒤 현장 전체로 외쳤고. “자자! 카메라 돌려봅시다!!” 정장환이 우진과 눈이 마주쳤다. 왜인지 강우진은 정장환을 바라보고 있었다. 이에 정장환이 피식 웃었다. “아, 걱정마요. 오늘은 애드립 안 칠 게. 한다 해도 사전에 우진씨한테 말할 거고.” 엥? 해도 상관없는데. 강우진은 속으로 뭐지 싶었다. 그는 그저 정장환의 멀대같이 큰 키에 감탄하고 있었을 뿐이니까. ‘부럽. 키가 2m는 되는 거 같냐? 한- 5센치만 노나줬으면 좋겠네.’ 하지만 장착한 컨셉질이 있는데 키 흥정을 할 수는 없는 노릇. 강우진은 최대한 목소리를 깔며 무뚝뚝하게 답했다. “잘 부탁드립니다.” “응, 나도 잘 부탁해요.” 그쯤 어느새 모니터 자리에 앉은 연출 PD가 두 배우에게 요청했다. “장환씨, 우진씨! 자리 잡읍시다!” 잠시 뒤. 고급 아파트의 복도를 연상케 하는, 나란히 붙은 철문과 엘리베이터의 문까지 연출된 세트장을 카메라가 담았다. 정면에서, 왼쪽에서, 오른쪽에서. 당장은 강우진과 정장환이 보이진 않는다. 이유는 심플했다. 그들의 등장은 문을 열고 나오는 것이기에 세트 철문 뒤쪽에 서 있었다. 이제 액션 사인이 던져지면 정장환부터 움직이고 곧장 강우진의 차례였다. 그런 둘 중 강우진은. ‘후우-’ 철문 앞에 서서 내면에 각인된, 초연히 잠들어 있던 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’ 깨웠다. 그리고 끌어올렸다. 이 과정은 이제 눈 깜짝할 새였다. 어느새 우진의 머리부터 발끝까지 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 모든 것이 드리웠다. 우진의 자세와 태도가 변한다. 수천 번 외운 것처럼 선명한 대사가 머릿속에 자리 잡는다, 그의 감각과 감정 그리고 속내가 가슴에 뿌리를 내린다, 확고한 세상이 눈앞에 펼쳐졌다. 점차 그의 귓가가 먹먹해진다. 시작은 이명부터였다. 삐- 따위의 소음이 우진의 귀속에서 번졌다. 이곳에 존재하는 소리가 점차 자취를 감춘다. 땅속으로, 하늘 위로. 덩달아 소란스럽던 세트장 풍경이 하나둘 연기처럼 사라진다. ‘조용해.’ 마치 끝없이 펼쳐진 광활한 공간에 이 복도의 조각만 섬처럼 둥둥 떠 있는 느낌이었다. 하지만 썩 좋은 기분은 아니었다. 아무것도 들리지 않는 세상은 공허할 뿐이니까. 최소 강우진. 아니, ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 그랬다. 공허하며 답답했다. 내면 저 깊숙한 곳에서 절망이 울컥였다. 그래도 참는다. 절망에 눈길조차 주지 않았다. 참는다? 그렇지 않다. 그저 익숙함에 자신을 속이는 게 다였다. 이내 강우진에겐 거대한 잠잠함과 미약한 공포가 맞물렸다. 평생을 이리 살아야 한다는 좌절, 그 좌절을 덮고도 넘쳐흐르는 의욕상실. 이때, 강우진의 뒤에 있던 카메라가 그의 옆모습으로 움직였다. 앵글은 바스트. 따라서 많은 이가 보는 모니터 중 하나에 우진의 얼굴이 출력됐다. 이월선 작가의 눈에 진중함이 팽배해지며 입을 감쌌다. “본 연기 시작 전. 근데도 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 세상을 온 얼굴에 담은 듯이······” 스크립터 포함 여러 스탭들 역시 줄지어 탄성을 자아냈다. “와- 우진씨, 저저 눈에 초점 없는 것 좀 봐요.” “디테일이 무슨- 표정이 있는데 표정이 없는 것 같은···저런 표현은 어디서 배우는 거지?” “몇 초나 걸렸지 지금? 감정 잡는 거 어이없을 정도로 빠르네요······” 이쯤 이월선 작가가 오른쪽에 자리한 수어 전문가에게 물었고. “지금 저 표정 어때요.” 눈이 동그래진 수어 전문가가 옅게 답했다. “이질감은 없어요, 아니 정말 실제 같아요. 연기 모르는 제가 봐도 대단해요. 어쩜 저러지?” 심지어 아직 액션이 들어가지도 않았다. 곧, 첫 자리의 연출 PD가 모니터 속 강우진을 보며 헛웃음을 뱉는다. ‘보통의 배우들은 기피하는 장애 연기. 겁이 날 수밖에 없어. 그런데 쟤는 거침이 없다. 그런데 소름이 돋을 정도의 생동감이 느껴지냐고.’ 경외와 더불어 심각해진 연출 PD가 천천히 확성기를 올렸다. 이내 현장 전체로 뱉어진 외침. “하이- 큐!!” 금세 수군거리던 세트장 전체가 꿀 먹은 벙어리가 됐다. 하지만 강우진에겐. ‘옆집 묘한 남자’에겐 아무짝에도 의미가 없다. 어느 쪽이든 같으니까. 그때. -덜컥! 정장환. 아니, ‘송태형’이 현관 철문을 열었다. 카메라는 그의 정면. 송태형은 직전에 손 세정제를 뿌렸다는 듯 양손을 비비며 등장했다. 그와 동시에. -달칵. 송태형의 옆집 철문 역시 열렸다. ‘옆집 묘한 남자’가 느릿하게 나타난다. 바로 미간을 좁히는 송태형. “쯧.” 반면. -스윽. 우진은 소리가 아닌 시각으로 송태형의 존재를 눈치챘다. 멈췄던 그의 혈색에 작디작은 즐거움이 묻는다. 뻣뻣한 상실에서 상황이 만들어졌으니까. 지금 강우진의 표정은 딱 그랬다. 그는 송태형이 나쁘지 않았다. ‘저 사람의 집은 항상 좋은 냄새가 나.’ 예민한 냄새 덕분인진 모르겠지만, 강우진은 그의 집이 열리는 찰나에 나는 향이 마음에 들었다. 여기서 카메라, 뒤로 빠지며 강우진과 정장환을 투샷으로 잡는다. 둘의 변화가 명확히 모니터에 드러난다. 서로를 보는 두 인물이지만 소통은 불가했다. ‘송태형’은 자의적으로 단절했고, 강우진은 타의적으로 단절당했다. 그렇기에 둘의 이해도, 생각도, 의견도, 파악도 모두 틀리다. 이때 강우진이 ‘송태형’에게 한 걸음 다가선다. 송태형은 움찔하지만, 먹먹한 강우진은 작은 미소를 지을 뿐이었다. 남이 본다면 모호한 웃음일지라도 우진에겐 긍정이었다. 그는 송태형의 착실함이 좋았다. 송태형은 늘 같은 시간에 집을 나서니까. 그렇기에 약속한 듯 마주칠 수 있었다. 말을 하지 않아도 말이다. 우진은 송태형의 정갈함도 마음에 들었다. 늘 정갈하며 흐트러짐이 없다. 뻣뻣한 무표정이 공격적이지만 그것마저 우진은 좋았다. 자신에게만이 아닌 송태형은 모든 사람들에게 똑같이 대했다. 일관적이다. ‘나에 관해 알면 사람들은 변해.’ 그것이 배려건 꺼림이건 강우진이. ‘옆집 묘한 남자’가 겪어온 모든 이가 같았다. 그건 나쁜 게 아니었다. 그저 우진은 상대가 누군들 늘 공격적인 송태형이 멋져 보였다. 그 공평함의 잣대가 상대에게 있는 게 아닌, 자기 자신에게 있는 것 같아서. 강우진이 손을 움찔했다. 카메라, 우진의 손부터 팔뚝 그리고 얼굴을 클로즈업. 현재 강우진의 눈빛은 변해 있었다. 갈망과 고뇌가 가득했다. 이때, 모니터 보던 수어 전문가가 두 눈을 디립다 크게 떴다. “세, 세상에.” 이월선 작가가 빠르게 그녀의 말에 따라붙었다. “······네, 저도 같은 말을 뱉을 예정이었어요.” “지금 우진씨는- 도저히 일반인으로 보이지가 않아요.” “이 짧은 연기에, 저 짧은 배역에 어떻게 저리 짙은 농도를 담아 왔을까.” 자극적이진 않지만, 투명하지도 않은 강우진이었다. 그리고 묽다. 의욕상실이지만 희망을 놓지 않았기 때문이었다. 그 희망은 금세 절망으로 바뀐다. 그 표현을 정면에서 보는 송태형 또는 정장환은 멈칫했다. ‘알겠어, 왜 거물들이 얘한테 들러붙는지. 내 눈에 이 정도면 그들의 눈에선······’ 이어 송태형의 다분한 대사가 들렸다. “뭡니까 대체.” 입 모양. 소리가 자취를 감춘 우진은 그의 입 모양으로 말을 알아챘다. 뭔가를 묻고 있구나. 여기서부터 강우진의 눈동자에 숱한 과거가 담긴다. 그 끝엔 ‘고민’이 기다리고 있었다. 나도 질문해보고 싶다, 말을 걸어보고 싶다, 내가 그럴 수 있을까? 변화도 두렵다, 저 사람이 날 보고 기겁하진 않을까? 친해질 수 있을까? 그러나 송태형은 ‘묘한 옆집 남자’에 질려선지 혀를 차며 갈 길을 간다. “짜증 나네, 이사를 가던지 해야지.” 카메라, 송태형의 앞에서 그를 담다가 우뚝 멈춰서는 서서히 강우진에게 다가간다. 여전히 제자리서 송태형의 뒷모습을 바라보는 그. 이 모습만 보면 충분히 기묘했다. 아니, 지금까지 우진이 보인 연기 전부가 그랬다. 대사 한 줄 없이 오직 눈빛과 표정 그리고 디테일한 몸짓, 손짓으로만 연기했으니까. 모니터 보는 모두와 더불어 시청자 역시 그렇게 보일 게 분명했다. 저 남자는, 말이 없는 옆집 남자는 수상하다고. 그렇게 확정 지을 때쯤, 가만히 있던 강우진이 천천히 두 손을 올렸다. 얼굴 근육이 풀어진다. 그런 우진이 송태형의 뒷모습에 대고 말했다. ‘난 당신이 좋아요.’ 그에겐 수어가 대사였으니. 곧, 우진의 얼굴을 클로즈업. 모니터엔 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 살짝 풀어진 미소가 담긴다. 아마 이쯤 해서 시청자들은 알아차릴 것이었다. 묘한 게 아닌 못하는 거구나. 오직 감정만으로 끌고 오는 씬이었다. 자칫 삐끗하면 이해가 힘들지도 모르는. 허나 지금까지의 강우진은 티끌 한 점 오류가 없었다. 완연하며 완벽했다. 그 모든 과정이, 감정이, 표정이 카메라에 꾹꾹 눌러 담긴다. 대사 한 마디가 없지만, 백 마디보다 농염하다. 깊고 짙다. 그런 강우진을 모니터로도, 실체로도 확인한 배우들은 각자만의 방법으로 반응했다. 넋 놓고 그저 빠져들었거나. “······” 속으로 거칠게 탄성 하거나. ‘와- 연기 돌았네, 저런 눈빛 표현을 대체 어떻게······’ 공통점은 배우들 모두의 종착역엔 한가지로 귀결됐다. 저건 신인이 할 수 있는 류의 연기가 아니다. 그러다 우진을 지켜보던 배우들이 눈이 더욱이 확장됐다. 무언가 강렬해서가 아니었다. 점잖은 고요한 연기에 압도당했다. 지금 강우진이 허공에 움직이는 두 손이, 수어가. ‘우린 친해질 수 없을까요?’ 지나치게 씁쓸하면서도 애잔했으니까. 이어 저도 모르게 이월선 작가가 헛웃음을 뱉었다. “그냥 대본을 찢고 나왔어.” 촬영 2일짜리 조·단역의 연기가 경력 20년인 스타작가 이월선의 기준을. “큰일인데, 눈이 너무 높아지면. 차라리 안 보는 게 나았을 정도야.” 사뿐히 갈아 치워버렸다. 이 시각, 일본. 강우진이 한창 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 세트장을 뒤집고 있을 무렵. 일본에선 ‘낯기생’ 관련 어처구니없으면서도 생뚱맞은 존재가 등장한 참이었다. 『카시히 그룹, 무너지는「낯기생」에 관심 가진다? 영화계에 소문 솔솔』 카시히 그룹이었다. < 역습 (3) > 끝","output":"< Counterattack (3) > Two hours later, in Suwon, Korea. Inside the KBC Drama Production Center, where the 'Freezing Romance' team had taken root. \\"Set check complete!!\\" \\"Lights are OK!!\\" \\"Props are almost sorted here!\\" \\"Let's get ready to shoot in 15 minutes!\\" The preparations for filming were nearly complete. The set was densely packed with all sorts of equipment. Cameras set up at various angles, reflectors and lights, and numerous cables laid out like veins. The footsteps of dozens of staff members crisscrossing the area were busy. In the midst of this. \\"Ah, Writer Lee, please take a seat here.\\" The director, who was at a station with three monitors, seated the newly arrived writer Lee Wol-seon next to him. Soon, Writer Lee, with her designer handbag on her lap, smiled faintly. \\"I like the atmosphere here on set. Even though it's my umpteenth time, I still enjoy the air here.\\" \\"Hahaha. Is that so?\\" \\"Yes. It feels like I'm seeing the fiction I wrote become reality.\\" Writer Lee Wol-seon chuckled softly as she looked around. \\"By the way, so many of our actors have arrived.\\" The shoot for the male lead Jeong Jang-hwan and the 'mysterious neighbor' Kang Woojin was scheduled to start soon. Yet, the actors who should have been waiting were already on set. The director provided the answer. \\"Well, it's the first shoot, isn't it? And they probably want to see it with their own eyes. Both you and I have allowed it.\\" Writer Lee, reminded of Kang Woojin, nodded as if she understood. \\"The ad-lib from that day has been included in the revised scene, so they must be curious.\\" \\"And they want to see Woojin's acting. It's different from sitting down and reading; being on set is something else.\\" At that moment. -Swish. A woman entered behind the two who were talking. \\"Hello.\\" Turning around, they saw the sign language expert who had attended the script reading, and Writer Lee stood up to greet her. \\"Did you come? Thank you for coming to the first shoot.\\" \\"No, I wanted to come too. But—\\" The sign language expert carefully asked as she noticed Kang Woojin, who was sitting nonchalantly on one side of the shooting zone, quietly looking down at his script. \\"Kang Woojin seems... much calmer than I thought?\\" Following her gaze, Writer Lee also looked over and chuckled lightly. \\"Woojin is always like that. Maybe he's like winter?\\" That was mostly a mistake. Inside, Kang Woojin was boiling with excitement. Specifically, he was a bit distracted. \\"'Close Male Friend' editing is finished, so the launch must be soon, right?\\" He had heard from Choi Sung-gun just a few minutes ago that the editing for 'Close Male Friend' was complete. It felt like just yesterday he was about to have a heart attack during the kiss scene, and now the editing was already done. Well, it was the right time, but to Kang Woojin, it felt very fast. Anyway, Kang Woojin started to get excited. \\"Ugh, I'm looking forward to it but also worried.\\" Unlike 'Hanryang,' 'Close Male Friend' was a lead role for him. It was his first lead role overseas, not in Korea. Plus, Japan was already noisy with Kang Woojin. He was nervous, but he maintained a poker face as many people were watching. Other actors watching Woojin whispered to each other softly. \\"He seems to be getting into the emotion, he looks very serious.\\" \\"Hmm, is that so? But Woojin is usually like that. Well, I've only seen him for a day.\\" \\"He's been standing there since he got here, so it seems like he's getting into character, especially since it's a difficult role.\\" \\"It's definitely different from sitting down and reading the script to acting on set, right?\\" \\"I heard he was no joke in 'Hanryang,' like a real serial killer appeared.\\" \\"Acting as a disabled person is really sensitive; you have to control every gesture and movement—hmm, I wonder how it will go.\\" At this point, Kang Woojin, who had been sitting, received a call. It was a sign to proceed with the costume and makeup. A little later. Kang Woojin, fully prepared, was revealed to everyone. There wasn't a noticeable change in his appearance. His outfit was simply jeans and a hoodie. However, his hair was styled naturally and a bit messy, and the makeup was light, just enough to show some healthy color. If anything was emphasized, it was the area around his eyes. Not too heavy, but with a hint of dark circles. Once Woojin was ready. -Swish. Director, Kang Woojin, and the tall Jeong Jang-hwan gathered in the middle of the set. It was for a simple script rehearsal. By the way, Jeong Jang-hwan looked impeccably neat. His hair was short, and he wore a sharply tailored suit. Anyway. \\"Is this okay? Since it's the first cut, let's go with the feeling of matching the lines lightly.\\" After a brief verbal rehearsal by the director, both the calm Kang Woojin and Jeong Jang-hwan nodded. \\"Yes, Director.\\" \\"Understood.\\" The director, with a smile on his face, clapped his hands a few times and then shouted to the entire set. \\"Alright! Let's roll the cameras!!\\" Jeong Jang-hwan and Woojin made eye contact. For some reason, Kang Woojin was looking at Jeong Jang-hwan, who then chuckled. \\"Ah, don't worry. I won't ad-lib today. Even if I do, I'll tell Woojin in advance.\\" Huh? It's okay if you do. Kang Woojin thought to himself. He was just admiring Jeong Jang-hwan's towering height. \\"Envious. Does he look like he's 2 meters tall? I wish I could grow just 5 centimeters.\\" But with his character concept in place, he couldn't haggle over height. Kang Woojin responded as gruffly as possible. \\"Please take care of me.\\" \\"Yeah, me too, please take care of me.\\" Around that time, the director, now seated at the monitor, requested the two actors. \\"Jang-hwan, Woojin! Let's get into position!\\" Shortly after. The set, designed to resemble the hallway of a luxury apartment with adjacent steel doors and an elevator door, was captured by the camera. From the front, left, and right. For now, Jeong Jang-hwan and Kang Woojin were not visible. The reason was simple. Their entrance was to come out through the doors, so they were standing behind the set's steel doors. Once the action sign was thrown, Jeong Jang-hwan would move first, followed by Kang Woojin. Among the two, Kang Woojin. -Hoo. Standing in front of the steel door, he awakened the 'mysterious neighbor' who had been calmly sleeping within him. And he brought it to the surface. This process was now a blink of an eye. Suddenly, everything from Woojin's head to toe was draped with the 'mysterious neighbor.' Woojin's posture and attitude changed. The lines, as if memorized a thousand times, settled in his head, his senses, emotions, and inner thoughts took root in his heart, and a firm world unfolded before his eyes. Gradually, his ears began to feel stuffed. It started with tinnitus. A noise like a beep spread inside Woojin's ears. The sounds that existed here gradually disappeared. Into the ground, into the sky. Along with it, the noisy set scenery began to vanish one by one like smoke. \\"It's quiet.\\" It felt as if only this piece of the hallway was floating like an island in an endlessly vast space. But it wasn't a pleasant feeling. A world where nothing can be heard is just empty. At least Kang Woojin. No, the 'mysterious neighbor' felt that way. It was empty and suffocating. Despair welled up from deep within. But he endured. He didn't even glance at the despair. Endure? Not quite. He was just deceiving himself with familiarity. Soon, a great calmness and a slight fear intertwined within Kang Woojin. The frustration of having to live this way for a lifetime, and the loss of motivation that overflowed even over that frustration. At that moment, the camera behind Kang Woojin moved to his side profile. The angle was a bust shot. Consequently, Woojin's face appeared on one of the many monitors being watched. Writer Lee Wol-seon's eyes filled with seriousness as she covered her mouth. \\"Before the main acting starts. Yet, he seems to have captured the world of the 'mysterious neighbor' all over his face...\\" Scripters and several other staff members also let out exclamations in a row. \\"Wow—look at Woojin's unfocused eyes.\\" \\"The detail is—there's an expression, but it's like there's no expression... Where do you learn to express like that?\\" \\"How many seconds did it take now? It's ridiculously fast to get into character...\\" At this point, Writer Lee asked the sign language expert sitting to her right. \\"How do you find that expression?\\" The sign language expert, with widened eyes, replied softly. \\"There's no sense of alienation, it's really like reality. Even someone like me who doesn't know acting can tell it's amazing. How does he do that?\\" And yet, the action hadn't even started. Soon, the director at the first monitor looked at Kang Woojin on the screen and chuckled. 'Acting as a disabled person is something ordinary actors avoid. It's bound to be scary. But he has no hesitation, and yet there's a sense of liveliness that gives me goosebumps.' With awe and seriousness, the director slowly raised the megaphone. Then, a shout echoed across the set. \\"High cue!!\\" Immediately, the bustling set went silent as if everyone had eaten honey. But for Kang Woojin. For the 'mysterious neighbor,' it meant nothing. It was the same either way. Then. -Thunk! Jeong Jang-hwan. No, 'Song Tae-hyung' opened the front steel door. The camera was on his front. Song Tae-hyung appeared, rubbing his hands as if he had just sprayed hand sanitizer. At the same time. -Click. The steel door next to Song Tae-hyung's also opened. The 'mysterious neighbor' appeared slowly. Song Tae-hyung frowned immediately. \\"Tsk.\\" On the other hand. -Swish. Woojin noticed Song Tae-hyung's presence not by sound but by sight. A tiny bit of joy tinged his pale complexion. A situation had been created from stiff loss. That was exactly Kang Woojin's expression. He didn't mind Song Tae-hyung. 'His house always smells nice.' Perhaps due to his sensitive sense of smell, Kang Woojin liked the scent that came from his house the moment the door opened. From here, the camera pulled back, capturing Kang Woojin and Jeong Jang-hwan in a two-shot. The change in both was clearly visible on the monitor. They were two characters looking at each other, but communication was impossible. 'Song Tae-hyung' had voluntarily cut himself off, and Kang Woojin had been cut off by others. Therefore, their understanding, thoughts, opinions, and perceptions were all different. At this moment, Kang Woojin took a step towards 'Song Tae-hyung.' Song Tae-hyung flinched, but the muffled Kang Woojin just smiled faintly. To others, it might seem like an ambiguous smile, but to Woojin, it was positive. He liked Song Tae-hyung's diligence. Song Tae-hyung always left his house at the same time. That's why they could meet as if by appointment, without speaking. Woojin also liked Song Tae-hyung's neatness. Always tidy and without disarray. His stiff expressionless face was aggressive, but even that Woojin liked. Song Tae-hyung treated everyone the same, not just himself. He was consistent. 'When people know about me, they change.' Whether it was out of consideration or aversion, everyone who had encountered Kang Woojin. The 'mysterious neighbor' had been the same. It wasn't bad. Woojin just thought Song Tae-hyung, who was always aggressive to everyone, looked cool. It seemed the standard of fairness was not with others but within himself. Kang Woojin's hand twitched. The camera, from Woojin's hand to his forearm and then his face, zoomed in for a close-up. Kang Woojin's eyes had changed. They were filled with longing and torment. At that moment, the sign language expert watching the monitor widened her eyes in surprise. \\"My, my goodness.\\" Writer Lee quickly followed up on her words. \\"...Yes, I was about to say the same thing.\\" \\"Right now, Woojin doesn't look like an ordinary person at all.\\" \\"How could he bring such a deep intensity to this short role, in this short performance?\\" Kang Woojin was neither provocative nor transparent. And he was diluted. He was demotivated but had not given up hope. That hope soon turned into despair. Song Tae-hyung, or Jeong Jang-hwan, who was watching this expression head-on, hesitated. 'I get it, why the big shots are clinging to him. If he looks like this to my eyes, then to theirs...' Then Song Tae-hyung's distinct line was heard. \\"What on earth is it?\\" Lip reading. Woojin, who had lost all sound, understood his words by reading his lips. He's asking something. From here, Kang Woojin's eyes filled with countless pasts. At the end of it, 'worry' was waiting. I want to ask a question too, I want to try talking, can I do that? Change is scary, what if that person is shocked by me? Can we become friends? However, Song Tae-hyung, perhaps disgusted by the 'mysterious neighbor,' clicked his tongue and went on his way. \\"It's annoying, I should move or something.\\" The camera, capturing Song Tae-hyung from the front, suddenly stops and slowly approaches Kang Woojin. Still standing in place, he watches Song Tae-hyung's back. Just this scene alone was sufficiently strange. No, all the acting Woojin had shown so far was like that. With no lines, only through his gaze, expressions, and detailed gestures, he acted. Everyone watching the monitor, as well as the viewers, would surely see it that way. That man, the silent neighbor, is suspicious. Just as they were about to confirm this, Kang Woojin, who had been still, slowly raised both hands. His facial muscles relaxed. Woojin, facing Song Tae-hyung's back, said. 'I like you.' For him, sign language was his dialogue. Soon, Woojin's face was zoomed in on the monitor. The 'mysterious neighbor's' slightly relaxed smile was captured. Perhaps by this point, the viewers would realize. It's not that he's strange; he's unable to speak. It was a scene pulled in by emotion alone. It could be difficult to understand if one slipped up. But so far, Kang Woojin had not made a single error. He was complete and perfect. All that process, emotion, and expression were firmly pressed into the camera. There were no words, but it was more eloquent than a hundred words. Deep and rich. The actors, both through the monitor and in reality, reacted in their own ways. Either they were mesmerized. \\"......\\" Or they internally exclaimed roughly. \\"Wow—his acting is insane, how can he express such a gaze...\\" The commonality was that all the actors concluded with one thing. This is not the kind of acting a rookie can do. Then the actors watching Woojin's eyes widened even more. Not because it was intense, but because they were overwhelmed by the calm and dignified acting. Kang Woojin's hands moving in the air, his sign language. 'Can't we become friends?' It was excessively bitter yet poignant. Then, without realizing it, Writer Lee Wol-seon chuckled. \\"He just tore up the script and came out.\\" The acting of a two-day supporting role had effortlessly replaced the standards of Writer Lee Wol-seon, a star writer with 20 years of experience. \\"It's a big deal if my standards get too high. It would have been better not to see it at all.\\" At this moment, in Japan. While Kang Woojin was turning the 'Freezing Romance' set upside down, an absurd and out-of-place presence related to 'Natchisaeng' appeared in Japan. \\"Kashihi Group shows interest in the crumbling 'Natchisaeng'?

Voici comment la classe \`Tab\` et la mise en œuvre correspondante pourraient ressembler en Java : \`\`\`java import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger; public class Tab { private int[] data; private AtomicInteger maxValue = new AtomicInteger(Integer.MIN_VALUE); public Tab(int[] data) { this.data = data; } public void updateMax() { int length = data.length; int tasks = length / 10 + (length % 10 == 0 ? 0 : 1); // On détermine le nombre de tâches ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); for (int i = 0; i < tasks; i++) { int start = i * 10; int end = Math.min((i + 1) * 10, length); executor.submit(new MaxFinder(start, end)); } executor.shutdown(); // On ne prend plus de nouvelles tâches try { // Attendre la fin de toutes les tâches if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) { executor.shutdownNow(); } } catch (InterruptedException e) { executor.shutdownNow(); Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); } // À ce stade, toutes les tâches ont fini et la valeur maximale est mise à jour. } private class MaxFinder implements Runnable { private final int start; private final int end; MaxFinder(int start, int end) { this.start = start; this.end = end; } @Override public void run() { int localMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE; for (int i = start; i < end; i++) { localMax = Math.max(localMax, data[i]); } // Mettre à jour la valeur maximale globale de façon atomique maxValue.accumulateAndGet(localMax, Math::max); } } // Getter pour récupérer la valeur maximale mise à jour public int getMaxValue() { return maxValue.get(); } } \`\`\` Dans cet exemple, la classe \`Tab\` contient une méthode \`updateMax\` qui crée des tâches de recherche de maximum pour des sous-parties du tableau. Le \`AtomicInteger\` est utilisé pour la mise à jour de la valeur maximale afin de garantir la sûreté des threads, car différents threads peuvent tenter de mettre à jour cette valeur en même temps. Vous pouvez exécuter la méthode \`updateMax\` pour mettre à jour le maximum après avoir créé une instance de \`Tab\` avec un tableau d'entiers. Notez que cet exemple suppose que la tâche de recherche du maximum peut être divisée uniformément en sections de 10 éléments, et qu'il utilisera un thread pour traiter les éléments restants si le nombre total d'éléments n'est pas divisible par 10."},{"instruction":"utilise pas AtomicInteger","output":"D'accord, si vous ne souhaitez pas utiliser \`AtomicInteger\` pour la mise à jour atomique de la valeur maximale, vous devrez trouver un autre moyen d'assurer que la mise à jour de la valeur maximale est thread-safe. Étant donné que \`AtomicInteger\` est une solution idéale pour ce type d'opération, si vous choisissez de ne pas l'utiliser, vous devrez vous assurer de la synchronisation manuelle à l'aide de \`synchronized\` ou d'autres mécanismes de verrouillage. Nous allons utiliser l'approche \`synchronized\` pour synchroniser l'accès à la valeur maximale. Voici comment vous pourriez implémenter la classe \`Tab\` sans utiliser \`AtomicInteger\`: \`\`\`java import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; import java.util.concurrent.Executors; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; public class Tab { private int[] data; private int maxValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // valeur par défaut public Tab(int[] data) { this.data = data; } public synchronized void updateIfMax(int localMax) { if (localMax > maxValue) { maxValue = localMax; } } public void updateMax() { int length = data.length; int tasks = length / 10 + (length % 10 == 0 ? 0 : 1); // On détermine le nombre de tâches ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); for (int i = 0; i < tasks; i++) { int start = i * 10; int end = Math.min((i + 1) * 10, length); executor.submit(new MaxFinder(start, end)); } executor.shutdown(); // On ne prend plus de nouvelles tâches try { // Attendre la fin de toutes les tâches if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) { executor.shutdownNow(); } } catch (InterruptedException e) { executor.shutdownNow(); Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); } // Toutes les tâches ont fini et la valeur maximale est mise à jour. } private class MaxFinder implements Runnable { private final int start; private final int end; MaxFinder(int start, int end) { this.start = start; this.end = end; } @Override public void run() { int localMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE; for (int i = start; i < end; i++) { localMax = Math.max(localMax, data[i]); } // Mettre à jour la valeur maximale de façon thread-safe updateIfMax(localMax); } } // Getter pour récupérer la valeur maximale mise à jour public int getMaxValue() { return maxValue; } } \`\`\` Dans cette version, \`updateIfMax\` est une méthode \`synchronized\`, ce qui signifie que lorsqu'un thread entre dans cette méthode, aucun autre thread ne peut y entrer tant que le premier n'a pas terminé. Cela garantit que deux threads ne mettront pas à jour \`maxValue\` en même temps, évitant ainsi les conditions de course. Gardez à l’esprit que l’utilisation excessive de blocs \`synchronized\` peut réduire les performances en raison du coût du verrouillage. Cependant, si la méthod \`updateIfMax\` est rapide et appelée uniquement à la fin de chaque recherche d’élément maximum dans une sous-section, l'impact sur les performances devrait être minimal dans ce cas précis."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: Cameron McCaffrey , Good morning , I read your email and noted. First I am surprised you said, you called your bank and they are telling you it is a Scam . How did they arrive at this without knowing the genesis of the transaction ? Are you not aware of legal inheritance by families left in banks all over the world? including the United States of America where you live? I want to know what you told them and the basis. I know myself and at my position and age close to 70years , I do not think, that I have taken advantage of any body, with my position, family or friends alike, in all my dealings of life. On a final note, I want to re confirm, with 100% guarantee that the inheritance is legal and legitimate . Whatever your bank or anybody around, who knows nothing about the transaction which is 100% legal , is rubbish . Note you cannot assume or give wrong information to people out there because you are a lawyer, Banker or whatever you call yourself. As a matter of fact, you MUST be aware of all information, 100% before giving out, I am also aware that Banks in the USA and other countries of the world have been sued for misinformation, and Deformation many times. The primary duty of the Banks is to transfer loan money to corporate organizations/individuals as the case may be. I have given you 100% honestly as long as this transaction is concern , and it's you to make your decision and I will happy, in any line you so choose. Warm regards, Dr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>","output":"Dear Dr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for your response. I understand your concern regarding the bank's claim of this inheritance being a scam. However, please allow me to clarify the situation. When I contacted my bank, they simply advised me to exercise caution as they were not aware of the genesis of the transaction. As a responsible bank, they wanted to ensure the safety of my funds and protect me from potential scams. I appreciate their diligence in such matters. Regarding the legal inheritance you mentioned, I must confess that I am not well-versed in such matters. It is intriguing to learn that families all over the world, including in the United States, may be entitled to inheritances from banks. However, since I am not familiar with the laws and regulations surrounding this, I sought advice from my bank to ensure that I am not inadvertently involved in any illicit activities. I appreciate your assertion that the inheritance is legal and legitimate. It is crucial to have complete clarity and certainty in such matters. Your guarantee of 100% legitimacy is reassuring, especially considering your position and experience of nearly 70 years. Trust and transparency are essential elements in any transaction, particularly when it involves a substantial inheritance. I agree with you wholeheartedly that providing accurate information is of utmost importance, and I must commend you for your dedication to upholding the truth. As a potential beneficiary, I have a responsibility to conduct my due diligence and ensure that I am making an informed decision. Based on your reassurances, I feel more confident about the legitimacy of this inheritance. I hope you understand that my hesitation initially stemmed from the bank's cautionary advice. I assure you that I am open to exploring this opportunity further. If you can provide me with more information, such as the necessary legal processes and any documentation required, it would greatly assist me in evaluating this inheritance proposition. Once I have all the facts, I will be better equipped to make an informed decision. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing from you with more details.

It is important you understand that I am not against contacting your Bank, or seeking advice., However the point I am making is that before you say anything, you MUST be 99% sure and give accurate information. If you may know, I doubt also as a Minister of God, with over 2,000 congregations, preaching the words of God to people. My bible teaches me that good names are better than riches , if I have an evil mind, I could have not informed you about this Inheritance, and you will not be aware. Should I decide to claim it if I am a dubious person I never asked you to give me any cent from your inheritance.. I am doing my job as a professional auditor, and I tell you that these are Bank systems across the board. They will NEVER inform the beneficiaries who are supposed to inherit such funds, as Top executive and Board of Directors sit on people 's inheritance and they become extremely rich to themselves and yet to unborn children . Therefore, I owe it first to God almighty to do what is right at all times. Since your inheritance is legal, you don't have any problem, and most importantly, these funds have no illicit activities attached . Either MONEY LAUNDRY OR TERRORIST As I informed you , all the documentation, is what we are doing internally , once we conclude with legalization of the documents, and obtain the Affidavit of claim, from court of competent jurisdiction here in UK., your file will be moved to the Bank that will release these funds to you, immediately within 48hours. It is no rocket Science , but all details and information is legal and legitimate. I hope with this clarification, you are well informed, that this transaction is legal and 100% risk free.

If by \\"optimal pc coupling\\" you are referring to how components inside a PC case connect or interact with each other for optimal performance, it's best to follow these general guidelines: 1. **Cooling:** Proper cooling is essential. Use an appropriate combination of case fans, CPU coolers, and, if necessary, GPU coolers to maintain optimal operating temperatures. 2. **Cable Management:** Proper cable management ensures good airflow and can also make it easier to work inside your PC case in the future. 3. **Component Selection:** Make sure that all your components are compatible with each other. For example, the motherboard should fit the case form factor (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, etc.), the power supply should provide enough wattage and connectors for all components, and the CPU cooler should fit both the CPU socket and within the case without obstructing other components or fans. 4. **Expansion and Upgrades:** If you plan to upgrade your PC in the future, ensure that the case has enough room for additional storage, more RAM, larger graphics cards, or additional cooling solutions. 5. **Dust Filters:** If the case has dust filters, ensure they are in place and maintained regularly to keep dust out of the system. 6. **Anti-Static Measures:** Whenever working on your PC, use anti-static wrist straps or other measures to prevent static electricity from damaging sensitive components. In terms of whether to use a PC case or not (\\"case or no case\\"), using a case is highly recommended because it: - Provides physical protection for components from dust, spills, and accidental impacts. - Blocks electromagnetic interference that can affect system stability and performance. - Offers a structured environment for optimal airflow and cooling. - Reduces noise from fans and other components. - Can be aesthetically pleasing and can be customized with lighting or window panels to showcase components. While some hobbyists and enthusiasts might run \\"open bench\\" setups for ease of access and testing, or for custom cooling solutions like extreme overclocking with liquid nitrogen, this is generally not recommended for most users due to the risks and impracticality for everyday use."},{"instruction":"translate to english, dont change symbol and line break.

When you crop an area with a label of class 2, you want to save any polygons within that cropped area that are labeled with class 0. Below is an example Python script using the \`PIL\` library for image handling and the \`Shapely\` library for geometric operations. This script assumes you have two data structures: 1. \`image\`: A PIL image object which you want to crop. 2. \`polygons\`: A list of dictionaries, each containing a Shapely \`Polygon\` object and a class label. The script will: 1. Find the bounding polygons of class 2. 2. Crop the image to the bounding box of each class 2 polygon. 3. Check for class 0 polygons within the bounding box of the class 2 polygon. 4. If any class 0 polygons are found, they are included with the crop. \`\`\`python from PIL import Image from shapely.geometry import Polygon # Replace PIL_image_path with the actual path to your image image = Image.open('PIL_image_path.jpeg') # Your polygon labels data structure (example provided, replace with your actual data) polygons = [ {'polygon': Polygon([(10, 10), (20, 10), (20, 20), (10, 20)]), 'class': 0}, # ... other polygons with class 0, 1, or 2 {'polygon': Polygon([(50, 50), (200, 50), (200, 200), (50, 200)]), 'class': 2}, ] def crop_and_save(image, class_2_polygon, enclosed_class_0_polygons): minx, miny, maxx, maxy = class_2_polygon.bounds cropped_image = image.crop((minx, miny, maxx, maxy)) # Do something with the enclosed_class_0_polygons within the cropped image if needed # Save the cropped image; filename can be changed based on your needs cropped_image.save(f'cropped_class_2_{minx}_{miny}.png') # Iterate through each polygon to check for class 2 for polygon_data in polygons: if polygon_data['class'] == 2: class_2_polygon = polygon_data['polygon'] enclosed_class_0_polygons = [] # Check other polygons for any class 0 inside the bounding box of class 2 polygon for other_polygon_data in polygons: if other_polygon_data['class'] == 0 and class_2_polygon.contains(other_polygon_data['polygon']): enclosed_class_0_polygons.append(other_polygon_data['polygon']) if enclosed_class_0_polygons: crop_and_save(image, class_2_polygon, enclosed_class_0_polygons) \`\`\` This script makes several assumptions: - You have a list of polygons labeled with class identifiers. - You are familiar with the \`PIL\` and \`Shapely\` libraries or you can install them using \`pip install Pillow\` and \`pip install Shapely\`.

However, the script you've provided has several issues that need to be addressed: 1. It uses the \`Polygon\` type and \`cascaded_union\` function without the proper imports. 2. The \`crop_polygon\` function appears to create a single \`class0_polygons\` list with the same coordinates as the class 2 polygon being cropped, which is incorrect. 3. It overwrites the \`new_img\` after pasting the cropped image, so the previous work of drawing the polygon mask on it is discarded. 4. The function is hard-coded to expect a class ID of 2, which might not work with different inputs or scenarios. To solve these issues, we should: - Use \`shapely.ops.unary_union\` instead of \`cascaded_union\` (the latter is deprecated). - Calculate the class 0 polygons correctly, based on actual data.

The main issue with the code you've provided is that the \`class_0_polygons\` parameter is not being passed properly to the \`crop_polygon\` function from within the \`process_image\` function. Let's fix the code and ensure that all necessary arguments are passed correctly. Here's the updated \`process_image\` function along with the necessary modifications: \`\`\`python def process_image(image_name, image_dir, labels_dir, save_dir): image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, image_name) polygons = get_polygons_for_image(image_name, labels_dir) class_0_polygons = [coords for class_id, coords in polygons if class_id == 0] # Add this line for index, (class_id, polygon_coordinates) in enumerate(polygons): if class_id == 2: # Only process polygons with class_id == 2 # The save_dir passed here should only be the top-level directory; the class directory is handled inside crop_polygon crop_polygon(image_path, class_id, polygon_coordinates, image_path, save_dir, class_0_polygons) # Modify this line \`\`\` I also noticed that your code imports \`Image\` and \`ImageDraw\` twice, and \`parse_coordinates\` function is defined but not used. Remember that the \`get_polygons_for_image\` function assumes your label file contains the class_id followed by pairs of polygon coordinates in each line. Make sure the format matches your actual data. Ensure the folders you specify in \`image_dir\`, \`labels_dir\`, and \`save_dir\` exist. Here is an example of what your label files might look like: \`\`\` 0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.1 2 0.4 0.4 0.6 0.4 0.6 0.6 0.4 0.6 \`\`\` If the format of your label files is different, you'll need to update \`get_polygons_for_image\` correspondingly to correctly parse the class labels and coordinates. Finally, it's important that the code running the \`main\` function does not create shared mutable state or rely on the global interpreter lock (GIL), because \`ProcessPoolExecutor\` uses separate processes that do not share memory. With these adjustments, your code should now correctly crop the polygons of class 2, save the associated cropped images, and handle class 0 polygons labels within those class 2 polygons as intended."},{"instruction":"give me all the code with update part","output":"Certainly!

역시 보나스로만 몇억 대 받은 PD님 다운 포스구만?” “반려할 거면 빨리 말해요. 다 엎고 여행이나 가게.” 회수하려는 윤병선 PD에게서 투명 파일을 휙 뺏은 예능 국장이, 앞쪽 탁자에 놓인 펜을 빠르게 집었다. “농담이다 임마. 아니, 내가 말했잖아? 너 일일이 사인받지 말고 그냥 알아서 추진하라니까? 사장님도 그렇게 하라 했다매.” “난 그냥 이게 좋아요. 뭔가 일이 진행되고 있는 기분이 들어서.” “하여튼 특이한 놈. 어이구야- 이게이게 지금 진행비가 얼마여?” “고 밑에 이번 출장비도 있어요.” “자! 사인했다.” 투명 파일을 넘긴 예능 국장이 돌연 실실 웃었다. “그나저나 다른 출연자들이야 그렇다 치는데. 너 강우진 이렇게 될지 알고 뽑았냐? 아니, 니가 처음 말했을 때는 한량 빼곤 걔 뭣도 없었을 때 아니냐? 근데 지금은······일본까지 진출한 최초의 신인이고. 솔직히 불어, 너 뭐 능력 같은 거 있지?” “있겠습니까?” “없는데 왜 너가 잡은 특이한 애들은 죄다 뜨냐고. 특히 강우진은 진짜 파격적이다, 파격적이야.” “우진씨가 좀 특이 케이스긴 하죠.” “좀? 좀으로 되냐 그게? 25년 넘게 예능밥 먹은 나도 처음 본다고 그런 캐릭터. 어떻게 1년도 안 된 신인 애가 연예계에 이런 파도를 일으켜?” 짧은 머리를 쓸어넘긴 윤병선 PD가 소파서 일어나면서도. “능력이 있다면 내가 아니라 우진씨한테 있겠죠. ‘우리네 식탁’ 방송되면 더 놀라실 겁니다.” “왜? 강우진 걔한테 또 뭐가 있어?” “갑니다-” 멀어지는 윤병선 PD의 등에다 대고 예능 국장이 다급히 외쳤다. “야야! 근데 ‘우리네 식탁’ 시즌1은 어디로 할 건지 결정했냐?! 일본이여??” 곧, 문을 연 윤병선 PD가 고개를 저었다. “아니요, 미국부터 시작할 겁니다.” 답한 그가 국장실을 나오자 주변에서 대기하고 있던 조연출과 작가들이 붙었다. 안경을 추겨 올린 윤병선 PD가 그들에게 직구로 지시했다. “바로 미팅 좀 하자.” “옙!” “그리고 출연자들 연락 돌려. 슬슬 1화로 쓸 초반 인터뷰 영상 촬영 잡아야 하니까. 특히 우진씨는 일정 확실히 확인해라? 아마 제일 바쁠 거야.” “촬영할 음식점들 섭외 들어갈게요.” “어- 그리고 출연자들한테 시즌1은 미국이라는 것도 알려줘.” “네네, 한식 종류는 결정하셨어요?” 엘리베이터 버튼을 누른 윤병선 PD가 웃으며 답했다. “K분식어때, K분식.” 같은 시각, 일본. 도쿄역과 가까운 유라쿠초역 근방. 멀리서도 보이는 높디높은, 대체로 각진 느낌의 건물이 눈에 띈다. 이미 알 사람은 아는 대기업 카시히 그룹의 본사였다. 그런 카시히 그룹 건물의 꼭대기 층. 복도부터 뭔가 고급진 느낌이 가득한 곳에 이 회사 오너의 방이 있었다. 즉, 회장실. 주인은 당연히 요시무라 히데키 회장. 최근 강우진의 존재를 손자 덕에 안 히데키 회장의 방은 호텔을 연상케 할 정도로 넓었다. 다만, 특이한 것은 책이 상당히 많다는 것. 한쪽 벽면을 가득 채울 정도에, 탁자나 커다란 소파들 주변에도 책들이 넘쳐났다. 이런 것들을 보면 히데키 회장이 얼마나 책을 읽어대는지 알 수 있는 대목이었고. “음-” 창가 쪽 커다란 책상, 정장 재킷은 벗은 히데키 회장은 현재 비서실장에서 보고를 듣는 중이었다. “말씀하신 강우진은 현재 일본 일정은 마치고 한국으로 돌아간 상태입니다.” 그녀의 보고와 함께 올려진 서류를 확인한, 코끝에 안경을 걸친 히데키 회장이 천천히 고개를 끄덕인다. “아쉽군. 다시 일본으로 온다는 얘기는 없던가.” “예, 현재로서는.” “그래. 계속해봐.” 이어 깔끔한 인상의, 머리를 한 줄로 묶은 비서실장이 준비된 멘트를 뱉었다. “현재 강우진은 한국에서 대단한 기세입니다. 데뷔 때 찍은 단편 영화부터 시작해, 그다음 드라마가 시청률 25%까지 찍으면서 얼굴을 알렸습니다. 다음으로······” 그녀는 강우진의 시작부터 지금까지의 필모를 줄줄줄 읊었다. 이미 언론에 대부분 소개됐기에 찾는 건 수월했고, 우진에게 거물들이 들러붙는다는 것도 추가했다. “일본에선 한량이 런칭한 상태고, 드라마 ‘남사친’이 예정돼 있습니다. 알고 계신 타노구치 쿄타로 감독의 ‘낯기생’은 제작 준비 중입니다. 강우진의 일본 인지도가 치솟은 건 ‘낯기생’때문이었습니다.” “음, 그래. ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’ 책은 나도 재미있게 읽었었지.” “강우진의 한국, 일본의 이슈나 화제성은 매우 치솟고 있습니다. 특히 한국은 독보적인 것으로 확인했습니다.” 뒤로 계속해서 보고를 듣던 히데키 회장의 표정에 약간 의아함이 묻었다. 곧, 보고서를 검지로 툭툭 친 그가 비서실장에게 차분히 물었다. “이 모든 게 고작 1년도 안 돼 일어났다는 건가.” “그렇습니다.” “이런 경우가 있어? 나는 좀 놀라운데. 우리 쪽 본사나 계열사들과 계약한 광고 모델들도 보면, 최소 무명이 3년에서 5년은 가졌잖나.” “유별난 케이스긴 합니다. 한국은 확실친 않으나, 일본에선 최초로 보셔도 무방할 정돕니다.” “그럼 한국에서도 그가 유일하겠지.” 솔직히 히데키 회장은 퍽 충격이었다. 강우진이란 한국 배우의 필모가 가히 심상치 않았으니까. 이건 동질감을 떠나, 그저 사업가의 눈으로 봐도 관심을 가질 정도의 속도와 결과들이었다. ‘나와 동일한 힘든 시간을 보냈을 텐데도- 이 정도의 일을 해냈다는 건가? 나이도 이렇게나 어린데······연기에, 일본어에, 일본 수어까지. 심지어 너튜브 채널은 노래가 주제구만. 다재다능해. 뭣보다.’ 보고서를 한 장 넘긴 히데키 회장은 강우진과 관련된 주변인에 집중했고. ‘근방에 빼어난 인물들이 많아. 거물들이랄지. 타노구치 쿄타로 감독을 포함해서 말이야.’ 한 가지를 확신했다. “얼마나 피나는 노력을 해왔을지 감도 안 잡히는군.” “예?” “아니야. 수어 쪽 정보는 없었나.” “네, 회장님. 수어 쪽은 전혀 나오는 게 없었습니다.” 고개 끄덕인 히데키 회장이 주제를 바꿨다. “이 친구 에이전시는 그리 크지 않구만. bw 엔터?” “예. 오픈한 지 얼마 되지 않았습니다. 한국의 엔터들과 비교하면 매우 협소합니다.” “신생이란 얘기군.” “소속 배우도 강우진과 탑배우인 홍혜연 두 명이 전부입니다.” “아- 그 여배우 말이지.” “예. 다만, 최근 강우진이나 홍혜연의 성과가 급부상한 모양인지, 회사의 확장을 노리고 있는 듯합니다.” “아 그래? 규모를 키운다라-” 말끝을 흐리던 히데키 회장의 눈빛이 변했다. 약간의 흥미가 섞인다. “일단 그릇이 커야 담기는 것도 많은 법이지. 이 부분 좀 더 확실히 확인해보지.” “···알겠습니다.” “특이점은?” 되물음에 비서실장이 ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’ 이야기를 꺼냈다. “쉬쉬하고 있는 듯하지만, 제가 확인해본 바로는 ‘낯기생’에 문제가 좀 있는 것 같습니다.” 여기서 히데키 회장의 눈알이 휙 올라갔다. 꽤 놀랐다는 듯. “문제? 무슨 문제?” 순간, 자신의 손자인 신고의 얼굴을 떠올리는 그. 정확히는 ‘낯기생’을 같이 보자는 약속을 상기한 히데키 회장의 미간이 확 구겨졌다. “혹시, 돈 문젠가?” “정확합니다. 투자금 문젭니다.” 천천히 고개 끄덕인 히데키 회장의 얼굴이 약간 편안해졌다. “돈이라면 아무 문제 없는 거와 같아.” 한편, 한국. 장소는 서울의 한 음향 스튜디오였다. 하지만 규모가 작지 않다. 그래서인지 메인 녹음실의 크기는 퍽 커다랬다. 정면에 여러 모니터와 스크린, 음향을 위한 각종 소품들, 버튼이 즐비한 음향기기들, 그 기기 뒤쪽으로 비치된 수십 의자들. 50명은 너끈히 수용하지 않을까? 실제로 그랬다. 지금 이 스튜디오 안엔 30명 넘는 인원이 자리한 상태니까. 조명은 어두컴컴했다. 그중 중앙 의자에 앉은 강우진이 보였다. 오늘도 역시 시니컬함의 극치였다. 허나. ‘나, 나온다!’ 속으로는 흥분이 고조되고 있었다. 그 이유가 정면 스크린을 통해 출력됐다. -♬♪ 스튜디오에 울려 퍼지는 BGM. 웅장하며 무겁다. 그 뒤로 거뭇하던 스크린 중앙에 흰색 글자들이 박힌다. 투자 관련 수많은 이름들, 그리곤 급작스레 음향의 볼륨이 높아진다. 동시에 스크린에 커다란 글자가 나타났다. -[마약상] 블랙과 레드가 섞인 색이었고 글자 스타일은 거칠다. 곧, 타이틀이 연기처럼 사라지며 다른 글자가 나온다. 이번에도 거친 느낌. -[진재준] 배우들의 이름이었고. -[박판서] 주연들의 이름 뒤로 한 명의 배우 이름이 추가됐다. -[그리고 강우진] ‘마약상’의 첫 상영이 시작됐다. < 뒷배 (2) > 끝","output":"< Support (2) > The eyes of the chief of staff sitting in the passenger seat widened slightly. It was more out of curiosity than shock. She cautiously asked Chairman Hideki, who was sitting in the back, in Japanese. \\"Excuse me, but I would like to confirm once again. Is it Kang Woo-jin, the rookie actor from Korea?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"......\\" When there was no answer, Chairman Hideki, who had been reading the newspaper, lowered it and his gaze shifted to the chief of staff in the passenger seat. \\"Is it too sudden to understand?\\" \\"...No. It's just a bit unexpected.\\" \\"That makes sense.\\" The chairman, who had been smiling gently, continued to look at the newspaper but muttered briefly. His voice was relaxed. \\"But you just need to do it. Sometimes curiosity can be a poison.\\" The chief of staff, whose face was filled with tension, turned around and bowed his head immediately. \\"Yes, yes. I understand. Should I check in detail?\\" To her question, Chairman Hideki, who had been stroking his chin, shook his head. \\"No. Just roughly, his recent activities and his agency. That should be enough for the works.\\" Afterward. Although Kang Woo-jin and Hwarin returned to Korea, the aftermath of their schedule in Japan was quite significant. Especially from the Japanese side. \\"「Kang Woo-jin, Hwarin」 appear at the arrival hall\\" \\"「Kang Woo-jin, Hwarin」's arrival at the airport draws a crowd of about 500 people/Entertainment News\\" From their arrival at the airport, which turned it upside down, to the incredible crowd that had gathered at the arrival hall, it was enough to provoke the Japanese media. \\"「Kang Woo-jin」 waves to the excited Japanese fans, he was calmer than expected\\" It was too bustling for the appearance of an actor from another country, not their own. Even though Hwarin was with him, it was still noisy. However, the Japanese media, unlike in the beginning, occasionally wrote articles with a negative perspective. \\"「Fuss, what's so special about the rookie actor from Korea?」 The voice of the opposition to Kang Woo-jin grows louder\\" Articles that followed the stimulation and shock tended to be more negative than positive. It was a natural scene. The same was true in Korea. Regardless. \\"「Kang Woo-jin」 marked by Director Kyotaro Tanoguchi, what will his schedule in Japan be?\\" In Japan, they were churning out as much news as possible about the currently best-selling topic. The main themes were similar or updated issues. \\"100,000 subscribers in just a week? The soaring popularity of 「Kang Woo-jin」 in Korea and Japan\\" \\"Numerous fans flock to the event with 「Kang Woo-jin, Hwarin」 hosted by 'Netflix Japan'\\" A really large number of photos were spread through articles. Some were taken by reporters, but many were from the cell phones of the Japanese public. Naturally, this was not only in the Japanese media but also spread throughout SNS and communities. -I saw Kang Woo-jin at the airport and he was really, really more handsome than I thought!! 'Netflix Japan' and 'Ametalk show!' also contributed to the related news. Of course, occasionally, there were articles in the form of gossip. \\"Rumors of investors pulling out from the controversial 'Night Parasite', film company insiders say \\"There's no such thing\\"\\" But they were in the minority and did not receive much attention. The focus was on 'Ametalk show!' which had recently finished recording with Kang Woo-jin. \\"「Ametalk show!」 becomes the first for Kang Woo-jin, the public explodes with curiosity after the news of the recording's end\\" In a way, it could be considered the biggest part of Kang Woo-jin's schedule in Japan. The 'Ametalk show!' that Woo-jin participated in had many items. The first rookie actor from Korea, guest Hwarin, Woo-jin's vocals, talk, and also. \\"「Ametalk show!」 production team \\"Kang Woo-jin has extraordinary abilities\\"\\" Even the hidden abilities of Kang Woo-jin. Since Woo-jin was so hot in Japan, the reaction was immediate. -Ametalk is doing a good job! I have to watch the live broadcast for the first time in a while! -Hwarin is a guest?!? They look really good together in the photos of them entering the country, aren't they dating? -It's because of comments like yours that false rumors start -I'm not really into that actor? I wish he would drop out of Night Parasite! -After watching Hanryang, he acts well but... there's a strange feeling -What's with the weird talk? Our country's actors are trash, aren't they? -Kang Woo-jin! Cute! When can we see him on Ametalk!? -I saw Kang Woo-jin at the airport, and I really felt that Japan lacks a lot in visuals compared to Korea... -I'm also really looking forward to Night Parasite, aren't I?? · · · · While the anticipation exceeded half, there were also a few comments that were twisted or openly critical. Well, this was a natural course of action for a rising star, so it wasn't a big problem. Regardless of what it was, the core was. -Subscribe to Kang Woo-jin's SNS and YouTube! You can see his real self! Kang Woo-jin's recognition in Japan was growing day by day. By this point, there was no way the Korean media would ignore the situation in Japan. \\"Currently, Japan is smitten with the 'monster rookie' Kang Woo-jin, his popularity spreading like a trend/Photos\\" In colloquial terms, was it called 'national pride'? Articles analyzing Kang Woo-jin's popularity in Japan also emerged. \\"Marketing experts on 'Kang Woo-jin's unbelievable popularity in Japan \\"The stagnant Japanese entertainment industry played a part\\"\\" It was natural for the Korean public opinion to be uplifted. September 1st, Tuesday. At the HTBS broadcasting station in Seoul. Despite it being morning, the entertainment department office looked incredibly busy at a glance. The PDs of various programs were busy with phone calls or meetings with writers, and the desks and empty spaces around the office were filled with various props. It was like a bustling market. In the director's office of the entertainment department, which was different from the outside, the atmosphere was relatively calm, and in the central 5-person sofa, a man with a protruding belly and a familiar man with glasses were seen. It was the entertainment director and the entertainment mogul, PD Yoon Byung-sun. \\"Our Yoon PD, isn't it too hard to see your face?\\" \\"Should I take a break then? Maybe crack some peanuts at the pub in front of us with the director?\\" \\"What director. Man, when you keep calling me director, it really tickles me. Just do it like usual.\\" \\"No, if I keep saying 'hyung hyung', I'll look too old.\\" \\"You are old.\\" Recently, PD Yoon Byung-sun was almost never in Korea. The reason was simple. It was because of 'Our Dining Table', which was announced to the world from planning to cast members, and would be a major variety show. Since the filming location was overseas, he traveled between Japan and the United States. PD Yoon Byung-sun returned from the United States two days ago. Anyway, PD Yoon Byung-sun handed over a transparent file he had brought to the director. \\"Anyway, I'm busy today. Just sign this quickly.\\" \\"Wow- What did Star PD leave for a signature? As expected, the posture of a PD who receives several hundred million as a bonus?\\" \\"If you're going to reject it, tell me quickly. I'll scrap everything and go on a trip.\\" As PD Yoon Byung-sun tried to retrieve the transparent file, the entertainment director snatched it quickly and picked up the pen on the table in front. \\"It's a joke, man. No, didn't I tell you? You don't have to get every signature, just proceed on your own? The president also said to do so.\\" \\"I just like this. It feels like something is progressing.\\" \\"Anyway, you're peculiar. Oh my- How much is this progress fee?\\" \\"And there's also the travel expenses for this trip.\\" \\"Done! I signed it.\\" The entertainment director who handed over the transparent file suddenly smiled. \\"But aside from the other cast members, did you know Kang Woo-jin would turn out like this? When you first mentioned him, he had nothing but Hanryang, right? But now he's... the first rookie to expand to Japan. Honestly, tell me, do you have some kind of ability?\\" \\"Do I?\\" \\"If you don't, then why do all the peculiar kids you pick always rise? Especially Kang Woo-jin, it's really exceptional.\\" \\"Woo-jin is a bit of a special case.\\" \\"A bit? Can you call that a bit? I've been eating variety for over 25 years and I've never seen such a character. How can a rookie who hasn't even been a year cause such a wave in the entertainment industry?\\" PD Yoon Byung-sun, who had brushed back his short hair, stood up from the sofa and said. \\"If there is an ability, it's not with me but with Woo-jin. You'll be even more surprised when 'Our Dining Table' is broadcast.\\" \\"Why? Does Kang Woo-jin have something else?\\" \\"I'm leaving-\\" As PD Yoon Byung-sun walked away, the entertainment director called out to his back urgently. \\"Hey! But have you decided where to do 'Our Dining Table' Season 1?! Japan??\\" Soon, PD Yoon Byung-sun, who opened the door, shook his head. \\"No, we'll start with the United States.\\" After he answered and left the director's office, the assistant directors and writers who had been waiting nearby approached him. PD Yoon Byung-sun, who had pushed up his glasses, gave them a direct order. \\"Let's have a meeting right away.\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"And contact the cast members. We need to schedule the initial interview videos for Episode 1 soon. Especially confirm Woo-jin's schedule for sure? He's probably the busiest.\\" \\"I'll start securing the restaurants for filming.\\" \\"Oh- and let the cast members know that Season 1 will be in the United States.\\" \\"Yes, have you decided on the types of Korean food?\\" PD Yoon Byung-sun, who pressed the elevator button, answered with a smile. \\"How about K-snacks, K-snacks.\\" At the same time, in Japan. Near Yurakucho Station, close to Tokyo Station. A tall, mostly angular building stood out from afar. It was the headquarters of the well-known conglomerate, Kashihi Group. At the top floor of the Kashihi Group building. From the hallway, there was a sense of luxury, and in this place was the room of the company's owner. That is, the chairman's office. The owner was, of course, Chairman Yoshimura Hideki. Recently, Hideki, who learned of Kang Woo-jin's existence thanks to his grandson, had an office that was as spacious as a hotel. However, what was peculiar was the large number of books. Enough to fill one wall, and even around the tables and large sofas, books were overflowing. From these things, one could tell how much Chairman Hideki read. \\"Hmm-\\" At the large desk near the window, Hideki, who had taken off his suit jacket, was currently listening to a report from the chief of staff. \\"Kang Woo-jin, whom you mentioned, has finished his schedule in Japan and returned to Korea.\\" As she reported and presented the documents, Hideki, with glasses on the tip of his nose, slowly nodded his head. \\"That's a shame. Is there no talk of him coming back to Japan?\\" \\"Not at the moment.\\" \\"I see. Continue.\\" The chief of staff, with a neat impression and her hair tied in a single line, delivered the prepared remarks. \\"Currently, Kang Woo-jin is making a tremendous impact in Korea. Starting with the short film he debuted in, he became known with the next drama hitting a 25% viewership rating. Next...\\" She recited Kang Woo-jin's filmography from the beginning to the present. Since most of it had already been introduced in the media, it was easy to find, and she added that big names were clinging to Woo-jin. \\"In Japan, Hanryang has been launched, and the drama 'Male Friend' is scheduled. 'Night Parasite' by Director Kyotaro Tanoguchi, whom you know, is in pre-production. Kang Woo-jin's soaring recognition in Japan was due to 'Night Parasite'.\\" \\"Hmm, that's right. I also enjoyed reading the book 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger'.\\" \\"Kang Woo-jin's issues and topicality in Korea and Japan are skyrocketing. Especially in Korea, it has been confirmed to be unparalleled.\\" As the chief of staff continued to report, a hint of wonder appeared on Chairman Hideki's face. Soon, tapping the report with his index finger, he calmly asked the chief of staff. \\"All of this happened in less than a year?\\" \\"That's correct.\\" \\"Has there been such a case? I find it quite surprising. Even if you look at the advertising models contracted with our headquarters or affiliates, they had at least 3 to 5 years of obscurity.\\" \\"It is an unusual case. It may not be certain in Korea, but in Japan, it can be considered unprecedented.\\" \\"Then he must be unique in Korea as well.\\" Honestly, Chairman Hideki was quite shocked. The filmography of Kang Woo-jin, the Korean actor, was quite extraordinary. This was beyond a sense of kinship; it was something that would attract attention even from a businessman's perspective due to the speed and results. 'Even though he must have gone through the same hard times as me- has he achieved this much? He's so young... in acting, Japanese, Japanese sign language, and even his YouTube channel is focused on singing. He's versatile. Most of all.' As Chairman Hideki turned the page of the report, he focused on the people related to Kang Woo-jin. 'There are many outstanding individuals nearby. Big names, including Director Kyotaro Tanoguchi.' He was certain of one thing. \\"I can't even imagine how much painstaking effort he must have put in.\\" \\"Sir?\\" \\"Never mind. Was there no information about sign language?\\" \\"No, Chairman. There was nothing about sign language.\\" Nodding his head, Chairman Hideki changed the subject. \\"This guy's agency isn't that big, huh. bw entertainment?\\" \\"Yes. It hasn't been open for long. Compared to other entertainment companies in Korea, it's very small.\\" \\"A newcomer, you say.\\" \\"There are only two actors under the agency, Kang Woo-jin and top actress Hong Hye-yeon.\\" \\"Ah- that actress.\\" \\"Yes. However, it seems that the company is aiming to expand due to the recent surge in achievements of Kang Woo-jin and Hong Hye-yeon.\\" \\"Is that so? They're planning to grow in size-\\" As Chairman Hideki trailed off, his eyes lit up with a hint of interest. \\"First, the bigger the vessel, the more it can hold. Let's check this part out more thoroughly.\\" \\"···Understood.\\" \\"Any peculiarities?\\" In response to the question, the chief of staff brought up the story of 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger.' \\"It seems to be kept quiet, but from what I've checked, there seems to be a problem with 'Night Parasite'.\\" At this point, Chairman Hideki's eyes shot up. He seemed quite surprised. \\"Problem? What kind of problem?\\" For a moment, he thought of his grandson Shingo. Precisely, he remembered the promise to watch 'Night Parasite' together, and Chairman Hideki's brow furrowed deeply. \\"Is it a money problem?\\" \\"That's correct. It's about the investment funds.\\" Chairman Hideki, who slowly nodded, looked somewhat relieved. \\"If it's money, it's as good as no problem.\\" Meanwhile, in Korea. The location was a sound studio in Seoul. However, it was not small in scale. Perhaps that's why the size of the main recording studio was quite large. In front of it were various monitors and screens, props for sound, sound equipment with numerous buttons, and dozens of chairs visible behind the equipment. Could it accommodate at least 50 people? In reality, it did. Currently, there were over 30 people seated in this studio. The lighting was dim. Among them, Kang Woo-jin was seen sitting in the center chair. Today, as always, he was the epitome of cynicism. However. 'I'm coming out!' Inside, he was filled with excitement. The reason was displayed on the screen in front. -♬♪ The BGM echoed throughout the studio. It was grand and heavy. Then, white letters appeared in the center of the dark screen. Numerous names related to investment, and suddenly the volume of the sound increased. At the same time, large letters appeared on the screen. -[Drug Dealer] The color was a mix of black and red, and the style of the letters was rough. Soon, the title disappeared like smoke, and other letters appeared. This time, they also had a rough feel. -[Jin Jae-joon] It was the names of the actors. -[Park Pan-seo] After the names of the leading actors, one more actor's name was added. -[And Kang Woo-jin] The first screening of 'Drug Dealer' began. < Support (2) > End"},{"instruction":"< 역습 (1) > 확실했다. 로봇 같은 여자 음성은 분명 하나가 아닌 두 개의 선물을 준다고 선포했다. 이에 강우진은 살짝 당황했다. “하나도 아니고 두 개나 준다고??” 없던 일이니까. 영어부터 시작해 일본어나 수어 그리고 가창력까지. 지금까지는 무조건 하나의 선물을 던지던 아공간이었다. 그런데 지금은 두 개를 준단다. “테크닉 그리고 레시피.” 솔직히 능력을 얻을 거라는 기대는 컸고 가능성도 높다 생각한 우진이었다. 그런데 두 개는 예상을 벗어난다. 뭣보다 타이밍이 묘했다. 왜 지금? 이 상황에? 그러다 강우진은 뭔가를 직감했다. “아공간이 발전- 하고있는 건가?” 확실하진 않지만 그런 느낌이었다. 언제나 설명은 없는 불친절한 아공간이지만, 현 상태로 봐선 강우진과 같이 아공간도 성장하고 있는 게 아닐까? 그런 거 있잖아. 게임 같은 거. 퀘스트를 깨면 보상이 늘어나듯이 아공간도 비슷한 게 아니려나? “퀘스트가 뜬 적은 없긴 해.” 강우진이 아공간을 잘 활용할수록 부여되는 선물의 폭이 거대해지는 걸지도. 뭐, 대충 그렇게 이해하자. 어차피 아공간을 파악하는 건 불가능하잖아? 거기다. “준다는데 나야 땡큐지.” 굳이 거절할 필요도, 거절할 방법도 없었다. 강우진은 그저 웃으면서 받아들이면 됐다. ‘이러면······앞으로 점차 2개에서 3개 또는 4개 5개도 받을 수 있는 건가?’ 옅었던 기대감이 폭발한다. 역시 아공간 최고. 쌍엄지도 부족했다. 그저 갓. 그때였다. [“‘셰프의 테크닉·레시피’ 리딩 준비 중······”] [“······준비 완료. ‘셰프의 테크닉·레시피’ 리딩을 시작합니다.”] 반가운 여자 목소리를 끝으로 거대한 회색이 강우진을 덥친다. 기세는 공포스럽지만 강우진은 미소 짓고 있었다. 허나 아랫배가 알싸한 고통은 여전했다. “읏.” 이어. -스으. 천천히 두 눈을 뜨는 강우진. 공간은 ‘가창력’을 강화했던 곳과 같았다. 직전의 아공간과 비슷하게 끝없이 컴컴하다. 다만. “아.” 금세 강우진은 다른 점을 파악했다. 그 차이점은 고개를 왼쪽으로 돌렸을 때 확인할 수 있었다. 언제나 혼자 있던 강우진이었으나, 왼편을 보니 강우진이 한 명 더 있었다. 아니 더 확실히 말하자면. “거울?” 서 있는 강우진의 반사체가 보였다. 눈을 끔뻑이는 것도, 손을 올려보는 것도, 발을 들어보는 것도 모두 따라 하는 우진의 반사체. ‘선물이 두 개라서?’ 신비롭다. 그런 기분이었다. 공간은 온통 컴컴한데 자신과 또 다른 자아가 존재하는 느낌. 바로 이때. “온다.” 저 멀리서 요상한 모양들이 날아들기 시작했다. 우진은 모양들이 지척에 가까워서야 뭔지를 이해했다. 음식들. 강우진의 몸에 빠르게 다가와 스며드는 것은 숱한 음식이었다. 이게 ‘셰프의 레시피’? 재밌는 건. “맛, 맛이 왜 느껴지냐?” 음식이 스며들 때 한기가 들긴 하지만 마치 스며든 음식을 먹고 있는 것 같았다. 선명한 맛이 느껴졌으니까. 그쯤 왼편에 보이는 강우진의 반사체 역시 뭔가에 공격당하고 있었다. 움직이는 칼, 현란한 웍 등등. 수많은 도구들이었다. 다음 날 13일, 일본 도쿄. 시간은 8시를 조금 넘겼다. 장소는 ‘토에가’ 영화사의 주차장. 점차 차들이 들어차는 사이 멀뚱히 선 쿄타로 감독이 눈에 띈다. “······” 표정은 굳었다. 그저 누군가를 기다리는 듯 주차장 입구를 바라본다. 그렇다면 그는 왜 이 시간에, 그것도 ‘낯기생’이 무너지는 순간에 여기서 시간을 보내고 있는가? 이유는 심플했다. ‘카시히 그룹이- 투자금을 대준다고?’ 어제 전화 왔던 테츠가와 리리라는 여자 때문이었다. 여기서 쿄타로 감독은 그녀와의 통화를 상기했다. 쿄타로 감독은 이게 뭔 소린가 싶었지만. “······카시히 그룹이 ‘낯기생’의 투자금을 대주신다고 말씀하셨습니까?” 핸드폰 너머 리리의 목소리는 그저 차분했었다. “맞습니다. 그보다 혹시 주변에 사람이 있습니까?” “아- 예. 있습니다.” “그럼 자리를 옮겨주세요.” “···알겠습니다.” 복도로 나가던 쿄타로 감독은 장난 전화가 아닌가 의심했다. 어쨌거나 확인은 필요했다. “죄송하지만. 당신이 카시히 그룹 쪽 사람인 걸 어떻게 믿을 수 있습니까?” “안 믿으셔도 괜찮습니다.” “예?” “현재 저희는 ‘낯기생’의 상황을 아주 잘 알고 있습니다. 그럼에도 투자할 생각이고요.” “누가요?” “그건 직접 만나보시면 알게 되십니다.” 이 여자는 뭔가 달랐다. 말투에서 느껴지는 기품이 그랬고, 대화를 이끌어가는 아우라가 그랬다. “감독님, 내일 오전에 시간이 어떠실까요?” “오전 말입니까?” “네. 괜찮으시면 저희 쪽에서 차를 보내겠습니다.” 다른 투자자와 약속이 잡혀 있던 쿄타로 감독이었다. 그러나 왜인지 이 순간을 놓치면 안 될 것 같았다. 덕분에 쿄타로 감독은 희미한 기회를 놓치지 않았다. “내일 오전. 괜찮습니다.” “그럼 ‘토에가’ 영화사의 주차장으로 오전 8시까지 나와 계시면 됩니다. 도착한 차를 타시구요.” 여기까지. 상기하던 어제를 멈춘 쿄타로 감독이 다시금 현실, ‘토에가’ 영화사의 주차장으로 돌아왔다. 진짜일까? 정말 카시히 그룹이? 믿기진 않지만 믿고 싶기도 한 쿄타로 감독이었다. “난 그쪽과 인연이 없는데. 대체 무슨.” 카시히 그룹은 일본의 재계서열 10위 안에 드는 초거대 재벌가. 다만, 쿄타로 감독과는 전혀 연이 없었다. 그렇다면 혹시 아카리 작가? 그 순간. -우웅! 주차장 입구로 고급진 검은 세단이 스르륵 입장했다. 한눈에 봐도 비싸 보이는 외제차. 그렇기에 쿄타로 감독의 시선을 사로잡았고, 스르륵 움직이던 세단은 당연하다는 듯 그의 앞에 멈췄다. 이내. -덜컥! 조수석 차 문이 열리며 반듯한 인상의 정장 입은 여자가 내렸다. 자세가 꼿꼿하며 정갈하다. 그런 그녀가 쿄타로 감독에게 꾸벅 인사하면서도. “안녕하세요, 감독님. 뵙게 되어 영광입니다. 전화 드렸던 테츠가와 리리라고 합니다.” 차의 뒷문을 열며 타라는 시늉을 예의 있게 던졌다. “타세요.” “······” 곧, 쿄타로 감독은 홀린 듯 차에 올랐다. 그렇게 약 한 시간 뒤. 쿄타로 감독을 태운 고급 세단이 멈춘 곳은 탄성이 절로 터질 초대형 주택 앞이었다. 그 앞에서 긴 머리를 한 줄로 묶은 리리가 먼저 내렸고. -스윽. 차 뒷문을 열었다. 쿄타로 감독의 표정은 여전히 어안이 벙벙한 느낌. 오는 내내 그녀와 한마디 말도 못 했으니까. 어쨌든. “감독님, 따라오시면 됩니다.” 얼결에 차에서 내린 쿄타로 감독은 새치 머리를 긁으면서도 리리의 뒤를 따랐다. 드넓은 마당을 지나, 일하기 바쁜 열댓 명 직원을 지나, 입이 쩍 벌어질 가구들을 지나. “여깁니다.” 그녀의 안내가 멈춘 것은 갈색 나무문의 앞이었다. 곧, 리리가 문에 노크를 두드렸고. -똑똑. 안에서 까끌한 남자 목소리가 들렸다. “그래, 들어와요.” 여유가 느껴지는 음성. 이어 리리가 문을 열자 방의 내부가 쿄타로 감독의 눈에 보였다. 책이 한가득하다. 누가 봐도 서재인 공간. 그 중심에 놓인 커다란 책상. 그리고. “음, 반갑습니다. 타노구치 쿄타로 감독님.” 책상 옆에 선, 눈썹에 흰털이 자욱한 늙은 남자. 옅은 미소로 쿄타로 감독에게 손을 내미는 그였으나 형상이 백발의 사자와 같다. 쿄타로 감독은 그가 누구인지 단박에 알아챘다. ‘······요시무라 히데키 회장.’ 대 카시히 그룹을 일군 수장. 일본인이라면, 아니 일본 말고도 해외로도 존재감이 높은 그였으니까. ‘진짜였어.’ 즉, 카시히 그룹이 접촉해 온 건 거짓이 아닌 참이었다. 여기서 거장 쿄타로 감독은 정신을 다잡았다. 그럴만한 인물이었으며, 상황이었기에. “안녕하십니까 요시무라 회장님. 처음 뵈겠습니다.” “나는 감독님이 처음이 아니지요, 워낙 매스컴에 자주 보이시니까요.” “요즘 본의 아니게 일이 커졌습니다.” “일본 영화 감독하면 타노구치 쿄타로 감독님이니 그렇겠지요.” “과찬입니다.” 묘한 미소를 띠는 히데키 회장이 책상 앞쪽 3인 소파에 손짓했다. 앉으라는 뜻. 곧, 서재로 찻잔이 배달됐고 차 한잔을 음미한 히데키 회장이 물꼬를 텄다. “지금 준비하신다는 영화 ‘낯기생’. 상황이 많이 안 좋다고 들었어요. 실제 그렇습니까?” 에두르는 것 없이 바로 본론. 하지만 자세가 꼿꼿한 쿄타로 감독 역시 침착하게 받아쳤다. “그렇습니다.” “어느 정도까지?” “최소 언론에서 다루는 투자금 문제는 사실입니다.” “그렇군요.” 느긋하게 찻잔을 내린, 그러나 눈빛만큼은 냉철한 히데키 회장이 쿄타로 감독에게 다시 말했다. “투자금이 얼마나 빠져나갔나요.” “대략 70% 정도 됩니다.” “150억은 되겠군.” 순간 쿄타로 감독의 눈빛이 미세히 흔들렸다. 어떻게 투자금의 세세한 부분까지 알고 있는가? 그래도 일단은 침착하게 답하는 그. “비슷합니다.” “음- 좋아요, 그럼 구멍 난 투자금 내가 메꿔드리지. 기존보다 조금 더 얹어서. 그러니 판을 더 키워도 됩니다.” “!!!” “대신에 조건이 있어요.” “조, 조건 말입니까?” 다시금 찻잔을 든 히데키 회장의 답은 간결했다. “그 한국의 신인배우. 강우진은 계속 유지되야 합니다.” “······” “딴 배우들은 교체해도 상관없고.” 대답을 들은 쿄타로 감독은 약간 황당했다. 왜 여기서 우진씨가 나오지? 정말 생각지도 못했으니까. 저 초거대 거물의 입에서 돌연 강우진이 나왔으니 당연했다. 다만, 쿄타로 감독은 일단 놀람을 꾹꾹 누르며 다른 것을 물었다. “···왜 저희 영화에 관심을 가지시는지 여쭤봐도 되겠습니까?” “흠. 글쎄, 한 아이가 어렵사리 가진 꿈을 지키기 위해서 정도겠지요. 그 아이를 위해서라면 1000억도 아깝지 않지.” 도무지 이해가 어려운 답변이었다. 하지만 더 물으면 안 될 것 같았기에 쿄타로 감독이 주제를 바꿨다. “혹시- 강우진 씨와는 아시는 사이신지.” 되물음에 고개를 작게 꺾은 히데키 회장은 바로 답하지 않았다. 그저 자신과 얼굴도 못 본 그 한국 배우의 동질감 또는 힘든 시간들을 상기할 뿐. 그게 얼추 10초쯤. 이내 히데키 회장의 주름진 입이 천천히 열렸고. “그저 같은 고통을 아는 사이라고 해둡시다.” 쿄타로 감독의 두 눈이 확장됐다. 분명, 히데키 회장의 말투에서 강우진과의 연줄이 느껴졌기 때문. 그러다. ‘그래, 그런가?’ 뜬금 쿄타로 감독이 저 혼자서 착각의 늪에 몸을 담그기 시작했다. ‘이제야······우진씨의 현지인 수준인 일본어가 이해되는군. 히데키 회장과 뭔가 인연이 있는 거야.’ 100%라 생각했다. 돌연 히데키 회장이 투자한다는 것도, 그의 입에서 강우진이 튀어나온 것도. ‘우진씨의 현란한 일본어, 넘치는 자존감, 뒤가 없는 추진력, 연기를 포함 미친 능력들, 왜인지 흘러넘치는 아우라.’ 거기에 영화가 벼랑 끝에 몰렸음에도 기다리겠다 한마디만 던진 여유까지. 그래, 그 모든 게 이 히데키 회장과 결합하면 조각이 딱딱 들어맞았다. ‘둘 사이에 어떤 사정이 있는가는 모른다만- 역시 그랬군.’ 여기에 히데키 회장의 말이 확신을 더 했다. “감독님만 알고 있어야 해요, 나의 존재부터 오늘 우리가 나눈 대화 전부.” “···알겠습니다.” 오해가 점철되는 순간이지만, 이를 전혀 모르던 둘 중 히데키 회장이 다시금 입을 열었다. “투자금은 금방 보내드리지. 대신에 모든 부분은 극비일 것이고, 그에 관련된 언론 조절 역시 내 쪽에서 해도 괜찮겠지요?” “언플을 말씀하시는.” “그래요.” “어떤 식으로 하실지 언질은 주실 수 있습니까?” “간단하지. 일단, 투자금 문제는 깔끔히 해결됐다는 식으로 시작해서.” 이어 히데키 회장의 옅은 미소가 깊어진다. “내 카시히 그룹이 뒷배라는 소문이 적당히 얽히고설키게 될겝니다.” 며칠 뒤, 16일 수요일. 밤. 일본의 국민 토크쇼인 ‘아메토크 show!’의 첫 방영일은 이미 발표된 상태였다. 『「낯기생」불화설부터 논란 점화되는 중이지만, 아메토크 show! 측은 방영 강행』 『「아메토크 show!」강우진편 16일 문제없이 방영된다』 홍보 역시 강우진이 일본을 다녀간 순간부터 지속적으로 하고 있었다. 물론, 그 사이 ‘낯기생’의 위기가 터졌을 때도, 강우진의 여러 잡소리가 번지고 있었어도 ‘아메토크 show!’는 멈추지 않았다. 보통의 시선으로 본다면 논란이 있는 상태에 방영은 좋지 못했다. 이는 언론이나. 『대중들의 목소리 무시? 강우진편 강행하는「아메토크 show!」의 생각은?』 일본의 여론 역시 마찬가지였다. -굳이 문제가 터진 강우진 편을 방영해야 되나? 좀 잠잠해진 뒤에 해도 되잖아?? -이해가 안 돼, 아메토크 PD는 왜 이걸 강행하는 거야? -상관없어 어차피 난 안 볼 거니까 -10년 넘은 장수 토크쇼고 강우진 아니어도 평균 10%대 시청률은 나오지 않아? 그냥 킵해둔 컨텐츠를 틀어주는 게 시기상 맞아 -아메토크 제작진들은 무슨 생각일까? -한국의 탑배우도 아니고 고작 신인 배우라면 볼 이유는 없어 악취가 난다. 악플은 정당화해도 결국 악플. 좌표를 찍는다고 하던가? 일본의 SNS나 커뮤니티 등으로 ‘아메토크 show!’ 관련 소식에 좌표가 찍혔다. 물론, 개중에 악플이 아닌 것도 있지만. -왜!! 난 엄청 기대되는데! 대부분은 우려와 공격을 퍼부었다. 하지만 분명 이들은 일부분일 뿐. 그리고 그 시각. “광고 3개 남았습니다!” ‘아메토크 show!’를 방영할 일본 민영방송국 TBE의 주종정실에는 많은 이가 모여 있었다. 예능국의 국장부터 간부들 그리고. “후우-” 수많은 모니터를 보며 마른침을 삼키는 신조 PD. 가뜩이나 말랐는데 긴장감이 돌아서 그런가? 더 얇아 보이는 얼굴. 당연히 그의 주변에 모인 ‘아메토크 show!’ 작가들도 표정은 비슷했다. 이쯤. “‘아메토크 show!’ 본방 들어갑니다!” 주조정실의 직원이 큐사인을 던졌다. 금세 많은 모니터 중 몇몇에 ‘아메토크 show!’의 오프닝이 틀어진다. 즉, ‘아메토크 show!’의 강우진 편이 일본 전역으로 전파를 탔다는 뜻. 동시에. “어, 어때?” 국장이 주조정실 직원에게 다가서며 물었고 뒤로 눈 커진 신조 PD가 따랐다. 그의 옆엔 작가들이 달라붙는다. 모두 주조정실 직원의 입만을 보고 있다. 동시에. “······” 뭔가를 확인한 주조정실 직원이. “‘아메토크 show!’ 오프닝 시청률-” 고개를 휙 돌려 몰린 인파들에게 외쳤다. “오프닝 시청률 20.3%! 20.3%요!” 그 순간 국장은 물론이며 신조 PD 등 모두가 입을 쩍 벌렸다. “어, 얼마??! 20.3%?!” 반전을 넘어 와전 수준의 결과였다. < 역습 (1) > 끝","output":"< Counterattack (1) > It was certain. The robotic female voice had clearly announced not one, but two gifts. At this, Kang Woo-jin was slightly taken aback. \\"Not just one, but two gifts??\\" It was an unprecedented event. From English to Japanese, sign language, and even singing ability, until now, the subspace had always offered just one gift. But now, it was offering two. \\"Technique and recipe.\\" Woo-jin had high expectations and thought it likely that he would gain abilities. But two was beyond his expectations. Moreover, the timing was peculiar. Why now? In this situation? Then, Kang Woo-jin had an intuition. \\"Is the subspace evolving?\\" It wasn't certain, but that was the feeling. The subspace was always unkind with no explanations, but judging by the current state, could it be that the subspace was growing along with Kang Woo-jin? There's something like that, right? Like in games. As you complete quests, the rewards increase—could the subspace be similar? \\"I've never seen a quest pop up, though.\\" Perhaps as Kang Woo-jin made better use of the subspace, the range of gifts it offered expanded. Well, let's just understand it that way. After all, it's impossible to fully grasp the subspace, right? Besides. \\"If it's offering, I'm thankful.\\" There was no need to refuse, nor was there a way to refuse. Kang Woo-jin just had to accept it with a smile. 'If this is the case... in the future, could I gradually receive 2, then 3, or even 4, 5 gifts?' A faint sense of anticipation exploded. The subspace was indeed the best. Even two thumbs up weren't enough. It was simply godly. That's when it happened. [\\"Preparing to read 'Chef's Technique·Recipe'......\\"] [\\"......Preparation complete. Starting the reading of 'Chef's Technique·Recipe'.\\"] Following the welcome female voice, a massive grayness engulfed Kang Woo-jin. The momentum was terrifying, but Woo-jin was smiling. However, the sharp pain in his lower abdomen remained. \\"Ugh.\\" Then. -Swooosh. Kang Woo-jin slowly opened his eyes. The space was the same as when his singing ability was enhanced. Like the previous subspace, it was endlessly dark. However. \\"Ah.\\" Soon, Kang Woo-jin noticed something different. The difference was apparent when he turned his head to the left. Although Kang Woo-jin had always been alone, when he looked to the left, there was another Kang Woo-jin. Or more precisely. \\"A mirror?\\" He saw the reflection of Kang Woo-jin standing. Blinking, raising a hand, lifting a foot—his reflection mimicked everything. 'Because there are two gifts?' It was mystical. That was the feeling. The space was completely dark, yet there was a sense of another self existing. Right then. \\"Here it comes.\\" From afar, strange shapes began to fly in. Woo-jin only understood what they were when they got close. Food. Countless foods approached Kang Woo-jin's body and seeped in. Was this the 'Chef's Recipe'? What was interesting was. \\"Why do I taste, taste the flavors?\\" Although there was a chill as the food seeped in, it felt as if he was eating the absorbed food. The flavors were distinct. Around that time, the reflection of Kang Woo-jin on the left was also being attacked by something. Moving knives, dazzling woks, and so on. Numerous tools. The next day, the 13th, in Tokyo, Japan. The time was just past 8 o'clock. The location was the parking lot of 'Toega' Film Company. Amidst the gradually filling cars, Director Kyotaro stood out, looking bewildered. \\"......\\" His expression was stern. He just seemed to be waiting for someone, looking at the entrance to the parking lot. Then why was he spending time here at this hour, especially when 'Night Parasite' was falling apart? The reason was simple. 'The Kashihi Group is providing the investment funds?' It was because of a call from a woman named Tetsugawa Riri yesterday. Here, Director Kyotaro recalled his conversation with her. Director Kyotaro wondered what this was all about. \\"......Did you say the Kashihi Group is providing the investment funds for 'Night Parasite'?\\" Riri's voice over the phone was just calm. \\"That's correct. More importantly, is there anyone around you?\\" \\"Ah- Yes. There is.\\" \\"Then please move to another location.\\" \\"......Understood.\\" As Director Kyotaro stepped out into the hallway, he suspected it might be a prank call. Regardless, he needed to confirm. \\"Excuse me, but how can I believe that you are from the Kashihi Group?\\" \\"It's okay if you don't believe me.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"We are very aware of the current situation with 'Night Parasite.' Despite that, we intend to invest.\\" \\"Who are you?\\" \\"You will find out when we meet in person.\\" This woman was different. The dignity felt in her tone and the aura she carried as she led the conversation. \\"Director, will you be available tomorrow morning?\\" \\"Tomorrow morning?\\" \\"Yes. If it's okay with you, we will send a car for you.\\" Director Kyotaro had another appointment with a different investor. However, he felt that he couldn't miss this moment. Thanks to that, Director Kyotaro didn't miss a faint opportunity. \\"Tomorrow morning is fine.\\" \\"Then please come to the parking lot of 'Toega' Film Company by 8 o'clock in the morning. Take the car that arrives.\\" That was it. Director Kyotaro, who had been recalling yesterday, returned to the present, to the parking lot of 'Toega' Film Company. Could it be real? Really the Kashihi Group? Director Kyotaro, who found it hard to believe but wanted to believe, thought. \\"I have no connection with them. What exactly is this?\\" The Kashihi Group was a super-conglomerate ranked within the top 10 in Japan's business hierarchy. However, Director Kyotaro had no ties with them. Then, could it be the writer Akari? At that moment. -Vroom! A luxurious black sedan smoothly entered the parking lot. At a glance, it was an expensive foreign car. Naturally, it caught Director Kyotaro's attention, and the sedan, moving smoothly, naturally stopped in front of him. Then. -Thunk! The passenger door opened, and a woman in a neat suit with a tidy appearance got out. Her posture was upright and neat. She bowed politely to Director Kyotaro and then. \\"Hello, Director. It's an honor to meet you. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, the one who called you.\\" She opened the rear door of the car, gesturing for him to get in with polite manners. \\"Please get in.\\" \\"......\\" Soon, Director Kyotaro got into the car as if enchanted. About an hour later. The luxury sedan carrying Director Kyotaro stopped in front of a mansion that naturally elicited exclamations. In front of it, Riri, with her long hair tied back in a single line, got out first. -Swish. She opened the rear door of the car. Director Kyotaro's expression was still one of bewilderment. He hadn't spoken a word to her the entire way. Anyway. \\"Director, please follow me.\\" Director Kyotaro, who got out of the car on impulse, scratched his graying hair and followed Riri. They passed through the spacious yard, past about a dozen busy employees, past furniture that made one's jaw drop. \\"Here we are.\\" Her guidance stopped in front of a brown wooden door. Soon, Riri knocked on the door. -Knock knock. A raspy male voice came from inside. \\"Come in.\\" The voice was relaxed. As Riri opened the door, the interior of the room became visible to Director Kyotaro. Books were everywhere. It was clearly a study. In the center was a large desk. And. \\"Ah, nice to meet you, Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro.\\" Standing next to the desk, an old man with white hair in his eyebrows. He extended his hand to Director Kyotaro with a faint smile, but his figure resembled a white-haired lion. Director Kyotaro immediately recognized who he was. '......Chairman Yoshimura Hideki.' The leader who built the great Kashihi Group. A figure well-known not only in Japan but also abroad. 'It was true.' So, the Kashihi Group's approach was not a lie but the truth. Here, the master director Kyotaro pulled himself together. It was a situation that warranted such a person. \\"Hello, Chairman Yoshimura. It's my first time meeting you.\\" \\"I've seen you often in the media, so it's not the first time for me, Director.\\" \\"Recently, things have gotten big beyond my intention.\\" \\"If it's about Japanese film directors, it's Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro, so that's to be expected.\\" \\"You flatter me.\\" Chairman Hideki, wearing a subtle smile, gestured to the 3-seater sofa in front of the desk. It was an invitation to sit. Soon, tea was served in the study, and after savoring a cup, Chairman Hideki opened the conversation. \\"I heard the situation with the movie 'Night Parasite' you're preparing is quite bad. Is that true?\\" He went straight to the point without beating around the bush. But Director Kyotaro, with his upright posture, calmly responded. \\"That's correct.\\" \\"To what extent?\\" \\"At least the investment fund issue covered by the media is true.\\" \\"I see.\\" Chairman Hideki, who put down his teacup leisurely but with a sharp gaze, spoke again to Director Kyotaro. \\"How much of the investment funds have been withdrawn?\\" \\"About 70%.\\" \\"That would be 15 billion.\\" For a moment, Director Kyotaro's eyes flickered slightly. How did he know such detailed information about the investment funds? Still, he calmly answered. \\"It's similar.\\" \\"Hmm- alright, then I'll fill in the gap in the investment funds for you. I'll add a little more than the original amount. So you can expand the scale of the project.\\" \\"!!!\\" \\"But there's a condition.\\" \\"A condition, you say?\\" Chairman Hideki, holding his teacup again, replied succinctly. \\"That rookie actor from Korea, Kang Woo-jin, must continue to be involved.\\" \\"......\\" \\"The other actors can be replaced if necessary.\\" Director Kyotaro was somewhat dumbfounded upon hearing the answer. Why was Woo-jin being mentioned here? He truly hadn't expected it, so it was natural that Kang Woo-jin's name suddenly came from the mouth of that super-giant tycoon. However, Director Kyotaro pressed down his surprise and asked something else. \\"......May I ask why you are interested in our movie?\\" \\"Hmm. Well, let's say it's to protect the hard-earned dream of a child. For that child, even 100 billion wouldn't be too much.\\" It was a response that was difficult to understand. But feeling that it was inappropriate to ask further, Director Kyotaro changed the subject. \\"By any chance, do you know Mr. Kang Woo-jin?\\" To the question, Chairman Hideki tilted his head slightly but did not answer immediately. He just recalled the common pain and difficult times of that Korean actor whom he had never met. After about 10 seconds. Chairman Hideki's wrinkled mouth slowly opened. \\"Let's just say we share a common pain.\\" Director Kyotaro's eyes widened. Clearly, he felt a connection between Chairman Hideki and Kang Woo-jin in his tone. Then. 'Is that so?' Suddenly, Director Kyotaro began to immerse himself in a swamp of misconceptions. 'Now I understand... Woo-jin's native-level Japanese. He must have some connection with Chairman Hideki.' He was 100% convinced. The sudden investment by Chairman Hideki and Kang Woo-jin's name popping out of his mouth. 'Woo-jin's dazzling Japanese, overflowing self-esteem, relentless drive, insane abilities including acting, and the aura that seemed to overflow.' And despite the movie being on the brink, the composure to say he would wait. Yes, all of it fit together perfectly when combined with Chairman Hideki. 'I don't know what the circumstances are between them, but I see.' Chairman Hideki's words added to his certainty. \\"Director, you must be the only one who knows, from my existence to the conversation we had today.\\" \\"......Understood.\\" It was a moment filled with misunderstandings, but unaware of this, Chairman Hideki, who was not part of the misunderstanding, spoke again. \\"I'll send the investment funds right away. However, everything must be kept strictly confidential, and I assume it's okay if my side handles the media control related to it?\\" \\"You mean public relations.\\" \\"That's right.\\" \\"Could you give me a hint on how you plan to do it?\\" \\"It's simple. First, we'll start by making it clear that the investment fund issue has been neatly resolved.\\" Then Chairman Hideki's faint smile deepened. \\"Rumors that my Kashihi Group is the backer will be appropriately entangled.\\" A few days later, on Wednesday the 16th, at night. The first broadcast date of Japan's national talk show 'Ametalk show!' had already been announced. \\"「Night Parasite」rumors of discord ignite controversy, but 'Ametalk show!' proceeds with the broadcast\\" \\"「Ametalk show!」 Kang Woo-jin episode to air without issues on the 16th\\" Promotion had been ongoing since the moment Kang Woo-jin visited Japan. Of course, even when the crisis of 'Night Parasite' erupted, and various rumors about Kang Woo-jin spread, 'Ametalk show!' did not stop. From a common perspective, airing during a controversy was not a good move. This was the case with the media. \\"Disregarding public opinion? What is 'Ametalk show!' thinking by pushing through with the Kang Woo-jin episode?\\" The Japanese public opinion was the same. -Do they really need to air the Kang Woo-jin episode when there's a problem? Can't they wait until it's calmer?? -I don't understand, why is the Ametalk PD pushing this? -It doesn't matter, I'm not going to watch it anyway -'Ametalk show!' has been a long-running talk show for over 10 years, and even without Kang Woo-jin, it gets average ratings in the 10% range, right? It's just about airing the content they've kept at the right time -What are the producers of 'Ametalk' thinking? -He's not even a top actor from Korea, just a rookie, so there's no reason to watch It stinks. Hate comments are still hate comments, even if they're justified. Isn't that what they say about marking coordinates? 'Ametalk show!' related news was marked with coordinates on Japan's SNS and communities. Of course, not all comments were hate comments. -Why!! I'm really looking forward to it! Most were filled with concerns and attacks. But clearly, these were just a part of the whole. And at that time. \\"Three commercials left!\\" In the main control room of TBE, the private broadcasting station that would air 'Ametalk show!', many people had gathered. From the head of the entertainment department to the executives and. \\"Phew-\\" PD Shinjo, who was swallowing dry saliva while looking at numerous monitors. He was already thin, but perhaps due to the tension, his face looked even thinner. Naturally, the writers of 'Ametalk show!' around him had similar expressions. At this point. \\"'Ametalk show!' is going live!\\" An employee in the main control room threw the cue sign. Suddenly, the opening of 'Ametalk show!' played on several of the many monitors. In other words, the Kang Woo-jin episode of 'Ametalk show!' was being broadcast across Japan. At the same time. \\"How, how is it?\\" The head of the department approached the main control room employee and asked, followed by PD Shinjo with widened eyes. Writers clung to his side. Everyone was just looking at the mouth of the main control room employee. At the same time. \\"......\\" The main control room employee, who had confirmed something. \\"The opening ratings for 'Ametalk show!'—\\" He turned his head quickly and shouted to the crowd. \\"The opening ratings are 20.3%! 20.3%!\\" At that moment, not only the head of the department but also PD Shinjo and everyone else dropped their jaws. \\"How much??! 20.3%?!\\" It was a result that went beyond a reversal, almost to the level of a distortion. < Counterattack (1) > End"},{"instruction":"< 역습 (3) > 두 시간 뒤, 한국. 수원. ‘얼어죽는 연애’팀이 뿌리를 내린 KBC의 드라마 제작센터 내부는. “세트 점검 마쳤습니다!!” “조명도 OK!!” “소품도 여기만 정리하면 끝나요!” “15분 뒤 슛들어가니까 서둘러요!” 촬영 준비가 얼추 끝난 상태였다. 세트 주변은 온갖 기기들로 촘촘했다. 정면과 여러 구도로 설치된 카메라들, 반사판과 조명들, 혈관처럼 깔린 많은 전선 등. 그 사이를 왕래하는 수십 스탭들의 발길은 분주했다. 와중. “어어, 작가님. 여기 앉으세요.” 모니터 3대가 놓인 자리의 연출 PD가 등장한 이월선 작가를 옆자리에 앉혔다. 곧, 명품 핸드백을 무릎에 올린 이월선 작가가 옅은 미소를 지었다. “좋네요, 현장. 벌써 십수 번인데도 난 여기 공기가 좋아.” “하하하. 그렇습니까?” “응. 내가 쓴 가상을 실상으로 보는 느낌이 들어서요.” 읊조리던 이월선 작가가 주변을 둘러보며 작게 헛웃음을 뱉었다. “그나저나 우리 배우님들 많이도 오셨네.” 지금부터 남주인 정장환과 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’인 강우진의 촬영이 있을 예정. 그럼에도 대기하고 있어야 할 배우들이 벌써 현장에 나와 있었으니까. 그 답을 연출 PD가 뱉었다. “뭐, 첫 촬영 아닙니까. 그리고 눈으로 직접 보고 싶은 거겠죠. 작가님이나 저나 허락한 부분이고.” 강우진을 상기한 이월선 작가가 알만하다는 듯 고개를 끄덕였다. “대본리딩 날, 그 문제의 애드립이 포함돼 수정된 씬이니 궁금도 하겠지.” “우진씨 연기가 보고 싶은 것도 있고요. 리딩 때처럼 앉아서 하는 것과 현장은 또 다르니까요.” 이때. -스윽. 대화하는 둘의 뒤쪽으로 여자 한 명이 들어섰다. “안녕하세요.” 돌아보니 대본리딩에도 참관했던 수어 전문가가 서 있었고, 이월선 작가가 일어나 그녀에게 인사했다. “오셨어요? 고마워요, 첫 촬영도 와주셔서.” “아니에요. 제가 오고 싶기도 했어요. 그런데-” 여기서 촬영존 한쪽의 무심히 앉은, 묵묵히 대본을 내려보고 있는 강우진을 확인한 수어 전문가가 조심히 물었다. “강우진씨는······생각보다 엄청 차분하시네요?” 이어 그녀의 시선을 따라 이월선 작가 역시 눈을 움직였다. 그리곤 픽 웃었다. “우진씨야 뭐 늘 저런 식이긴 해요. 계절로 치면 겨울일까?” 대체로 오류였다. 현재 의자에 앉은 강우진의 속은 펄펄 널뛰고 있었으니까. 정확하게는 약간 딴 생각 중이었다. ‘‘남사친’ 편집이 끝났다, 그런 거면 이제 런칭도 얼마 안 남았다는 거잖어?’ 몇십 분 전 최성건을 통해 ‘남사친’의 편집이 끝났다는 소식을 들었으니까. 키스씬에 심장 터질 뻔한 게 어제 같은데 벌써 편집이 끝났다. 아니, 시기상 적당한 시간이 지난 건 맞지만, 강우진의 체감상 매우 빠른 것 같았다. 여하튼 강우진은 두근거리기 시작했다. ‘으- 은근 기대되면서도 걱정되는데.’ 한량과는 달리, ‘남사친’은 그가 주연이었으니까. 주연작으로 한국이 아닌 첫 해외 진출. 거기다 이미 일본은 강우진으로 와장창 시끄럽기도 했다. 떨린다, 그러나 보는 사람이 많아 순수하게 포커페이스를 유지한다. 그런 우진을 지켜보던 다른 배우들은 작게작게 쑥떡 댔다. “감정 잡고 있나 봐요, 엄청 심각하네.” “음- 그런가? 근데 우진씨는 평소에도 좀 저렇던데. 뭐, 하루 본 게 다지만.” “여기와서 쭉 저 상탠데 감정 잡는 거 맞는 것 같아요, 아무래도 어려운 역할이다 보니까.” “대본리딩 때처럼 앉아서 하는 것과 현장 연기, 확실히 다르긴 하겠죠?” “한량에서도 장난 아니었대요, 막 연쇄살인범이 진짜 나타난 것 같았다고.” “장애 연기는 진짜 예민해서 손발 몸짓 전부 통제해야 할 건데- 흠, 어쩌려나.” 이쯤, 앉아 있던 강우진이 콜을 받았다. 의상과 메이크업을 진행하자는 사인. 뒤로 얼마 뒤. 준비를 마친 강우진의 모습이 전체적으로 공개됐다. 뭐랄까, 딱 눈에 띄게 변한 건 없었다. 의상은 간단히 청바지에 후드. 다만, 헤어는 신경 안 쓴 듯 네추럴하면서 약간 부스스했고, 메이크업도 적당한 혈색만 표현할 정도로 옅었다. 강조한 게 있다면 눈가. 짙진 않지만 묘하게 다크서클이 들어간 모습. 우진까지 준비가 완료되자. -스윽. 연출 PD와 강우진 그리고 장신의 정장환이 세트장 중간에 모였다. 간단한 대본 리허설을 위해서였다. 참고로 정장환의 모습은 깔끔 그 자체였다. 헤어는 짧았으며 의상은 칼 각 잡힌 정장이었다. 어쨌든. “이런 식으로 오케이? 첫 컷이니까 가볍게 대사 맞춰보는 느낌으로 가볼게요.” 적당히 구두로 리허설을 마친 연출 PD의 말에, 덤덤한 강우진이나 정장환이 고개를 끄덕였다. “예, PD님.” “알겠습니다.” 금세 웃음이 걸린 연출 PD가 양손을 몇 번 친 뒤 현장 전체로 외쳤고. “자자! 카메라 돌려봅시다!!” 정장환이 우진과 눈이 마주쳤다. 왜인지 강우진은 정장환을 바라보고 있었다. 이에 정장환이 피식 웃었다. “아, 걱정마요. 오늘은 애드립 안 칠 게. 한다 해도 사전에 우진씨한테 말할 거고.” 엥? 해도 상관없는데. 강우진은 속으로 뭐지 싶었다. 그는 그저 정장환의 멀대같이 큰 키에 감탄하고 있었을 뿐이니까. ‘부럽. 키가 2m는 되는 거 같냐? 한- 5센치만 노나줬으면 좋겠네.’ 하지만 장착한 컨셉질이 있는데 키 흥정을 할 수는 없는 노릇. 강우진은 최대한 목소리를 깔며 무뚝뚝하게 답했다. “잘 부탁드립니다.” “응, 나도 잘 부탁해요.” 그쯤 어느새 모니터 자리에 앉은 연출 PD가 두 배우에게 요청했다. “장환씨, 우진씨! 자리 잡읍시다!” 잠시 뒤. 고급 아파트의 복도를 연상케 하는, 나란히 붙은 철문과 엘리베이터의 문까지 연출된 세트장을 카메라가 담았다. 정면에서, 왼쪽에서, 오른쪽에서. 당장은 강우진과 정장환이 보이진 않는다. 이유는 심플했다. 그들의 등장은 문을 열고 나오는 것이기에 세트 철문 뒤쪽에 서 있었다. 이제 액션 사인이 던져지면 정장환부터 움직이고 곧장 강우진의 차례였다. 그런 둘 중 강우진은. ‘후우-’ 철문 앞에 서서 내면에 각인된, 초연히 잠들어 있던 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’ 깨웠다. 그리고 끌어올렸다. 이 과정은 이제 눈 깜짝할 새였다. 어느새 우진의 머리부터 발끝까지 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 모든 것이 드리웠다. 우진의 자세와 태도가 변한다. 수천 번 외운 것처럼 선명한 대사가 머릿속에 자리 잡는다, 그의 감각과 감정 그리고 속내가 가슴에 뿌리를 내린다, 확고한 세상이 눈앞에 펼쳐졌다. 점차 그의 귓가가 먹먹해진다. 시작은 이명부터였다. 삐- 따위의 소음이 우진의 귀속에서 번졌다. 이곳에 존재하는 소리가 점차 자취를 감춘다. 땅속으로, 하늘 위로. 덩달아 소란스럽던 세트장 풍경이 하나둘 연기처럼 사라진다. ‘조용해.’ 마치 끝없이 펼쳐진 광활한 공간에 이 복도의 조각만 섬처럼 둥둥 떠 있는 느낌이었다. 하지만 썩 좋은 기분은 아니었다. 아무것도 들리지 않는 세상은 공허할 뿐이니까. 최소 강우진. 아니, ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 그랬다. 공허하며 답답했다. 내면 저 깊숙한 곳에서 절망이 울컥였다. 그래도 참는다. 절망에 눈길조차 주지 않았다. 참는다? 그렇지 않다. 그저 익숙함에 자신을 속이는 게 다였다. 이내 강우진에겐 거대한 잠잠함과 미약한 공포가 맞물렸다. 평생을 이리 살아야 한다는 좌절, 그 좌절을 덮고도 넘쳐흐르는 의욕상실. 이때, 강우진의 뒤에 있던 카메라가 그의 옆모습으로 움직였다. 앵글은 바스트. 따라서 많은 이가 보는 모니터 중 하나에 우진의 얼굴이 출력됐다. 이월선 작가의 눈에 진중함이 팽배해지며 입을 감쌌다. “본 연기 시작 전. 근데도 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 세상을 온 얼굴에 담은 듯이······” 스크립터 포함 여러 스탭들 역시 줄지어 탄성을 자아냈다. “와- 우진씨, 저저 눈에 초점 없는 것 좀 봐요.” “디테일이 무슨- 표정이 있는데 표정이 없는 것 같은···저런 표현은 어디서 배우는 거지?” “몇 초나 걸렸지 지금? 감정 잡는 거 어이없을 정도로 빠르네요······” 이쯤 이월선 작가가 오른쪽에 자리한 수어 전문가에게 물었고. “지금 저 표정 어때요.” 눈이 동그래진 수어 전문가가 옅게 답했다. “이질감은 없어요, 아니 정말 실제 같아요. 연기 모르는 제가 봐도 대단해요. 어쩜 저러지?” 심지어 아직 액션이 들어가지도 않았다. 곧, 첫 자리의 연출 PD가 모니터 속 강우진을 보며 헛웃음을 뱉는다. ‘보통의 배우들은 기피하는 장애 연기. 겁이 날 수밖에 없어. 그런데 쟤는 거침이 없다. 그런데 소름이 돋을 정도의 생동감이 느껴지냐고.’ 경외와 더불어 심각해진 연출 PD가 천천히 확성기를 올렸다. 이내 현장 전체로 뱉어진 외침. “하이- 큐!!” 금세 수군거리던 세트장 전체가 꿀 먹은 벙어리가 됐다. 하지만 강우진에겐. ‘옆집 묘한 남자’에겐 아무짝에도 의미가 없다. 어느 쪽이든 같으니까. 그때. -덜컥! 정장환. 아니, ‘송태형’이 현관 철문을 열었다. 카메라는 그의 정면. 송태형은 직전에 손 세정제를 뿌렸다는 듯 양손을 비비며 등장했다. 그와 동시에. -달칵. 송태형의 옆집 철문 역시 열렸다. ‘옆집 묘한 남자’가 느릿하게 나타난다. 바로 미간을 좁히는 송태형. “쯧.” 반면. -스윽. 우진은 소리가 아닌 시각으로 송태형의 존재를 눈치챘다. 멈췄던 그의 혈색에 작디작은 즐거움이 묻는다. 뻣뻣한 상실에서 상황이 만들어졌으니까. 지금 강우진의 표정은 딱 그랬다. 그는 송태형이 나쁘지 않았다. ‘저 사람의 집은 항상 좋은 냄새가 나.’ 예민한 냄새 덕분인진 모르겠지만, 강우진은 그의 집이 열리는 찰나에 나는 향이 마음에 들었다. 여기서 카메라, 뒤로 빠지며 강우진과 정장환을 투샷으로 잡는다. 둘의 변화가 명확히 모니터에 드러난다. 서로를 보는 두 인물이지만 소통은 불가했다. ‘송태형’은 자의적으로 단절했고, 강우진은 타의적으로 단절당했다. 그렇기에 둘의 이해도, 생각도, 의견도, 파악도 모두 틀리다. 이때 강우진이 ‘송태형’에게 한 걸음 다가선다. 송태형은 움찔하지만, 먹먹한 강우진은 작은 미소를 지을 뿐이었다. 남이 본다면 모호한 웃음일지라도 우진에겐 긍정이었다. 그는 송태형의 착실함이 좋았다. 송태형은 늘 같은 시간에 집을 나서니까. 그렇기에 약속한 듯 마주칠 수 있었다. 말을 하지 않아도 말이다. 우진은 송태형의 정갈함도 마음에 들었다. 늘 정갈하며 흐트러짐이 없다. 뻣뻣한 무표정이 공격적이지만 그것마저 우진은 좋았다. 자신에게만이 아닌 송태형은 모든 사람들에게 똑같이 대했다. 일관적이다. ‘나에 관해 알면 사람들은 변해.’ 그것이 배려건 꺼림이건 강우진이. ‘옆집 묘한 남자’가 겪어온 모든 이가 같았다. 그건 나쁜 게 아니었다. 그저 우진은 상대가 누군들 늘 공격적인 송태형이 멋져 보였다. 그 공평함의 잣대가 상대에게 있는 게 아닌, 자기 자신에게 있는 것 같아서. 강우진이 손을 움찔했다. 카메라, 우진의 손부터 팔뚝 그리고 얼굴을 클로즈업. 현재 강우진의 눈빛은 변해 있었다. 갈망과 고뇌가 가득했다. 이때, 모니터 보던 수어 전문가가 두 눈을 디립다 크게 떴다. “세, 세상에.” 이월선 작가가 빠르게 그녀의 말에 따라붙었다. “······네, 저도 같은 말을 뱉을 예정이었어요.” “지금 우진씨는- 도저히 일반인으로 보이지가 않아요.” “이 짧은 연기에, 저 짧은 배역에 어떻게 저리 짙은 농도를 담아 왔을까.” 자극적이진 않지만, 투명하지도 않은 강우진이었다. 그리고 묽다. 의욕상실이지만 희망을 놓지 않았기 때문이었다. 그 희망은 금세 절망으로 바뀐다. 그 표현을 정면에서 보는 송태형 또는 정장환은 멈칫했다. ‘알겠어, 왜 거물들이 얘한테 들러붙는지. 내 눈에 이 정도면 그들의 눈에선······’ 이어 송태형의 다분한 대사가 들렸다. “뭡니까 대체.” 입 모양. 소리가 자취를 감춘 우진은 그의 입 모양으로 말을 알아챘다. 뭔가를 묻고 있구나. 여기서부터 강우진의 눈동자에 숱한 과거가 담긴다. 그 끝엔 ‘고민’이 기다리고 있었다. 나도 질문해보고 싶다, 말을 걸어보고 싶다, 내가 그럴 수 있을까? 변화도 두렵다, 저 사람이 날 보고 기겁하진 않을까? 친해질 수 있을까? 그러나 송태형은 ‘묘한 옆집 남자’에 질려선지 혀를 차며 갈 길을 간다. “짜증 나네, 이사를 가던지 해야지.” 카메라, 송태형의 앞에서 그를 담다가 우뚝 멈춰서는 서서히 강우진에게 다가간다. 여전히 제자리서 송태형의 뒷모습을 바라보는 그. 이 모습만 보면 충분히 기묘했다. 아니, 지금까지 우진이 보인 연기 전부가 그랬다. 대사 한 줄 없이 오직 눈빛과 표정 그리고 디테일한 몸짓, 손짓으로만 연기했으니까. 모니터 보는 모두와 더불어 시청자 역시 그렇게 보일 게 분명했다. 저 남자는, 말이 없는 옆집 남자는 수상하다고. 그렇게 확정 지을 때쯤, 가만히 있던 강우진이 천천히 두 손을 올렸다. 얼굴 근육이 풀어진다. 그런 우진이 송태형의 뒷모습에 대고 말했다. ‘난 당신이 좋아요.’ 그에겐 수어가 대사였으니. 곧, 우진의 얼굴을 클로즈업. 모니터엔 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 살짝 풀어진 미소가 담긴다. 아마 이쯤 해서 시청자들은 알아차릴 것이었다. 묘한 게 아닌 못하는 거구나. 오직 감정만으로 끌고 오는 씬이었다. 자칫 삐끗하면 이해가 힘들지도 모르는. 허나 지금까지의 강우진은 티끌 한 점 오류가 없었다. 완연하며 완벽했다. 그 모든 과정이, 감정이, 표정이 카메라에 꾹꾹 눌러 담긴다. 대사 한 마디가 없지만, 백 마디보다 농염하다. 깊고 짙다. 그런 강우진을 모니터로도, 실체로도 확인한 배우들은 각자만의 방법으로 반응했다. 넋 놓고 그저 빠져들었거나. “······” 속으로 거칠게 탄성 하거나. ‘와- 연기 돌았네, 저런 눈빛 표현을 대체 어떻게······’ 공통점은 배우들 모두의 종착역엔 한가지로 귀결됐다. 저건 신인이 할 수 있는 류의 연기가 아니다. 그러다 우진을 지켜보던 배우들이 눈이 더욱이 확장됐다. 무언가 강렬해서가 아니었다. 점잖은 고요한 연기에 압도당했다. 지금 강우진이 허공에 움직이는 두 손이, 수어가. ‘우린 친해질 수 없을까요?’ 지나치게 씁쓸하면서도 애잔했으니까. 이어 저도 모르게 이월선 작가가 헛웃음을 뱉었다. “그냥 대본을 찢고 나왔어.” 촬영 2일짜리 조·단역의 연기가 경력 20년인 스타작가 이월선의 기준을. “큰일인데, 눈이 너무 높아지면. 차라리 안 보는 게 나았을 정도야.” 사뿐히 갈아 치워버렸다. 이 시각, 일본. 강우진이 한창 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 세트장을 뒤집고 있을 무렵. 일본에선 ‘낯기생’ 관련 어처구니없으면서도 생뚱맞은 존재가 등장한 참이었다. 『카시히 그룹, 무너지는「낯기생」에 관심 가진다? 영화계에 소문 솔솔』 카시히 그룹이었다. < 역습 (3) > 끝","output":"< Counterattack (3) > Two hours later, in Suwon, Korea. Inside the KBC Drama Production Center, where the team for \\"Freezing Romance\\" had taken root: \\"Set check complete!!\\" \\"Lights are OK!!\\" \\"Props are almost sorted here!\\" \\"We're shooting in 15 minutes, hurry up!\\" The preparations for filming were nearly finished. The set was surrounded by all sorts of equipment. Cameras installed at various angles, reflectors and lights, and many cables laid out like veins. The footsteps of dozens of staff members bustling through the space. In the midst of this. \\"Ah, Writer-nim, please take a seat here.\\" The director, who had just arrived at the spot with three monitors, seated the writer Lee Wol-seon next to him. Soon, Lee Wol-seon, with her designer handbag on her lap, smiled faintly. \\"The atmosphere here is nice. It's my umpteenth time, but I still like the air here.\\" \\"Hahaha. Is that so?\\" \\"Yes. It feels like I'm seeing the fiction I wrote become reality.\\" Muttering, Writer Lee Wol-seon looked around and chuckled softly. \\"By the way, so many of our actors have arrived.\\" The upcoming scene involved the male lead, Jeong Jang-hwan, and the 'mysterious neighbor,' Kang Woo-jin. Despite that, the actors who should have been waiting were already on set. The director provided the answer. \\"Well, it's the first shoot, isn't it? And they probably want to see it with their own eyes. Both you and I have allowed it.\\" Remembering Kang Woo-jin, Writer Lee Wol-seon nodded as if she understood. \\"The scene that includes that problematic ad-lib from the script reading has been revised, so they must be curious.\\" \\"And they want to see Woo-jin's acting. It's different from sitting down during the reading.\\" At that moment. -Swish. A woman entered behind the two who were conversing. \\"Hello.\\" Turning around, they saw the sign language expert who had attended the script reading, and Writer Lee Wol-seon stood up to greet her. \\"Did you come? Thank you for coming to our first shoot.\\" \\"No, I wanted to come too. But—\\" The sign language expert, noticing Kang Woo-jin sitting indifferently and looking down at his script, cautiously asked. \\"Kang Woo-jin seems... much calmer than I thought?\\" Following her gaze, Writer Lee Wol-seon also looked over and chuckled. \\"Woo-jin is always like that. Maybe he's like winter?\\" That was mostly a mistake. Inside, Kang Woo-jin was boiling with excitement. Specifically, he was a bit distracted. \\"'Male Friend' editing is finished, so the launch must be soon, right?\\" He had heard from Choi Seong-geon just tens of minutes ago that the editing for \\"Male Friend\\" was complete. It felt like just yesterday when his heart nearly burst during the kiss scene, and now the editing was already done. Well, it was the right time, but to Kang Woo-jin, it felt very fast. Anyway, Kang Woo-jin began to feel nervous. \\"Ugh, I'm looking forward to it but also worried.\\" Unlike \\"Hanryang,\\" \\"Male Friend\\" was his leading role. It was his first overseas debut as a lead actor, not in Korea. Plus, Japan was already noisy with Kang Woo-jin. He was trembling, but he maintained a poker face as many people were watching. Watching Woo-jin, the other actors murmured softly to each other. \\"He seems to be getting into character, he looks so serious.\\" \\"Hmm, is that so? But Woo-jin is usually like that. Well, I've only seen him for a day.\\" \\"He's been in that state since he got here, so it seems like he's getting into character, considering it's a difficult role.\\" \\"The acting on set is definitely different from sitting down during the reading, right?\\" \\"I heard he was no joke in 'Hanryang,' like a real serial killer appeared.\\" \\"Acting as a disabled person is really sensitive; you have to control every hand and body movement—hmm, I wonder how it will go.\\" Around this time, Kang Woo-jin, who had been sitting, received a call. It was a sign to proceed with the costume and makeup. A little later. Kang Woo-jin's fully prepared appearance was revealed to everyone. There wasn't a noticeable change at first glance. His outfit was simply jeans and a hoodie. However, his hair was styled naturally and a bit messy, and the makeup was light, just enough to show some healthy color. If anything was emphasized, it was the area around his eyes. Not too heavy, but with a peculiar dark circle effect. Once Woo-jin was ready. -Swish. The director, Woo-jin, and the tall Jeong Jang-hwan gathered in the middle of the set. It was for a simple script rehearsal. For reference, Jeong Jang-hwan's appearance was impeccably neat. His hair was short, and he wore a sharply tailored suit. Anyway. \\"Is this okay? Since it's the first cut, let's go with the feeling of matching the lines lightly.\\" After a brief verbal rehearsal, the calm Kang Woo-jin and Jeong Jang-hwan nodded to the director's words. \\"Yes, Director.\\" \\"Understood.\\" The director, with a smile on his face, clapped his hands a few times and then shouted to the entire set. \\"Alright! Let's roll the cameras!!\\" Jeong Jang-hwan made eye contact with Woo-jin. For some reason, Kang Woo-jin was looking at Jeong Jang-hwan. Jeong Jang-hwan chuckled. \\"Ah, don't worry. I won't ad-lib today. Even if I do, I'll tell Woo-jin in advance.\\" Huh? It's okay if he does. Kang Woo-jin thought to himself. He was just admiring Jeong Jang-hwan's towering height. 'Envious. Is he like 2 meters tall? I wish I could grow just 5 centimeters more.' But with his character concept already set, he couldn't haggle over height. Kang Woo-jin responded as gruffly as possible. \\"Please take care of me.\\" \\"Yeah, me too.\\" Around that time, the director, now seated at the monitor, requested the two actors. \\"Jang-hwan, Woo-jin! Let's get into position!\\" Shortly after. The set, designed to resemble the hallway of a luxury apartment with adjacent iron doors and an elevator door, was captured by the camera. From the front, left, and right. For now, Kang Woo-jin and Jeong Jang-hwan were not visible. The reason was simple. Their entrance involved coming out of the doors, so they were standing behind the set's iron doors. Once the action sign was thrown, Jeong Jang-hwan would move first, followed by Kang Woo-jin. Among them, Kang Woo-jin. 'Phew-' Standing in front of the iron door, he awakened the 'mysterious neighbor' who had been calmly sleeping within him. And he brought it to the surface. This process was now a blink of an eye. In no time, everything from Woo-jin's head to his toes was draped with the 'mysterious neighbor.' Woo-jin's posture and attitude changed. The lines he had memorized thousands of times took their place in his mind, his senses and emotions took root in his heart, and a firm world unfolded before his eyes. Gradually, his ears began to feel stuffed. It started with tinnitus. A noise like a beep spread inside Woo-jin's ears. The sounds of this place gradually disappeared. Into the ground, into the sky. Along with it, the noisy set scene began to vanish one by one like smoke. 'It's quiet.' It felt as if only this piece of the hallway was floating like an island in an endlessly vast space. But it wasn't a pleasant feeling. A world where nothing can be heard is just empty. At least Kang Woo-jin. No, the 'mysterious neighbor' felt that way. It was empty and suffocating. Despair welled up from deep within him. But he endured. He didn't even glance at the despair. Endure? Not quite. He was just deceiving himself with familiarity. Soon, Kang Woo-jin was caught between immense stillness and a faint fear. The frustration of having to live this way for a lifetime, and the overwhelming loss of motivation that overflowed even that frustration. At that moment, the camera behind Woo-jin moved to his side profile. The angle was a bust shot. Therefore, Woo-jin's face appeared on one of the many monitors being watched. Writer Lee Wol-seon's eyes filled with seriousness as she covered her mouth. \\"Before the main acting starts. Yet he seems to have captured the world of the 'mysterious neighbor' all over his face......\\" The scripter and several other staff members also let out exclamations in a row. \\"Wow- Look at Woo-jin's unfocused eyes.\\" \\"The detail is what—there's an expression, but it's like there's no expression... Where do you learn such expression?\\" \\"How many seconds did it take now? It's ridiculously fast to get into character......\\" Around this time, Writer Lee Wol-seon asked the sign language expert seated to her right. \\"How do you find that expression?\\" The sign language expert, with wide eyes, replied softly. \\"There's no sense of alienation, no, it really feels real. Even someone like me who doesn't know acting can tell it's amazing. How does he do that?\\" And the action hadn't even started yet. Soon, the director at the first monitor looked at Woo-jin on the screen and chuckled. 'Ordinary actors avoid playing disabled characters. It's scary. But this guy has no hesitation. And yet, there's a chilling sense of vitality.' With awe and seriousness, the director slowly raised the megaphone. Then he shouted across the set. \\"Action!\\" Immediately, the bustling set went silent as if everyone had eaten honey. But to Kang Woo-jin. To the 'mysterious neighbor,' it meant nothing. It was all the same either way. Then. -Thunk! Jeong Jang-hwan. No, 'Song Tae-hyung' opened the front iron door. The camera was on his front. Song Tae-hyung appeared, rubbing his hands as if he had just sprayed hand sanitizer. At the same time. -Click. The iron door of Song Tae-hyung's neighbor also opened. The 'mysterious neighbor' appeared slowly. Song Tae-hyung frowned immediately. \\"Tsk.\\" On the other hand. -Swish. Woo-jin noticed Song Tae-hyung's presence not by sound but by sight. A tiny bit of joy tinged his pale complexion. A situation had been created from stiff loss. That was exactly Woo-jin's expression at the moment. He didn't dislike Song Tae-hyung. 'His house always smells good.' He wasn't sure if it was because of the sensitive smell, but Kang Woo-jin liked the scent that came from his house when the door opened. The camera then pulled back, capturing both Woo-jin and Jeong Jang-hwan in a two-shot. The change in both was clearly displayed on the monitor. The two characters were looking at each other, but communication was impossible. 'Song Tae-hyung' had voluntarily cut himself off, while Kang Woo-jin had been involuntarily isolated. Therefore, their understanding, thoughts, opinions, and perceptions were all different. At that moment, Kang Woo-jin took a step towards 'Song Tae-hyung.' Song Tae-hyung flinched, but the deaf Woo-jin just smiled faintly. To others, it might seem like an ambiguous smile, but to Woo-jin, it was affirmation. He liked Song Tae-hyung's diligence. Song Tae-hyung always left his house at the same time. That's why they could meet as if by appointment, without speaking. Woo-jin also liked Song Tae-hyung's neatness. He was always tidy and never disheveled. His stiff expression was aggressive, but Woo-jin liked that too. Song Tae-hyung treated everyone the same, not just Woo-jin. He was consistent. 'When people know about me, they change.' Whether it was out of consideration or aversion, everyone who had encountered Kang Woo-jin, the 'mysterious neighbor,' had been the same. It wasn't bad. Woo-jin just thought Song Tae-hyung, who was always aggressive towards everyone, looked cool. It seemed the standard of fairness wasn't with others but with himself. Kang Woo-jin's hand twitched. The camera, from Woo-jin's hand to his forearm and then his face, zoomed in for a close-up. At that moment, Woo-jin's eyes had changed. They were filled with longing and torment. Then, the sign language expert watching the monitor suddenly widened her eyes. \\"My, my goodness.\\" Writer Lee Wol-seon quickly followed up on her words. \\"......Yes, I was about to say the same thing.\\" \\"Right now, Woo-jin doesn't look like an ordinary person.\\" \\"How did he bring such a deep intensity to this short performance, to this brief role?\\" Woo-jin was neither provocative nor transparent. And he was diluted. He was dispirited but had not given up hope. That hope soon turned into despair. Song Tae-hyung, or Jeong Jang-hwan, watching the expression head-on, hesitated. 'I get it, why the big shots are clinging to this guy. If he looks like this to my eyes, then to theirs......' Then Song Tae-hyung's distinct line was heard. \\"What on earth is it?\\" Lip-reading. Woo-jin, who had lost all sound, understood his words by the shape of his mouth. He's asking something. From there, Kang Woo-jin's eyes filled with countless past memories. At the end, 'worry' was waiting. I want to ask questions too, I want to talk, can I do that? Change is scary, won't he be shocked when he sees me? Can we become friends? However, Song Tae-hyung, perhaps disgusted by the 'mysterious neighbor,' clicked his tongue and went his way. \\"It's annoying, I should move or something.\\" The camera, in front of Song Tae-hyung, captures him and then slowly approaches Kang Woo-jin, who is still standing in place, watching Song Tae-hyung's back. Just this scene alone was sufficiently strange. No, everything Woo-jin had shown in his performance so far was like that. He acted solely with his gaze, expression, and detailed gestures and hand movements, without a single line of dialogue. Everyone watching the monitors, as well as the viewers, would surely see it that way. That man, the silent neighbor, is suspicious. Just as they were about to confirm that, Kang Woo-jin, who had been still, slowly raised both hands. His facial muscles relaxed. Then Woo-jin spoke to Song Tae-hyung's back. 'I like you.' For him, sign language was his dialogue. Soon, Woo-jin's face was zoomed in on the monitor. A slightly relaxed smile of the 'mysterious neighbor' was captured. Perhaps by this point, the viewers would realize. It's not that he's strange, it's that he can't. It was a scene pulled entirely by emotion. It could have been difficult to understand if it went slightly awry. But so far, Kang Woo-jin had not made a single mistake. He was complete and perfect. All those processes, emotions, and expressions were firmly pressed into the camera. There was not a single word, but it was more sensual than a hundred words. Deep and rich. The actors, both on the monitor and in reality, reacted in their own ways. They were either captivated or. \\"......\\" Or they silently exclaimed with rough admiration. \\"Wow- That gaze, that expression, how on earth does he do that......\\" The commonality was that all the actors eventually converged on one conclusion. That's not the kind of acting a rookie can do. Then the actors watching Woo-jin's performance widened their eyes even more. Not because it was intense, but because they were overwhelmed by the calm and dignified performance. Now, Kang Woo-jin's hands moving in the air, his sign language. 'Can't we become friends?' It was excessively bitter yet poignant. Then, without realizing it, Writer Lee Wol-seon chuckled. \\"He just tore up the script and came out.\\" The two-day performance of a minor role by a rookie actor had just casually replaced the standards of Lee Wol-seon, a star writer with 20 years of experience. \\"It's serious, my standards have become too high. It would have been better not to have seen it at all.\\" At this moment, in Japan. While Kang Woo-jin was turning the set of \\"Freezing Romance\\" upside down, an absurd and out-of-place presence related to \\"Night Parasite\\" had emerged in Japan. \\"The Kashihi Group shows interest in the crumbling 'Night Parasite'? Rumors swirl in the film industry.\\" It was the Kashihi Group. < Counterattack (3) > End"},{"instruction":"translate to english, dont change symbol and line break.

[“강우진님은 일본 수어도 잘하시는데 일본어도 엄청 잘하시나 봐요! PD님이나 스탭들이랑도 엄청 편하게 대화하셨어요.”] [“그러니?”] 일본어까지? 회장은 약간의 확신이 들었다. 더불어 진심 어린 감탄까지. ‘일본 수어에, 일본어까지? 평범한 배우는 아닌 모양이야. 과연 떠들썩할 만한 이유가 있군,’ 잠시간 속으로 읊조리던 회장이 생각의 주제를 바꿨다. 눈앞 손자의 행복한 미소에 집중한 것. ‘어쨌든 감사해, 이 아이가 잃었던 웃음을 선물해줬으니.’ 거의 10년 만에 본 손자의 웃음이었다. 그런 손자의 뒤쪽 책상 위엔 여러 서류가 겹쳐 있었다. 그 서류 표지에 붙은 회사 상호. -카시히. ‘카시히 그룹’. 일본의 재계서열 10위 안에 걸린 대기업. ‘카시히 그룹’은 화학, 섬유, 건설, 주택, 식품, 전자, 의약품 등 수많은 사업과 계열사를 거느렸다. 한국 대기업 포함, 여러 기업과 관계가 깊은 사업도 더러 있었다. 회장은 그 ‘카시히 그룹’을 이끄는 최상위 포식자며 오너였다. 이름은 요시무라 히데키 회장. 대놓고 재벌가 집안. 하지만 재벌가 회장이라도 해도 인간이며 사람이었다. 급작스레 닥친 사고는 피할 재간이 없었다. 약 10년 전 안타까운 비보가 있었던 것. 『카시히 그룹 부사장 참변, 차에는 아내와 아들이 타고 있었다』 히데키 회장의 첫째 아들. 즉, 장남 부부의 차 사고가 있었다. 차 안엔 부부와 네 살배기 아들이 타고 있었다. 안타깝게도 부모는 즉사. 어린 아들만이 기적적으로 살 수 있었다. 엄마가 감싼 탓이었다. 그 사고로 네 살배기 손자는 청력과 말을 잃었다. 물론, 히데키 회장에겐 아들이 셋이 있었고 연결된 가족도 퍽 많았다. 하지만 기대받던 장남과 며느리가 눈을 감았고, 그 부부가 어렵사리 잉태한 어린 손자는 4살에 장애를 가지게 됐다. 히데키 회장으로선 장남 부부의 사망으로 내장이 끊어지듯 했지만, 손자가 살아준 것만으로도 천만다행이었다. 이 정도쯤 되다 보니 회장에게 손자는, 요시무라 신고는 목숨과도 같았다. 극진히 아낄 수밖엔 없었다. ‘신고는 내가 어떻게든 살려야 해.’ 히데키 회장은 네 살배기 손자인 요시무라 신고를 옆에 두고 직접 키우기 시작했다. 대기업을 이끄는 수장임에도 수어도 배워야 했고, 농아인에 관해 공부도 해야 했다. 허나 손자인 신고는 커갈수록 생기를 잃어갔다. 대기업의 손자라는 주변의 시기 질투도 한몫했으며, 뭣보다 신고가 가진 장애가 가장 큰 이유였다. 학교에서나 세상에서 신고는 혼자였다. 고립됐다. 덕분에 신고는 8살 무렵부턴 아예 표정이 사라졌고, 10살부터는 세상과 단절했다. 뒤로는 심각한 우울증까지 겹쳐 상태가 더욱이 나빠졌다. 그게 14살 된 최근까지도 유지됐다. 신고는 약 10년간 웃지 않았으며, 언제나 로봇같이 딱딱한 얼굴로 지냈다. 수어 선생을 빼면 사람의 교류도 끊었다. 당연히 히데키 회장도 손자에게 별짓을 다 해봤었다. 정신과 치료부터 각종 치료로 돈을 들이부었고, 수어를 통달해 시간이 날 때마다 신고를 극진히 보살폈다. 하지만 모든 건 의미가 없었다. 수억 수백억을 쏟았다 한들, 신고의 웃음과 생기를 되찾아 줄 수 없었다. 신고는 더욱더 방에 틀어박혔고 정신이 죽어갔다. 오직 게임과 각종 영상을 보며 시간을 보낼 뿐이었다. 이쯤 신고가 넷플렉스의 ‘프로파일러 한량’을 보게 됐다. 원래도 신고는 한국 드라마를 즐겨봤었다. 워낙 많은 컨텐츠를 보던 신고였고, 일본의 정형화된 연기와 연출이 질렸었으니까. 더불어 일본을 벗어나고픈 속마음도 있었다. 뭐가 됐든 신고는 ‘박대리’에 꽂혔다. 이유야 간단했다. ‘차 사고.’ ‘박대리’의 과거 서사가 자신과 비슷한 게 있었기 때문. 결은 매우 달랐으나 ‘박대리’도 차 사고로 부모를 잃었고 신고 역시 마찬가지였다. 자연스럽게 박대리를 연기한 강우진에 관심을 가진 신고. 한국의 배우 강우진은 대단했다. 신인임에도 한국과 일본을 뒤집고 있었으니까. 심지어 너튜브 채널을 보니, 한국인인데도 심히 유창한 일본어로 커버 노래 영상 올리는 중이었다. 그렇게 신고는 ‘아메토크 show!’ 녹화까지 가게 되고. 돌아와서는 대뜸 웃음을 되찾은 채였다. 아무리 돈을 쏟아부어도, 그 어떤 방법을 동원해도 정신이 죽어가던 신고의 생기가 단숨에 폭발하고 있었다. 그러니 히데키 회장의 발작에 가까운 감격은 자연스러운 것이었다. 목숨과 같은 손자가 다시 살아난 느낌이었으니까. 그것이 히데키 회장에게 희망을 선사했고, 그 얼굴도 모를 강우진이란 한국 배우에게 무한한 감사를 느꼈다. 이때. [“할아버지!”] 손자 신고가 히데키 회장에게 흥분 섞인 수어를 추가했다. [“강우진님과 언젠가는 또 대화할 수 있겠죠?”] [“기회가 닿는다면. 물론, 그 기회는 네가 만들어 돼. 방에 틀어박히면 힘들겠지.”] [“응! 곧, ‘남사친’이란 드라마가 일본에 나온다고 했어요! 빨리 보고 싶다. 아, 그리고 강우진님이 우리나라 대단한 감독님이랑 영화도 찍는대요!”] [“일본 영화를?”] [“그거 보러 가도 돼요? 개봉하면 같이 봐요 할아버지!”] [“그래, 그러자꾸나. 개봉은 언제니?”] [“이제 곧 촬영 시작할 거라는 기사를 봤어요! 기대된다. 할아버지! 저도 강우진님 같은 배우가 될 수 있을까요? 말은 못 하지만 수어 배우가 되고 싶어요.”] 히데키 회장은 순간 울컥했다. 하지만 억지로 참았다. 지금 사랑스런 손자에겐 눈물이 아닌 희망을 실어 줘야 했으니. [“네가 할 수 있다고 생각하면 할 수 있는 거란다. 그 정신이 중요해, 내가 옆에서 도와주마.”] [“응! 할아버지.”] 죽어가던, 세상을 등졌던 손자에게 꿈과 목표가 보인다. 이 얼마나 아름다운 광경인가. 수어를 주고받는 서재는 무척이나 고요했으나, 신고의 맑은 눈동자엔 용기가 솟고 있었고. [“아! 이제 수어 선생님 올 시간이다! 할아버지, 저 수어 공부 엄청 열심히 할게요!”] 미소 가득한 신고가 서재를 뛰쳐나갔다. 그 뒷모습을 보며 히데키 회장은 희열마저 느끼고 있었다. 대규모 사업 프로젝트가 성공할 때보다 더 큰 고양감. “······강우진이라고 했나? 고마워서 눈물이 날 지경이군.” 진심이었다. 어떤 상황이 있었는지는 정확히 몰라도, 강우진은 히데키 회장이 10년간 돈을 들이부어도 못한 걸 하루 만에 해냈다. 의도야 없었겠지만 히데키 회장에겐 태산과도 같은 문제가 지워진 것과 같았다. “신고가 측은했는지도 모르겠어, 자기가 일본 수어를 배운 과거가 떠올랐을 거야.” 이어 서재 책상에 놓인 정장 재킷을 입은 히데키 회장이 픽 웃었다. 그리곤 의미심장한 말을 뱉었다. “그런 배우가 대성해야지.” 이 시각, 다시 ‘토에가’ 영화사. ‘변화를 두려워하는, 썩어 빠진 멍청한 놈들 때문’이라는 쿄타로 감독의 대답에 회의실 분위기가 팍 가라앉았다. 이를 눈치챈 최성건이 옆에 앉은 강우진에게 속삭였다. “왜 그래? 무슨 일인데?” 우진이 무심한 톤으로 투자 문제에 관해 적당히 설명을 뱉었다. 그러자 최성건의 눈이 약간 커졌다. “대본리딩이 내년 초까지 밀린다고?” “예.” 바로 머리를 굴리는 최성건. 워낙 경험이 풍부했기에 금세 그림이 그려졌다. ‘혹시나 했었는데- 설마 진짜 이런 일이 벌어질 줄이야, 우진이가 일본에서 터진 만큼 아니꼽게 보는 시선도 충분히 있을 순 있지.’ 실제 강우진을 향한 악플도 꽤 늘었다. 한국이나 일본이나. 정작 우진은 전혀 눈길도 안 준다만, 케어를 담당하는 최성건은 정확히 파악하고 있었다. 즉, ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’ 투자자들은 그 세력들의 눈치를 봤을 가능성이 컸다. 투자금이 한두 푼이 아니니까. ‘아니면 아싸리 투자자들 사이에서 한국 배우가 중심이 되는 그림을 꺼렸을 수도 있고. 여하튼 이건 꽤 골치 아픈데.’ 최성건의 계산에선 말만 내년 초로 밀리는 것이고, ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’의 제작 전체 일정이 틀어진 것과 같았다. 그리되면 배우 캐스팅이 얼마나 진행됐는지는 모르나, 주요 배우들이 발을 뺄 수도 있다. 이미 꾸려진 여러 스탭팀들도 마찬가지. 그러면 자연스레 업계 전체로 별별 잡소리 개소리가 돌고, 행여 언론·여론이 이 소식을 접한다면 작품에 지대한 악영향을 미치게 된다. ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’은 워낙 유명하니 파괴력은 두 배 이상. ‘뭣보다 작품의 기세가 원래 좋긴 했어도, 우진이로 홍보력 최대치로 팍 올렸는데 그게 싹 허사가 돼.’ 이는 일본만이 아닌 한국도 마찬가지였다. 곧, 최성건이 건너편 쿄타로 감독에게 재빨리 물었다. 물론, 한국어였고. “투자자 문제- 아무리 그래도 감독님이나 아카리 작가님 이름값이 얼만데, 투자금이 이리 쉽게 빠진다는 게 좀 이상하지 않습니까?” 강우진의 통역을 들은 쿄타로 감독이 씁쓸하게 웃었다. “물론 저희의 이름값은 결코 작지 않아요. 다만, 작가님은 그저 원작자일 뿐입니다. 그리고 우리 작품은 시작 발표부터 잡음이 심했습니다. 원작 팬들이 워낙 강성하고 여러 세계에 분포돼 있어서. 물론, 반대 여론이 초반엔 더 극성이었습니다.” “······” “그래도 강행했어요. 투자자들이 걱정을 표하긴 했지만, 제가 밀어붙였기에 진행은 됐습니다. 근데 우진씨 합류부터 다시 삐걱대기 시작했습니다. 전 확신하지만 그들은 아니었던 거죠.” “그래서 안 되겠다 싶기에 발을 뺀다?” “투자자들은 도전적인 걸 꺼립니다. 특히, 일본에서 그 성향은 더 심해요. 지금 우진씨로 일본은 뒤집혔고, 그 관심 역시 극성이다 싶을 정도로 높아요.” 쿄타로 감독이 팔짱을 낀다. “그런데 행여 이 작품이 잘 안되면? 원작 팬들 포함 그 모든 이가 등을 돌리게 되고, 한국 배우를 합류시킨 것에 관해 욕을 먹게 될까 두려운 겁니다, 투자자들은. 겁쟁이들.” 이쯤 강우진은. -스윽. 바로 앞에 놓인, ‘낯기생’(‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’) 시나리오를 집었다. 용도는 미팅 용이었지만, 강우진은 아공간 통로로써 사용했다. -푹! 남몰래 아공간에 진입한 강우진은 재빨리 흰 사각형 앞으로 움직였다. 총 7개의 흰 사각형이 떠 있다. 그중에서 우진은 첫 번째 변화를 확인했다. “아오- 씨, 역시나 이렇게 되나?” -[7/시나리오(제목: 낯선 이의 기괴한 희생), C급] A+였던 ‘낯기생’의 등급이 C까지 내려앉은 것. A+은 최상급이지만 C는 평타였다. 강우진은 진심 어린 탄식을 뱉었다. “하- 평타는 좀 아쉬운데. 투자잔지 나발인지 구하면 다시 오를 수 있나?” 하지만 내년 초는 아직 많이 남았다. 어떤 일이 벌어질지 몰랐다. 그것을 강우진이 예측할 턱이 없었다. 거기다 아직 옅긴 하지만. “역시 연예계. 다사다난하다, 다사다난해.” 뒷배의 그림자가 생기고 있다는 것도 말이다. 이후. 쿄타로 감독과의 미팅을 마친 강우진은 30일 오후 비행기를 타고 한국으로 귀국했다. 참고로 우진의 ‘아메토크 show!’ 게스트로 녹화를 마친 화린은, 강우진보다 하루 먼저 한국에 입국한 상태였다. 뭐가 됐든 강우진이 한국에 돌아왔을 땐 공항은 조용했다. 이유야 간단. 도둑 입국으로 들어왔으니까. 덕분에 나름 조용히 승합차에 오른 우진은. ‘후-’ 간만에 느껴보는 한국의 공기를 들이마셨다. 이때, 조수석에 앉은 최성건이 격려를 던졌다. “‘낯기생’ 잘 될 거다. 워낙 감독 이름값이 높아서 엎어지거나 하진 않을 거야.” “예, 대표님. 괜찮습니다.” “그래. 뭐, 아쉽게도 우리로서는 딱히 할 게 없어. 후킹이나 어그로도 충분히 해줄 만큼 굴려줬고. 솔직히 넌 지금 딱히 그 작품에 목멜 시간도 없거든.” “알고 있습니다.” “우린 일단 기다려 보는 수밖에. 쨌든 우진아. 일본 일정 고생해서 며칠 쉬게 해주고 싶은데, 안타깝게도 스케줄이 공백 내기가 빡세다. 오늘 집 가자마자 아무것도 하지 말고 잠만 자라.” 이어 최성건이 다이어리를 덮으며 정해진 일정을 읊었다. “‘마약상’ 블라인드 시사회부터, ‘실종의 섬’ 티저 포스터 촬영 등으로 풀이니까.” 다음 날 이른 아침, 31일. 일본 도쿄. 8월의 마지막 월요일이었다. 어느새 8월도 오늘이 끝나면 9월로 바뀔 예정. 그럼에도 일본은 한국 못지않게 여전히 뜨거운 날씨였다. 이 아침에도 말이다. 하지만 날씨야 아랑곳없이 으리으리한 주택에서 최고급 세단이 스르륵 빠져나왔다. 히데키 회장의 차였다. 뒤로 승용차 한 대가 더 따른다. 뒤쪽 차엔 경호원들이 탔다. 둘 중 앞쪽의 차 안 뒷좌석에 앉은 히데키 회장이 보인다. 흰 털 섞인 눈썹에 정장을 입은 모습. -팔락. 히데키 회장은 준비된 신문을 펼치면서도 조수석에 앉은 비서실장을 불렀다. “자네도 강우진이란 한국 배우를 아나?” 뜬금없는 질문에 그녀가 고개 돌려 바로 답했다. “최근 그 배우의 일로 일본이 시끄러웠습니다. 그래서 알고는 있습니다.” “그렇군.” “왜 그러시는지.” “한국 배우 강우진, 그 친구에 관해 좀 알아봐. 최대한 빨리.” “예?” 되물음에 히데키 회장이 작게 읊조렸다. “감사를 표할 일이 생겼어, 그렇게만 알면 돼.” < 뒷배 (1) > 끝","output":"< Backing (1) > The chairman, who had a smile spread across his face as he stroked the head of his grandson, who had regained his lost laughter, thought to himself. 'That rookie actor from Korea, his name was- Kang Woojin, wasn't it?' He was building up a misunderstanding, a misconception, all on his own. 'It must be that he has a family member or an important person who is in a similar situation to my grandson. I'm sure of it, sign language is too difficult to learn just as a hobby or out of interest.' It was a plausible situation. For the chairman, it was almost an inevitability. 'Other languages might not be easy either, but they come with their rewards. However, sign language is different. It has limited use compared to other languages and is used by only a subset of people.' In other words, sign language is not something people learn to enhance their careers or resumes. At this point, the chairman began to recall the past, those incredibly difficult days, as he looked into his grandson's eyes. The sign language he learned solely for this child. 'I know it all too well, I know it too well. It must have been hell, even though it's done for a loved one.' Even though he was an actor from a foreign country whose face and voice he did not know, the chairman felt a strong sense of kinship with the actor Kang Woojin. It was impressive enough that he became an actor while learning such sign language, even if he didn't know it. Then he paused. 'Wait. But Japanese sign language? Why Japanese sign language and not Korean sign language? Ah- right, maybe the important person is related to Japan.' He was jumping from one mistake to another. At this moment, his grandson, who had been grinning continuously, added some sign language for the chairman. [\\"Mr. Kang Woojin is good at Japanese sign language, and it seems he's also very good at Japanese! He had a very comfortable conversation with the PD and staff.\\"] [\\"Is that so?\\"] Japanese too? The chairman felt a bit of certainty, along with sincere admiration. 'Japanese sign language, and Japanese language too? He's not an ordinary actor. There's indeed a reason for the buzz,' The chairman muttered to himself for a while and then shifted his thoughts. He focused on the happy smile of his grandson in front of him. 'Anyway, I'm grateful, for he has given this child back the laughter he lost.' It was the first time in almost 10 years that he had seen his grandson's laughter. On the desk behind his grandson, several documents were stacked. On the cover of those documents was the company name. -Kashihi. 'Kashihi Group', a major corporation within the top 10 of Japan's business hierarchy. 'Kashihi Group' had numerous businesses and subsidiaries in chemicals, textiles, construction, housing, food, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and more. It had deep ties with several corporations, including major Korean conglomerates. The chairman was the top predator and owner leading the 'Kashihi Group'. His name was Chairman Yoshimura Hideki. An outright chaebol family. But even a chaebol chairman was human, a person. There was no way to avoid a sudden accident. About 10 years ago, there was a tragic piece of news. \\"Kashihi Group's Vice President Tragically Killed, His Wife and Son Were in the Car\\" Chairman Hideki's eldest son, that is, the car accident involving the eldest son and his wife. The couple and their four-year-old son were in the car. Sadly, the parents died instantly. Only the young son miraculously survived. It was because the mother had shielded him. Due to the accident, the four-year-old grandson lost his hearing and speech. Of course, Chairman Hideki had three sons and a large extended family. However, the highly anticipated eldest son and daughter-in-law had passed away, and their young grandson, conceived with difficulty, became disabled at the age of four. For Chairman Hideki, the death of his eldest son and daughter-in-law felt like his guts were being torn out, but it was a great relief that his grandson had survived. By this point, the grandson, Yoshimura Shingo, was as precious as life itself to the chairman. He had no choice but to cherish him greatly. 'I have to save Shingo no matter what.' Chairman Hideki began to raise his four-year-old grandson, Yoshimura Shingo, by his side. Even as the head of a major corporation, he had to learn sign language and study about the deaf and mute. However, as Shingo grew, he began to lose his vitality. The jealousy and envy of those around him, being the grandson of a major corporation, played a part, and above all, Shingo's disability was the biggest reason. At school and in the world, Shingo was alone. Isolated. As a result, Shingo's expression disappeared around the age of eight, and from the age of ten, he cut himself off from the world. Behind that, severe depression overlapped, worsening his condition. This continued until he was 14 years old. For about 10 years, Shingo did not smile and always had a stiff, robotic face. He cut off human interaction, except with his sign language teacher. Naturally, Chairman Hideki tried everything for his grandson. He poured money into psychiatric treatment and various therapies, and whenever he had time, he took great care of Shingo through sign language. But it was all meaningless. No matter how many hundreds of millions were spent, it was impossible to bring back Shingo's smile and vitality. Shingo became more confined to his room, and his spirit died. He only spent time playing games and watching various videos. Around this time, Shingo started watching Netflix's 'Profiler Hanryang'. Shingo had always enjoyed Korean dramas. He had seen a lot of content, and he was tired of the stereotyped acting and directing in Japan. Moreover, he had a desire to escape Japan. Whatever the reason, Shingo became hooked on 'Assistant Manager Park'. The reason was simple. 'Car accident.' The past narrative of 'Assistant Manager Park' was similar to his own. Although the details were very different, 'Assistant Manager Park' also lost his parents in a car accident, and so did Shingo. Naturally, Shingo became interested in Kang Woojin, the actor who played Park. The Korean actor Kang Woojin was remarkable. Despite being a newcomer, he was turning Korea and Japan upside down. Even on his YouTube channel, he was uploading cover song videos in fluent Japanese, despite being Korean. Thus, Shingo ended up attending the recording of 'Ametalk show!'. And when he returned, he had regained his laughter. No matter how much money was poured in, no matter what methods were used, the vitality that was dying in Shingo exploded in an instant. Therefore, Chairman Hideki's near-convulsive emotion was natural. It felt like his precious grandson had come back to life. It gave Chairman Hideki hope, and he felt infinite gratitude towards the Korean actor Kang Woojin, whose face he didn't even know. At that moment. [\\"Grandfather!\\"] Grandson Shingo added excited sign language to Chairman Hideki. [\\"Will I be able to talk to Mr. Kang Woojin again someday?\\"] [\\"If the opportunity arises. Of course, you have to create that opportunity. It will be difficult if you stay cooped up in your room.\\"] [\\"Yes! Soon, the drama 'Male Friend' will be released in Japan! I want to see it quickly. Oh, and Mr. Kang Woojin is also filming a movie with our country's great director!\\"] [\\"A Japanese movie?\\"] [\\"Can I go see it when it's released? Let's watch it together, grandfather!\\"] [\\"Sure, let's do that. When is it being released?\\"] [\\"I saw an article that they're going to start filming soon! I'm excited. Grandfather! Can I become an actor like Mr. Kang Woojin? I can't speak, but I want to become a sign language actor.\\"] Chairman Hideki was momentarily choked up. But he forced himself to hold back. Right now, his beloved grandson needed hope, not tears. [\\"If you think you can do it, then you can. That mindset is important, I'll help you by your side.\\"] [\\"Yes! Grandfather.\\"] A dream and a goal appeared for the grandson who was dying, who had turned his back on the world. What a beautiful sight it was. The study where they exchanged sign language was very quiet, but courage was welling up in Shingo's clear eyes. [\\"Ah! It's time for the sign language teacher to come! Grandfather, I'll study sign language really hard!\\"] Shingo, full of smiles, ran out of the study. Watching his retreating figure, Chairman Hideki felt a thrill. It was a greater sense of elation than when a major business project succeeded. \\"...Kang Woojin, was it? I'm so grateful I could cry.\\" It was sincere. Whatever the situation had been, Kang Woojin had accomplished in one day what Chairman Hideki had not been able to do with ten years of investment. Although it was unintentional, to Chairman Hideki, it was as if a mountainous problem had been erased. \\"Shingo must have been moved, remembering the past when he learned Japanese sign language.\\" Then, Chairman Hideki, who had put on his suit jacket on the desk in the study, chuckled and uttered a meaningful phrase. \\"Such an actor must succeed.\\" At this moment, back at 'Toega' film company. The atmosphere in the meeting room plummeted after Director Kyotaro's response about 'the stupid fools who fear change and are rotten to the core.' Sensing this, Choi Seong-gun whispered to Kang Woojin, who was sitting next to him. \\"What's wrong? What happened?\\" Woojin casually explained the investment issue in an indifferent tone. Choi Seong-gun's eyes widened slightly. \\"The script reading is postponed until early next year?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Choi Seong-gun quickly processed the information. With his extensive experience, he could easily picture the situation. 'I had a hunch, but to think it would actually happen - there could certainly be enough resentment towards Woojin for making a splash in Japan.' Indeed, the hate comments towards Kang Woojin had increased, both in Korea and Japan. Although Woojin himself paid no attention to them, Choi Seong-gun, who was in charge of his care, was well aware of them. In other words, the investors of 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' were likely watching the reactions of those forces. It wasn't a small amount of investment money. 'Or maybe the investors were simply reluctant to have a Korean actor at the center of the picture. Anyway, this is quite a headache.' In Choi Seong-gun's calculations, it wasn't just a matter of postponing until early next year; the entire production schedule of 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' had been disrupted. If that happened, it was uncertain how far the casting of the main actors had progressed, but they might pull out. The same went for the various staff teams that had already been assembled. Then naturally, all sorts of nonsense and rubbish would circulate throughout the industry, and if the media and public got wind of this news, it would have a significant negative impact on the work. 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger' was quite famous, so the destructive power would be more than doubled. 'Moreover, although the work's momentum was originally good, it had been maximized for promotional power with Woojin, and now all that effort might go to waste.' This was true not only in Japan but also in Korea. Soon, Choi Seong-gun quickly asked Director Kyotaro, who was across from him. Of course, in Korean. \\"About the investor issue - even considering that, isn't it a bit strange that the investment money is withdrawn so easily, given the value of the director's and Akari writer's names?\\" After hearing Kang Woojin's interpretation, Director Kyotaro smiled bitterly. \\"Of course, our names are not small by any means. However, the writer is just the original author. And our work has been noisy from the start of its announcement. The original fans are quite strong and spread across various worlds. Of course, the opposition was more intense at the beginning.\\" \\"...\\" \\"Still, we pushed through. The investors expressed concerns, but since I pushed forward, it proceeded. But it started to wobble again after Woojin joined. I'm sure, but they weren't the ones.\\" \\"So they think it won't work and pull out?\\" \\"Investors are averse to challenges. Especially in Japan, that tendency is even stronger. Right now, Japan is turned upside down because of Woojin, and that attention is so high it seems extreme.\\" Director Kyotaro crossed his arms. \\"But what if this work doesn't do well? If all those people, including the original fans, turn their backs, and the investors are afraid of being criticized for involving a Korean actor. Cowards.\\" At this point, Kang Woojin. -Swish. Picked up the 'Nakgiseng' ('The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger') scenario placed in front of him. It was meant for the meeting, but Woojin used it as a portal to another dimension. -Thud! Kang Woojin, who secretly entered the other dimension, quickly moved to the front of a white rectangle. There were a total of seven white rectangles floating. Among them, Woojin checked the first change. \\"Ah, damn it, so it turned out like this?\\" -[7/Scenario (Title: The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger), Grade C] The grade of 'Nakgiseng', which was A+, had dropped to C. A+ was the highest grade, but C was average. Kang Woojin let out a sincere sigh. \\"Ah- average is a bit disappointing. Can it go back up if I find some investment or something?\\" But early next year was still a long way off. It was unpredictable what would happen. There was no way for Kang Woojin to foresee it. Moreover, although it was still faint. \\"Entertainment industry, always full of ups and downs.\\" The shadow of backing was beginning to form. Afterward. After finishing the meeting with Director Kyotaro, Kang Woojin took a flight back to Korea in the afternoon of the 30th. By the way, Hwarin, who had finished recording 'Ametalk show!' as a guest with Woojin, had entered Korea a day earlier than Kang Woojin. Whatever the case, when Kang Woojin returned to Korea, the airport was quiet. The reason was simple. He entered the country incognito. Thanks to that, Woojin, who quietly got into the van. 'Phew-' Took a breath of Korean air for the first time in a while. At that moment, Choi Seong-gun, sitting in the passenger seat, threw encouragement. \\"'Nakgiseng' will do well. The director's name value is high, so it won't fall apart.\\" \\"Yes, President. It's okay.\\" \\"Right. Well, unfortunately, we don't really have anything to do about it. We've done enough hooking and aggro. Honestly, you don't really have time to worry about that work right now.\\" \\"I'm aware.\\" \\"We'll just have to wait and see. Anyway, Woojin. I'd like to give you a few days off after your hard work in Japan, but unfortunately, the schedule is too tight to afford a break. As soon as you get home today, don't do anything and just sleep.\\" Then Choi Seong-gun closed his diary and recited the scheduled events. \\"From the blind screening of 'Drug Dealer' to the teaser poster shoot for 'The Missing Island', it's full.\\" The next day, early in the morning of the 31st. Tokyo, Japan. It was the last Monday of August. Although August was ending today and September was approaching, Japan was still as hot as Korea. Even this morning. But regardless of the weather, a luxurious sedan smoothly exited a grand residence. It was Chairman Hideki's car. Another sedan followed behind. Bodyguards were in the car behind. Chairman Hideki, sitting in the back seat of the front car, was visible. With white-mixed eyebrows and dressed in a suit. -Flap. While unfolding the prepared newspaper, Chairman Hideki called out to the chief of staff sitting in the passenger seat. \\"Do you know about Kang Woojin, the Korean actor?\\" Caught off guard by the question, she turned her head and immediately answered. \\"Japan has been noisy recently because of that actor. So I am aware of him.\\" \\"I see.\\" \\"Why do you ask?\\" \\"Korean actor Kang Woojin, find out about that guy as soon as possible. As quickly as you can.\\" \\"Excuse me?\\" At her question, Chairman Hideki muttered softly. \\"There's a reason to express gratitude, just know that.\\" < Backing (1) > End"},{"instruction":"< 뒷배 (5) > 승합차 안, 셰프란 주인공 직업을 읊조린 송만우 PD가 설명을 추가했다. “시놉을 좀 더 읽어보면 알겠지만, 그- 정확하는 과거엔 잘나갔지만 현재는 몰락한 셰프랄까?” “다시 일어나는 느낌입니까?” “아마도 그렇게 될 것 같아요. 물론, 방향이 조금 틀어질 순 있지만.” 천천히 고개 끄덕인 강우진이 시선을 다시금 시놉시스에 붙였다. 첫 줄부터 요리 얘기가 나와서 긴가민가했는데, 방금의 송만우 PD의 말을 듣곤 우진도 확신했다. ‘셰프라- 예전에 뭐냐 제목은 기억 안 나는데 셰프 드라마 대박 친 거 있지 않나?’ 보통 시놉시스에는 간단한 전체 줄거리와 개요, 기획, 집필 의도, 등장인물 등이 포함된다. 현재 우진이 보고 있는 시놉도 마찬가지였다. ‘멋있긴 하지, 셰프. 특히 칼질할 때.’ 과거 너튜브에서 봤던 영상을 남몰래 상기하는 강우진. 얼굴은 가린 셰프 너튜버였는데 현란한 칼질에 반해 여러 영상을 봤던 것. 거기 나온 요리도 몇 번 따라 한 적 있는 우진이었다. 어쨌든. -팔락. 시니컬하게 시놉 한 장을 더 넘긴 강우진이 속으로 짧은 한숨을 내뱉었다. 이유야 간단했다. ‘뭐, 이것저것 많이 담겼긴한데- 시놉은 솔직히 나한텐 그냥 종이쪼가리라.’ 아쉽게도 드라마, 영화의 시놉시스는 검은 사각형이 안 뜨니까. 아공간에 들어갈 통로 말이다. 실제 우진의 손에 들린 두 부의 작품 시놉엔 붙은 게 아무것도 없었다. 그저 평범한 얇은 종이 뭉치일 뿐. 예전부터 그랬다. 몇 장짜리 쪽대본은 아공간 통로가 뜨지만, 100장이 넘어가도 시놉시스엔 검은 사각형이 붙진 않았다. 뭐 당연하다면 당연하달까? 애초 시놉시스는 그저 그 작품의 설명이 함축된 PPT일 뿐이니까. 일말의 대사 따윈 없어 설명만이 가득했다. 다른 배우들이야 작품 선정을 위해 시놉을 심도깊게 보는 게 보통이지만, 강우진에겐 그닥 큰 감흥이 없었다. 그래도 일단은 읽는 척은 해준다. 여기서 뜬금. ‘···근데 이 셰프가 주인공인 드라마 대본을 확인하면- 셰프 능력도 얻을 수 있을라나?’ 강우진에게 미약한 기대감이 차올랐다. 아공간이라면 충분히 가능하지 않을까. 그도 그럴 게 보컬 능력이며 많은 언어까지 삽시간에 습득시켜주잖아? ‘요리 실력? 아니면 지식? 뭔 능력이 각인될지는 잘 모르겠는데. 능력이야 뭐가 됐든 쌉가능 아닌가?’ 늘 기상천외한 아공간이니 반전이 있을진 모른다만 가능성은 매우 컸다. 이 순간, 셰프 관련 능력을 얻는다면 어디다 쓸지 몇 가지가 파팍 떠오르는 그. ‘당장 생각나는 건 ‘우리네 식탁’.’ 예능계 거물인 윤병선 PD가 제작 준비 중인, 강우진 포함 많은 탑스타가 출연할 초대형 예능. ‘우리네 식탁’ 역시 큰 틀로 보면 ‘요리’가 주제였다. 그것 말고도 실생활에도 쓸모가 많겠지. 반면, 우진의 묵묵한 얼굴을 보며 턱수염 송만우 PD는 마른 침을 꿀떡 삼켰다. ‘거참, 말없이 보기만 하니까 긴장되는구만.’ 강우진. 아니, 강토템을 격하게 신봉하는 그였으니까. 드라마판 걸물임에도 그의 손엔 땀이 찰 지경이었다. 어찌보면 강토템에게 평가를 받는 그림이기도 했기에. 현재 송만우 PD는 방송국을 퇴사한 상태였다. 아직 한량 관련 일이 마무리된 건 아니지만, 그건 인수인계와 함께 필요하면 합류하는 형태로 마무리됐다. 즉, 송만우 PD는 독립했다. 그리고 신생 제작사의 사장을 맡았다. 물론, 표면적으로는 그렇고 바지사장이었다. 대표가 두 명인 셈. 송만우 PD는 얼굴마담 겸 대표 연출자로 봐야 했고, 독립하고 첫 작품을 위해 선별한 드라마 시놉을 강우진에게 제일 먼저 가져온 참이었다. 한량의 종방연 때 했던 약속 관련 때문. 당연히 우진이 바쁠 걸 알기에 송만우 PD는 이 광고 촬영장까지 손수 찾아왔다. 거물이고 나발이고 예의를 지킨 것. ‘이 미친 스케줄에 시간을 내준 것도 감사하지.’ 당연히 우진을 향한 신앙심도 포함됐고. 이쯤. -스윽. 두 번째 시놉까지 보던 ‘시늉’을 하던 강우진이 무심한 얼굴로 입을 열었다. “PD님.” “어어어, 듣고 있어요 우진씨.” “이 두 작품, 대본은 안 나온 겁니까?” 되물음에 턱수염 송만우 PD가 고개를 저었다. “있긴 해요. 근데 아직 완성은 아니고. 두 작품 다 1화씩은 나온 상태? 근데 어떤 작품을 갈지 확정은 아니라서 진행 홀드 잡은 거고.” “그렇습니까? 흠-” 짧게 침음을 뱉던 우진이 시놉 두 부를 정갈히 겹치며 목소리를 깔았다. “그럼 그 미완성된 대본들을 제가 받아볼 수 있습니까?” “그거야 문제없지만. 바쁜데 괜찮겠어요? 적당히 언질만 줘도 나는 괜찮긴 한데. 혹시 번거로울까 해서.” “상관없습니다, 보내주셔도.” 금세 송만우 PD의 표정이 밝아졌다. “알겠어요! 두 작품 다 보내달란 거지?” 뭐 그게 자연스럽겠지. 강우진이 근엄히 고개를 끄덕였다. “네, 두 작품 다.” “오케이! 하하, 강토템님 바쁘신데 몸 둘 바를 모르겠구만. 그럼 정리해서 대본은 우진씨네 회사로.” “아니요. 가능하면 제집으로 부탁드립니다.” “그래요? 어어, 그럼 집으로 보내둘게요. 오늘 스케줄이- 역시 밤에 끝나죠?” “예.” 그 순간. -똑똑. 승합차 창문에 노크 소리가 퍼졌다. 곧, 승합차 뒷문이 열리며 꽁지머리 최성건의 웃는 얼굴이 보였다. “PD님. 죄송합니다만, 이제 슬슬 우진씨 촬영이 시작돼서요.” “아! 그래요, 우진씨 시간 내줘서 진짜진짜 고마워요. 얼른 가봐!” 이어 간단히 마무리 인사를 한 송만우 PD는 가까운 곳에 주차된 자신의 차로 뛰었고, 우진은 최성건과 나란히 광고 촬영장으로 움직였다. 최성건이 말을 건 것은 이때. “송 PD님이 뭐래?” “시놉 주셨습니다.” “아- 그래, 저 양반 독립했지? 들어보니까 워낙 거물이기도 하고 한량이 초대박나서 투자도 빵빵하게 받았다드만. 후, 우리도 투자금 제대로 땅겨야 하는데.” 최성건. 아니, bw 엔터는 요즘 확장을 노릴 준비가 한창이었다. 여러 투자자를 선별하고 bw 엔터의 미래 가치를 산정 중. 여기서 ‘투자금’ 단어 때문에 우진이 ‘낯기생’을 떠올렸다. “일본 쪽, ‘낯기생’ 상태는 어떻습니까?” “그쪽이랑 연락도 하고 계속 모니터링 중인데.” 잠시 말을 멈춘 최성건이 난감한 듯 턱을 긁었다. “솔직히 상황은 더 나빠졌다. 이미지 실추도 많이 됐고. 여론이 확 뒤집히는 상황이 나오진 않을 거다. 지금이라도 빠질 생각 있냐? 아무도 너 욕할 사람 없으니까 편하게 결정해도 돼.” “아니요, 기다리겠습니다.” “······워낙 공과 사가 확실한 너니까 의리 예의 그런 건 아닐 거고. 이유가 있냐?” ‘낯기생’이 S+급으로 올라서요. 라고는 말 못 하니 우진이 대강 둘러댔다. “그냥 ‘낯기생’이 하고 싶을 뿐입니다.” 다만, 이 멘트에서 최성건은. ‘역시, ‘낯기생’에 뭔가 삘이 빡 꽂힌 거야. 아니고선 사태가 이 지경인데 버틸 이유가 없으니까. 그 미친 감이 발동한 거면···’ 약간의 착각 한스푼을 멋대로 삼키는 중이었다. 같은 시각, 일본. 도쿄에 있는 ‘낯기생’의 ‘토에가’ 영화사는 부산스럽기 짝이 없었다. 여전히 사태가 사그라지지 않았으니까. 아니, 첫 기사가 터지고 약 일주일간 더욱이 상황이 나빠졌다. 『투자금 줄줄 샌다는 「낯기생」, 타노구치 쿄타로 감독 이대로 무너지나』 뭐랄까, ‘낯기생’의 인지도는 가히 최고점을 찍고 있었지만, 반대로 여러 잡소리와 개소리 역시 미친 듯이 쏟아지는 중이었다. 이에 ‘토에가’ 영화사는 발 빠르게 움직여 해명 기사 등을 쏴봤지만. 『토에가 측 “투자금 축소는 사실이지만, 기타 기사들은 사실 무근”』 불길은 쉬이 잡히지 않았다. 이에 ‘낯기생’에 캐스팅된 배우들부터, 일본 연예계의 배우들 사이로도 수많은 소문이 돌기 시작했고. “감독님! 투자를 다시 생각해보자는 얘기가 자꾸 들어옵니다!” “······이런. 이번엔 어딥니까?” 이미 빠져나간 투자자들은 그렇다 쳐도 남았던 투자금까지 흔들리는 중이었다. 벌써 약 60%의 투자금이 발을 뺀 것. 물론, 쿄타로 감독이나 영화사 측이 새 투자금 유치를 위해 백방으로 뛰어다니고 있다만 결과는 좋지 못했다. 뭐, 당연한 흐름이긴 했다. 빤히 사태가 안 좋은 게 보이는데 어느 투자자가 나서려고 할까? 소극적으로 변하며 구멍이 좁아질 수밖엔 없었다. 이쯤 되면 쿄타로 감독과 영화사가 할 결정은 하나뿐이었다. “감독님···현재 남은 제작비 정도로 영화 규모를 줄이는 건 어떠십니까?” 사이즈를 크게 줄이는 것. 하지만 쿄타로 감독은 그것만은 절대 안 될 일이라 생각했다. “아니. 그럴 거면 차라리 제작을 포기하는 게 맞아요. 거기다 남은 투자금이 유지될지도 불투명하고.” “···흠. 그래도 뭔가 결정은 해야 합니다. 저희 영화 포함 우진씨에게도 근거 없는 찌라시가 계속 붙습니다. 거기다 우진씨 빼고, 나머지 배우들 움직임이 심상치 않습니다. 그나마 남은 투자금이 있을 때 뭐라도 해야 됩니다. ” “······” “일단 급한대로 크랭크인을 올린 뒤에 차차 투자금을 매꾸는 방법은 어떻습니까?” 어떤 방법인들 모두 극단적이었다. 쿄타로 감독은 슬슬 자신의 뚝심이 무리였나? 싶었다. 일본은 변화하기에 준비가 안 된 건가? 뭐가 됐든 이대로 시간을 보내면 강우진 포함 모두 피해를 볼 뿐이었다. 심경이 복잡한 쿄타로 감독. 이미 일주는 넘게 발버둥 쳤지만 이렇다 할 묘수가 없다. ‘밀고 나갈지 멈출지를 결정해야 할 때야.’ GO 또는 STOP을 확정 지을 타이밍. 바로 그때였다. -♬♪ 책상 위에 놓인 쿄타로 감독의 핸드폰이 울렸다. 발신자는 저장 안 된 번호. 최근 언론사 측의 무분별한 전화가 많았기에 무시할까 하던 그는. “후-” 행여 소문이 날까 싶어 일단 전화를 받았다. “네, 타노구치 쿄타롭니다.” 핸드폰 너머 상대는 여자였으며 기자도 아니었다. “안녕하세요, 감독님. 카시히 그룹의 테츠가와 리리라고 합니다.” 바로 두 눈을 끔뻑이는 쿄타로 감독. “······카시히 그룹? 제가 아는 그 카시히 그룹이 맞습니까?” 일본의 재계서열 10위 안의 초대기업. “맞습니다, 감독님.” 어이가 없을 정도로 황당한 상대였다. “감독님을 뵙고자 하시는 분이 계십니다.” “저를 말입니까? 누가?” 하지만 핸드폰 너머 여자는 한없이 차분했다. “‘낯기생’의 투자금 전부를 대주실 분입니다.” 밤, 강우진의 오피스텔. 방금 강우진을 내려준 승합차가 스르륵 지하주차장을 빠져나간다. 그것을 가만- 히 지켜보던 우진이. “······” 승합차가 완전히 사라진 뒤에야 온몸을 휘감고 있던 컨셉질을 풀었다. “파하- 뒤지겠네. 아니야, 이미 사망한 상태일지도.” 지금 시각 밤 11시 40분. 대충 봐도 늦은 시간이지만, 강우진에게 있어서는 오늘이 평소보다 퇴근이 빠른 것이었다. 그렇기에 강우진의 눈동자 속엔 피곤이 가득했다. 곧, 그가 몸을 돌려서는 걷기 시작했다. 오늘 쳐낸 스케줄을 상기하면서. ‘나 오늘 뭐 했더라. 진심 기억도 안남.’ 그러나 워낙 정신이 없어선지 잘 기억도 안 났다. 일본을 다녀온 게 벌써 3주나 지났다니. 작게 읊조린 우진이 엘리베이터에 오른 뒤 1층을 눌렀다. 바로 집에 가지 않는 이유는 간단했다. ‘택배함에 있을 거랬나?’ 아침에 만났던 턱수염 송만우 PD가 대본을 보내놨다는 연락을 했었으니까. 역시나 택배함에는 약간 두꺼운 누런 서류봉투가 보였다. 그것을 집은 그가 다시금 엘리베이터에 올랐다. 위잉 소리를 내며 올라가는 틈에 강우진이 서류봉투를 뜯었다. -투둑! 피곤함이 가득했으나, 그 사이에서 약간의 기대감이 파생된다. 물론, 아침에 들었던 능력 습득 관련 때문. “보자-” 누런 봉투 안에는 대본 두 부가 담겨 있었다. 이쯤 엘리베이터가 층에 도착해 문을 열었고, 금방 집에 도착한 우진이 신발을 대강 벗고는 누런 봉투 안에서 대본 두 부를 꺼냈다. 둘 다 확인해보긴 해야 하지만 당장 강우진이 찾을 건 하나였다. “그 셰프가 나온다는 게 뭐지?” 오래 확인할 것도 없었다. 찾던 대본의 제목이 딱 눈에 들어왔으니까. -‘칭송받는 셰프’ 타이틀을 확인한 우진이 작게 웃었다. “이거네, 이거.” 이어 누런 봉투를 가까운 식탁에 올린 우진이 ‘칭송받는 셰프’ 대본을 들었다. 뭐 당연하겠지만, 아침에 봤던 시놉과는 달리 대본 옆에는 익숙한 검은 사각형이 보인다. 회색과 검은색이 회오리치는 느낌의. 그것을 대수롭지 않게 검지로 찍는 강우진. -푹! 어느새 우진은 끝없이 암흑으로 가득한, 집보다 백배는 자주 오는 아공간에 진입했다. 그대로 길쭉하게 기지개를 켜던 우진이 가슴팍 정도로 둥둥 뜬 흰 사각형 쪽으로 걸었다. 방금의 대본이 흰 사각형으로 추가됐다. 일단, 강우진은 최근 아공간을 오면 늘 확인하는 것부터 찾았다. -[7/시나리오(제목: 낯선 이의 기괴한 희생), S+급] ‘낯기생’의 등급. “응, 아직 S+급 그대로고.” 돌연 떡상한 ‘낯기생’ S+ 등급은 유지되고 있었다. 만족한 강우진이 제일 마지막의 흰 사각형에 시선을 돌렸다. -[8/대본(제목: ‘칭송받는 셰프’), C급] 아쉽게도 ‘칭송받는 셰프’는 C등급이었다. 즉, 평타. 이때 우진이 급작스레 고개를 저었다. “C면 나쁘지 않은 거지, 미친놈이 눈이 높아진 건가-” 스스로를 질타하던 그가 ‘칭송받는 셰프’의 흰 사각형을 터치했다. 그러자 보이는 문구가 금방 바뀐다. -[8/대본(제목: ‘칭송받는 셰프’)을 선택하셨습니다.] -[리딩(경험) 가능한 인물을 나열합니다.] -[A:장현재······] 뒤쪽 배역은 신경 쓸 필요가 없었다. 우진이 필요한 건 오로지 주인공. 강우진은 고민하는 것 없이 나열된 배역 중 첫 번째인 주인공을 터치했다. 그러면서도 속으로 주문을 외웠다. ‘나와라, 나와. 떠라! 떠!’ 로봇 같은 여자 목소리가 바로 배역 리딩을 하겠다 하면 꽝이고, 평소와 다른 뉘앙스의 멘트를 치면 합격이었다. 그때였다. [“기본 스팩 이상의 능력이 감지됩니다. ‘셰프의 테크닉’을 먼저 습득합니다.”] 어깨춤을 출 결과가 아공간 전체로 퍼졌다. 순간, 강우진이 양손을 짝 쳤다. 합격이었으니까. 근데 ‘셰프의 테크닉’? 짧은 순간 그가 각인될 능력에 관해 궁금증을 가졌을 무렵. [“······”] 잠시 조용하던 로봇 같은 여자 목소리가 재차 울려 퍼졌다. [“기본 스팩 이상의 능력이 감지됩니다. ‘셰프의 레시피’를 먼저 습득합니다.”] 듣자마자 강우진의 두 눈이 약간 확장됐다. “어? 두 개?” 이런 경우는 처음이었으니까. < 뒷배 (5) > 끝","output":"< Backing (5) > Inside the van, PD Song Man-woo, who had just recited the protagonist's occupation as a chef, added an explanation. \\"If you read the synopsis a bit more, you'll see that he—was a successful chef in the past but is now fallen, perhaps?\\" \\"Is it about him rising again?\\" \\"It seems likely to go that way. Of course, the direction might shift a bit.\\" Kang Woojin nodded slowly and refocused his attention on the synopsis. He had been unsure when he first saw the mention of cooking in the opening lines, but after hearing PD Song Man-woo's words, Woojin was convinced. 'A chef, huh—wasn't there a hit drama about a chef before? I can't remember the title.' Typically, a synopsis includes a brief overall plot, outline, planning, writing intentions, characters, etc. The synopsis Woojin was looking at was no different. 'Being a chef is cool, especially when they're chopping.' Kang Woojin secretly recalled a video he had seen on YouTube. It was a chef YouTuber with a hidden face, but Woojin had watched several videos, captivated by the dazzling knife skills. He had even tried some of the recipes shown there. Anyway. -Flap. Woojin cynically flipped another page of the synopsis and let out a short sigh internally. The reason was simple. 'Well, it contains a lot of stuff, but honestly, to me, a synopsis is just a piece of paper.' Unfortunately, synopses for dramas and movies don't trigger a black rectangle to appear. That is, they don't serve as a portal to the other dimension. The two synopses Woojin was holding had nothing attached to them. They were just ordinary thin stacks of paper. It had always been like that. A few pages of a script might trigger a portal to the other dimension, but even if a synopsis exceeded 100 pages, it wouldn't have a black rectangle attached. It was only natural, after all. A synopsis is just a PPT condensed with the description of the work. It was full of explanations without a single line of dialogue. While other actors typically read synopses in-depth to select their works, Kang Woojin wasn't particularly moved by them. Still, he pretended to read them. Out of the blue. '...But if I check the script of this drama where the chef is the protagonist—could I gain the chef's abilities?' A faint sense of expectation rose in Woojin. If it were the other dimension, it would be entirely possible. After all, it had granted him vocal abilities and a multitude of languages in an instant, hadn't it? 'Culinary skills? Or knowledge? I'm not sure what ability will be imprinted. But isn't any ability possible?' The other dimension was always full of surprises, so there could be a twist, but the possibility was very high. At this moment, Woojin thought of a few uses for chef-related abilities if he were to acquire them. 'The first thing that comes to mind is \\"Our Dining Table.\\"' A mega-variety show in preparation by the entertainment mogul PD Yoon Byung-sun, featuring many top stars including Kang Woojin. \\"Our Dining Table\\" was also centered around 'cooking' as its main theme. It would be useful in real life as well. Meanwhile, PD Song Man-woo, with his goatee, swallowed dryly as he watched Woojin's silent face. 'It's nerve-wracking when he just reads without saying anything.' Kang Woojin. Or rather, he was a fervent believer in Kang Totem. Even though he was a drama industry big shot, his hands were sweaty. It was as if he was being evaluated by Kang Totem himself. PD Song Man-woo had resigned from the broadcasting station. Although the work related to 'Hanryang' wasn't completely finished, it was wrapped up in a way that he would join if needed after handing over his duties. In other words, Song Man-woo PD had gone independent. And he had taken on the role of president of a new production company. Of course, that was only on the surface, and he was a figurehead president. There were two representatives. Song Man-woo PD had to be seen as a representative director and a frontman, and he had brought the drama synopsis he had selected for his first independent work to Kang Woojin first. It was related to a promise made during the wrap-up party for 'Hanryang.' Knowing that Woojin would be busy, Song Man-woo PD had personally come to the commercial shoot location. It was a matter of courtesy, regardless of his status. 'I'm grateful he even made time in his crazy schedule.' Of course, his devotion to Woojin was included. At this point. -Swish. Woojin, who had been pretending to read the second synopsis, spoke up with an indifferent face. \\"PD-nim.\\" \\"Ye-yes, I'm listening, Woojin-ssi.\\" \\"Are there no scripts for these two works?\\" At the question, goatee Song Man-woo PD shook his head. \\"There are, but they're not complete yet. Both works have only the first episode out? But we haven't decided which project to go with, so we've put a hold on the progress.\\" \\"Is that so? Hmm—\\" After a short hum, Woojin neatly stacked the two synopses and spoke. \\"Then, may I receive those unfinished scripts?\\" \\"That's no problem. But are you sure it's okay? You're busy, and I'm fine with just a hint. I was worried it might be a hassle.\\" \\"It's fine, please send them.\\" Song Man-woo PD's expression brightened instantly. \\"Got it! You want both scripts sent, right?\\" That would be natural. Kang Woojin nodded solemnly. \\"Yes, both works.\\" \\"Okay! Haha, I don't know what to do with myself, Kang Totem-nim is so busy. Then I'll organize and send the scripts to your company.\\" \\"No, if possible, please send them to my home.\\" \\"Is that so? Oh, then I'll send them to your home. Your schedule today—ends late at night as usual, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" At that moment. -Knock knock. There was a knock on the van window. Soon, the back door of the van opened, and the smiling face of Choi Seong-gun with a ponytail appeared. \\"PD-nim. Sorry, but Woojin-ssi's shoot is about to start.\\" \\"Ah! That's right, thank you so much for your time, Woojin-ssi. Go ahead!\\" After a brief farewell, Song Man-woo PD ran to his car parked nearby, and Woojin moved to the commercial shoot location alongside Choi Seong-gun. It was then that Choi Seong-gun spoke. \\"What did Song PD say?\\" \\"He gave me a synopsis.\\" \\"Ah—right, that guy went independent, didn't he? I heard he's quite a big shot and got a lot of investment because 'Hanryang' was a huge hit. Phew, we need to secure proper investment too.\\" Choi Seong-gun. Or rather, BW Entertainment was currently busy preparing for expansion. They were selecting various investors and assessing the future value of BW Entertainment. The word 'investment' reminded Woojin of 'Nakgiseng.' \\"How's the situation with 'Nakgiseng' in Japan?\\" \\"I've been in contact and monitoring it continuously.\\" Choi Seong-gun paused for a moment and scratched his chin, looking troubled. \\"Honestly, the situation has gotten worse. There's been a lot of damage to the image. It's unlikely that the public opinion will completely flip. If you want to back out now, no one will blame you. Feel free to make a comfortable decision.\\" \\"No, I'll wait.\\" \\"Knowing you, it's not about loyalty or manners. Is there a reason?\\" 'I can't say that 'Nakgiseng' has risen to S+ grade.' Woojin vaguely dodged the question. \\"I just want to do 'Nakgiseng.'\\" However, from this comment, Choi Seong-gun thought. 'As expected, he's got a strong hunch about 'Nakgiseng.' Otherwise, there's no reason to hold on when the situation is this bad. If that crazy intuition is kicking in...' He was swallowing a spoonful of his own misconception. At the same time, in Japan. 'Toega' film company in Tokyo was bustling. The situation had not subsided. No, it had worsened even more about a week after the first article broke. \\"Is 'Nakgiseng,' which is leaking investment funds, about to collapse under Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro?\\" Somehow, 'Nakgiseng's' recognition had reached its peak, but conversely, all sorts of nonsense and rubbish were being poured out like crazy. 'Toega' film company quickly took action and tried to release explanatory articles. \\"Toega's side: 'It's true that investment funds have been reduced, but other articles are baseless.'\\" But the fire was not easily extinguished. Rumors began to circulate among the actors cast in 'Nakgiseng' and throughout the Japanese entertainment industry. \\"Director! There's talk of reconsidering the investment!\\" \\"Ah, this is troublesome. Which one is it this time?\\" Even the remaining investment funds were shaking, not just those who had already pulled out. About 60% of the investment funds had withdrawn. Of course, Director Kyotaro and the film company were running around trying to attract new investment, but the results were not good. It was a natural flow. Who would step forward when the situation was visibly bad? They had no choice but to become passive and the gap narrowed. At this point, there was only one decision for Director Kyotaro and the film company to make. \\"Director... What about reducing the scale of the film with the current remaining production budget?\\" Reducing the size significantly. But Director Kyotaro thought that was absolutely not an option. \\"No. If that's the case, it's better to give up on production. Besides, it's unclear whether the remaining investment will even last.\\" \\"Hmm. Still, we need to make some decision. Unfounded rumors keep sticking to us and Woojin-ssi, and the movements of the other actors are not normal. We have to do something while we still have some investment left.\\" \\"...\\" \\"Maybe we should start the crank-in urgently and gradually make up for the investment?\\" All the options were extreme. Director Kyotaro was starting to wonder if his stubbornness had been too much. Was Japan not ready for change? Whatever the case, if they just let time pass, everyone, including Kang Woojin, would suffer. Director Kyotaro was in a complex state of mind. He had been struggling for over a week, but there was no brilliant solution. 'It's time to decide whether to push forward or stop.' It was time to confirm whether to GO or STOP. Just then. -♬♪ Director Kyotaro's phone on the desk rang. The caller was an unsaved number. Recently, there had been many indiscriminate calls from the press, so he considered ignoring it. \\"Sigh—\\" Worried about rumors spreading, he decided to answer the call. \\"Yes, this is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" The person on the other end of the phone was a woman, and she was not a reporter. \\"Hello, Director. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Kashihi Group.\\" Director Kyotaro blinked his eyes in surprise. \\"...Kashihi Group? The same Kashihi Group I know?\\" A mega-corporation within Japan's top 10 business hierarchy. \\"That's correct, Director.\\" It was an absurdly astonishing caller. \\"There's someone who wishes to meet with you, Director.\\" \\"Me? Who?\\" But the woman on the other end of the phone was endlessly calm. \\"Someone who will provide all the investment funds for 'Nakgiseng.'\\" Night, Kang Woojin's office apartment. The van that had just dropped off Kang Woojin smoothly exited the underground parking lot. Woojin watched it quietly. \\"...\\" Only after the van had completely disappeared did he let go of the act that had been enveloping his body. \\"Phew— I'm dying. No, maybe I'm already dead.\\" It was 11:40 PM. It was late by any standard, but for Woojin, it was an early finish compared to his usual days. That's why Woojin's eyes were filled with fatigue. Soon, he turned and began to walk, recalling the schedule he had tackled today. 'What did I even do today? I seriously can't remember.' But his mind was so scattered that he couldn't remember well. It had already been three weeks since he returned from Japan. Woojin muttered softly as he got on the elevator and pressed the button for the first floor. The reason he wasn't going straight home was simple. 'Was it in the mailbox?' Goatee Song Man-woo PD had contacted him in the morning, saying he had sent the scripts. Sure enough, there was a slightly thick yellow envelope in the mailbox. Woojin picked it up and got back on the elevator. As the elevator ascended with a whirring sound, Woojin tore open the envelope. -Crack! Despite being full of fatigue, a bit of anticipation emerged within him. Of course, it was because of the ability acquisition he had heard about in the morning. \\"Let's see—\\" Inside the yellow envelope were two scripts. The elevator reached his floor and opened its doors, and Woojin, who had just arrived home, carelessly took off his shoes and pulled out the two scripts from the yellow envelope. Although he needed to check both, there was only one thing Woojin was looking for right now. \\"Which one is the one with the chef?\\" It didn't take long to find it. The title of the script he was looking for caught his eye immediately. -'The Acclaimed Chef' Woojin smiled faintly upon confirming the title. \\"This is it, this one.\\" Then, placing the yellow envelope on the nearby dining table, Woojin picked up 'The Acclaimed Chef' script. Of course, unlike the synopsis he had seen in the morning, there was a familiar black rectangle next to the script. It had a swirling sensation of gray and black. Woojin nonchalantly pressed it with his index finger. -Thud! Suddenly, Woojin entered the other dimension, filled with endless darkness, a place he visited a hundred times more often than his home. He stretched out long and walked towards the white rectangle floating at chest height. The recent script had been added as a white rectangle. First, Woojin looked for something he always checked when he entered the other dimension. -[7/Script (Title: The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger), S+ Grade] The grade of 'Nakgiseng.' \\"Yep, it's still S+ grade.\\" The suddenly skyrocketed S+ grade of 'Nakgiseng' was maintained. Satisfied, Woojin turned his gaze to the last white rectangle. -[8/Script (Title: 'The Acclaimed Chef'), C Grade] Unfortunately, 'The Acclaimed Chef' was C grade. That is, average. At that moment, Woojin suddenly shook his head. \\"C is not bad, have I become too picky—\\" As he scolded himself, Woojin touched the white rectangle of 'The Acclaimed Chef.' The displayed text quickly changed. -[8/Script (Title: 'The Acclaimed Chef') has been selected.] -[Listing characters available for reading (experience).] -[A: Jang Hyeon-jae······] There was no need to worry about the roles listed behind. Woojin only needed the protagonist. Without hesitation, he touched the first character listed among the roles, the protagonist. At the same time, he chanted internally. 'Come out, come out. Rise! Rise!' If the robotic female voice proceeded to read the role, it would be a failure, but if it delivered a different nuance of comment than usual, it would be a success. That's when it happened. [\\"A skill level above the basic specs has been detected. 'Chef's Technique' will be acquired first.\\"] The result that made him want to dance spread throughout the entire other dimension. At that moment, Woojin clapped his hands. It was a success. But 'Chef's Technique'? For a brief moment, he was curious about the ability he would be imprinted with. [\\"······\\"] After a moment of silence, the robotic female voice echoed again. [\\"A skill level above the basic specs has been detected. 'Chef's Recipe' will be acquired first.\\"] Upon hearing this, Woojin's eyes widened slightly. \\"Uh? Two?\\" This was the first time such a thing had happened. < Backing (5) > End"},{"instruction":"< 역습 (2) > ‘아메토크 show!’ 강우진 편의 시작은 여느 편과 비슷했다. 같은 세트장에 MC인, 비버 닮은 카라마츠 소요가 나와 간단한 오프닝 멘트.

[“반갑습니다, 강우진씨. 간단하게 시청자분들께 인사부터 부탁드릴게요.”] [“안녕하세요, ‘아메토크 show!’ 시청자 여러분. 배우 강우진입니다. 일본의 전통 깊은 토크쇼에 나오게 되어 영광입니다. 열심히 떠들다 가겠습니다.”] [“이야- 근데 일본어를 정말 잘하시는데요? 눈감고 들으면 헷갈리겠어요”] [“자주 듣습니다, 하지만 한국말을 역시 더 잘합니다.”] 토크쇼 ‘아메토크 show!’의 속 강우진은 무덤덤했지만 부드러웠다. 어색함이 전혀 느껴지지 않았다.

[“자! 좋습니다. 그럼 분위기를 좀 바꿔 볼까요?”] 분위기를 환기시켰다. 녹화장에 참여한 수백 방청객의 Q&A에 돌입한 것. 그리고 첫 번째 질문은.

[“할아버지! 저! 저 나왔어요!”] 손자인 신고와 함께 뭉클하게 보는 히데키 회장. 그런 그는 신고의 머리를 쓰다듬으면서도 TV 속 강우진을 가만히 응시했다. 그의 외모부터 피지컬, 분위기 등을 파악했다. 이어 우진이 보이는 일본 수어에 집중한다. 본인보다 더 대단했다. 뭣보다. ‘눈길이 가. 퍼포먼스가 좋아, 저렇게 신고 앞까지 다가가 수어를 보이는 건 제작진의 생각인가? 아니, 저 친구의 생각임이 확실해. 수어를 잘 아는 사람만이 떠올릴 생각이야. 눈과 표정이 잘 보여야 하니까.’ 강우진은 존재감을 피력하는 기술이 좋았다. 어느정도 무대 연출이나 각색이 있기야 하겠다만. ‘시선을 집중시키는 방법을 잘 알고 있군. 무대 활용도도 좋고. 최고점은 저 냉철한 여유. 과연, 평범친 않군.’ 히데키 회장에게 더욱이 우진의 흥미가 높아졌다. 한편. ‘아메토크 show!’가 끝으로 치닫고 있을 무렵, 민영방송국 TBE의 주종정실에 모인 전부는 광란의 어깨춤을 춰대고 있었다. “20.5% 넘겼습니다!” 종합시청률은 아니어도 충분했다. 참고용 실시간 시청률이라 할지라도, 수치는 이미 예상을 아득히 넘겼다. 덕분에 얼타는 얼굴의 신조 PD에게 축하가 쏟아졌고. “신조! 잘했다, 잘했어!” “시이키 PD님!! 축하드려요!” “여론 안 좋아서 걱정했는데, 이게 이렇게 뒤집히나??!” “얼마 만에 20% 시청률이야?! 헤이! 신조! 정신 좀 차려보라고!” “하하하, 국장님 이 친구 넋을 놨습니다!” 빼싹 마른 신조 PD의 집 나간 혼은 쉽사리 돌아오지 못했다. 그도 그럴 게. ‘20%?!! 진짜 20%를 넘겼다고??’ 지금 눈 앞에 펼쳐진 20% 넘는 시청률은 초창기 빼곤 없었으니까. 전통 깊은 ‘아메토크 show!’ 전체로 봐도 평균 10% 시청률에, 최고치인 23%를 넘긴 것도 8년 전이었다. 헐리웃 인기배우가 나온 편. 뒤로 20% 시청률은 전무했다. 그것을 강우진이 다시금 끌어 올렸다. 물론, 순전히 강우진의 힘만으로 만든 수치는 아닐 것이었다. 쿄타로 감독부터 수많은 이슈가 합쳐진 결과. 그럼에도, 그렇다 해도 중심에 서 있는 건. “신조! 저 한국의 신인. 아니! 강우진한테 연락은 해줘야지??” 누가 뭐래도 강우진이었다. 그 시각. 한국. 장소는 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 제작사였다. 그 제작사의 커다란 회의실. 얼추 열댓 명의 인원들이 모여 있다. 이미 대본리딩을 마친 ‘얼어죽는 연애’였고, 지금은 프리 프로덕션에 있는 마지막 제작 회의 중이었다. 그러니 연출 PD는 물론이고, 여러 팀의 키스탭들과 주얼리가 주렁주렁한 이월선 작가 역시 참석했다. 이제 ‘얼어죽는 연애’는 촬영만이 남은 상태였다. 세트장, 장소헌팅, 배우 캐스팅, 편성 등 굵직한 결정은 이미 확정이 났으니까. 그리고 이 마지막 제작 회의에서 첫 촬영날을 픽스할 예정이었다. 재밌는 것은. “‘낯기생’ 분위기가 점점 더 안 좋아지네요? 며칠 전보다 여론이 훨씬 나빠졌어.” 왜인지 제작 실장이나 연출 PD 등은 우진과 ‘낯기생’의 얘기가 한창이라는 것. 이월선 작가도 마찬가지였다. 일본을 뒤흔드는 ‘낯기생’ 소식이 한국에까지 퍽 번졌으니까. “뭐, 일본이나 한국이나 영화 또는 드라마 제작은 풍전등화지. 다들 알면서 그래요.” “그래도 감독이 그 쿄타로 감독에 워낙 깔린 판이 컸고, 우진씨가 주연이라는 이슈 터지면서 난리 났었잖아요? 근데 갑자기 상황이 이리 휙 바뀌네.” “언론·여론 태세 변환하는 거 한두 번인가? 이슈가 어마무시했던 만큼 후폭풍이 큰 거겠죠.” “‘낯기생’ 투자자들이 강우진씨 때문에 빠진다는 건 진짜래요? 지금도 쭉쭉 빠지고 있다던데.” ‘얼어죽는 연애’ 팀들은 남 일이긴 했으나, 그 사건에 강우진이 끼어 있기에 아쉬움을 표했다. 강우진이 날아오를수록 ‘얼어죽는 연애’에도 낙수효과가 있으니까. “왠지 엎어질 것 같네, 좀- 아깝네요. 우진씨가 역사 한 번 제대로 쓰나 했구만.” “이대로 ‘낯기생’ 엎어지면 우진씨한테 타격이 있을까요?” “있기야 하겠지만, ‘낯기생’ 엎어져도 크게 보면 우진씨한텐 이득이긴 하죠. 악플이야 한때고 지금 우진씨가 일본에서 인지도 기하급수적으로 올랐잖아요.” “그래도 실추될 이미지도 있고, ‘낯기생’은 엎어지기보단 제작가는 게 무조건 베스트긴 한데. 최초의 선례를 만드는 것도 있고요.” “흠- 분위기 상 그 뭐냐, 우진씨가 출연한다는 토크쇼 시청률은 좀 별로겠네요.” “아아, 그거? 아메토크? 일본에서는 국민 토크쇼긴 한데, 지금은 대중들한테 욕 많이 들어 처먹고 있더라고요.” 이때 핸드폰을 내린 이월선 작가가 제작 회의의 주제를 바로 잡았고. “결과야 지켜보면 알 것이고. 우린 일단 첫 촬영 날부터 확정 지어야죠?” 연출 PD부터 각 키스탭들이 정신을 차렸다. “아아아, 그렇죠. 보자- 작가님은 장환씨하고 우진씨 컷으로 뚜껑 따는 게 좋다고 하셨죠?” “맞아요. 아무래도 초반 중 가장 중요한 씬이고, 장환씨 감정선 잡기에도 편할 것 같아서. 우진씨 스케줄 맞추는 것도 이번 달이 낫다고 했고.” “예, 최대표님한테 들었습니다.” 고개 끄덕인 이월선 작가가 제작실장에게 물었다. “우진씨, ‘실종의 섬’ 촬영이 임박했다고 들었는데. 언제부터 크랭크인이래요?” “아아- 25일 확정이라고 들었습니다. 뒤로 약 일주일 뒤에 해외로케 떠나구요.” “그럼 천상 우린 20일 전후로 첫 촬영 잡는 게 좋을 것 같은데요? 어떻게 보세요 PD님.” 턱을 쓸던 연출 PD가 앞에 놓인 예상 촬영 스케줄을 내려보며 답했다. “오늘이 16일- 대략 일주일이라.” “좀 빡빡하긴 해도 못 할 건 없죠? 이미 뭐 세팅될 건 다 됐잖아요. 장환씨도 우리 거 말곤 스케줄 없다고 했고.” “소품, 세트가 좀 미비되긴 했는데······서두르면 가능은 할 겁니다.” “그럼 확정 지어도 되지 않나?” “뭐 우진씨 촬영 스케줄 길어야 이틀인데 그게 낫겠다 싶긴 하네요. 우진씨 ‘실종의 섬’ 해외로케 뜨면 몇 달이나 기다릴지 알 수도 없고.” 대체로 의견이 모이던 중 연출 PD가 말을 이었다. “당장 우진씨 스케줄부터 붙여 봐야겠네요. 아, 작가님. 그 건은 어떻게 보십니까? 우진씨 촬영날에 배우들이 참관하고 싶다는 거.” 곧, 이월선 작가가 상관없다는 듯. “상관없지 않나요? 촬영에 방해만 안 된다면. 두 눈으로 보고 싶기도 하겠죠. 자극될 것도 같고.” 어깨를 으쓱였다. “나도 보러 갈 거야.” 그렇게 슬슬 마무리가 지어지던 참에. “어?!” 조연출이 약간 놀라며 외쳤다. “아메토크 show!요, 지금 기사 떴는데 시청률 20% 넘겼다는데요??” 그 충격은 이월선 작가를 포함해 모두에게 번졌다. “어, 얼마를 넘겼다고??!” 이렇듯 ‘아메토크 show!’의 기록적인 시청률 갱신은 금방 한국에도 퍼졌다. 『‘괴물 신인’ 강우진이 출연 편, 일본의 국민 토크쇼 ‘아메토크 show!’ 시청률 20% 넘겼다!』 워낙 강우진이 잘 팔리다 보니 국내 기자들이 일본 쪽 상황을 실시간 모니터링하고 있었으니까. 즉, 일본도 한국과 마찬가지로 ‘아메토크 show!’의 반전을 발 빠르게 전하고 있다는 뜻. 『[이슈체크]‘한량에 이어 또 20%?!’ 강우진 단독 출연한 ‘아메토크 show!’ 시청률 갱신』 『‘주모 여기 국뽕 한 사발!’, 일본 토크쇼 나가 당당히 20% 시청률 기록한 강우진/ 사진』 이에 부정적인 것이 가득하던 일본의 여론이 조금씩 바뀌고 있었다. -우와! 아메토크 시청률 20% 넘겼다구?? 다들 안 본다고 난리였으면서! -(웃음)다들 강우진이 궁금했던 거겠지 -난 강우진 그냥 그렇던데? 딱히 매력은 안 보였어 그러니까 일본에 그만 왔으면! -↑너 같은 악플이 사람을 죽이는 거야 -강우진 너튜브 보고 왔는데!! 대충격!! 진짜 노래 잘해!! 미쳤어!!! -화린이랑 강우진…케미 좋더라… -일본어 완전 잘하더라? 엄청 노력한 게 눈에 보일 정도였어 -하긴, 그 정도면 일본어 대사해도 전혀 어색하진 않겠더라 -반대!! 강우진 반대!!! -강우진 좋아졌어, 특히 일본 수어하는 장면. 남자 아이한테 직접 다가가서 수어하는데…왜 멋져? · · · · 물론, 완벽히 긍정적으로 돌아선 건 아니지만 많은 변화가 보였다. 그중 가장 큰 힘을 발휘한 것은. -얘들아 그것보다 강우진이 일본말 왜 그렇게 잘 하는지, 심지어 일본 수어까지 왜 할 줄 아는지는 나만 궁금해??? 역시 유창한 일본어와 일본 수어였다. 이후 다음 날 아침 17일에 ‘아메토크 show!’의 정식 시청률이 일본에 발표됐다. 『강우진 나온「아메토크 show!」, 공식 시청률은 20.4%』 과연 20%의 ‘아메토크 show!’의 힘은 작지 않았다. 몇 배는 뻥튀기된 유입이 강우진 관련으로 흘러 들어가기 시작했다. 일본은 물론이며 한국도 상황은 비슷했다. 약 이틀간 말이다. 심지어 한국에선 일본의 ‘아메토크 show!’ 강우진 편이 불법 사이트에 업로드되는 사건까지 발생했다. 하지만. 『영화계 전문가 “「낯기생」쪽 투자금 약 70% 빠져나간 듯 보인다”』 일본서의 ‘낯기생’ 관련 위기는 여전했다. 21일, 아침. 수원. 수원 쪽에 위치한 KBC의 드라마 제작센터. 즉, 대형 촬영 세트장이었다. 이 KBC의 드라마 제작센터에는 내부와 외부로 나뉘어 있다. 그만큼 규모는 퍽 커다랗다 봐도 됐다. 그런 제작센터 내부엔 섹션마다 세트장이 보이며 천장으로는 수많은 조명이 달렸다. 그중 한 세트장 앞엔 이미 카메라부터 각종 오디오기기 등이 세팅되고 있었고. “아니!! 거기 조명 아니고! 여기 뒤에!!” “아! 바로 수정하겠습니다!” “세트팀! 여기 문짝에서 끼익끼익 소리나요!” “그거 소리 나게끔 PD님이 만들래서 나는 겁니다!!” 50명은 가뿐히 넘는 스탭들이 몰려 있었다. 세트장의 형태는 뭔가 고급 아파트의 복도를 연상케 하는 모습. 이때. “미술팀! PD님이 찾으세요!!” 연출 PD가 미술팀을 불렀다. 보니 연출 PD가 낯익다. 그런 그가 뒷주머니에 꽂은 대본엔 이런 타이틀이 걸려 있었다. -‘얼어죽는 연애’ 즉, 여긴 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 촬영 세트장인 것. 바로 이 시각. -끼익! 외부 주차장에 외제차 한 대가 섰다. 붉은색의 차였고, 그 차에서 번쩍이는 귀걸이 등이 눈에 띄는 여자가 내렸다. 스타작가 이월선 작가였다. 재밌는 것은. -텅! 차 문을 닫은 그녀가 고개를 돌렸을 때, 가까운 곳에 방금 주차한 승합차를 보자마자 이월선 작가가 씨익 웃는다는 것. 정확하게는. “우진씨, 일찍 왔네요?” “아- 예. 안녕하십니까, 작가님.” 승합차에서 내린 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’. 아니, 오늘부터 약 이틀간 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 촬영에 참여할 강우진에게 던진 미소였다. 한편, 약간 어둑한 편집실. 많은 모니터, 각종 기기들, 벽에 걸린 오디오 등. 편집실의 풍경은 여느 때와 같으나, 모인 사람들부터 분위기가 대체로 침체됐다. 뭐랄까, 이 편집실에는 에너지가 느껴지지 않았다. 그런 편집실엔 얼추 너댓명의 인원이 보였다. 그중, 익숙한 남자가 눈에 띈다. “후우- 으아, 드디어.” 방금 의자 등받이에 몸을 움푹 기댄, 얼굴에 다크서클이 즐비한 사각턱 신동춘 감독이었다. 이어 그가 주변 편집기사들의 어깨를 두드린 뒤, 대뜸 핸드폰을 꺼내 어디론가 전화를 걸었다. 상대는 넷플렉스 코리아의. “아- 총괄디렉터님.” 김소향 총괄디렉터였고, 신동춘 감독이 옅게 입꼬리를 올리며 읊조렸다. “다됐습니다, 후반 작업.” 편집이 방금 끝났다. 즉, 찐한 첫 장면 포함 여러 OST, 온탕 ‘한인호’가 함유된 ‘남사친’이 완성됐으며. “날 잡으시죠.” 출격만이 남았단 소리였다. < 역습 (2) > 끝","output":"< Counterattack (2) > The start of the 'Ametalk show!' featuring Kang Woojin was similar to other episodes. The same set, the beaver-like MC Karamatsu Soyo appeared and gave a simple opening remark. [\\"It's mid-September and it's still hot, but today's guest is so novel that you'll be able to forget the heat for a while!\\"] Then MC Soyo introduced the guest. [\\"The hottest man in Japan right now! The monster rookie actor from Korea, Kang Woojin!\\"] The show's long-standing guest entrance music played. -♬♪ Kang Woojin appeared through the guest entrance door set up in the studio. Woojin and MC Soyo exchanged a simple handshake and then sat down on their respective sofas. [\\"Nice to meet you, Kang Woojin-ssi. Please say a simple greeting to the viewers first.\\"] [\\"Hello, 'Ametalk show!' viewers. I'm actor Kang Woojin. It's an honor to be on such a traditional Japanese talk show. I'll chat enthusiastically.\\"] [\\"Wow— But you speak Japanese really well, don't you? If I closed my eyes, I'd be confused.\\"] [\\"I hear that often, but I still speak Korean better.\\"] Kang Woojin on the talk show 'Ametalk show!' was calm yet amiable. There was no sign of awkwardness. [\\"Ah! Woojin-ssi, is this your first talk show since your debut?\\"] [\\"Yes. It's my first time on 'Ametalk show!' So I'm quite nervous.\\"] [\\"Eh— You don't look nervous at all? Haha, but it's your first talk show, so I can imagine you're not sure what to do.\\"] [\\"You don't look nervous at all.\\"] [\\"Eh? Are you joking?\\"] [\\"It's a joke.\\"] After the greetings, many topics were discussed. How was his schedule in Korea, was his current schedule busy, and how did he feel when he first joined 'Profiler Hanryang.' [\\"How did you feel when you first got the role in 'Profiler Hanryang'?\\"] [\\"I wondered if it was the right fit.\\"] His thoughts when 'Hanryang' blew up in Japan, the upcoming launch of 'Male Friend', the explosive increase in followers on Kang Woojin's SNS, and his 'Kang Woojin's side character' channel surpassing a million subscribers in just a few weeks. Here, MC Soyo made a request to Kang Woojin. [\\"I took a peek at your channel. There weren't many videos, but you surpassed a million subscribers. Your skills seem to go beyond just a hobby, right? And the themes are unique. You cover KPOP in Japanese or English.\\"] [\\"Soon, I plan to show covers of JPOP and pop songs in Korean.\\"] [\\"Just hearing about it, the views will explode, right? Are you planning any other content?\\"] [\\"I'm considering it.\\"] [\\"Hmm! Could you give us a brief, just a tiny cover of a song? The viewers would want it.\\"] [\\"Of course.\\"] -♬♪ The request was for just a short verse, but Kang Woojin sang almost a full verse. Interestingly. -Swish. Around the second verse, an unexpected guest appeared. It was Hwarin, holding a handheld microphone. She passionately sang the second verse of 'Elani's 'Ballerina' in the original language. A tightly packed composition. Then Kang Woojin and Hwarin sat side by side and continued with promotional talk about 'Male Friend', and around the middle of the show, MC Soyo shifted the topic to 'Nakgiseng'. The relationship with Director Kyotaro, the casting details, the movie's content, his mindset, and so on. However, unfortunately, 'Nakgiseng' itself was still in a situation where information couldn't be disclosed, so the answers weren't very detailed. Around this time, 'Ametalk show!' changed the atmosphere. [\\"Alright! Let's change the mood a bit, shall we?\\"] They refreshed the mood. They moved on to a Q&A with the hundreds of audience members participating in the recording. And the first question was. [\\"······\\"] It was from a silent young boy. Or rather, a child using Japanese sign language. Of course, subtitles were provided below. But suddenly. -Swish. Seeing the question in Japanese sign language thrown by the child, Kang Woojin stood up from the sofa and moved briskly. He walked right up to the child. Soon, Kang Woojin in the camera angle naturally exchanged Japanese sign language with the child. Various effect subtitles were added to the 'Ametalk show!' being broadcast. And this scene was. [\\"Grandfather! Look! I'm on TV!\\"] Chairman Hideki Yoshimura watched with emotion alongside his grandson Shingo. He stroked Shingo's head while intently watching Kang Woojin on TV. He assessed everything from Woojin's appearance to his physicality and aura. Then he focused on the Japanese sign language Woojin was using. He was more impressive than himself. Above all. 'He catches the eye. Was it the production team's idea to have him approach Shingo and show sign language like that? No, it's clear it was his own idea. Only someone well-versed in sign language would think of that. The eyes and expressions need to be clearly visible.' Kang Woojin had a good technique for asserting his presence. There might have been some stage direction and adaptation. 'He knows how to focus attention well. Good use of the stage too. The highlight is his cool composure. Indeed, he's not ordinary.' Chairman Hideki Yoshimura's interest in Woojin grew even more. Meanwhile. As 'Ametalk show!' was nearing its end, everyone gathered in the main control room of the private broadcasting station TBE was dancing a frenzy of shoulder dances. \\"We've surpassed 20.5%!\\" It was enough, even if it wasn't the overall viewership rating. Even if it was just a reference for real-time ratings, the numbers had already far exceeded expectations. Congratulations poured onto PD Shinjo, whose face was flushed with excitement. \\"Shinjo! Well done, you did great!\\" \\"Congratulations, PD Shiiki!\\" \\"Weren't people worried because the public opinion was bad, but how did it turn around like this??!\\" \\"How long has it been since we hit a 20% viewership rating?! Hey! Shinjo! Snap out of it!\\" \\"Hahaha, Director, this guy is out of his mind!\\" PD Shinjo, who was skinny as a rake, couldn't easily bring his soul back. It was understandable. '20%?!! Did we really surpass 20%??' The viewership rating exceeding 20% in front of his eyes was unprecedented except for the early days. Even for the long-standing 'Ametalk show!', the average viewership rating was 10%, and the highest ever was 23% eight years ago. That was when a popular Hollywood actor appeared. There had been no 20% viewership ratings since then. Kang Woojin had once again raised the bar. Of course, it wasn't solely due to Kang Woojin's power. It was the result of a combination of issues, from Director Kyotaro and many others. Nevertheless, at the center of it all. \\"Shinjo! That Korean rookie. No! We have to contact Kang Woojin, right?\\" It was Kang Woojin, no matter what anyone said. At that time. In Korea. The location was the production company of 'Freezing Love'. In the company's large conference room, about a dozen people were gathered. 'Freezing Love' had already completed the script reading, and now they were in the last production meeting during pre-production. Therefore, not only the director but also key staff from various teams and writer Lee Wol-seon, adorned with jewelry, were in attendance. Now, 'Freezing Love' only had filming left. The major decisions such as set construction, location scouting, actor casting, and scheduling had already been confirmed. And in this last production meeting, they planned to fix the first day of shooting. Interestingly. \\"The atmosphere around 'Nakgiseng' is getting worse, isn't it? Public opinion has deteriorated much more than a few days ago.\\" For some reason, the production manager, the director, and others were in the midst of discussing Woojin and 'Nakgiseng.' Writer Lee Wol-seon was no exception. The news of 'Nakgiseng' shaking up Japan had spread widely in Korea as well. \\"Well, whether it's Japan or Korea, film or drama production is like a candle in the wind. Everyone knows that.\\" \\"Still, the situation blew up because the director was that famous Kyotaro, and the issue of Woojin-ssi being the lead exploded, right? But suddenly, the situation has changed so drastically.\\" \\"How many times has the media and public opinion shifted? The backlash must be huge because the issue was so tremendous.\\" \\"Is it true that the investors of 'Nakgiseng' pulled out because of Kang Woojin-ssi? I heard they're still withdrawing.\\" The 'Freezing Love' team felt regretful, although it was someone else's affair, because Kang Woojin was involved. The more Kang Woojin soared, the more 'Freezing Love' would benefit from the spillover effect. \\"It seems like it might fall apart, a bit of a shame. I thought Woojin-ssi would make history.\\" \\"If 'Nakgiseng' falls apart, will it affect Woojin-ssi?\\" \\"There would be some impact, but even if 'Nakgiseng' falls apart, it would still be a gain for Woojin-ssi in the grand scheme of things. Hate comments are temporary, and Woojin-ssi's recognition in Japan has skyrocketed.\\" \\"Still, there's the image that could be tarnished, and it's definitely best for 'Nakgiseng' to be produced rather than fall apart. It would also set a precedent.\\" \\"Hmm— Given the mood, the talk show Woojin-ssi is appearing on probably won't have great ratings.\\" \\"Ah, that one? Ametalk? It's a national talk show in Japan, but right now, they're getting a lot of flak from the public.\\" At that moment, writer Lee Wol-seon, who had put down her phone, redirected the topic of the production meeting. \\"We'll know the results when we see them. For now, we need to confirm the first day of shooting, right?\\" The director and key staff snapped back to attention. \\"Ah, right. Let's see— Writer-nim, you said it would be good to start with the scenes featuring Jang Hwan-ssi and Woojin-ssi, right?\\" \\"That's right. It's one of the most important scenes in the beginning, and it would be easier for Jang Hwan-ssi to get into the emotional flow. It's also better to match Woojin-ssi's schedule this month.\\" \\"Yes, I heard from CEO Choi.\\" Writer Lee Wol-seon, who nodded, asked the production manager. \\"I heard Woojin-ssi's 'The Missing Island' shooting is imminent. When does the crank-in start?\\" \\"Ah— It's confirmed for the 25th. They'll be heading overseas for location shooting about a week later.\\" \\"Then it seems best for us to schedule the first shooting around the 20th, right? What do you think, Director?\\" The director, stroking his chin, looked down at the projected shooting schedule in front of him and answered. \\"Today is the 16th— roughly a week.\\" \\"It's a bit tight, but it's not impossible, right? Everything that needs to be set up is already done. Jang Hwan-ssi said he has no other schedules besides ours.\\" \\"The props and set are a bit lacking, but... if we hurry, it should be possible.\\" \\"Then shouldn't we confirm it?\\" \\"Well, Woojin-ssi's shooting schedule is only about two days at most, so that seems better. If Woojin-ssi leaves for 'The Missing Island' overseas location shooting, we don't know how many months we'll have to wait.\\" As opinions were converging, the director continued. \\"We need to check Woojin-ssi's schedule right away. Oh, Writer-nim. What do you think about that matter? The actors want to observe on the day of Woojin-ssi's shooting.\\" Soon, writer Lee Wol-seon shrugged nonchalantly. \\"It shouldn't matter, right? As long as it doesn't interfere with the shooting. They would want to see it with their own eyes. It might be stimulating.\\" She shrugged her shoulders. \\"I'll go watch too.\\" As the meeting was gradually wrapping up. \\"Uh?!\\" An assistant director exclaimed in surprise. \\"It's about the Ametalk show! A new article just came out saying the viewership rating surpassed 20%??\\" The shock spread to everyone, including writer Lee Wol-seon. \\"How much did it surpass??!\\" Thus, the record-breaking viewership rating of 'Ametalk show!' quickly spread to Korea as well. \\"Monster rookie Kang Woojin's appearance on Japan's national talk show 'Ametalk show!' surpasses 20% viewership!\\" Since Kang Woojin was selling well, domestic reporters were monitoring the situation in Japan in real-time. In other words, Japan was also quickly reporting the turnaround of 'Ametalk show!' just like Korea. \\"[Issue Check] 'Another 20% after Hanryang?!' Kang Woojin's solo appearance on 'Ametalk show!' refreshes viewership ratings\\" \\"Here's a bowl of national pride! Kang Woojin boldly records a 20% viewership rating on a Japanese talk show / Photo\\" Public opinion in Japan, which had been filled with negativity, was slowly changing. -Wow! Did Ametalk really surpass 20%?? Everyone was making a fuss about not watching it! -(Laughter) Everyone must have been curious about Kang Woojin -I don't see what's so great about Kang Woojin? I didn't find him particularly charming, so I wish he'd stop coming to Japan! -↑It's comments like yours that kill people -I went to see Kang Woojin's YouTube!! Huge shock!! He really sings well!! Crazy!!! -Hwarin and Kang Woojin... they had good chemistry... -He speaks Japanese really well? You could tell he put in a lot of effort -Well, with that level, he wouldn't sound awkward speaking Japanese lines -Against!! Against Kang Woojin!!! -I've started to like Kang Woojin, especially the scene where he does Japanese sign language. Going up to the boy and signing... why is it so cool? · · · · Of course, the shift wasn't entirely positive, but there was a lot of change. The most influential factor was. -Guys, am I the only one curious about why Kang Woojin speaks Japanese so well and even knows Japanese sign language??? It was indeed his fluent Japanese and Japanese sign language. The next morning, on the 17th, the official viewership rating for 'Ametalk show!' was announced in Japan. \\"Kang Woojin's 'Ametalk show!' officially records a 20.4% viewership rating\\" Indeed, the power of the 20% 'Ametalk show!' was not small. The influx multiplied several times over began to flow towards Kang Woojin-related content. Both in Japan and Korea, the situation was similar. For about two days. Even in Korea, there was an incident where the 'Ametalk show!' episode featuring Kang Woojin was uploaded to illegal sites. However. \\"Film industry expert: 'It seems about 70% of the investment for 'Nakgiseng' has been withdrawn'\\" The crisis related to 'Nakgiseng' in Japan persisted. 21st, morning. Suwon. At KBC's drama production center located in Suwon, which was essentially a large filming set. The production center was divided into internal and external areas, indicating its considerable scale. Inside the production center, sets were visible in each section, and numerous lights hung from the ceiling. In front of one of the sets, cameras and various audio equipment were already being set up. \\"No!! Not that light! Behind here!!\\" \\"Ah! I'll correct it right away!\\" \\"The set team! There's a creaking sound from this door!\\" \\"That's intentional by the PD to make that sound!!\\" Over 50 staff members were swarming around. The set resembled the hallway of a luxury apartment. At that moment. \\"Art team! The PD is looking for you!!\\" The director called for the art team. The familiar director had a script titled 'Freezing Love' tucked into his back pocket. In other words, this was the filming set for 'Freezing Love.' At this very moment. -Creak! A foreign car parked in the external parking lot. It was a red car, and a woman with flashy earrings got out. It was the star writer Lee Wol-seon. Interestingly. -Thud! As she closed the car door and turned her head, Lee Wol-seon smiled upon seeing the van that had just parked nearby. Precisely. \\"Woojin-ssi, you're early, aren't you?\\" \\"Ah— Yes. Hello, Writer-nim.\\" The smile was directed at 'The Mysterious Neighbor.' No, Kang Woojin, who would be participating in the filming of 'Freezing Love' for about two days starting today. Meanwhile, in a slightly dim editing room. Numerous monitors, various devices, and audio equipment hung on the walls. The editing room looked the same as always, but the atmosphere was generally downcast. It was as if the editing room lacked energy. About three or four people were visible in the editing room. Among them, a familiar man stood out. \\"Phew— Ah, finally.\\" Director Shin Dong-chun, with dark circles under his eyes, leaned back into the chair. Then he patted the shoulders of the surrounding editors and suddenly pulled out his phone to call someone. The other end was Netflix Korea. \\"Ah— Director Kim So-hyang.\\" It was Director Kim So-hyang, and Director Shin Dong-chun spoke with a slight smile. \\"It's all done, the post-production.\\" The editing had just finished. In other words, 'Male Friend,' containing the rich first scene, various OSTs, and the warm 'Han In-ho,' was completed. \\"Let's set a date.\\" Only the launch remained. < Counterattack (2) > End"},{"instruction":"write this in a professional way: Hello favour kindly avail me with all the necessary documents and contacts as regards PCIDSS registration and our business with digital jewel .As Mr Bola said i should handle the renewal of the PCIDSS License.","output":"Dear Favour, I hope this message finds you well.

Dexter was notorious for his practical jokes and pranks, and he took great delight in tricking everyone around him. His favorite prank, however, involved making prank calls to unsuspecting victims. One dark and stormy night, as the rain poured outside, Dexter decided to take his pranking skills to a whole new level. Armed with his trusty toy cellphone, he plotted to dial the emergency number, 999, and see how the serious-sounding emergency operators would react to his silly jokes. Heart pounding with excitement, Dexter dialed the number, his giggles barely contained. As the line connected, a stern voice answered, \\"Emergency services, what is your emergency?\\" Trying not to burst into laughter, Dexter put on his best deep voice and said, \\"There's a giant monster stomping through the town, gobbling up ice cream shops!\\" The operator's tone turned serious. \\"We take all emergencies seriously. Stay calm, and tell me your location.\\" But instead of bursting into laughter, Dexter felt a cold shiver run down his spine. He tried to explain that it was just a prank, but the operator wasn't having any of it. The operator's voice turned icy as he said, \\"Prank calls are not a joke, young man. You have wasted valuable resources, and now you'll face the consequences.\\" Feeling a mixture of fear and regret, Dexter heard a tapping on his window. He turned, wide-eyed, to see a towering figure in a dark cloak. The figure beckoned him to come outside, and Dexter, trembling, obeyed. Outside, the figure introduced itself as Mordecai the Misfortune Man. Mordecai explained that he was responsible for punishing pranksters who caused unnecessary panic and distress. Dexter would be his next assignment. Mordecai led Dexter through shadowy alleys until they arrived at a grey, foreboding building. As they entered, Dexter's eyes widened at the sight of countless pranksters being punished for their deeds. Some were being pelted by buckets of icy water, while others were forced to wear clown costumes for eternity. \\"You see, Dexter,\\" Mordecai said, \\"your pranks were not harmless fun. You abused the trust of emergency services, wasting their precious time and energy. For your thoughtless actions, you shall face a fitting punishment.\\" Dexter's heart sank as Mordecai pointed to a room filled with telephones. Each phone was connected to one of the houses Dexter had prank called. He was instructed to pick up each phone and apologize to the families he had frightened. As Dexter dialed the first number, he couldn't help but feel the weight of his actions. One by one, he spoke to the frightened parents, hearing their anger, disappointment, and fear. Tears streamed down his face as he listened to their stories of how his prank had affected their lives. Once he had apologized to every family, Dexter was led back to Mordecai, who looked at him sternly. \\"Remember this day, Dexter,\\" Mordecai warned. \\"Pranks can be fun, but they should never come at the expense of others' wellbeing. This is a lesson you'll carry with you for the rest of your life.\\" Released from the grey building, Dexter returned to his small town. From that day on, he dedicated himself to making amends and helping others. He used his mischievous skills to entertain at children's hospitals and to organize fundraisers for emergency services. The people of Mischievia saw a changed boy who had learned the importance of kindness and empathy. And as for Mordecai, he departed with a grim satisfaction, knowing that he had played his part in teaching a young prankster a valuable lesson – a lesson that would stay with Dexter forever, reminding him of the grim fate that awaits those who play with the trust of others."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post saying this fictional episode aired on 4th May 2007 on CITV","output":"Title: Grizzly Tales - The Prankster's Grim Fate: A Lesson in Mischievous Misery Date: May 4th, 2007 Greetings, Grizzly Tales enthusiasts!

This should be done carefully, as incorrect modifications to the registry could lead to serious system issues. Here are the steps to remove a weak cipher suite in IIS: 1. **Backup the Registry**: Before making changes, it's always a good practice to back up the current state of your registry. You can do this by opening the Registry Editor and then clicking on \`File\` > \`Export\`. Save the backup to a secure location. 2. **Open Registry Editor**: - Press \`Win + R\`, type in \`regedit\`, and hit \`Enter\` to open Registry Editor. 3. **Navigate to the SCHANNEL Section**: - In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following path: \`\`\` HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlSecurityProvidersSCHANNELCiphers \`\`\` 4. **Find and Disable Weak Ciphers**: - Within the \`Ciphers\` key, look for subkeys with the names of weak cipher suites like \`Triple DES 168\`. If they don't exist, you will need to create them. Right-click on the \`Ciphers\` key, select \`New\` > \`Key\` and name it \`Triple DES 168\`. 5. **Modify the Value to Disable the Cipher**: - With the \`Triple DES 168\` subkey selected, right-click in the right pane, select \`New\` > \`DWORD (32-bit) Value\`, and name it \`Enabled\`. - Double-click on the new \`Enabled\` value to open the edit dialog, and make sure the value is set to \`0\` (which means disabled). 6. **Repeat for Any Other Weak Ciphers**: - If you know about other weak cipher suites, you can repeat the process for those as well, by creating subkeys for them if they don't already exist, and setting the \`Enabled\` DWORD value to \`0\`. 7. **Close Registry Editor and Restart Your Server**: - Close Registry Editor. - It's important to restart the server to apply changes to the SCHANNEL configuration. This can be done either through the Start menu or by issuing the following command in the Command Prompt or PowerShell: \`\`\` shutdown /r /t 0 \`\`\` The \`/r\` flag indicates a restart, and \`/t 0\` specifies no delay. By taking these steps, you will remove the support for the \`TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA\` cipher suite, as well as any other weak cipher suites you have disabled through the registry, from the IIS server. It's good practice to also review and disable other outdated protocols like SSL 3.0 and weak ciphers from time to time to keep your server secure. Keep in mind that after disabling weak cipher suites, there may be compatibility issues with older clients or devices that do not support more modern ciphers. Ensure that your client base can support the stronger ciphers before making these changes."},{"instruction":"Purchase or generate a new SSL/TLS certificate using SHA-2 signature algorithm to replace the existing one.","output":"To replace an existing SSL/TLS certificate that uses an older signature algorithm (like SHA-1) with a new certificate that uses a SHA-2 signature algorithm, you can either purchase one from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or generate one using an internal CA if you have a private certificate infrastructure. Here are the steps to purchase or generate a new certificate: # Purchase a Certificate from a Trusted CA: 1. **Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**: - Open the IIS Manager (\`inetmgr\`). - Navigate to the server in the Connections panel, then click on \\"Server Certificates\\" in the middle pane. - In the Actions pane on the right, click \\"Create Certificate Request.\\" - Follow the prompts to enter your organization's information. When selecting the cryptographic service provider and bit length, choose an option that supports SHA-2 (like \\"Microsoft RSA SChannel ...\\"). - Save the CSR to a text file. 2. **Submit the CSR to a Trusted CA**: - Visit the website of a trusted CA and initiate the SSL certificate purchase process. - When prompted, paste the contents of the CSR file into the appropriate field on the CA's website. - Complete the purchase process, which may include domain verification and organization vetting, depending on the type of certificate you are purchasing. 3. **Download the Certificate**: - Once the CA has verified your information and issued the certificate, you will receive an email with the certificate or instructions on how to download it. 4. **Install the Certificate**: - Return to IIS Manager and, in the \\"Server Certificates\\" section, click \\"Complete Certificate Request.\\" - Browse to the location of the certificate file provided by the CA. - Name the certificate and optionally select a certificate store. - Once installed, the certificate can be bound to your website. # Generate a Certificate Using an Internal CA (if applicable): 1. **Generate CSR via IIS Manager** or a command-line tool like OpenSSL (follow the steps from above). 2. **Submit the CSR to Your Internal CA**: - If your organization uses an internal CA (like Active Directory Certificate Services), submit the CSR through your CA's web interface or per your organization's internal procedures. 3. **Approve and Issue the Certificate**: - The internal CA administrator will review the CSR and, upon approval, issue the certificate using the SHA-2 signature algorithm. 4. **Download and Install the Certificate**: - Download the issued certificate from your internal CA. - Follow the steps to install the certificate on your server, as mentioned above. # Additional Tasks: - **Bind the New Certificate**: - In IIS Manager, navigate to the site you want to secure with the newly installed certificate. - Click on \\"Bindings\\" in the Actions pane. - In the Site Bindings window, add or edit an HTTPS binding and select the new SSL certificate. - Save the binding. - **Test the Installation**: - Use a browser to navigate to your website using HTTPS to ensure that the new certificate is working properly. - You may also want to use an SSL test service like SSL Labs' SSL Test to evaluate the security of your site's SSL configuration. - **Retire the Old Certificate**: - Once the new certificate is installed and working, you should retire the old certificate by either allowing it to expire or by manually revoking it if it's from an internal CA. Always remember to keep a secure backup of your certificates and associated private keys, and follow your organization's security policies during this process."},{"instruction":"create a new rimworld Foundation themed challenge","output":"Title: \\"Founders of the Rim: Building the Utopian Foundation\\" Challenge Description: You are tasked with establishing and maintaining a thriving utopian society on a distant planet in the RimWorld universe.

От окружающей человека среды (природные условия, условия на рабочем месте, жилищные условия) зависит продолжительность жизни, здоровье, уровень заболеваемости и др. Нормирование качества окружающей среды - установление показателей и пределов, в которых допускается изменение этих показателей (для воздуха, воды, почвы и т.д.). ЦЕЛЬ НОРМИРОВАНИЯ - установление предельно допустимых норм (экологических нормативов) воздействия человека на окружающую среду. Благодаря соблюдению экологических нормативов обеспечивается экологическая безопасность населения, сохраняется генофонд, осуществляется рациональное использование и воспроизводство природных ресурсов. Основные экологические нормативы качества и воздействия на окружающую природную среду: 1. Нормативы качества (санитарно-гигиенические): предельно допустимая концентрация (ПДК) предельно допустимый выброс (ПДВ) вредных веществ; предельно допустимый сброс (ПДС) вредных веществ. вредных веществ; предельно допустимый уровень (ПДУ) вредных физических радиации, шума, вибрации, магнитных полей и др. 2. Нормативы воздействия (производственно-хозяйственные): Нормативы предельно допустимых вредных воздействий, а также методы носят временный характер и могут совершенствоваться по мере развития техники сучетом международных стандартов. воздействий: их определения, науки и ПРЕДЕЛЬНО ДОПУСТИМАЯ КОНЦЕНТРАЦИЯ ВРЕДНЫХ ВЕЩЕСТВ Предельно допустимая концентрация вредных веществ(ПДК) это величина, характеризующая максимальное количество вещества, которое может находиться в определенном объеме измерений и не причинять ущербаживым организмам (в том числе, и человеку). Чтобы выяснить, что такое ПДК, необходимо определить, какие виды ее измеряются в разных средах и каковы их максимально допустимые уровни. … Поэтому особенно важно измерять ПДК вредных веществ в воде и атмосферном воздухе, поскольку именно влиянию этих сред подвергается основная часть населения ПОНЯТИЕ «КЛАРК» Количественную распространенность химических элементов в земной коре впервые установил Ф. У. Кларк. В земную кору он включал также гидросферу и атмосферу. Поскольку масса гидросферы составляет лишь несколько процентов, а атмосферы - сотые доли процента от массы твердой земной коры (ЗК), поэтомучисла Кларка в основном отражают состав ЗК. Отдавая должное Кларку, свыше 40 лет посвятившему этим исследованиям, А. Е. Ферсман в 1923 г. предложил подтермином «КЛАРК» понимать среднее содержание химического элемента в земной коре, какой-либо ее части, Земле в целом, в планетахи других космических объектах. ПДК рассчитынают на единицу объема (для воздуха, воды), массы (для почны, пищеных продуктов) или поверхности (для кожи работающих). ПДК устанавливают на основании комплексных исследований. Значения ПДК, устанавливаемые на основании экспериментальных данных о токсичности и иных привходящих обстоятельств, не одинаковы в разных странах и периодически пересматриваются. Так, ПДК сероводорода в атмосферном воздухе при 24-часовом воздействии в Испании составляет 0,004 мг/м3, а в Венгрии - 0,15 мг/м3 (в России - 0,008 мг/м3). ПДК устанавливаются для среднестатистического человека, однако ослабленные болезнью и другими факторами люди могут почувствовать себя дискомфортно при концентрациях предных веществ (ВВ), меньших ПДК. Уровни ПДК одного и того же вещества различны для разных объектов внешней среды: ПДК сс - среднесуточное, ПДК ж.з. - жилой зоны, ПДК р.з. - в рабочей зоне, ПДК мр - максимально- разовое значение в воздухе, ПДК почв - в почве и др. В нашей стране нормативы ПДК разрабатываются и утверждаются органами санитарно- эпидемиологической службы и государственными органами в области охраны ОС. Значения ПДК включены в ГОСТы и другие нормативные документы. Нормативы качества окружающей среды являются едиными для всей территории РФ; их учитывают при проектировании технологических процессов, оборудования, очистных устройств и пр. СЭС контролирует соблюдение нормативов ПДК в воде водоемов хозяйственно-питьевого водопользования, в атмосферном воздухе и в воздухе производственных помещений; контроль за состоянием водоёмов рыбопромыслового назначения осуществляют органы рыбнадзора. С учетом природно-климатических особенностей, а также повышенной социальной ценности отдельных территорий для них могут быть установлены нормативы предельно допустимой концентрации, отражающие особые условия. По некоторым оценкам, 67% населения России живут в регионах, где содержание вредных веществ в воздухе выше установленной предельно допустимой концентрации. ПРЕДЕЛЬНО ДОПУСТИМЫЙ УРОВЕНЬ (ПДУ) ОРИНТИРОВОЧНО ДОПУСТИМЫЙ УРОВЕНЬ (ОДУ) ОРИНТИРОВОЧНО ДОПУСТИМАЯ КОНЦЕНТРАЦИЯ (ОДК) Это максимальный уровень влияния радиации, шума, вибрации, магнитныхполей и иныхвредныхфизическихвоздействий, который не представляетопасностидля здоровья человека, состояния животных, растений, ихгенетического фонда. ПДУ - это то же, что ПДК, но для физических воздействий. Например, предельно допустимый уровень радиационного воздействия определяется на основании норм радиационной безопасности, основных санитарных норм и санитарных норм проектирования В тех случаях, когда ПДК или ПДУ не определены и находятся только на стадии разработки, используюттакие показатели, как ОДК - ориентировочно допустимая концентрация, или ОДУ - ориентировочно допустимый уровень соответственно. ИОНИЗИРУЮЩЕЕ ИЗЛУЧЕНИЕ Ионизирующее излучение - это вид энергии, высвобождаемой атомами в форме электромагнитных волн (гамма- или рентгеновского излучения) или частип (нейтроны, бета или альфа). Спонтанный распад атомов называется радноактивностью, а избыток возникающей при этом энергии является формой понизирующего излучения При альфа-излученни Ra-226 переходит Rn-222 и его удельное количество с поверхности грунта на участке планируемой застройки измеряется в Бк/кв_м./с., те. активность (1 распад/с)/на площадь/время. Это и называется плотность потока радона (ШПР). Основным признаком потенциальной радоноопасности земельных участков является ППР в пределах контура проектируемых объектов строительства. Если расположение контуров проектируемых объектов на участке не определено (предпроектная стадия), то сеть контрольных точек выбирается равномерно по всему участку с целью предварительной оценки радоноопасности. Если по результатам обследования на поверхности грунта значительное количество контрольных точек имеют превышения, то окончательную оценку соответствия участка требованиям санитарных правил и гигиенических нормативов по данному показателю принимают с учетом результатов определения ППР на отметке заложения подошвы фундамента.","output":"Конспект по нормированию качества окружающей среды: - Качество окружающей среды - степень соответствия среды жизни человека его потребностям, влияет на здоровье и продолжительность жизни. - Нормирование качества окружающей среды - установление показателей и пределов изменения этих показателей для различных сред (воздуха, воды, почвы). - Цель нормирования - предельно допустимые нормы воздействия человека на окружающую среду, экологическая безопасность, сохранение генофонда, рациональное использование ресурсов.

Характерными чертами современного общевойскового боя являются: высокая напряженность, скоротечность и динамичность боевых действий, их наземно-воздушный характер, одновременное мощное огневое и радиоэлектронное воздействие на всю глубину построения сторон, применение разнообразных способов выполнения боевых задач, быстрый переход от одного вида боевых действий к другому, сложная тактическая обстановка. 7. Какие основные цели преследует позиционная оборона? Защита ключевых объектов Создание непреодолимых барьеров Экономия ресурсов Создание блокады Подготовка к контратаке Создание благоприятных условий для обороны Поддержание морально-психологического преимущества 8. Какие основные цели преследует наступление батальона (роты) ? Цели наступления батальона (роты) достигаются выполнением ряда тактических задач, основными из которых являются: борьба с низколетящими вертолетами и БПЛА противника; занятие исходного района (положения, позиции); выдвижение и развертывание батальона (роты) в боевой порядок; преодоление заграждений; уничтожение противника, обороняющегося на переднем крае и в ближайшей глубине; отражение контратак противника; разгром вторых эшелонов (резервов) противника; развитие наступления; овладение важными рубежами (объектами) противника; уничтожение подразделений противника, оставшихся в тылу наступающих подразделений. 9. Какое удаление от переднего края занимают огневые позиции гранатометного (противотанкового) взвода? Гранатометный взвод в ходе огневой подготовки атаки и с началом атаки огнем с занимаемых огневых позиции уничтожают живую силу и огневые средства на переднем крае обороны противника. Занимает огневые позиции за ротами первого эшелона на удалении до 300м. Перед наступлением с ходу взвод скрытно располагается в удаленном от обороны противника исходном районе соединения (части). Развертывание в боевой порядок для наступления взвод осуществляет в ходе выдвижения на рубеж перехода в атаку. В период огневой подготовки атаки гранатометный взвод может заранее выдвинуться на огневую позицию для поддержки атаки мотострелковых и танковых подразделений в порядке, указанном командиром батальона. 10. Какова роль инженерного обеспечения в современном общевойсковом бою? Инженерное обеспечение есть комплекс инженерных задач (мероприятий), проводимых в мирное и военное время с целью создания благоприятных условий для своевременного и скрытного развертывания подразделений (частей), проведения ими маневра и выполнения поставленных задач, повышения их защиты и устойчивости от всех средств поражений, а также нанесения потерь противнику и затруднения его действий, применением инженерных боеприпасов. Подразделения (части) инженерных войск предназначены для выполнения задач инженерного обеспечения боевых действий (передвижения) подразделений (частей) родов войск, других специальных войск видов вооруженных сил и тыла. Они выполняют наиболее сложные задачи инженерного обеспечения, требующие специальной подготовки личного состава, применения инженерной техники и инженерных боеприпасов. 11. Какие задачи включает в себя инженерное обеспечение боевых действий войск? Основные задачи инженерного обеспечения. Инженерная разведка противника, местности и объектов. Фортификационное оборудование оборонительных позиций опорных пунктов и районов обороны (районов развертывания пунктов управления, исходных районов, районов сосредоточения). Устройство и содержание инженерных заграждений. Подготовка (производство) разрушений. Проделывание и содержание проходов в заграждениях и разрушениях. Разминирование местности и объектов, Подготовка и содержание путей движения и маневра подразделений; Оборудование и содержание переправ при форсировании (преодолении) водных преград. 12. Какая цель преследуется при создании инженерных заграждений в боевых действия? Инженерные заграждения устраиваются в целях нанесения противнику потерь, задержки его продвижения, создания благоприятных условий своим войскам для поражения противника всеми огневыми средствами. Основой инженерных заграждения являются минно-взрывные заграждения (МВЗ), которые устанавливаются в виде минных полей, групп мин и отдельных мин. По своему предназначению они подразделяются на ПП, ПТ, и смешанные. 13. Каким образом герметизируется место сочленения мины ТМ-62М с взрывателем? Мины серии ТМ-62 отличаются материалом корпуса и имеют одинаковое строение. Мина состоит из корпуса, снаряжённого зарядом ВВ. В корпусе имеется стакан с резьбой. В нижней части стакана имеется дополнительный детонатор. Место сочленения взрывателя дополнительно герметизируется резиновой прокладкой. На минах имеется ручка для переноски. При хранении мин стакан с резьбой закрывается пробкой. 14. Каким образом осуществляется крепление мины МОН – 50 на местных предметах ? Если условия местности не позволяют зафиксировать мину в грунте или снегу, то ее устанавливают на местных предметах. Для этого в фланец на нижней грани корпуса ввинчивается струбцина. Она с помощью шурупа закрепляется на деревянных столбах, деревьях, а с использованием закрепительного винта и гайки – на конструкциях из металла. При этом порядок приведения мины не изменяется. Инженерный снаряд устанавливается на грунт на специальные складные ножки или крепится к горизонтальным поверхностям и местным предметам при помощи струбцины. 15.

Sebbene, dal momento che A e B condividono lo stesso spazio di indirizzi, potrebbero stare nella stessa sottorete e quindi questo non sarebbe necessario, però senza informazioni aggiuntive sull'organizzazione della rete, non possiamo escludere la necessità di conoscere l'indirizzo del router. e) l'indirizzo MAC del router della propria rete: Se i due host si trovano su reti diverse, A avrà bisogno dell'indirizzo MAC del proprio router per poter incapsulare il datagramma in una trama Ethernet e passarlo al router per l'inoltro. Ancora una volta, ciò potrebbe non essere necessario se fossero sulla stessa sottorete, ma mancano le informazioni per determinarlo con certezza.

Se sono su sottoreti diverse, A avrebbe comunque bisogno dell'indirizzo MAC del proprio router e non diretto a B. f) l'indirizzo MAC del router della rete a cui appartiene B: Questo non è necessario per A; il proprio router si occupa di scoprire e utilizzare l'indirizzo MAC appropriato tramite ARP quando il datagramma arriva alla rete di destinazione. In conclusione, in base alle informazioni fornite, A dovrebbe conoscere l'indirizzo IP del router della propria rete (b) e potenzialmente l'indirizzo MAC del router della propria rete (e), a meno che non si possa determinare con certezza che A e B siano sulla stessa sottorete solo usando l'indirizzo IP e la netmask fornita (in questo caso, entrambi gli host sarebbero nella sottorete con indirizzo di rete 12.34.56.64/26, ma questo non è dettagliato nella domanda, quindi non si può dare per scontato)."},{"instruction":"Un’organizzazione X ha un blocco di indirizzi 131.108.64/20.

Indicare i sottoblocchi di indirizzi assegnati a ciascun dipartimento. Inoltre, come buona pratica, l’organizzazione X deve annunciare ai router delle reti esterne il minimo numero possibile di rotte per coprire esattamente i suoi indirizzi IP.

Questa pratica migliora l'efficienza del routing su internet riducendo la grandezza delle tabelle di routing. Ecco come sono stati determinati gli insiemi più piccoli: Per il dipartimento A, vogliamo assegnare un blocco di indirizzi che può contenere almeno 2000 indirizzi. Il blocco più piccolo che soddisfa questa richiesta è un /21 (CIDR), in quanto fornisce 2^(32-21) = 2^11 = 2048 indirizzi. Dunque per A, il blocco assegnato è: 131.108.64.0/21 Per il dipartimento B, serve un blocco che contenga almeno 500 indirizzi. Il blocco più piccolo con questa capacità è un /23 (CIDR), che fornisce 2^(32-23) = 2^9 = 512 indirizzi. Perciò per B, il blocco assegnato è: 131.108.72.0/23 Per il dipartimento C, serve una quantità di indirizzi equivalente a quella del dipartimento B, dunque anche per C si assegnerà un blocco /23. Tuttavia, ci dobbiamo assicurare di non sovrapporre gli indirizzi con quelli di B. Il blocco successivo a quello di B (131.108.72.0/23) inizia a 131.108.74.0, quindi il blocco per C è: Per C, il blocco assegnato è: 131.108.74.0/23 Ora, possiamo vedere che i blocchi assegnati ai dipartimenti B e C sono consecutivi. I blocchi 131.108.72.0/23 e 131.108.74.0/23 possono essere aggregati in un unico blocco /22, in quanto: - Entrambi iniziano a 72 (in binario: 01001000) e 74 (in binario: 01001010), ovvero differiscono solo nel bit meno significativo del terzo ottetto. - Unendo questi due blocchi, si ottiene un intervallo che va da 72 a 75 (0001001000 a 0001001011 in binario), che è rappresentabile con un blocco /22 (si osservi che la parte della subnet è di 22 bit, lasciando 2 bit liberi nel terzo ottetto, che rappresentano esattamente 4 valori consecutivi possibili, ovvero 00, 01, 10 e 11). Quindi l'aggregazione dei blocchi B e C ci dà: 131.108.72.0/22 Analizzando le rotte: - Il blocco A è 131.108.64.0/21 e non può essere combinato con altri blocchi poiché si allontana dal range degli indirizzi degli altri blocchi. - I blocchi B e C sono stati aggregati in 131.108.72.0/22. Questi sono quindi gli insiemi più piccoli di indirizzi di rete che rappresentano le rotte per raggiungere i dipartimenti A, B e C: 1. 131.108.64.0/21 (copre il dipartimento A) 2. 131.108.72.0/22 (copre i dipartimenti B e C)"},{"instruction":"Q3 (8 punti) - Un Web Browser deve recuperare una risorsa alla URL http://www.example.com/index.html .

Spiegami il punto B","output":"Il punto b) chiede di identificare le coppie di indirizzo IP e porta impiegate per i pacchetti scambiati tra il web browser e il server web, e come questi vengono modificati dal processo di NAT (Network Address Translation) eseguito dal router. Quando un host in una rete privata (come 192.168.9.10) vuole comunicare con un host in una rete pubblica (come il server web con indirizzo 23.12.96.62), deve inviare i pacchetti attraverso un router che esegue il NAT per sostituire l'indirizzo IP privato dell'host sorgente con un indirizzo IP pubblico che è visibile su Internet. Questo processo è necessario perché gli indirizzi privati non sono riconosciuti su Internet e quindi i pacchetti originati da questi indirizzi non potrebbero essere inoltrati correttamente. Ecco come funziona nel dettaglio: 1. **Web Browser -> Web Server:** Il browser sul computer con indirizzo privato 192.168.9.10 stabilisce una connessione al server web. Il client inizializza la connessione da una porta disponibile (ad esempio, 43523) verso l'indirizzo IP del server web sulla porta 80, che è la porta HTTP di default. La coppia (indirizzo IP, porta) sorgente prima del NAT, il pacchetto avrà: - Source IP: 192.168.9.10 (indirizzo privato del browser) - Source Port: 43523 (una porta alta scelta casualmente dal sistema operativo del browser) La coppia (indirizzo IP, porta) destinazione sarà: - Destination IP: 23.12.96.62 (indirizzo pubblico del server web) - Destination Port: 80 (porta standard per il protocollo HTTP) Quando il pacchetto raggiunge il router, il NAT modifica la sorgente IP e porta per apparire come se il pacchetto provenga dal router stesso. Il router tiene traccia di questa associazione nella sua tabella NAT. Dopo il NAT, il pacchetto avrà: - Source IP: 150.50.10.10 (indirizzo pubblico del router NAT) - Source Port: Per esempio, 5010 (il router sceglie una porta disponibile per mantenere la traccia della sessione) 2. **Web Server -> Web Browser:** Le risposte dal server web saranno indirizzate al router NAT, poiché il server vede solo l'indirizzo pubblico usato dal NAT e non può vedere l'indirizzo privato del browser. La coppia sorgente del pacchetto inviato dal server sarà: - Source IP: 23.12.96.62 (indirizzo pubblico del server web) - Source Port: 80 (porta su cui il server sta aspettando le connessioni in entrata) La coppia destinazione (prima che il router esegua il NAT inverso) sarà: - Destination IP: 150.50.10.10 (indirizzo pubblico del router NAT) - Destination Port: 5010 (la porta che il router ha associato alla connessione originale del browser) Quando la risposta del server raggiunge il router, il NAT effettua il \\"reverse NAT\\" (il processo inverso) utilizzando la sua tabella NAT per determinare a quale indirizzo IP e porta privati deve essere inoltrato il pacchetto all'interno della rete locale. Il router quindi inoltra la risposta al client/browser originale sulla porta 43523 dell'indirizzo IP privato 192.168.9.10. In questo modo, il browser riceve la risposta come se avesse comunicato direttamente con il server web."},{"instruction":"What the three steps we discussed in class (and are listed on the PowerPoint) of photosynthesis? Be sure to list them in order of occurance.","output":"Unfortunately, I do not have direct access to the PowerPoint presentation or the details of the class discussion you are referring to. However, the process of photosynthesis in plants typically occurs in three general stages: 1. **Light Absorption:** In the first step, photosynthetic organisms capture light energy from the sun using pigment molecules such as chlorophyll, which are located in the chloroplasts of plant cells, mainly in the thylakoid membranes. 2. **Light-Dependent Reactions:** These reactions, also known as the photochemical or light reactions, take place within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts. Here, the light energy absorbed by chlorophyll is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Water molecules are split during this process, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct. 3. **Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent Reactions):** These reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid that surrounds the thylakoids in the chloroplasts. ATP and NADPH generated from the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into organic molecules like glucose. This process does not require light and is also known as the dark reaction or carbon fixation. These three steps together describe the overall process by which plants and other photosynthetic organisms convert light energy into chemical energy, releasing oxygen and storing energy in the form of carbohydrates."},{"instruction":"Describe controversial shaped supernova","output":"A controversial shaped supernova refers to a type of supernova explosion that displays a distinctive, non-spherical shape, which has led to debates and controversy among scientists to explain its origin and characteristics. Supernovae are powerful explosions that occur at the end of a star's life cycle, when the star has exhausted its nuclear fuel. Typically, when a star explodes as a supernova, it releases its energy in a spherical or nearly symmetric shape. However, controversial shaped supernovae deviate from this norm and exhibit a variety of irregular shapes. One example of a controversial shaped supernova is SN 1987A, which occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy to the Milky Way. This supernova displayed a peculiar shape with prominent rings and an hourglass-like structure. The study of SN 1987A has challenged existing theoretical models and raised questions about the physical processes that drive the explosion of supernovae. The controversy surrounding the shaped supernovae mainly stems from the difficulty in explaining their asymmetrical structures. Scientific theories and simulations have been proposed to account for these shapes, such as the presence of magnetic fields, rotation, and instabilities in the dying star before the explosion. However, none of these explanations has been universally accepted, leading to ongoing debate and controversy within the scientific community. Understanding the nature and origin of controversial shaped supernovae is crucial because they can have significant implications for our understanding of stellar evolution, the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, and the production of heavy elements in the universe. Further research, observations, and computational simulations are needed to resolve the controversies surrounding these fascinating cosmic phenomena."},{"instruction":"В рф на 2023 год Какое время должно предусматриваться для сна в распорядке дня воинской части?","output":"На 2023 год в Российской Федерации регламентирование времени, предусмотренного для сна военнослужащих в воинских частях, определяется соответствующими нормативными актами, регулирующими бытовые и служебные аспекты жизнедеятельности вооруженных сил.

Тема урока \\"Первые революционные преобразования большевиков\\". #Текст из учебника# 1 Первые декреты новой власти. Всероссийский съезд Советов в октябре 1917 г. принял ряд исторических решений. Главные из них — декреты о мире и о земле — были приняты по предложению Ленина. Декрет о мире провозгласил выход России из войны. Съезд обратился ко всем воюющим правительствам и народам с предложением всеобщего демократического мира, т. е. мира без аннексий и контрибуций. Правительствам Германии, Австро-Венгрии и Турции было предложено начать переговоры о заключении перемирия. В основу Декрета о земле были положены крестьянские наказы, направленные сразу после свержения монархии в адрес I Всероссийского съезда крестьянских депутатов. В них крестьяне требовали отмены частной собственности на землю и установления уравнительного землепользования. Эти требования были частью программы партии эсеров, а не большевиков. Но Ленин прекрасно понимал, что новая власть прежде всего должна удовлетворить чаяния большинства населения по вопросам земли и мира. Из декрета СНК о печати (27 октября 1917 г.) «Всякий знает, что буржуазная пресса есть одно из могущественнейших оружий буржуазии. Особенно в критический момент, когда новая власть, власть рабочих и крестьян, только упрочивается, невозможно было целиком оставить это оружие в руках врага в то время, как оно не менее опасно в такие минуты, чем бомбы и пулемёты. Закрытию подлежат лишь органы прессы: 1) призывающие к открытому сопротивлению или неповиновению Рабочему и Крестьянскому правительству; 2) сеющие смуту путём явно клеветнического извращения фактов». ⬤ Почему большевики издали такой декрет о печати? 2(15) ноября 1917 г. была опубликована Декларация прав народов России, провозгласившая равенство народов и их право на самоопределение — т. е. образование самостоятельного государства. Отменялись все национальные и религиозные ограничения. Декретом об уничтожении сословий и гражданских чинов отменялось деление общества на сословия дворян, купцов, крестьян, мещан, отменялись княжеские, графские и иные титулы, гражданские чины. Для всего населения устанавливалось одно наименование — гражданин Российской Советской Республики. Были уравнены в гражданских правах мужчины и женщины. 66 ГЛАВА I В январе 1918 г. издан декрет об отделении Церкви от государства и школы от Церкви. Был осуществлён переход на григорианский календарь — 1 февраля 1918 г. стало 14-м. С начала 1918 г. стало повсеместно использоваться новое правописание русского языка: из алфавита исключались три буквы (i десятеричное, фита и ять), менялись правила написания некоторых приставок и окончаний. ⬤ 1.

Свою позицию объясните. 2 Учредительное собрание. Идея Учредительного собрания была очень популярна среди всех партий и организаций после свержения монархии в феврале 1917 г. Большевики тоже никогда не выступали против его созыва. Выборы прошли в ноябре — в срок, назначенный ещё Временным правительством. Итоги выборов были предсказуемы: большинство крестьян выбирали своими делегатами представителей партии эсеров, большевики получили около 22% голосов. Ленин (Ульянов) Владимир Ильич (1870—1924) Родился в Симбирске (ныне Ульяновск) в семье действительного статского советника И. Ульянова. Окончил экстерном юридический факультет Санкт-Петербургского университета. Вместе с будущим лидером меньшевиков-интернационалистов Ю. Мартовым основал марксистский кружок «Союз борьбы за освобождение рабочего класса». Был арестован и сослан на три года в Восточную Сибирь. После ссылки выехал за границу по подложному заграничному паспорту на фамилию «Ленин», которая стала его партийным псевдонимом. С небольшим перерывом провёл в эмиграции 17 лет. Проявив политическую волю и незаурядную интуицию, умение организовать и вести за собой людей, способность убеждать, Ленин возглавил приход к власти большевиков в октябре 1917 г. В качестве главы первого правительства Советской России играл главную роль в формировании нового госаппарата, выработке и принятии всех важнейших решений в области внутренней и внешней политики. Настоял на разгоне Учредительного собрания, заключении Брестского мира с Германией, введении продовольственной диктатуры. Считал оправданным «революционное насилие» в отношении всех противников нового строя. В 1918 г. был тяжело ранен в результате покушения, организованного эсерами-террористами. Последствия ранения привели к тяжёлой болезни, из-за которой Ленин с 1922 г. фактически утратил решающее влияние в партии и государстве. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 67 Первое заседание Учредительного собрания в Таврическом дворце Петрограда 5(18) января 1918 г. стало и последним. Председателем был избран лидер правых эсеров, бывший министр земледелия Временного правительства В. Чернов. Лидеры эсеров и меньшевиков полагали, что теперь им удастся оттеснить большевиков от власти и сформировать собственное правительство. По­этому Учредительное собрание отклонило подготовленную Лениным Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа как основу будущей конституции страны и отказались утвердить принятые с октября 1917 г. декреты Совнаркома. Однако большевики и левые эсеры не собирались уступать. Они покинули заседание, которое продолжалось далеко за полночь. В 4 ч 40 мин утра его прервал начальник охраны матрос-анархист А. Железняков, произнёсший ставшие легендарными слова: «Караул устал». Ночью ВЦИК Советов принял решение о роспуске Учредительного собрания. Возле Таврического дворца была выставлена охрана, не пустившая туда депутатов. Демонстрации в поддержку собрания были разогнаны с применением вооружённой силы. Большая часть жителей России восприняла это событие спокойно. Но многие депутаты Учредительного собрания, прежде всего правые эсеры, решили продолжить борьбу и присоединиться к тем, кто готовился бороться с новой властью с помощью оружия. Летом 1918 г., после восстания Чехословацкого корпуса, им удалось организовать антибольшевистское восстание в Самаре.

Эта картина была написана художником в 1920 г. По легенде, спустя некоторое время к нему в мастерскую пришёл Фёдор Шаляпин (тот писал его портрет). Увидев картину, певец содрогнулся и произнёс: «Ну, пора уезжать?» ⬤ Как вы думаете, какую идею выражает данная картина? Почему она так называется? антибольшевистское правительство, которое объявило себя верховной властью и приступило к формированию Народной армии (см. § 8). ⬤ 1. Почему большинство членов Учредительного собрания отказались утвердить декреты Совнаркома? 2. Что побудило большевиков пойти на роспуск Учредительного собрания? 3 Организация власти Советов. Полномочия Учредительного собрания взял на себя III Всероссийский съезд Советов рабочих и солдатских депутатов, который открылся спустя три дня после роспуска Учредительного собрания. К нему присоединились делегаты III Всероссийского съезда Советов крестьянских депутатов. Объединённый съезд одобрил Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа, объявил Россию Советской Федеративной Социалистической Республикой (РСФСР) и поручил ВЦИК разработать Конституцию. В состав ВЦИК, кроме большевиков и левых эсеров, вошло несколько представителей других партий. Большое значение придавалось созданию системы Советов на местах. Им были переданы управленческие функции земских учреждений, декларировалась их полная автономность «в вопросах местного характера». Однако подчёркивалось, что местные Советы сообразуют свою деятельность с общими декретами и постановлениями высших советских организаций, в состав которых они входят. Впоследствии в условиях Гражданской войны роль Советов во многом подменялась чрезвычайными органами: местными чрезвычайными комиссиями (ЧК), комитетами бедноты (комбедами), революционными комитетами (ревкомами). ⬤ 1. Зачем большевикам понадобилось созывать III съезд Советов почти сразу после роспуска Учредительного собрания? 2. Какие функции выполняли Советы? § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 69 «Первые дни Октября. Красногвардейский дозор». Художник Г. Савицкий. 1949 г. В сборнике «Великие дни. Рассказы о революции» так описывались эти дни: «Тихо стало в богатых кварталах Петрограда. Побеждённая буржуазия боится выйти на улицу, со страхом и ненавистью смотрит она». ⬤ Из кого состояли первые отряды красногвардейцев? 4 Создание новой армии и спецслужбы. Новое государство нуждалось и в новой армии. Декрет Совнаркома провозгласил создание Рабоче-крестьянской Красной Армии (РККА). Вскоре был образован Красный Флот (РККФ). Применявшийся поначалу добровольческий принцип комплектования РККА приводил к сложностям в управлении войсками, что пагубным образом отражалось на её боеспособности и дисциплине. Кроме того, обеспечить быстрый рост численности армии на добровольной основе оказалось невозможно. Когда Германия нарушила перемирие и начала новое наступление на фронте, оказалось, что сдерживать его некому: самочинная демобилизация, начатая по решениям солдатских комитетов после Декрета о мире, привела к полному развалу армии. К тому же ширился размах антибольшевистских выступлений в регионах страны. Поэтому Совнаркому пришлось вернуться к всеобщей воинской повинности мужского населения в возрасте от 18 до 40 лет. В течение лета—осени 1918 г. в ряды РККА было мобилизовано 300 тыс. человек. В 1920 г. число красноармейцев превысило 5 млн. Большое внимание уделялось формированию командных кадров. В 1917—1919 гг., помимо краткосрочных курсов и школ для подготовки среднего командного звена, были открыты высшие военные учебные заведения. В марте 1918 г. опубликовано извещение о привлечении на службу военных специалистов (военспецов) царской армии. К 1 января 1919 г. ряды Красной Армии пополнили более чем 70 тыс. бывших офицеров русской императорской армии. Для контроля над ними в апреле 1918 г. в войсках и на флоте был введён институт военных комиссаров, которые должны 70 ГЛАВА I были также осуществлять «политическое воспитание» красноармейцев. В сентябре 1918 г. была создана единая структура управления войсками фронтов и армий. Во главе каждого фронта (армии) назначался Революционный военный совет (Реввоенсовет, или РВС), состоявший из командующего и двух комиссаров. Возглавлял все военные учреждения Реввоенсовет республики во главе с Л. Троцким, который занял пост наркома по военным и морским делам. Были приняты меры по ужесточению дисциплины. Представители Реввоенсовета, наделённые чрезвычайными полномочиями (вплоть до расстрела изменников и трусов без суда), выезжали на самые напряжённые участки фронта. В ноябре 1918 г. был образован Совет рабочей и крестьянской обороны во главе с В. Лениным, сосредоточивший в своих руках всю полноту государственной власти. В первые недели после взятия власти большевики столкнулись с массовым бойкотом (забастовкой) государственных, банковских и других служащих. Новым советским министрам (теперь — народным комиссарам, наркомам) приходилось силой взламывать покинутые чиновниками здания и кабинеты. 7(20) декабря 1917 г. была создана Всероссийская чрезвычайная комиссия по борьбе с контрреволюцией и саботажем (ВЧК). Возглавил ВЧК Ф. Дзержинский. Первой задачей комиссии была борьба с саботажем госслужащих. Позднее основными направлениями деятельности чекистов стали пресечение любых действий контрреволюции, предание суду революционного трибунала саботажников и контрреволюционеров, выработка системных мер борьбы с ними. Дзержинский Феликс Эдмундович (1877—1926) Участник революционной борьбы, шесть раз был арестован и трижды бежал, стоял у истоков Красной гвардии. Одновременно с созданием и руководством первой советской спецслужбой (ВЧК) был наркомом путей сообщения, главой комиссии по детской беспризорности, председателем созданного им спортивного общества «Динамо», с 1924 г. — председатель главного органа управления экономикой страны — ВСНХ. Сыграл огромную роль не только в борьбе с контрреволюцией, но и в создании системы профессионального образования, восстановлении железных дорог и всего народного хозяйства. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 71 За столом переговоров при подписании Брестского мира. Брест-Литовск, 1918 г. В августе 1918 г. было заключено дополнительное соглашение, по которому советское правительство обязывалось выплатить Германии огромную контрибуцию. Её часть была выплачена до аннулирования Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г. ⬤ 1. На каких принципах формировалась РККА? Почему большевикам удалось быстро организовать боеспособную армию? 2. Какие задачи возлагались на ВЧК? 5 Брестский мир. Вопрос о войне оставался одним из самых болезненных. В ноябре 1917 г. Л. Троцкий, назначенный народным комиссаром по иностранным делам, обратился к правительствам всех воюющих держав с предложением о заключении всеобщего демократического мира. Согласие на переговоры было получено только от воюющих с Россией государств. Переговоры начались в г. Брест-Литовске, где находилась ставка командования германскими войсками на Восточном фронте, и привели к заключению 2 декабря 1917 г. перемирия. Однако после отказа стран Антанты присоединиться к переговорам Германия отвергла идею заключения мира «без аннексий и контрибуций» и выдвинула требование признать за ней оккупированные территории Польши, Прибалтики и других частей бывшей Российской империи. Германия планировала установить протекторат над правобережьем Днепра. После событий октября 1917 г. в Петрограде Украинская Центральная рада (ЦР) отказалась признать переход власти к Советам. Восстание рабочих киевских заводов было подавлено частями «самостийников» под командованием С. Петлюры. Но отряды Красной гвардии приближались к Киеву. Чтобы сохранить свою власть, ЦР провозгласила создание Украинской народной республики (УНР) и в обмен на военную помощь против большевиков обязалась поставить Германии и Австро-Венгрии миллион тонн зерна, а также другое продовольствие и сырьё. Чтобы обеспечить себе «право» на захват Украины, германское командование подписало с представителями 72 ГЛАВА I УНР сепаратный мирный договор на следующий день после того, как отряды Красной гвардии заняли Киев. Германские требования и подготовка вторжения для помощи «независимой Украине» вызвали конфликт среди руководителей большевиков. Все они всерьёз рассчитывали, что в уставших от войны европейских странах тоже вот-вот должна начаться революция. Постепенно расширяясь, революционное движение охватит весь мир («мировая революция»). Поэтому отказ России от мира с Германией, демонстрация готовности вести «революционную войну» и обращение за помощью к «мировому пролетариату» подстегнёт революционное движение в других странах. Особенно активно эту точку зрения отстаивали Н. Бухарин, Ф. Дзержинский и Л. Троцкий. Подписание мира с Германией, считали они, — это отказ от мировой революции. Данную позицию поддержали левые эсеры. Ленин же настаивал на немедленном заключении мира. Чтобы убедить других членов ЦК, ему пришлось даже угрожать отставкой с поста главы правительства. Ленина поддержал Сталин, заявив, что «революционного движения на Западе нет, а есть только потенция, а с потенцией мы не можем считаться». В итоге, чтобы избежать раскола в руководстве партии, большинством голосов было решено просто затягивать переговоры, отказываясь от подписания мира на немецких условиях. Суть компромисса сформулировал Троцкий в лозунге «Ни мира, ни войны». При этом демобилизация армии должна была продолжаться. В это же время был принят декрет ВЦИК (его возглавлял Я. Свердлов) об аннулировании всех прежних долгов России перед иностранными государствами. Однако совсем скоро большевикам пришлось признать правоту своего лидера: после отказа заключить мир немцы и австрийцы начали новое наступление. Не встречая серьёзного сопротивления, их армии двинулись к Киеву и Одессе, а на северо-западе — к Пскову. Советское правительство немедленно запросило мира. Новый германский ультиматум, полученный 23 февраля, содержал гораздо более тяжёлые условия. Под давлением Ленина большинство членов ЦК проголосовали за немедленное принятие этих условий. Мирный договор был подписан 3 марта 1918 г. в БрестЛитовске. По его условиям Российское правительство обязывалось признать УНР независимым государством, а также не претендовать на Прибалтику: здесь немцы тоже планировали создать подконтрольные им государственные образования (сразу после § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 73 подписания мира было объявлено о восстановлении Герцогства Курляндского, а осенью провозглашено создание Балтийского герцогства). В результате в сферу влияния Германии попадала территория площадью свыше 1 млн кв. км и с населением более 50 млн человек. Кроме того, Россия должна была уступить Турции в Закавказье города Ардаган, Батум и Карс с округами. Эти уступки дополнялись обязательством демобилизовать армию и разоружить флот. Вскоре после заключения мира левые эсеры в знак протеста вышли из состава правительства. О своей оппозиционности этому решению ЦК заявили также многие большевики. Лидером этой группы, которую стали называть «левыми коммунистами», был Н. Бухарин. Они считали, что Брестский договор означает отказ от продолжения «русской и международной революции», и требовали либо аннулировать его, либо развернуть партизанскую борьбу на оккупированных Германией территориях. РСФСР отказалась соблюдать условия Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г., сразу после революции в Германии и её капитуляции. ⬤ 1.

На каких условиях был заключён мир с Германией? Какова была, на ваш взгляд, необходимость заключения такого договора? Свой ответ аргументируйте. 6 Первая Конституция России 1918 г. В июле 1918 г. собрался V Всероссийский съезд Советов. Главным итогом его работы стало принятие первой в истории России Конституции 1918 г. Она объявляла государственную власть принадлежащей «трудовому народу» — рабочим и беднейшей части крестьянства. Закреплялось федеративное устройство страны и её название — Российская Социалистическая Федеративная Советская Республика (РСФСР), был утверждён новый государственный флаг и герб. Высшим органом власти признавался Всероссийский съезд Советов, а в период между созывами съездов — избранный им ВЦИК. Он имел право отменить или приостановить решение правительства — Совнаркома (СНК). Конституция перечисляла основные права и обязанности граждан. Все были обязаны трудиться, охранять завоевания революции, защищать Отечество. Выборы в органы власти не были прямыми для сельского населения: сельские Советы выбирали депутатов на волостные и уезд­ 74 ГЛАВА I ные съезды, которые затем посылали депутатов на областные и губернские, а уже те — на Всероссийский съезд. Избирательного права лишались лица, прибегавшие к наёмному труду или живущие на «нетрудовой доход»: прежде всего, имелись в виду «капиталисты» (предприниматели), в том числе частные торговцы. Также участвовать в выборах не могли священнослужители, агенты полиции и жандармы, члены императорского дома Романовых и др. ⬤ Выделите основные положения Конституции РСФСР 1918 г.

Here's an overview of the \`Solucio\` class' functionality based on the code: - The class stores data related to financial transaction records, such as years (\`anys\`), income or expense (\`ingresDespesa\`), transaction codes (\`codi\`), and the import amounts (\`import\`). - It also stores assignment-related information like the current level (\`niv\`), number of lines processed (\`linies\`), sum of processed values (\`suma\`), sum of processed import amounts (\`sumaImport\`), and sum of processed lines (\`sumaLinies\`). - It holds configuration flags like \`tipus\` and \`capitol\` which presumably control certain aspects of the assignment logic. - There are methods to initialize candidates, check whether a candidate is acceptable, and if a candidate's import exceeds a threshold amount. - The \`acabada\` method checks if the solution is complete, determined by whether it has processed all input lines. - \`anotar\` records the assigning of a transaction to a specific auditor, while \`desanotar\` undoes this assignment. - \`numAuditors\` may update the number of auditors involved based on information in the candidates. - \`potSerMillor\` and \`esMillor\` are used to compare solutions, likely to identify the best among alternatives. - The \`desviacio\` method calculates a statistical deviation value that might be used to determine how evenly the financial load is spread among the auditors. - Finally, a few methods such as \`primeraLinia\`, \`mostrar_solucio\`, and \`mostrarLinies\` provide output for user readability, potentially to display intermediate steps or the final solution. It's worth noting to fully understand and utilize this code, you would need the related \`Candidats\` class definition and possibly other parts of the project to see how it all integrates."},{"instruction":"// Dídac Comes Salas // Usuari u1988980 // Pràctica 2 #include \\"Candidats.h\\" #include <iostream> #include <vector> using namespace std;

He revisat la funció \`desanotar\` i hi ha un parell de coses que podrien causar problemes: 1. Estàs fent servir \`cout\` per imprimir la variable \`maxCan\` i \`iCan.actual()\` a cada trucada de \`desanotar\`, el que podria introduir soroll i dificultar seguir el flux lògic del programa. 2. La lògica per a reduir \`maxCan\` podria no estar manejant correctament tots els casos, especialment si \`maxCan\` és igual a \`iCan.actual()\` i aquest candidat era l'únic assignat a l'auditor que està essent eliminat. Revisem i ajustem el mètode \`desanotar\`: \`\`\`cpp void Solucio::desanotar(const Candidats& iCan) { if (not assignacions.empty() and iCan.actual() < assignacions.size()) { if (not assignacions[iCan.actual()].empty()) { niv--; linies--; char id = ingresDespesa[linies]; assignacions[iCan.actual()][id].pop_back(); sumaImp[iCan.actual()] -= import[linies]; sumaImport -= import[linies]; // Aquesta part sembla que podria ser una mica problemàtica. // Hem de revisar si després de desanotar, l'auditor actual té 0 càrregues, // i en aquest cas, actualitzar maxCan adequadament. if (assignacions[iCan.actual()][id].empty() && sumaImp[iCan.actual()] == 0) { // Es pot millorar aquesta comprovació per veure si realment ha de decrementar maxCan. bool esUltimAuditor = true; for (int i = 0; i <= maxCan; i++) { if (sumaImp[i] != 0) { esUltimAuditor = false; break; } } if (esUltimAuditor && maxCan > 0) { maxCan--; } } // Si estem desanotant i tornem enrere en les linies, hem d'assegurar-nos // que la propera trucada de \`anotar\` començarà a revisar des de la linia correcta. // Això és important perquè si tenim múltiples assignacions possibles en una linia, // podriem necessitar tornar enrere més d'una vegada. while(any != anys[linies] && linies > 0){ linies--; } } } } \`\`\` Una altra cosa que val la pena revisar és el maneig adequat de l'actualització de \`maxCan\` dins la funció \`numAuditors\`: \`\`\`cpp void Solucio::numAuditors(const Candidats &iCan){ // Si aquesta és una nova assignació que supera el nombre d'auditors actuals, // aleshores maxCan ha d'augmentar. if(iCan.actual() > maxCan) maxCan = iCan.actual(); // A més, hauries de considerar el cas quan treure una assignació disminueix maxCan. } \`\`\` A més, seria bo revisar les funcions \`trobar\` i \`trobarMillor\` per asegurar-te que realitzen correctament els backtracking, especialment si el programar està fent servir recursivitat per explorar els candidats. Finalment, recomano revisar la lògica en \`trobarMillor\` i assegurar que quan trobis una millor solució, actualitzis correctament l'objecte \`opt\`. Si després de fer la recomanació encara teniu problemes, seria útil revisar el problema amb més detall per capçalera i entendre exactament quins casos no s'estan maneajnt correctament."},{"instruction":"Ara he fet aixo: void Solucionador::trobarMillor(Solucio& act){ Candidats iCan = act.inicialitzarCandidats(); while(not iCan.esFi()){ if(act.acceptable(iCan) and act.potSerMillor(opt, iCan)){ act.anotar(iCan); if(not act.acabada()) trobarMillor(act); else { if(act.esMillor(opt)){ opt = act; } } act.desanotar(iCan); } iCan.seguent(); } if(iCan.esFi()){ encertat = true; cout << \\"hola\\" << endl; } } i em dona el hola molts cops i arriba un moment que para. No ho entenc ja que en teoria quan arriba a la linia if(iCan.esFi()){ l'ha de fer un cop ja que no està dins ni de cap while i entenc que no afecta a l'acció recursiva ja que per tornar al principi de l'acció trobarMillor està a la linia if(not act.acabada()) trobarMillor(act); que està dins del while.","output":"Podem veure que el missatge \\"hola\\" s'imprimeix cada vegada que la funció \`trobarMillor\` arriba al seu final i comprova la condició \`if(iCan.esFi())\`. Això indicaria que cada trucada recursiva de \`trobarMillor\` està arribant a aquesta condició. El teu enfocament per buscar la millor solució és correcte, utilitzant la recursivitat per recórrer tot l'espai de solucions possibles. La impressió del \\"hola\\" es pot repetir nombroses vegades perquè es tracta d'un procés recursiu profund i podria passar que s'arriba al final de la llista de candidats (la condició \`iCan.esFi()\`) diverses vegades, ja que això ocorrerà en cada nivell de recurrència de la cerca. L'acció de \`trobarMillor\` es pot desglossar de la manera següent: 1. Amb cada nova crida recursiva, inicialitzem els candidats per a l'actual solució. 2. Iterem a través de tots els possibles candidats, fins que no quedin més (\`iCan.esFi()\`). 3. Si el candidat actual és acceptable i pot millorar la millor solució fins ara coneguda (\`opt\`), l'anotem per veure si podria fer una solució completa o millorar una solució existent. 4. Si la solució arriba a ser completa, comprovem si és millor que la que tenim (\`opt\`) i l'actualitzem si cal. 5. Desanotem el candidat actual per retrocedir i intentar altres possibles combinacions. Respecte a la impressió repetida de \\"hola\\", això es pot donar per alguns motius diferents: - La recursivitat de \`trobarMillor\` està arribant a la condició de fi (\`iCan.esFi()\`) múltiples vegades a través de diferents camins en l'arbre de cerca. Aquesta és una operació esperada en una recerca backtracking, ja que intentarem tots els possibles candidats en cada pas recursiu. - Hi ha prou nombroses combinacions possibles com per què la funció recursiva sigui cridada moltes vegades abans de trobar una solució. Si el missatge \\"hola\\" s'imprimeix infinitament, és possible que la recursivitat no tingui una condició base correcta en alguna situació, o que es doni un cas infinit degut a la gestió incorrecta de l'estat de l'objecte \`act\` o \`opt\` dins de la cerca. Per resoldre el problema amb el bucle infinit, necessitaràs assegurar-te que el teu algorisme de cerca satisfà els següents punts: - Cada candidat només es considera una vegada per cada trucada de funció recursiva. - Reduint clarament el nombre de possibilitats en cada crida (\`trobarMillor\`). - Que la condició de base està ben definida, així la cerca es detindrà quan ja no hi hagi més candidats o quan s'hagi trobat una millor solució. Suggeriria afegir més opcions de depuració o utilitzar eines de depuració per seguir l'estat de les variables i comprendre millor el flux d'execució de la teva aplicació."},{"instruction":"El que fa és inserir-me molts \\"hola\\", però al final no insereix res més. Hauria d'inserir el que hi ha a assignacions i no insereix res. Ara et passo l'enunciat de tota la pràctica juntament amb alguns exemples. 1 Presentaci´o Ha arribat el dia en qu\`e s’ha de fiscalitzar la feina de la Gencat i, entre d’altres, es realitzar\`a una auditoria dels comptes d’acord amb els pressupostos. La nostra empresa, Empresa d’Auditories S.L. (EdA SL, en curt), ha rebut l’enc\`arrec de fiscalitzar els comptes i la gerent de l’empresa ens ha demanat al servei inform\`atic crear un programa per dimensionar l’equip d’auditors que participar\`a en aquesta feina. L’objectiu ´es auditar totes les partides (Aplicacions) del pressupost d’un any donat amb un equip d’auditors adequat. Aix´ı, haurem d’assignar cada aplicaci´o pressupost\`aria a un auditor, per\`o aquesta assignaci´o no ´es trivial si es vol fer de la millor manera possible d’acord amb els criteris establerts. Per simplificar la feina als auditors, voldrem tenir la capacitat d’assignar nom´es aplicacions d’un mateix tipus a cada auditor, o d’un mateix cap´ıtol. A m´es, la gerent d’EdA SL ens indica que, per reduir costos, voldria poder trobar l’equip m´es petit possible per\`o sense sobresaturar cap dels nostres companys auditors. Es ´ a dir, en aquest cas buscar´ıem l’assignaci´o que necessiti el menor nombre d’auditors per\`o, donades dues solucions amb el mateix nombre, triar´ıem l’assignaci´o d’aplicacions que m´es b´e (balancejat) reparteix l’import total als auditors. 1.1 Dades d’entrada Tornarem a tractar amb el mateix tipus de dades sobre els pressupostos de la Gencat que d´ona el CTTI i que s’han fet servir abans en exercicis i pr\`actiques de l’assignatura. 1.2 Resum dels requeriments Si recopilem el m´es rellevant del que s’ha explicat abans: • Hem d’auditar totes les partides (aplicacions) del pressupost d’un any donat • Les aplicacions es repartiran entre auditors • A cada auditor se li poden assignar aplicacions per un import m\`axim donat. Tots els auditors tenen el mateix l´ımit. • Es pot demanar que cada auditor fiscalitzi nom´es (restriccions) aplicacions d’un mateix tipus (I/D) o d’un mateix cap´ıtol. • Es poden fer servir, en principi, tants auditors com calgui, per\`o... – es pot indicar el nombre d’auditors m\`axim a utilitzar, – o es pot demanar buscar la soluci´o amb el m´ınim nombre d’auditors. En aquest cas, entre dues solucions amb el mateix nombre, es prioritzar\`a aquella que tingui l’import total m´es ben repartit entre auditors, ´es a dir, la que tingui la menor desviaci´o est\`andard (veure Equaci´o 1) de l’import assignat als auditors. σ = vuut 1 n Xn i=1 (pi − p) 2 F´ormula de la desviaci´o est\`andard σ, on n ´es el nombre d’auditors, pi ´es l’import agregat de les aplicacions assignades a l’i-\`esim auditor, i p ´es l’import mitj\`a assignat als auditors. (1) EDA Practica 2: Algor \` ´ısmica, curs 2023/24 GDDV/GEINF 2 2 Feina a fer 1. Fent servir backtracking, trobar una assignaci´o d’aplicacions a auditors que no superi el nombre m\`axim donat (si s’indica) i que compleixi les restriccions establertes. Si no ´es possible trobar una assignaci´o amb aquestes condicions, s’informar\`a que no hi ha soluci´o. 2. Fent servir backtracking, trobar la millor assignaci´o d’aplicacions a auditors complint les restriccions donades, ´es a dir, la que minimitza el nombre d’auditors, primer, i la desviaci´o est\`andard de l’assignaci´o d’imports en segon lloc. Igualment, si no ´es possible trobar una assignaci´o amb aquestes condicions, s’informar\`a que no hi ha soluci´o. 2.1 Instruccions • Cal codificar el backtracking utilitzant les classes vistes a teoria: Solucionador, Solucio i Candidats. • Les dades es llegiran d’un fitxer de tipus text que contindr\`a les dades de pressupostos que ja coneixeu fent servir les funcions d’eines.h. • Ens quedarem amb les l´ınies del pressupost de l’any indicat per l’usuari amb un import consolidat m´es gran que 0. Recordeu que pot haver-hi m´es d’una l´ınia (o import) associada a la mateixa aplicaci´o. Nom´es cal guardar la informaci´o associada a l’aplicaci´o. • Un cop calculada la soluci´o, aquesta es mostrar\`a per la sortida est\`andard en un format lliure, per\`o similar al que es mostra m´es endavant en aquest document. En tot cas, ha de mostrar l’assignaci´o de cada auditor (les aplicacions que auditar\`a ordenades per codi), l’import agregat de les aplicacions assignades a cada auditor, el nombre total d’auditors, la desviaci´o est\`andard dels imports assignats als auditors, i el temps que ha trigat a trobar la soluci´o. • Si es creu oport´u, es poden preprocessar les dades abans d’iniciar el backtracking per obtenir estructures que ens puguin ser ´utils per podar branques de l’arbre de possibilitats. Aquest preprocessament s’inclour\`a en el c\`alcul del temps de c\`omput de l’algorisme. • En una execuci´o normal, cal indicar obligat\`oriament si es busca una o la millor soluci´o, l’any a auditar, l’import m\`axim que pot assumir un auditor, i el nom del fitxer de dades. El nombre m\`axim d’auditors ´es un par\`ametre opcional (si no s’indica, s´on il·limitats), al igual que les restriccions per tipus I/D i cap´ıtol. Per saber com indicar aquests par\`ametres, es pot consultar l’ajuda del programa (veure exemple m´es avall). • Per fer les proves, cal comen¸car amb poques l´ınies amb imports ben dimensionats (pel que fa al m\`axim que se li podr\`a assignar a un auditor), i anar-ho incrementant de mica en mica (el temps d’execuci´o es disparar\`a!). • El programa principal s’ha d’anomenar audita i ha de funcionar a trav´es de l’int\`erpret de comandes tal com es descriu a continuaci´o: – Si es crida sense par\`ametres, ha d’emetre un missatge indicant com demanar ajuda. 1 ./audita 2 Falten arguments (\\"./audita --help\\" per ajuda) – Si es demana ajuda, ha de descriure el seu funcionament. 1 ./audita --help 2 Utilitzaci´o: ./audita opcio fitxer 3 4 opcio pot ser: 5 -h, --help mostra aquest missatge d'ajuda i surt 6 -u cerca una soluci´o qualsevol que compleixi les EDA Practica 2: Algor \` ´ısmica, curs 2023/24 GDDV/GEINF 3 7 restriccions del problema 8 -m cerca la soluci´o que minimitza el nombre d'auditors 9 i el repartiment \`optim d'aplicacions 10 -t indica que nom´es es poden assignar aplicacions del 11 mateix tipus (ingr´es/despesa) a un auditor 12 -c indica que nom´es es poden assignar aplicacions del 13 mateix cap´ıtol a un auditor 14 -a <any> indica que s'ha de fer l'assignaci´o per a 15 l'exercici pressupostari <any> 16 -i <imp> assigna <imp> com a import m\`axim que un 17 ´unic auditor pot fiscalitzar 18 -n <aud> assigna <aud> com a nombre m\`axim d'auditors 19 20 fitxer ha de ser un fitxer de text amb totes les l´ınies 21 dels pressupostos amb el format del CTTI. 22 – El programa s’ha d’aturar i mostrar un missatge d’error amb el primer problema detectat amb l’entrada de par\`ametres (si falta un par\`ametre o ´es incorrecte).

Això inclou les classes \`Solucio\`, \`Candidats\`, i \`Solucionador\`, juntament amb la lògica de processament principal situada dins del \`main\`. Volem assegurar-nos que el solucionador pugui: 1. Llegir dades del fitxer CSV proporcionat. 2. Filtrar les dades segons l'any i altres criteris. 3. Utilitzar backtracking per a trobar una assignació permesa d'aplicacions pressupostàries segons els límits d'import per auditor i altres restriccions. 4. Comparar solucions per a determinar quina reparteix més equitativament l'import total entre els auditors, usant la desviació estàndard com a criteri de decisió. En el teu cas, t'has trobat amb un problema on sembla que el solucionador s'executa, però no retorna cap solució. Hi ha alguns passos a seguir per a depurar el problema: - Comprova que les dades es llegeixen correctament del fitxer CSV i es filtren adequadament basant-se en els criteris especificats (any i imports no nuls). - Assegura't que la classe \`Candidats\` permet iterar adequadament a través de les opcions disponibles, i que l'estat es manté coherent a través de trucades recursives. - Verifica que les funcions \`acceptable\`, \`anotar\`, i \`desanotar\` dins de la classe \`Solucio\` gestionen correctament l'estat de la solució actual, inclòs l'assignació i la retirada d'aplicacions als auditors. - Revisa que la funció \`trobarMillor\` maneja correctament la recursivitat, especialment quan es retorna de la recursió. Una vegada s'arriba a una fulla de l'arbre de cerca (és a dir, quan \`iCan.esFi()\` és cert), la solució actual s'ha de comparar amb la millor solució (\`opt\`) i actualitzar si és millor. Si no és millor, o no és una solució completa, la funció hauria de retornar a la trucada anterior per provar una altra branca de l'arbre. Si després de fer les comprovacions anteriors encara no s'obté cap solució, seria útil incorporar missatges de depuració o utilitzar un depurador per seguir els valors de les variables i comprendre per què el programa està actuant d'aquesta manera. Per a la depuració, pots inserir missatges addicionals de consola a punts clau de la teva implementació del backtracking que t'ajudin a entendre quins passos està seguint l'algorisme i per què podria estar fallant en trobar una solució. També podríeu considerar el cas que l'algorisme està trobant una solució, però per alguna raó no s'està mostrant correctament a la sortida. A mode de recordatori, cal assegurar que no estàs imprimint \\"hola\\" dins la funció \`trobarMillor\`, ja que aquest missatge s'imprimirà cada vegada que la funció s'execute i arribi a la condició \`iCan.esFi()\`, i això pot provocar confusió durant la depuració. En lloc d'això, només haurien d'imprimir-se missatges que indiquin l'estat actual del backtracking i la raó per la qual no es troba solució, si és el cas."},{"instruction":"Il n’est pas en recherche active, mais le poste lui semble en adéquation avec son profile et ses ambitions d’integrer un client direct.

La nostra empresa, Empresa d’Auditories S.L. (EdA SL, en curt), ha rebut l’enc\`arrec de fiscalitzar els comptes i la gerent de l’empresa ens ha demanat al servei inform\`atic crear un programa per dimensionar l’equip d’auditors que participar\`a en aquesta feina. L’objectiu ´es auditar totes les partides (Aplicacions) del pressupost d’un any donat amb un equip d’auditors adequat. Aix´ı, haurem d’assignar cada aplicaci´o pressupost\`aria a un auditor, per\`o aquesta assignaci´o no ´es trivial si es vol fer de la millor manera possible d’acord amb els criteris establerts. Per simplificar la feina als auditors, voldrem tenir la capacitat d’assignar nom´es aplicacions d’un mateix tipus a cada auditor, o d’un mateix cap´ıtol. A m´es, la gerent d’EdA SL ens indica que, per reduir costos, voldria poder trobar l’equip m´es petit possible per\`o sense sobresaturar cap dels nostres companys auditors. Es ´ a dir, en aquest cas buscar´ıem l’assignaci´o que necessiti el menor nombre d’auditors per\`o, donades dues solucions amb el mateix nombre, triar´ıem l’assignaci´o d’aplicacions que m´es b´e (balancejat) reparteix l’import total als auditors. 1.1 Dades d’entrada Tornarem a tractar amb el mateix tipus de dades sobre els pressupostos de la Gencat que d´ona el CTTI i que s’han fet servir abans en exercicis i pr\`actiques de l’assignatura. 1.2 Resum dels requeriments Si recopilem el m´es rellevant del que s’ha explicat abans: • Hem d’auditar totes les partides (aplicacions) del pressupost d’un any donat • Les aplicacions es repartiran entre auditors • A cada auditor se li poden assignar aplicacions per un import m\`axim donat. Tots els auditors tenen el mateix l´ımit. • Es pot demanar que cada auditor fiscalitzi nom´es (restriccions) aplicacions d’un mateix tipus (I/D) o d’un mateix cap´ıtol. • Es poden fer servir, en principi, tants auditors com calgui, per\`o... – es pot indicar el nombre d’auditors m\`axim a utilitzar, – o es pot demanar buscar la soluci´o amb el m´ınim nombre d’auditors. En aquest cas, entre dues solucions amb el mateix nombre, es prioritzar\`a aquella que tingui l’import total m´es ben repartit entre auditors, ´es a dir, la que tingui la menor desviaci´o est\`andard (veure Equaci´o 1) de l’import assignat als auditors. σ = vuut 1 n Xn i=1 (pi − p) 2 F´ormula de la desviaci´o est\`andard σ, on n ´es el nombre d’auditors, pi ´es l’import agregat de les aplicacions assignades a l’i-\`esim auditor, i p ´es l’import mitj\`a assignat als auditors.

Fent servir backtracking, trobar una assignaci´o d’aplicacions a auditors que no superi el nombre m\`axim donat (si s’indica) i que compleixi les restriccions establertes. Si no ´es possible trobar una assignaci´o amb aquestes condicions, s’informar\`a que no hi ha soluci´o. 2.

Igualment, si no ´es possible trobar una assignaci´o amb aquestes condicions, s’informar\`a que no hi ha soluci´o. 2.1 Instruccions • Cal codificar el backtracking utilitzant les classes vistes a teoria: Solucionador, Solucio i Candidats. • Les dades es llegiran d’un fitxer de tipus text que contindr\`a les dades de pressupostos que ja coneixeu fent servir les funcions d’eines.h. • Ens quedarem amb les l´ınies del pressupost de l’any indicat per l’usuari amb un import consolidat m´es gran que 0. Recordeu que pot haver-hi m´es d’una l´ınia (o import) associada a la mateixa aplicaci´o. Nom´es cal guardar la informaci´o associada a l’aplicaci´o. • Un cop calculada la soluci´o, aquesta es mostrar\`a per la sortida est\`andard en un format lliure, per\`o similar al que es mostra m´es endavant en aquest document. En tot cas, ha de mostrar l’assignaci´o de cada auditor (les aplicacions que auditar\`a ordenades per codi), l’import agregat de les aplicacions assignades a cada auditor, el nombre total d’auditors, la desviaci´o est\`andard dels imports assignats als auditors, i el temps que ha trigat a trobar la soluci´o. • Si es creu oport´u, es poden preprocessar les dades abans d’iniciar el backtracking per obtenir estructures que ens puguin ser ´utils per podar branques de l’arbre de possibilitats. Aquest preprocessament s’inclour\`a en el c\`alcul del temps de c\`omput de l’algorisme. • En una execuci´o normal, cal indicar obligat\`oriament si es busca una o la millor soluci´o, l’any a auditar, l’import m\`axim que pot assumir un auditor, i el nom del fitxer de dades. El nombre m\`axim d’auditors ´es un par\`ametre opcional (si no s’indica, s´on il·limitats), al igual que les restriccions per tipus I/D i cap´ıtol.

Murals refer to the paintings illustrated on visual components like the wall, ceiling and other long-lasting surfaces. The mural paintings of Kerala stand out for their prominence in clarity, beauty and symmetry with an unmatchable linear accuracy. It is believed that these paintings belong to a distinguishable lineage with its tradition carrying influences from Ajanta. Kerala mural paintings find their roots in ancient Indian art traditions, particularly in the region of Kerala. The roots of the extant mural tradition of Kerala could be traced as far back as the 7th and 8th century AD. It is not unlikely that the early Kerala murals along with its architecture came heavily under the influence of Pallava art. The oldest murals in Kerala were discovered in the rock-cut cave temple of Thirunandikkara, which is now in the Kanyakumari district of Tamilnadu. The mural paintings of Kerala are mostly from the 14th Century AD. There are over 150 temples in Kerala which have ancient mural art forms. The scriptural basis of these paintings can be found in the Sanskrit texts, Chithrasoothram - (Chitrasutra is a part of the Vishnu Dharmottara Purana, a book written in Sanskrit about 1500 years ago. It contains 287 short verses in nine chapters and a few prose in the second chapter. There is no other book on painting as detailed as the Chitrasutra. This book answers hundreds of questions about what a painting is, why, its purpose, role, relationship with the painter, connoisseurs, and other arts.","output":"The word 'mural' comes from 'murus,' the Latin for 'wall,' referring to art painted on enduring surfaces like walls and ceilings.

The process of creating a Kerala Mural Painting involves several stages. 1.The surface is prepared by applying a mixture of lime and sand to create a smooth and even base. 2.The artist sketches the outline of the figures using charcoal or chalk. 3.The colours are then carefully applied, starting with lighter shades and gradually building to darker tones. The artists pay meticulous attention to detail, using fine brush strokes to bring out the depicted figures' intricate facial expressions, gestures, and ornate costumes. 4. Addition of decorative details In detail : First, we begin with the Lekhya Karma, which refers to the basic sketch that the artist renders on the wall. It acts as a guiding outline, allowing the artist to visualise the intricate shapes which often consist of mandalas; the character art in turn is influenced by local dance forms such as Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattam and Theyyam. The second stage is called the Rekha Karma, which reinforces the linework by tracing it and enhances the shapes to be filled in. The Varna Karma finally utilises the panchavarna. This is the stage wherein the colours are painted into the outlines. The mural begins to come together, enlivened by the strong hues, each referring to a virtue. At this point, however, the colours are solid and have not been shaded in. This is what happens in the Vartana Karma. Tonality is added to the painting by way of darkening and lightening as required. This gives dimensionality to the art. Next, we come to the fifth stage, namely - Lekha Karma. Here, the outline is decisively finalised, after which the finishing touches are added in the final stage of the Dvika Karma. The mural is brought to life in all of its brilliant glory, and is preserved with resin and oils for a gleaming finish. The artists have depicted each deity differently but one thing which is common is the depiction of large eyes, the prominent ornamentation and its curvy circular art style form.","output":"Kerala Mural Painting stands out for its bright colors, detailed work, and balanced designs.

One is the Fresco style where colours are applied on a slightly wet surface. The one where the colours are used on a dry surface is the dry fresco style. The primary colours used were ochre-yellow, Indian red, blue or indigo, black, green and white. Different deities were shown in different colours. This differentiation was based on the character of each deity as described in the literature. White colour was used to present satvauna (spiritual positive aspect) of the deity. Red colour was used to represent rajoguna (inclination towards power and materialistic wealth). Yellow colour was used to represent both rajoguna and satvaguna. Tamoguna (evil characters) were represented by using black colour. The shades of blue and green colour were used to represent a dharmic (righteous) character. The most prominent peculiarity of murals of Kerala is the process of making the pigments with indigenous colours. Each eye was elaborately decorated with colours. Shading was predominantly done with dots depending on the shading pattern. The backdrop of these paintings was always red in colour. It was then coated as per the required shade and was dotted with a mix of red and brown. Kerala Murals are aesthetic in appearance and also eco-friendly due to the materials used in the various stages of painting. The five fundamental colours used for painting of murals are prepared from the mineral pigments and vegetables like leaves, fruits, stones and ores. The colours are blended in a wooden bowl along with tender coconut water and extracts of the Neem tree. The wall is prepared by application of various coatings for a durable, robust and clear layout, set for painting the mural. The tools and raw materials used for painting of Kerala murals require the following: • Plaster consisting of lime and sand • Water • Extracts (Juice) of Kadukka (Mussels) • Burnt husk • Tender coconut water • Extracts of Neem tree • Turmeric powder • Soot • Acrylic Paints (contemporary painting) • Five colours or Panchvarna used are yellow, red, green, black and white • Wooden bowl for mixing of colours","output":"Kerala Mural Paintings employ two styles, applying colors on wet (Fresco) or dry (dry fresco) surfaces.

Later, the cultural sphere and the Bhakti movements too inspired the painters. A thorough change was noticed with the advent of the Ravi Varma school of thought in the 16th centuary. Raja Ravi Varma combined the Eastern and Western styles with dexterity. The Badami caves in Karnataka carry wall murals created during the reign of Chalukya dynasty. Images found in other caves depict royal and divine figures. Similarly, during the reigns of Pallava, Pandya and Chola dynasties, murals became a standard art form for decorating various temples. Panamalai temple and Kanchipuram temple of Pallavas; Tirumalaipuram and Jain caves at Sithanvasal of the Pandyas were embellished with frescos, depicting humans as well as divine beings. In the Chola period, murals depicting narratives related to Shiva at Nartamalai and Brihadisvara temples were created. The Vijayanagara style of mural paintings in Virupaksha temple, Hampi, depict episodes from Ramayana and Mahabharata, among other themes. Imprints of the Vijayanagara art, can also be seen at Lepakshi, Andhra Pradesh. During the Nayaka period, murals can be found in places like Thiruparakunram and Brihadisvara. During 16th-18th century CE, the distinct tradition of murals flourished in Kerala, drawing cues from Nayaka and Vijayanagara styles, and inspired by performing traditions. As a ritualistic practice, scenes from epics and puranas were painted, as is evident in some temples and palaces. Furthermore, the wall paintings of Wai, Satara, Pune, and Menavali, among other places in Maharashtra, are worth mentioning. In the 19th century, the legacy of mural paintings was carried forth by great masters like Acharya Nandalal Bose. His artistic sensibilities grew under the tutelage of Acharya Abanindranath Thakur, a pioneering figure of the Bengal School of Art, which was a movement aligned with the Swadeshi worldview in response to European academic paintings. In 1970s, many mural paintings in Guruvayur temple were gutted in a fire. After this, on public demand, a Mural training school was started there under the tutelage of Mammiyoor Krishnankutty Nair. The establishment of the school led to the world knowing more about the mural traditions of Kerala.","output":"Initially, Kerala murals were influenced by the region's nature and later by cultural and Bhakti movements.

Aquest preprocessament s’inclour\`a en el c\`alcul del temps de c\`omput de l’algorisme. • En una execuci´o normal, cal indicar obligat\`oriament si es busca una o la millor soluci´o, l’any a auditar, l’import m\`axim que pot assumir un auditor, i el nom del fitxer de dades. El nombre m\`axim d’auditors ´es un par\`ametre opcional (si no s’indica, s´on il·limitats), al igual que les restriccions per tipus I/D i cap´ıtol.

The task is to allocate budget applications (partidas) of a given fiscal year to a team of auditors while following a set of criteria and constraints. The solution has to find the most optimal allocation, with additional functionality such as handling restrictions (like assigning applications only of the same type or chapter to an auditor) and finding the smallest team possible without overburdening any auditor. The software must be developed using backtracking, and the classes \`Solucionador\` (Solver), \`Solucio\` (Solution), and \`Candidats\` (Candidates) as seen in theory lessons. Solutions are to be computed by reading data from a text file using functions from \`eines.h\`, which likely is a custom library provided for the assignment. The summary of requirements includes: - Auditing all budget applications of a given fiscal year. - Allocating applications to auditors without exceeding a given maximum value for each auditor. - Optional constraints to limit allocations by application type (income/expenses - I/D) or chapter. - Using either the exact number of auditors required or the least possible number of auditors while balancing the total import (budget amount) assigned to each auditor, aiming for the smallest standard deviation of assigned amounts. - Processing data from files of a specified fiscal year and only considering lines with a consolidated amount greater than 0. - Displaying the solution with specified details, including the assigned applications, total import, the number of auditors, the standard deviation, and the computation time. The software program, named \`audita\`, is designed to work through the command line with various options and parameters; it should provide help if called without arguments or when providing incorrect input. This is not a real scenario but rather a detailed description of a computer science assignment designed to test students' knowledge of algorithms, backtracking, data processing, and command-line interfacing in a practical context that resembles a real-world application.

A m´es, la gerent d’EdA SL ens indica que, per reduir costos, voldria poder trobar l’equip m´es petit possible per\`o sense sobresaturar cap dels nostres companys auditors. Es ´ a dir, en aquest cas buscar´ıem l’assignaci´o que necessiti el menor nombre d’auditors per\`o, donades dues solucions amb el mateix nombre, triar´ıem l’assignaci´o d’aplicacions que m´es b´e (balancejat) reparteix l’import total als auditors. 1.1 Dades d’entrada Tornarem a tractar amb el mateix tipus de dades sobre els pressupostos de la Gencat que d´ona el CTTI i que s’han fet servir abans en exercicis i pr\`actiques de l’assignatura. 1.2 Resum dels requeriments Si recopilem el m´es rellevant del que s’ha explicat abans: • Hem d’auditar totes les partides (aplicacions) del pressupost d’un any donat • Les aplicacions es repartiran entre auditors • A cada auditor se li poden assignar aplicacions per un import m\`axim donat. Tots els auditors tenen el mateix l´ımit. • Es pot demanar que cada auditor fiscalitzi nom´es (restriccions) aplicacions d’un mateix tipus (I/D) o d’un mateix cap´ıtol. • Es poden fer servir, en principi, tants auditors com calgui, per\`o... – es pot indicar el nombre d’auditors m\`axim a utilitzar, – o es pot demanar buscar la soluci´o amb el m´ınim nombre d’auditors. En aquest cas, entre dues solucions amb el mateix nombre, es prioritzar\`a aquella que tingui l’import total m´es ben repartit entre auditors, ´es a dir, la que tingui la menor desviaci´o est\`andard (veure Equaci´o 1) de l’import assignat als auditors. σ = vuut 1 n Xn i=1 (pi − p) 2 F´ormula de la desviaci´o est\`andard σ, on n ´es el nombre d’auditors, pi ´es l’import agregat de les aplicacions assignades a l’i-\`esim auditor, i p ´es l’import mitj\`a assignat als auditors.","output":"Sembla que estàs explicant una tasca d'algorismia i programació que involucra crear un programa per assignar partides pressupostàries a un equip d'auditors segons certes restriccions i criteris d'optimització. Usen les dades dels pressupostos de la Generalitat de Catalunya proporcionats pel CTTI. A continuació, et faig un resum més estructurat de la tasca a realitzar: # Resum del Problema: Objectiu: Auditar totes les partides (Aplicacions) del pressupost d'un any determinat amb l'equip més petit d'auditors possible, sense sobrepassar un límit màxim d'import assignat per auditor, i amb la restricció que cada auditor només pot revisar aplicacions del mateix tipus o capítol. Dades Entrada: - Llista de partides pressupostàries del pressupost d'un any determinat proporcionades pel CTTI. - Límit màxim d'import que es pot assignar a cada auditor. - Opcional: nombre màxim d'auditors que es poden utilitzar. Requeriments: - Auditar totes les partides pressupostàries (aplicacions). - Repartir les aplicacions entre els auditors respectant el límit màxim d'import per auditor. - Opcionalment, assignar només aplicacions d’un mateix tipus (I/D) o d’un mateix capítol a cada auditor. - Trobar l'equip més petit d'auditors necessari, o dins d'un límit màxim especificat d'auditors. - Si hi ha múltiples solucions amb el mateix nombre d'auditors, prioritzar la que tingui l'import total més ben repartit (menor desviació estàndard σ de l'import assignat als auditors). La fórmula per calcular la desviació estàndard σ és la següent: [ sigma = sqrt{frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} (p_i - bar{p})^2} ] on: - ( n ) és el nombre d'auditors. - ( p_i ) és l'import agregat de les aplicacions assignades a l'audit i-ès. - ( bar{p} ) és l'import mitjana assignada als auditors. # Possibles Passos per Solucionar el Problema: 1. Analitzar les dades pressupostàries i les restriccions (tipo d'aplicació, capítols). 2. Establir un mètode per dividir les partides entre els auditors (per exemple, podria ser útil un algorisme de bin packing o de programació lineal). 3. Implementar un algorisme que assigni les partides als auditors, tot seguint les restriccions i optimitzant per la mínima quantitat d'auditors i/o la repartició més equitativa de l'import. 4. Calcular la desviació estàndard de l'import repartit entre els auditors per cada solució potencial. 5. Trobar la millor solució segons els criteris establerts. 6. Proveir la llista final d'assignments d'auditors, juntament amb el detall del pressupost que revisaran.

Utilitzar el Backtracking per Assignar Aplicacions: - Trobar una assignació d'aplicacions a auditors respectant un límit màxim d'auditors (si s’especifica) i seguint les restriccions. - Informar quan no es pot trobar una solució sota les condicions donades. 2. Trobar la Millor Assignació Amb Backtracking: - L'objectiu és minimitzar el nombre d'auditors. - Prioritzar solucions amb menys desviació estàndard dels imports assignats als auditors. - Informar quan no es pot trobar una solució sota aquestes condicions. # Instruccions per a la Implementació: - Utilitzar les classes \`Solucionador\`, \`Solucio\`, i \`Candidats\` per codificar el backtracking. - Llegir dades d'un fitxer de text amb la informació pressupostària usant les funcions de \`eines.h\`. - Filtrar les línies de pressupost de l'any desitjat i amb import consolidat major que zero. - Només guardar la informació associada a l'aplicació. - Mostrar la solució per sortida estàndard amb l'assignació per a cada auditor, l’import assignat total, el nombre d’auditors, la desviació estàndard dels imports i el temps de càlcul. - Preprocessar les dades si és necessari per optimitzar la cerca amb el backtracking. - El programa principal ha de ser \`audita\` i ha de seguir la interfície de línia de comandes descrita. - Gestionar correctament els errors d'entrada i problemes amb l'obertura del fitxer. # Consideracions Especials: El backtracking és una estratègia d'algorismia que pot ser molt costosa en temps de càlcul, especialment en problemes amb un gran nombre de possibilitats. Per tant: - Comença amb conjunts de dades petits per assegurar que el teu algorisme funciona adequadament. - Optimitza el procés de cerca podant branques de l’arbre de cerca quan sigui clar que no porten a una solució vàlida o òptima. - Prova incrementar gradualment la mida del conjunt de dades per entendre el comportament del programa en situacions més realistes (però estigues preparat per temps d'execució significativament més llargs).

Тема урока “Первые революционные преобразования большевиков”. #Текст из учебника# 1 Первые декреты новой власти. Всероссийский съезд Советов в октябре 1917 г. принял ряд исторических решений. Главные из них — декреты о мире и о земле — были приняты по предложению Ленина. Декрет о мире провозгласил выход России из войны. Съезд обратился ко всем воюющим правительствам и народам с предложением всеобщего демократического мира, т. е. мира без аннексий и контрибуций. Правительствам Германии, Австро-Венгрии и Турции было предложено начать переговоры о заключении перемирия. В основу Декрета о земле были положены крестьянские наказы, направленные сразу после свержения монархии в адрес I Всероссийского съезда крестьянских депутатов. В них крестьяне требовали отмены частной собственности на землю и установления уравнительного землепользования. Эти требования были частью программы партии эсеров, а не большевиков. Но Ленин прекрасно понимал, что новая власть прежде всего должна удовлетворить чаяния большинства населения по вопросам земли и мира. Из декрета СНК о печати (27 октября 1917 г.) «Всякий знает, что буржуазная пресса есть одно из могущественнейших оружий буржуазии. Особенно в критический момент, когда новая власть, власть рабочих и крестьян, только упрочивается, невозможно было целиком оставить это оружие в руках врага в то время, как оно не менее опасно в такие минуты, чем бомбы и пулемёты. Закрытию подлежат лишь органы прессы: 1) призывающие к открытому сопротивлению или неповиновению Рабочему и Крестьянскому правительству; 2) сеющие смуту путём явно клеветнического извращения фактов». ⬤ Почему большевики издали такой декрет о печати? 2(15) ноября 1917 г. была опубликована Декларация прав народов России, провозгласившая равенство народов и их право на самоопределение — т. е. образование самостоятельного государства. Отменялись все национальные и религиозные ограничения. Декретом об уничтожении сословий и гражданских чинов отменялось деление общества на сословия дворян, купцов, крестьян, мещан, отменялись княжеские, графские и иные титулы, гражданские чины. Для всего населения устанавливалось одно наименование — гражданин Российской Советской Республики. Были уравнены в гражданских правах мужчины и женщины. 66 ГЛАВА I В январе 1918 г. издан декрет об отделении Церкви от государства и школы от Церкви. Был осуществлён переход на григорианский календарь — 1 февраля 1918 г. стало 14-м. С начала 1918 г. стало повсеместно использоваться новое правописание русского языка: из алфавита исключались три буквы (i десятеричное, фита и ять), менялись правила написания некоторых приставок и окончаний. ⬤ 1. Охарактеризуйте основные преобразования большевиков осенью 1917 — зимой 1918 г. 2. Как вы считаете, эти меры позволили решить основные проблемы страны? Свою позицию объясните. 2 Учредительное собрание. Идея Учредительного собрания была очень популярна среди всех партий и организаций после свержения монархии в феврале 1917 г. Большевики тоже никогда не выступали против его созыва. Выборы прошли в ноябре — в срок, назначенный ещё Временным правительством. Итоги выборов были предсказуемы: большинство крестьян выбирали своими делегатами представителей партии эсеров, большевики получили около 22% голосов. Ленин (Ульянов) Владимир Ильич (1870—1924) Родился в Симбирске (ныне Ульяновск) в семье действительного статского советника И. Ульянова. Окончил экстерном юридический факультет Санкт-Петербургского университета. Вместе с будущим лидером меньшевиков-интернационалистов Ю. Мартовым основал марксистский кружок «Союз борьбы за освобождение рабочего класса». Был арестован и сослан на три года в Восточную Сибирь. После ссылки выехал за границу по подложному заграничному паспорту на фамилию «Ленин», которая стала его партийным псевдонимом. С небольшим перерывом провёл в эмиграции 17 лет. Проявив политическую волю и незаурядную интуицию, умение организовать и вести за собой людей, способность убеждать, Ленин возглавил приход к власти большевиков в октябре 1917 г. В качестве главы первого правительства Советской России играл главную роль в формировании нового госаппарата, выработке и принятии всех важнейших решений в области внутренней и внешней политики. Настоял на разгоне Учредительного собрания, заключении Брестского мира с Германией, введении продовольственной диктатуры. Считал оправданным «революционное насилие» в отношении всех противников нового строя. В 1918 г. был тяжело ранен в результате покушения, организованного эсерами-террористами. Последствия ранения привели к тяжёлой болезни, из-за которой Ленин с 1922 г. фактически утратил решающее влияние в партии и государстве. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 67 Первое заседание Учредительного собрания в Таврическом дворце Петрограда 5(18) января 1918 г. стало и последним. Председателем был избран лидер правых эсеров, бывший министр земледелия Временного правительства В. Чернов. Лидеры эсеров и меньшевиков полагали, что теперь им удастся оттеснить большевиков от власти и сформировать собственное правительство. По­этому Учредительное собрание отклонило подготовленную Лениным Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа как основу будущей конституции страны и отказались утвердить принятые с октября 1917 г. декреты Совнаркома. Однако большевики и левые эсеры не собирались уступать. Они покинули заседание, которое продолжалось далеко за полночь. В 4 ч 40 мин утра его прервал начальник охраны матрос-анархист А. Железняков, произнёсший ставшие легендарными слова: «Караул устал». Ночью ВЦИК Советов принял решение о роспуске Учредительного собрания. Возле Таврического дворца была выставлена охрана, не пустившая туда депутатов. Демонстрации в поддержку собрания были разогнаны с применением вооружённой силы. Большая часть жителей России восприняла это событие спокойно. Но многие депутаты Учредительного собрания, прежде всего правые эсеры, решили продолжить борьбу и присоединиться к тем, кто готовился бороться с новой властью с помощью оружия. Летом 1918 г., после восстания Чехословацкого корпуса, им удалось организовать антибольшевистское восстание в Самаре.

Эта картина была написана художником в 1920 г. По легенде, спустя некоторое время к нему в мастерскую пришёл Фёдор Шаляпин (тот писал его портрет). Увидев картину, певец содрогнулся и произнёс: «Ну, пора уезжать?» ⬤ Как вы думаете, какую идею выражает данная картина? Почему она так называется? антибольшевистское правительство, которое объявило себя верховной властью и приступило к формированию Народной армии (см. § 8). ⬤ 1. Почему большинство членов Учредительного собрания отказались утвердить декреты Совнаркома? 2. Что побудило большевиков пойти на роспуск Учредительного собрания? 3 Организация власти Советов. Полномочия Учредительного собрания взял на себя III Всероссийский съезд Советов рабочих и солдатских депутатов, который открылся спустя три дня после роспуска Учредительного собрания. К нему присоединились делегаты III Всероссийского съезда Советов крестьянских депутатов. Объединённый съезд одобрил Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа, объявил Россию Советской Федеративной Социалистической Республикой (РСФСР) и поручил ВЦИК разработать Конституцию. В состав ВЦИК, кроме большевиков и левых эсеров, вошло несколько представителей других партий. Большое значение придавалось созданию системы Советов на местах. Им были переданы управленческие функции земских учреждений, декларировалась их полная автономность «в вопросах местного характера». Однако подчёркивалось, что местные Советы сообразуют свою деятельность с общими декретами и постановлениями высших советских организаций, в состав которых они входят. Впоследствии в условиях Гражданской войны роль Советов во многом подменялась чрезвычайными органами: местными чрезвычайными комиссиями (ЧК), комитетами бедноты (комбедами), революционными комитетами (ревкомами). ⬤ 1. Зачем большевикам понадобилось созывать III съезд Советов почти сразу после роспуска Учредительного собрания? 2. Какие функции выполняли Советы? § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 69 «Первые дни Октября. Красногвардейский дозор». Художник Г. Савицкий. 1949 г. В сборнике «Великие дни. Рассказы о революции» так описывались эти дни: «Тихо стало в богатых кварталах Петрограда. Побеждённая буржуазия боится выйти на улицу, со страхом и ненавистью смотрит она». ⬤ Из кого состояли первые отряды красногвардейцев? 4 Создание новой армии и спецслужбы. Новое государство нуждалось и в новой армии. Декрет Совнаркома провозгласил создание Рабоче-крестьянской Красной Армии (РККА). Вскоре был образован Красный Флот (РККФ). Применявшийся поначалу добровольческий принцип комплектования РККА приводил к сложностям в управлении войсками, что пагубным образом отражалось на её боеспособности и дисциплине. Кроме того, обеспечить быстрый рост численности армии на добровольной основе оказалось невозможно. Когда Германия нарушила перемирие и начала новое наступление на фронте, оказалось, что сдерживать его некому: самочинная демобилизация, начатая по решениям солдатских комитетов после Декрета о мире, привела к полному развалу армии. К тому же ширился размах антибольшевистских выступлений в регионах страны. Поэтому Совнаркому пришлось вернуться к всеобщей воинской повинности мужского населения в возрасте от 18 до 40 лет. В течение лета—осени 1918 г. в ряды РККА было мобилизовано 300 тыс. человек. В 1920 г. число красноармейцев превысило 5 млн. Большое внимание уделялось формированию командных кадров. В 1917—1919 гг., помимо краткосрочных курсов и школ для подготовки среднего командного звена, были открыты высшие военные учебные заведения. В марте 1918 г. опубликовано извещение о привлечении на службу военных специалистов (военспецов) царской армии. К 1 января 1919 г. ряды Красной Армии пополнили более чем 70 тыс. бывших офицеров русской императорской армии. Для контроля над ними в апреле 1918 г. в войсках и на флоте был введён институт военных комиссаров, которые должны 70 ГЛАВА I были также осуществлять «политическое воспитание» красноармейцев. В сентябре 1918 г. была создана единая структура управления войсками фронтов и армий. Во главе каждого фронта (армии) назначался Революционный военный совет (Реввоенсовет, или РВС), состоявший из командующего и двух комиссаров. Возглавлял все военные учреждения Реввоенсовет республики во главе с Л. Троцким, который занял пост наркома по военным и морским делам. Были приняты меры по ужесточению дисциплины. Представители Реввоенсовета, наделённые чрезвычайными полномочиями (вплоть до расстрела изменников и трусов без суда), выезжали на самые напряжённые участки фронта. В ноябре 1918 г. был образован Совет рабочей и крестьянской обороны во главе с В. Лениным, сосредоточивший в своих руках всю полноту государственной власти. В первые недели после взятия власти большевики столкнулись с массовым бойкотом (забастовкой) государственных, банковских и других служащих. Новым советским министрам (теперь — народным комиссарам, наркомам) приходилось силой взламывать покинутые чиновниками здания и кабинеты. 7(20) декабря 1917 г. была создана Всероссийская чрезвычайная комиссия по борьбе с контрреволюцией и саботажем (ВЧК). Возглавил ВЧК Ф. Дзержинский. Первой задачей комиссии была борьба с саботажем госслужащих. Позднее основными направлениями деятельности чекистов стали пресечение любых действий контрреволюции, предание суду революционного трибунала саботажников и контрреволюционеров, выработка системных мер борьбы с ними. Дзержинский Феликс Эдмундович (1877—1926) Участник революционной борьбы, шесть раз был арестован и трижды бежал, стоял у истоков Красной гвардии. Одновременно с созданием и руководством первой советской спецслужбой (ВЧК) был наркомом путей сообщения, главой комиссии по детской беспризорности, председателем созданного им спортивного общества «Динамо», с 1924 г. — председатель главного органа управления экономикой страны — ВСНХ. Сыграл огромную роль не только в борьбе с контрреволюцией, но и в создании системы профессионального образования, восстановлении железных дорог и всего народного хозяйства. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 71 За столом переговоров при подписании Брестского мира. Брест-Литовск, 1918 г. В августе 1918 г. было заключено дополнительное соглашение, по которому советское правительство обязывалось выплатить Германии огромную контрибуцию. Её часть была выплачена до аннулирования Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г. ⬤ 1. На каких принципах формировалась РККА? Почему большевикам удалось быстро организовать боеспособную армию? 2. Какие задачи возлагались на ВЧК? 5 Брестский мир. Вопрос о войне оставался одним из самых болезненных. В ноябре 1917 г. Л. Троцкий, назначенный народным комиссаром по иностранным делам, обратился к правительствам всех воюющих держав с предложением о заключении всеобщего демократического мира. Согласие на переговоры было получено только от воюющих с Россией государств. Переговоры начались в г. Брест-Литовске, где находилась ставка командования германскими войсками на Восточном фронте, и привели к заключению 2 декабря 1917 г. перемирия. Однако после отказа стран Антанты присоединиться к переговорам Германия отвергла идею заключения мира «без аннексий и контрибуций» и выдвинула требование признать за ней оккупированные территории Польши, Прибалтики и других частей бывшей Российской империи. Германия планировала установить протекторат над правобережьем Днепра. После событий октября 1917 г. в Петрограде Украинская Центральная рада (ЦР) отказалась признать переход власти к Советам. Восстание рабочих киевских заводов было подавлено частями «самостийников» под командованием С. Петлюры. Но отряды Красной гвардии приближались к Киеву. Чтобы сохранить свою власть, ЦР провозгласила создание Украинской народной республики (УНР) и в обмен на военную помощь против большевиков обязалась поставить Германии и Австро-Венгрии миллион тонн зерна, а также другое продовольствие и сырьё. Чтобы обеспечить себе «право» на захват Украины, германское командование подписало с представителями 72 ГЛАВА I УНР сепаратный мирный договор на следующий день после того, как отряды Красной гвардии заняли Киев. Германские требования и подготовка вторжения для помощи «независимой Украине» вызвали конфликт среди руководителей большевиков. Все они всерьёз рассчитывали, что в уставших от войны европейских странах тоже вот-вот должна начаться революция. Постепенно расширяясь, революционное движение охватит весь мир («мировая революция»). Поэтому отказ России от мира с Германией, демонстрация готовности вести «революционную войну» и обращение за помощью к «мировому пролетариату» подстегнёт революционное движение в других странах. Особенно активно эту точку зрения отстаивали Н. Бухарин, Ф. Дзержинский и Л. Троцкий. Подписание мира с Германией, считали они, — это отказ от мировой революции. Данную позицию поддержали левые эсеры. Ленин же настаивал на немедленном заключении мира. Чтобы убедить других членов ЦК, ему пришлось даже угрожать отставкой с поста главы правительства. Ленина поддержал Сталин, заявив, что «революционного движения на Западе нет, а есть только потенция, а с потенцией мы не можем считаться». В итоге, чтобы избежать раскола в руководстве партии, большинством голосов было решено просто затягивать переговоры, отказываясь от подписания мира на немецких условиях. Суть компромисса сформулировал Троцкий в лозунге «Ни мира, ни войны». При этом демобилизация армии должна была продолжаться. В это же время был принят декрет ВЦИК (его возглавлял Я. Свердлов) об аннулировании всех прежних долгов России перед иностранными государствами. Однако совсем скоро большевикам пришлось признать правоту своего лидера: после отказа заключить мир немцы и австрийцы начали новое наступление. Не встречая серьёзного сопротивления, их армии двинулись к Киеву и Одессе, а на северо-западе — к Пскову. Советское правительство немедленно запросило мира. Новый германский ультиматум, полученный 23 февраля, содержал гораздо более тяжёлые условия. Под давлением Ленина большинство членов ЦК проголосовали за немедленное принятие этих условий. Мирный договор был подписан 3 марта 1918 г. в БрестЛитовске. По его условиям Российское правительство обязывалось признать УНР независимым государством, а также не претендовать на Прибалтику: здесь немцы тоже планировали создать подконтрольные им государственные образования (сразу после § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 73 подписания мира было объявлено о восстановлении Герцогства Курляндского, а осенью провозглашено создание Балтийского герцогства). В результате в сферу влияния Германии попадала территория площадью свыше 1 млн кв. км и с населением более 50 млн человек. Кроме того, Россия должна была уступить Турции в Закавказье города Ардаган, Батум и Карс с округами. Эти уступки дополнялись обязательством демобилизовать армию и разоружить флот. Вскоре после заключения мира левые эсеры в знак протеста вышли из состава правительства. О своей оппозиционности этому решению ЦК заявили также многие большевики. Лидером этой группы, которую стали называть «левыми коммунистами», был Н. Бухарин. Они считали, что Брестский договор означает отказ от продолжения «русской и международной революции», и требовали либо аннулировать его, либо развернуть партизанскую борьбу на оккупированных Германией территориях. РСФСР отказалась соблюдать условия Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г., сразу после революции в Германии и её капитуляции. ⬤ 1.

На каких условиях был заключён мир с Германией? Какова была, на ваш взгляд, необходимость заключения такого договора? Свой ответ аргументируйте. 6 Первая Конституция России 1918 г. В июле 1918 г. собрался V Всероссийский съезд Советов. Главным итогом его работы стало принятие первой в истории России Конституции 1918 г. Она объявляла государственную власть принадлежащей «трудовому народу» — рабочим и беднейшей части крестьянства. Закреплялось федеративное устройство страны и её название — Российская Социалистическая Федеративная Советская Республика (РСФСР), был утверждён новый государственный флаг и герб. Высшим органом власти признавался Всероссийский съезд Советов, а в период между созывами съездов — избранный им ВЦИК. Он имел право отменить или приостановить решение правительства — Совнаркома (СНК). Конституция перечисляла основные права и обязанности граждан. Все были обязаны трудиться, охранять завоевания революции, защищать Отечество. Выборы в органы власти не были прямыми для сельского населения: сельские Советы выбирали депутатов на волостные и уезд­ 74 ГЛАВА I ные съезды, которые затем посылали депутатов на областные и губернские, а уже те — на Всероссийский съезд. Избирательного права лишались лица, прибегавшие к наёмному труду или живущие на «нетрудовой доход»: прежде всего, имелись в виду «капиталисты» (предприниматели), в том числе частные торговцы.

I get how they get ip addresses as anyone with a brain could buy an ip block but how do they actually get their internet access?","output":"Bulletproof hosting services, especially those that engage in hosting illegal content or services, operate by finding Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that are either willing to turn a blind eye to their activities or are themselves operating in jurisdictions with lax law enforcement and regulatory oversight. Here is how they may go about securing their Internet access: 1. **Establishment in Lenient Jurisdictions:** Bulletproof hosts often set up operations in countries with weak or ill-enforced cyber laws. In these locations, authorities may not be proactive in monitoring or shutting down these services. 2. **Use of Multiple ISPs:** To diversify their risk, bulletproof hosts may contract with multiple ISPs across different countries. This can make tracing them and taking them down more complex and time-consuming. 3. **Reseller Relationships:** They might form reseller or intermediary agreements with larger hosts or ISPs, effectively reselling or leasing their services under a different name. This method can mask the true nature of the services being offered. 4. **Peer Arrangements:** In some cases, bulletproof hosts may form peering relationships with other networks, allowing them to exchange traffic directly without relying on a traditional ISP. 5. **Using Middlemen or Brokers:** They may use middlemen or brokers to purchase bandwidth and infrastructure. This creates a buffer between the bulletproof host and the service provider and can make it harder for law enforcement to track the source of the illegal activities. 6. **Private Connectivity:** Sometimes, bulletproof hosts may use private connectivity solutions such as dedicated lines obtained from providers that might not be strict about enforcing regulations, especially if the business is financially worthwhile for them. 7. **ISPs with Lax Policies:** They seek out ISPs that either do not care about the type of traffic they carry or are actively complicit in ignoring it, provided the payments are made for their services. 8. **Proxy Networks:** The use of VPNs, Tor, and proxy services to obscure the origin of their traffic. It's important to note that while it is technically possible for bulletproof hosts to acquire Internet access, it is not without risks. Law enforcement agencies around the world are increasingly collaborating to shut down these operations. The providers themselves or the upstream ISPs may face pressure to cease the provision of services to such hosts if they are found to contravene local or international laws. Furthermore, regulatory bodies are continuously working to close down loopholes that bulletproof hosts exploit to maintain their operations."},{"instruction":"No dispositivo Android oque é : forçar renderização da gpu","output":"Em dispositivos Android, a opção \\"Forçar renderização da GPU\\" é uma configuração de desenvolvedor que obriga o sistema operacional a usar a unidade de processamento gráfico (GPU) para desenhar todas as interfaces de usuário que normalmente seriam processadas pelo processador central (CPU). Esta opção está geralmente desativada por padrão e pode ser encontrada dentro das \\"Opções do desenvolvedor\\" nas configurações do sistema. Quando você \\"força a renderização da GPU\\", todos os elementos da interface do usuário, incluindo transições, animações e a renderização de aplicativos, são tratados pelo GPU. Isso pode ser útil em algumas circunstâncias para diagnosticar problemas de desempenho ou para melhorar a suavidade das animações em dispositivos com GPUs poderosas mas CPUs menos potentes. No entanto, forçar a renderização por GPU não é uma panaceia e pode até mesmo causar uma diminuição do desempenho ou afetar negativamente a duração da bateria em certos dispositivos ou aplicativos, pois a GPU pode consumir mais energia do que a CPU para tarefas de renderização. Para acessar a opção \\"Forçar renderização da GPU\\", você precisa primeiro ativar as \\"Opções do desenvolvedor\\", que geralmente estão ocultas por padrão. Aqui está como você pode fazer isso na maioria dos dispositivos Android: 1. Vá para as \\"Configurações\\" do seu dispositivo. 2. Role para baixo e selecione \\"Sobre o telefone\\" ou algo semelhante (pode variar dependendo do fabricante). 3. Encontre a opção \\"Número da compilação\\" ou \\"Número da versão\\" e toque nela repetidamente até receber uma mensagem informando que as \\"Opções do desenvolvedor\\" estão ativadas. 4.

Dentro das \\"Opções do desenvolvedor\\", procure pela opção \\"Forçar renderização da GPU\\" e ative-a. Uma vez ativada, todas as operações de desenho da interface do usuário serão processadas pela GPU. Lembre-se de que essa é uma opção de depuração e é mais útil para desenvolvedores ou usuários avançados que sabem como essa configuração pode afetar o comportamento do dispositivo.

Essas mensagens de log são usadas para depuração e podem incluir informações sobre o funcionamento de um app, eventos do sistema, erros, avisos e outros dados relevantes para desenvolvedores. Um buffer de log é basicamente uma área de armazenamento temporário onde os logs são mantidos até que possam ser lidos ou até que o espaço seja necessário para novos logs. Ajustar o tamanho do buffer de log permite controlar a quantidade de dados de log que podem ser armazenados. Se você escolher um buffer maior, poderá armazenar mais mensagens de log para análise. Contudo, isso também pode significar que mais armazenamento do sistema será usado para reter essas informações de log, o que geralmente não é problemático mas é algo para se estar ciente, especialmente em dispositivos com armazenamento limitado. Aumentar o tamanho do buffer de log pode ser útil para desenvolvedores que precisam capturar e revisar um histórico mais longo de eventos de log para diagnosticar problemas ou comportamentos anômalos que ocorrem durante a execução de aplicativos. Em contrapartida, um valor menor pode ser apropriado quando um volume menor de dados é suficiente ou quando se quer limitar o uso de recursos do dispositivo.

La nostra empresa, Empresa d’Auditories S.L. (EdA SL, en curt), ha rebut l’enc\`arrec de fiscalitzar els comptes i la gerent de l’empresa ens ha demanat al servei inform\`atic crear un programa per dimensionar l’equip d’auditors que participar\`a en aquesta feina.

(EdA SL). Heu d'elaborar un programa que pugui: 1. Repartir totes les partides pressupostàries entre un conjunt d'auditors. 2. Assegurar que cada auditor revisi només partides d'un mateix tipus (I/D) o capítol. 3. Limitar l'import que cada auditor pot auditar, tot mantenint aquest límit uniforme per a tots els auditors. 4. Minimitzar el nombre d'auditors usats per a l'auditoria, però només si això no resulta en una sobrecàrrega del treball per als auditors involucrats. 5. Buscar una distribució de treball entre els auditors que minimise la variació o desviació estàndard de l'import assignat a cada auditor. Aquests requeriments implica que el programa ha de ser capaç de processar les dades del pressupost, identificar les \\"aplicacions\\" o partides a ser auditades, i distribuir aquestes eficientment entre els auditors disponibles. La desviació estàndard (( sigma )) és una mesura estadística que indica com estan distribuïdes les quantitats al voltant de la mitjana, i en aquest context, ajudarà a assegurar que el treball està distribuït de manera equitativa. Per complir amb aquests requeriments, probablement necessiteu desenvolupar un algoritme o aplicar mètodes d'optimització i repartiment de càrregues de treball. Un enfocament podria ser la implementació de tècniques d'optimització combinatòria o d'algoritmes heurístics, com ara programació lineal, algoritmes genètics o cerca amb algoritmes de backtracking, depenent de la naturalesa exacta del problema i les restriccions involucrades. Addicionalment, el programa haurà de ser capaç de llegir i gestionar un conjunt de dades proporcionat pel CTTI o una estructura similar que contingui les partides pressupostàries. La part \\"Dades d'entrada\\" es refereix a com el programa haurà d'interactuar amb les dades disponibles, presumiblement en un format específic que ha estat utilitzat en exercicis o pràctiques previs en el marc de l'assignatura referida. Tot això haurà de ser pres en compte en el desenvolupament del software d'auditoria. Cal tenir en compte que això és un resum generalitzat basat en la informació proporcionada en la descripció, i el desenvolupament específic podria requerir una comprensió més profunda tant dels requeriments com de les dades disponibles."},{"instruction":"2 Feina a fer 1. Fent servir backtracking, trobar una assignaci´o d’aplicacions a auditors que no superi el nombre m\`axim donat (si s’indica) i que compleixi les restriccions establertes.

Igualment, si no ´es possible trobar una assignaci´o amb aquestes condicions, s’informar\`a que no hi ha soluci´o. 2.1 Instruccions • Cal codificar el backtracking utilitzant les classes vistes a teoria: Solucionador, Solucio i Candidats. • Les dades es llegiran d’un fitxer de tipus text que contindr\`a les dades de pressupostos que ja coneixeu fent servir les funcions d’eines.h. • Ens quedarem amb les l´ınies del pressupost de l’any indicat per l’usuari amb un import consolidat m´es gran que 0.

Aquest preprocessament s’inclour\`a en el c\`alcul del temps de c\`omput de l’algorisme. • En una execuci´o normal, cal indicar obligat\`oriament si es busca una o la millor soluci´o, l’any a auditar, l’import m\`axim que pot assumir un auditor, i el nom del fitxer de dades. El nombre m\`axim d’auditors ´es un par\`ametre opcional (si no s’indica, s´on il·limitats), al igual que les restriccions per tipus I/D i cap´ıtol. Per saber com indicar aquests par\`ametres, es pot consultar l’ajuda del programa (veure exemple m´es avall). • Per fer les proves, cal comen¸car amb poques l´ınies amb imports ben dimensionats (pel que fa al m\`axim que se li podr\`a assignar a un auditor), i anar-ho incrementant de mica en mica (el temps d’execuci´o es disparar\`a!).","output":"**Resposta en català:** Aquesta secció detalla la feina específica que s'espera es realitzi en el marc del projecte d'auditoria descrit anteriorment. Es poden destacar dos objectius principals, tots dos basats en l'ús de backtracking, una tècnica d'algorísmica per resoldre problemes de cerca i optimització: 1. Utilitzant backtracking, es busca trobar una assignació d'aplicacions a auditors que no excedeixi un màxim nombre establert d'auditors (si això s'ha especificat), i que respecti les restriccions definides. Si no es pot trobar cap assignació que compleixi amb aquestes condicions, el programa ha d'informar que no s'ha trobat cap solució. 2. També mitjançant backtracking, es busca trobar la \\"millor\\" assignació possible, on \\"millor\\" es defineix com aquella que minimitzi primer el nombre d'auditors i, en cas d'empat, la que posseeixi la menor desviació estàndard en l'assignació d'imports. Si no es troba cap assignació possible sota aquestes condicions, el programa ha de comunicar que no hi ha solució. Algunes instruccions detallades per la implementació inclouen: - La necessitat de construir el backtracking utilitzant classes com Solucionador, Solucio i Candidats, presumiblement ensenyades en el marc de la teoria. - Lectura de dades de fitxers de text usant funcions específiques d'un arxiu \`eines.h\`. - Filtrat de dades per assegurar-se que només es tracten línies de l'any seleccionat per l'usuari amb un import consolidat més gran que zero. - Les dades preprocessades abans de començar el backtracking poden ajudar a podar eficaçment les branques de l'arbre de possibilitats. Aquest preprocessament compta dins del temps computacional mesurat. - A l'hora d'executar el programa, hi ha paràmetres obligatoris: indicar si es busca una solució o la millor, l'any que s'ha d'auditar, l'import màxim per auditor i el nom del fitxer de dades. El nombre màxim d'auditors i les restriccions per tipus o capítol són opcionals. - Es recomana començar les proves amb conjunts de dades petits i anar augmentant progressivament la mida, ja que es preveu un gran augment en el temps d'execució amb dades més substancials. - La solució calculada s'ha de mostrar a través de la sortida estàndard, incloent la distribució d'aplicacions per auditor, imports agregats, nombre total d'auditors, desviació estàndard dels imports assignats, i el temps invertit en trobar la solució. Aquest tipus de projecte requereix una comprensió sòlida de l'algorísmia, sobretot en tècniques de backtracking, i una bona gestió de les dades i estructura del codi. És important utilitzar bones pràctiques de desenvolupament de software que permetin experimentar fàcilment amb diferents configuracions i conjunts de dades, així com la possibilitat de depurar i millorar l'algorisme mentre es treballa per optimitzar la seva eficiència."},{"instruction":"• El programa principal s’ha d’anomenar audita i ha de funcionar a trav´es de l’int\`erpret de comandes tal com es descriu a continuaci´o: – Si es crida sense par\`ametres, ha d’emetre un missatge indicant com demanar ajuda. 1 ./audita 2 Falten arguments (\\"./audita --help\\" per ajuda) – Si es demana ajuda, ha de descriure el seu funcionament. 1 ./audita --help 2 Utilitzaci´o: ./audita opcio fitxer 3 4 opcio pot ser: 5 -h, --help mostra aquest missatge d'ajuda i surt 6 -u cerca una soluci´o qualsevol que compleixi les","output":"Per satisfer les especificacions donades, caldrà implementar el programa \`audita\` de manera que es comporti conforme als arguments passats a través de la línia de comandes.

However, it is important to note that the usage of the swastika symbol in this context does not involve any associations with its historical connotations or any political or ideological meanings. In astrophysics, supernovae are extremely energetic and luminous explosions that occur at the end of a star's life cycle. They can occur through various mechanisms, usually resulting from the collapse of a massive star or the thermonuclear ignition of a white dwarf. A swastika-shaped supernova is a rare occurrence where the ejected material from the explosion takes on a shape resembling a swastika when observed from certain angles. This shape is caused by the complex interaction between the explosive energy released during the supernova and the surrounding interstellar medium. Several factors can influence the formation of such a shape, including the presence of a nearby companion star, the orientation of the rotating star, and the surrounding magnetic fields. These factors can shape and warp the expanding stellar material into various patterns, including the swastika shape. The optical appearance of a swastika-shaped supernova can provide valuable insights into the explosion's dynamics, the nature of its progenitor star, and the characteristics of the surrounding environment.

Тема урока “Первые революционные преобразования большевиков”. #Текст из учебника# 1 Первые декреты новой власти. Всероссийский съезд Советов в октябре 1917 г. принял ряд исторических решений. Главные из них — декреты о мире и о земле — были приняты по предложению Ленина. Декрет о мире провозгласил выход России из войны. Съезд обратился ко всем воюющим правительствам и народам с предложением всеобщего демократического мира, т. е. мира без аннексий и контрибуций. Правительствам Германии, Австро-Венгрии и Турции было предложено начать переговоры о заключении перемирия. В основу Декрета о земле были положены крестьянские наказы, направленные сразу после свержения монархии в адрес I Всероссийского съезда крестьянских депутатов. В них крестьяне требовали отмены частной собственности на землю и установления уравнительного землепользования. Эти требования были частью программы партии эсеров, а не большевиков. Но Ленин прекрасно понимал, что новая власть прежде всего должна удовлетворить чаяния большинства населения по вопросам земли и мира. Из декрета СНК о печати (27 октября 1917 г.) «Всякий знает, что буржуазная пресса есть одно из могущественнейших оружий буржуазии. Особенно в критический момент, когда новая власть, власть рабочих и крестьян, только упрочивается, невозможно было целиком оставить это оружие в руках врага в то время, как оно не менее опасно в такие минуты, чем бомбы и пулемёты. Закрытию подлежат лишь органы прессы: 1) призывающие к открытому сопротивлению или неповиновению Рабочему и Крестьянскому правительству; 2) сеющие смуту путём явно клеветнического извращения фактов». ⬤ Почему большевики издали такой декрет о печати? 2(15) ноября 1917 г. была опубликована Декларация прав народов России, провозгласившая равенство народов и их право на самоопределение — т. е. образование самостоятельного государства. Отменялись все национальные и религиозные ограничения. Декретом об уничтожении сословий и гражданских чинов отменялось деление общества на сословия дворян, купцов, крестьян, мещан, отменялись княжеские, графские и иные титулы, гражданские чины. Для всего населения устанавливалось одно наименование — гражданин Российской Советской Республики. Были уравнены в гражданских правах мужчины и женщины. 66 ГЛАВА I В январе 1918 г. издан декрет об отделении Церкви от государства и школы от Церкви. Был осуществлён переход на григорианский календарь — 1 февраля 1918 г. стало 14-м. С начала 1918 г. стало повсеместно использоваться новое правописание русского языка: из алфавита исключались три буквы (i десятеричное, фита и ять), менялись правила написания некоторых приставок и окончаний. ⬤ 1. Охарактеризуйте основные преобразования большевиков осенью 1917 — зимой 1918 г. 2. Как вы считаете, эти меры позволили решить основные проблемы страны? Свою позицию объясните. 2 Учредительное собрание. Идея Учредительного собрания была очень популярна среди всех партий и организаций после свержения монархии в феврале 1917 г. Большевики тоже никогда не выступали против его созыва. Выборы прошли в ноябре — в срок, назначенный ещё Временным правительством. Итоги выборов были предсказуемы: большинство крестьян выбирали своими делегатами представителей партии эсеров, большевики получили около 22% голосов. Ленин (Ульянов) Владимир Ильич (1870—1924) Родился в Симбирске (ныне Ульяновск) в семье действительного статского советника И. Ульянова. Окончил экстерном юридический факультет Санкт-Петербургского университета. Вместе с будущим лидером меньшевиков-интернационалистов Ю. Мартовым основал марксистский кружок «Союз борьбы за освобождение рабочего класса». Был арестован и сослан на три года в Восточную Сибирь. После ссылки выехал за границу по подложному заграничному паспорту на фамилию «Ленин», которая стала его партийным псевдонимом. С небольшим перерывом провёл в эмиграции 17 лет. Проявив политическую волю и незаурядную интуицию, умение организовать и вести за собой людей, способность убеждать, Ленин возглавил приход к власти большевиков в октябре 1917 г. В качестве главы первого правительства Советской России играл главную роль в формировании нового госаппарата, выработке и принятии всех важнейших решений в области внутренней и внешней политики. Настоял на разгоне Учредительного собрания, заключении Брестского мира с Германией, введении продовольственной диктатуры. Считал оправданным «революционное насилие» в отношении всех противников нового строя. В 1918 г. был тяжело ранен в результате покушения, организованного эсерами-террористами. Последствия ранения привели к тяжёлой болезни, из-за которой Ленин с 1922 г. фактически утратил решающее влияние в партии и государстве. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 67 Первое заседание Учредительного собрания в Таврическом дворце Петрограда 5(18) января 1918 г. стало и последним. Председателем был избран лидер правых эсеров, бывший министр земледелия Временного правительства В. Чернов. Лидеры эсеров и меньшевиков полагали, что теперь им удастся оттеснить большевиков от власти и сформировать собственное правительство. По­этому Учредительное собрание отклонило подготовленную Лениным Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа как основу будущей конституции страны и отказались утвердить принятые с октября 1917 г. декреты Совнаркома. Однако большевики и левые эсеры не собирались уступать. Они покинули заседание, которое продолжалось далеко за полночь. В 4 ч 40 мин утра его прервал начальник охраны матрос-анархист А. Железняков, произнёсший ставшие легендарными слова: «Караул устал». Ночью ВЦИК Советов принял решение о роспуске Учредительного собрания. Возле Таврического дворца была выставлена охрана, не пустившая туда депутатов. Демонстрации в поддержку собрания были разогнаны с применением вооружённой силы. Большая часть жителей России восприняла это событие спокойно. Но многие депутаты Учредительного собрания, прежде всего правые эсеры, решили продолжить борьбу и присоединиться к тем, кто готовился бороться с новой властью с помощью оружия. Летом 1918 г., после восстания Чехословацкого корпуса, им удалось организовать антибольшевистское восстание в Самаре.

Эта картина была написана художником в 1920 г. По легенде, спустя некоторое время к нему в мастерскую пришёл Фёдор Шаляпин (тот писал его портрет). Увидев картину, певец содрогнулся и произнёс: «Ну, пора уезжать?» ⬤ Как вы думаете, какую идею выражает данная картина? Почему она так называется? антибольшевистское правительство, которое объявило себя верховной властью и приступило к формированию Народной армии (см. § 8). ⬤ 1. Почему большинство членов Учредительного собрания отказались утвердить декреты Совнаркома? 2. Что побудило большевиков пойти на роспуск Учредительного собрания? 3 Организация власти Советов. Полномочия Учредительного собрания взял на себя III Всероссийский съезд Советов рабочих и солдатских депутатов, который открылся спустя три дня после роспуска Учредительного собрания. К нему присоединились делегаты III Всероссийского съезда Советов крестьянских депутатов. Объединённый съезд одобрил Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа, объявил Россию Советской Федеративной Социалистической Республикой (РСФСР) и поручил ВЦИК разработать Конституцию. В состав ВЦИК, кроме большевиков и левых эсеров, вошло несколько представителей других партий. Большое значение придавалось созданию системы Советов на местах. Им были переданы управленческие функции земских учреждений, декларировалась их полная автономность «в вопросах местного характера». Однако подчёркивалось, что местные Советы сообразуют свою деятельность с общими декретами и постановлениями высших советских организаций, в состав которых они входят. Впоследствии в условиях Гражданской войны роль Советов во многом подменялась чрезвычайными органами: местными чрезвычайными комиссиями (ЧК), комитетами бедноты (комбедами), революционными комитетами (ревкомами). ⬤ 1. Зачем большевикам понадобилось созывать III съезд Советов почти сразу после роспуска Учредительного собрания? 2. Какие функции выполняли Советы? § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 69 «Первые дни Октября. Красногвардейский дозор». Художник Г. Савицкий. 1949 г. В сборнике «Великие дни. Рассказы о революции» так описывались эти дни: «Тихо стало в богатых кварталах Петрограда. Побеждённая буржуазия боится выйти на улицу, со страхом и ненавистью смотрит она». ⬤ Из кого состояли первые отряды красногвардейцев? 4 Создание новой армии и спецслужбы. Новое государство нуждалось и в новой армии. Декрет Совнаркома провозгласил создание Рабоче-крестьянской Красной Армии (РККА). Вскоре был образован Красный Флот (РККФ). Применявшийся поначалу добровольческий принцип комплектования РККА приводил к сложностям в управлении войсками, что пагубным образом отражалось на её боеспособности и дисциплине. Кроме того, обеспечить быстрый рост численности армии на добровольной основе оказалось невозможно. Когда Германия нарушила перемирие и начала новое наступление на фронте, оказалось, что сдерживать его некому: самочинная демобилизация, начатая по решениям солдатских комитетов после Декрета о мире, привела к полному развалу армии. К тому же ширился размах антибольшевистских выступлений в регионах страны. Поэтому Совнаркому пришлось вернуться к всеобщей воинской повинности мужского населения в возрасте от 18 до 40 лет. В течение лета—осени 1918 г. в ряды РККА было мобилизовано 300 тыс. человек. В 1920 г. число красноармейцев превысило 5 млн. Большое внимание уделялось формированию командных кадров. В 1917—1919 гг., помимо краткосрочных курсов и школ для подготовки среднего командного звена, были открыты высшие военные учебные заведения. В марте 1918 г. опубликовано извещение о привлечении на службу военных специалистов (военспецов) царской армии. К 1 января 1919 г. ряды Красной Армии пополнили более чем 70 тыс. бывших офицеров русской императорской армии. Для контроля над ними в апреле 1918 г. в войсках и на флоте был введён институт военных комиссаров, которые должны 70 ГЛАВА I были также осуществлять «политическое воспитание» красноармейцев. В сентябре 1918 г. была создана единая структура управления войсками фронтов и армий. Во главе каждого фронта (армии) назначался Революционный военный совет (Реввоенсовет, или РВС), состоявший из командующего и двух комиссаров. Возглавлял все военные учреждения Реввоенсовет республики во главе с Л. Троцким, который занял пост наркома по военным и морским делам. Были приняты меры по ужесточению дисциплины. Представители Реввоенсовета, наделённые чрезвычайными полномочиями (вплоть до расстрела изменников и трусов без суда), выезжали на самые напряжённые участки фронта. В ноябре 1918 г. был образован Совет рабочей и крестьянской обороны во главе с В. Лениным, сосредоточивший в своих руках всю полноту государственной власти. В первые недели после взятия власти большевики столкнулись с массовым бойкотом (забастовкой) государственных, банковских и других служащих. Новым советским министрам (теперь — народным комиссарам, наркомам) приходилось силой взламывать покинутые чиновниками здания и кабинеты. 7(20) декабря 1917 г. была создана Всероссийская чрезвычайная комиссия по борьбе с контрреволюцией и саботажем (ВЧК). Возглавил ВЧК Ф. Дзержинский. Первой задачей комиссии была борьба с саботажем госслужащих. Позднее основными направлениями деятельности чекистов стали пресечение любых действий контрреволюции, предание суду революционного трибунала саботажников и контрреволюционеров, выработка системных мер борьбы с ними. Дзержинский Феликс Эдмундович (1877—1926) Участник революционной борьбы, шесть раз был арестован и трижды бежал, стоял у истоков Красной гвардии. Одновременно с созданием и руководством первой советской спецслужбой (ВЧК) был наркомом путей сообщения, главой комиссии по детской беспризорности, председателем созданного им спортивного общества «Динамо», с 1924 г. — председатель главного органа управления экономикой страны — ВСНХ. Сыграл огромную роль не только в борьбе с контрреволюцией, но и в создании системы профессионального образования, восстановлении железных дорог и всего народного хозяйства. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 71 За столом переговоров при подписании Брестского мира. Брест-Литовск, 1918 г. В августе 1918 г. было заключено дополнительное соглашение, по которому советское правительство обязывалось выплатить Германии огромную контрибуцию. Её часть была выплачена до аннулирования Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г. ⬤ 1. На каких принципах формировалась РККА? Почему большевикам удалось быстро организовать боеспособную армию? 2. Какие задачи возлагались на ВЧК? 5 Брестский мир. Вопрос о войне оставался одним из самых болезненных. В ноябре 1917 г. Л. Троцкий, назначенный народным комиссаром по иностранным делам, обратился к правительствам всех воюющих держав с предложением о заключении всеобщего демократического мира. Согласие на переговоры было получено только от воюющих с Россией государств. Переговоры начались в г. Брест-Литовске, где находилась ставка командования германскими войсками на Восточном фронте, и привели к заключению 2 декабря 1917 г. перемирия. Однако после отказа стран Антанты присоединиться к переговорам Германия отвергла идею заключения мира «без аннексий и контрибуций» и выдвинула требование признать за ней оккупированные территории Польши, Прибалтики и других частей бывшей Российской империи. Германия планировала установить протекторат над правобережьем Днепра. После событий октября 1917 г. в Петрограде Украинская Центральная рада (ЦР) отказалась признать переход власти к Советам. Восстание рабочих киевских заводов было подавлено частями «самостийников» под командованием С. Петлюры. Но отряды Красной гвардии приближались к Киеву. Чтобы сохранить свою власть, ЦР провозгласила создание Украинской народной республики (УНР) и в обмен на военную помощь против большевиков обязалась поставить Германии и Австро-Венгрии миллион тонн зерна, а также другое продовольствие и сырьё. Чтобы обеспечить себе «право» на захват Украины, германское командование подписало с представителями 72 ГЛАВА I УНР сепаратный мирный договор на следующий день после того, как отряды Красной гвардии заняли Киев. Германские требования и подготовка вторжения для помощи «независимой Украине» вызвали конфликт среди руководителей большевиков. Все они всерьёз рассчитывали, что в уставших от войны европейских странах тоже вот-вот должна начаться революция. Постепенно расширяясь, революционное движение охватит весь мир («мировая революция»). Поэтому отказ России от мира с Германией, демонстрация готовности вести «революционную войну» и обращение за помощью к «мировому пролетариату» подстегнёт революционное движение в других странах. Особенно активно эту точку зрения отстаивали Н. Бухарин, Ф. Дзержинский и Л. Троцкий. Подписание мира с Германией, считали они, — это отказ от мировой революции. Данную позицию поддержали левые эсеры. Ленин же настаивал на немедленном заключении мира. Чтобы убедить других членов ЦК, ему пришлось даже угрожать отставкой с поста главы правительства. Ленина поддержал Сталин, заявив, что «революционного движения на Западе нет, а есть только потенция, а с потенцией мы не можем считаться». В итоге, чтобы избежать раскола в руководстве партии, большинством голосов было решено просто затягивать переговоры, отказываясь от подписания мира на немецких условиях. Суть компромисса сформулировал Троцкий в лозунге «Ни мира, ни войны». При этом демобилизация армии должна была продолжаться. В это же время был принят декрет ВЦИК (его возглавлял Я. Свердлов) об аннулировании всех прежних долгов России перед иностранными государствами. Однако совсем скоро большевикам пришлось признать правоту своего лидера: после отказа заключить мир немцы и австрийцы начали новое наступление. Не встречая серьёзного сопротивления, их армии двинулись к Киеву и Одессе, а на северо-западе — к Пскову. Советское правительство немедленно запросило мира. Новый германский ультиматум, полученный 23 февраля, содержал гораздо более тяжёлые условия. Под давлением Ленина большинство членов ЦК проголосовали за немедленное принятие этих условий. Мирный договор был подписан 3 марта 1918 г. в БрестЛитовске. По его условиям Российское правительство обязывалось признать УНР независимым государством, а также не претендовать на Прибалтику: здесь немцы тоже планировали создать подконтрольные им государственные образования (сразу после § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 73 подписания мира было объявлено о восстановлении Герцогства Курляндского, а осенью провозглашено создание Балтийского герцогства). В результате в сферу влияния Германии попадала территория площадью свыше 1 млн кв. км и с населением более 50 млн человек. Кроме того, Россия должна была уступить Турции в Закавказье города Ардаган, Батум и Карс с округами. Эти уступки дополнялись обязательством демобилизовать армию и разоружить флот. Вскоре после заключения мира левые эсеры в знак протеста вышли из состава правительства. О своей оппозиционности этому решению ЦК заявили также многие большевики. Лидером этой группы, которую стали называть «левыми коммунистами», был Н. Бухарин. Они считали, что Брестский договор означает отказ от продолжения «русской и международной революции», и требовали либо аннулировать его, либо развернуть партизанскую борьбу на оккупированных Германией территориях. РСФСР отказалась соблюдать условия Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г., сразу после революции в Германии и её капитуляции. ⬤ 1. Какие точки зрения по вопросу заключения сепаратного мира с Германией существовали в партии большевиков? Какая из позиций, на ваш взгляд, больше отвечала интересам России? Почему вы так считаете? 2. На каких условиях был заключён мир с Германией? Какова была, на ваш взгляд, необходимость заключения такого договора? Свой ответ аргументируйте. 6 Первая Конституция России 1918 г. В июле 1918 г. собрался V Всероссийский съезд Советов. Главным итогом его работы стало принятие первой в истории России Конституции 1918 г. Она объявляла государственную власть принадлежащей «трудовому народу» — рабочим и беднейшей части крестьянства. Закреплялось федеративное устройство страны и её название — Российская Социалистическая Федеративная Советская Республика (РСФСР), был утверждён новый государственный флаг и герб. Высшим органом власти признавался Всероссийский съезд Советов, а в период между созывами съездов — избранный им ВЦИК. Он имел право отменить или приостановить решение правительства — Совнаркома (СНК). Конституция перечисляла основные права и обязанности граждан. Все были обязаны трудиться, охранять завоевания революции, защищать Отечество. Выборы в органы власти не были прямыми для сельского населения: сельские Советы выбирали депутатов на волостные и уезд­ 74 ГЛАВА I ные съезды, которые затем посылали депутатов на областные и губернские, а уже те — на Всероссийский съезд. Избирательного права лишались лица, прибегавшие к наёмному труду или живущие на «нетрудовой доход»: прежде всего, имелись в виду «капиталисты» (предприниматели), в том числе частные торговцы. Также участвовать в выборах не могли священнослужители, агенты полиции и жандармы, члены императорского дома Романовых и др. ⬤ Выделите основные положения Конституции РСФСР 1918 г.

Instead, Pygame provides a more suitable way to handle timing and events. To limit the frame rate and effectively pause the execution at each iteration of your game loop, you can use \`pygame.time.Clock().tick(fps)\`, which you already have at the end of your provided code. The \`tick(fps)\` method limits the game loop to the specified frames per second, effectively creating a wait that allows the game to run at a consistent speed. Here's how you use it to cap the game at 60 frames per second: \`\`\`python # Outside the game loop, create a Clock object clock = pygame.time.Clock() # Game loop while True: # ... Your game logic here ... # Cap the frame rate to 60 frames per second (FPS) clock.tick(60) \`\`\` By using \`clock.tick(60)\`, you ensure that your game loop does not run more than 60 times per second, which introduces a delay at the end of each loop iteration if your code completes before 1/60th of a second has passed. This not only caps the FPS but also allows the program to be more CPU efficient. If you need to execute a one-time delay in Pygame without freezing the entire application, consider setting up a timer event with \`pygame.time.set_timer()\` and handle the delay in the event loop. This approach won't stop your program from responding to other events like user input."},{"instruction":"No sistema operacional Android nas opções do desenvolvedor Qual é a função da opção forçar 4xms a","output":"A opção \\"Forçar renderização 4x MSAA\\" (Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing) nas opções de desenvolvedor do Android é uma configuração que visa melhorar a qualidade gráfica em jogos e outras aplicações que usam gráficos OpenGL ES 2.0. MSAA é uma técnica de suavização de bordas que ajuda a reduzir o efeito de serrilhado, essas bordas irregulares e pixeladas que podem aparecer em elementos gráficos 3D. Essa técnica de anti-aliasing funciona ao renderizar as bordas dos gráficos em uma resolução mais alta e depois redimensioná-las para se encaixar na resolução de tela do dispositivo. Isso resulta em bordas mais suaves e uma aparência visual geralmente mais polida. Porém, ativar o 4x MSAA pode ter um impacto significativo no desempenho do sistema e no consumo de energia, já que exige mais do processador gráfico (GPU) e pode drenar a bateria mais rapidamente. Quando você força a renderização em 4x MSAA, está instruindo o dispositivo a usar essa configuração de anti-aliasing em todos os jogos e aplicações que suportam OpenGL ES 2.0, mesmo se o jogo ou aplicação não foi originalmente projetado com essa funcionalidade. É importante notar que nem todos os aplicativos se beneficiarão visivelmente dessa configuração e, como mencionado, isso pode afetar negativamente a performance em dispositivos menos potentes ou em situações onde a economia de energia é crucial. Portanto, essa é uma opção que os desenvolvedores e usuários avançados podem ativar para testes ou para uma experiência visual aprimorada em certas aplicações, mas deve ser usada com cautela. No uso diário, é geralmente recomendado deixar essa opção desativada para preservar a vida útil da bateria e manter o desempenho do sistema equilibrado."},{"instruction":"Como posso melhorar o desempenho do meu Samsung Galaxy j7 Neo através das opções do desenvolvedor","output":"As \\"Opções de desenvolvedor\\" no Android foram projetadas inicialmente para desenvolvedores testarem seus aplicativos e otimizarem seus desempenhos, mas essas configurações também podem ser usadas para ajustar certos aspectos do desempenho do sistema. Em um Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, aqui estão algumas dicas que você pode usar para melhorar o desempenho através dessas opções: 1. Reduzir as Animações: - Dentro das \\"Opções de desenvolvedor\\", procure por \\"Escala de animação da janela\\", \\"Escala de animação de transição\\" e \\"Escala de duração do animador\\". - Configure esses valores para 0.5x ou até \\"Animação desligada\\" para tornar as transições e as animações mais rápidas ou instantâneas. 2. Limitar os Processos em Segundo Plano: - Role para baixo até encontrar \\"Limite de processos em segundo plano\\". - Selecione uma opção mais baixa para restringir o número de aplicativos que podem rodar em segundo plano simultaneamente, liberando recursos. 3. Forçar a Renderização da GPU: - Ative \\"Forçar renderização da GPU\\" para forçar o uso da GPU para desenhar os elementos da interface do usuário. Isso pode ajudar a aliviar a CPU, mas pode ou não melhorar o desempenho, dependendo do aplicativo. 4. Desabilitar Serviços em Segundo Plano: - Como alternativa, você pode desativar serviços desnecessários ou aplicativos em segundo plano manualmente ajustando suas configurações individualmente fora das \\"Opções de desenvolvedor\\". 5. Desativar Overlays de Hardware: - O \\"Desativar overlays de hardware\\" força a aplicação a ser desenhada com a GPU e pode melhorar o desempenho em determinadas situações. 6. Ativar 4x MSAA (com cautela): - Ativar o \\"Forçar 4x MSAA\\" pode melhorar a qualidade visual dos gráficos nos jogos, mas como mencionado anteriormente, isso pode diminuir o desempenho e aumentar o consumo de bateria. 7. Modificar as Opções de Desenvolvedor de Rede: - Caso você esteja desenvolvendo ou testando aplicações que usam a rede, ajustar as configurações relacionadas à conectividade (como a velocidade da rede) pode ajudar a simular diferentes ambientes de rede para melhorar o desempenho do app nessas condições. Antes de alterar essas configurações, lembre-se de que: - Essas opções podem variar de acordo com a versão do Android e o fabricante do dispositivo. - Algumas mudanças podem ter efeitos indesejados no uso cotidiano do seu aparelho. - Sempre anote ou memorize as configurações padrão para que você possa restaurá-las se algo não funcionar como esperado. Como último recurso, você também pode tentar realizar uma restauração de fábrica para remover qualquer app ou configuração que esteja afetando o desempenho, mas lembre-se de fazer backup dos seus dados antes de proceder com essa ação."},{"instruction":"Se una forza favorisce lo spostamento di un corpo, essa compie lavoro motore.

A história segue Naofumi Iwatani, um otaku que é transportado para um mundo paralelo junto com outros três indivíduos, para se tornarem os heróis legendários desse mundo. Cada um deles recebe um equipamento especial; Naofumi recebe o Escudo Lendário e é conhecido como o Herói do Escudo. A \\"Dama de Ferro\\" no contexto de \\"Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari\\" parece ser uma referência equivocada, uma vez que não é um termo ou objeto diretamente relacionado a essa série. No entanto, a expressão \\"Dama de Ferro\\" (Iron Maiden em inglês) pode se referir ao seguinte: 1. Uma forma de tortura ou execução: A Dama de Ferro era um suposto dispositivo de tortura medieval, consistindo em um sarcófago de ferro com espinhos no interior. Uma pessoa seria fechada dentro dele, sofrendo lesões dos espinhos. 2. Uma banda de heavy metal: Iron Maiden é uma famosa banda britânica de heavy metal formada em 1975. Com um grande número de fãs em todo o mundo, é possível que alguém se refira a \\"Iron Maiden\\" em diversas discussões ou contextos.

The code consists of four primary classes: \`Candidats\`, \`Solucio\`, \`Solucionador\`, and the main program where execution starts. Here's a brief explanation of each part: 1. \`Candidats\`: Represents a set of possible candidates (in this context, candidates likely refer to auditors or tasks that can be assigned to auditors). This class provides functionality to iterate over the candidates, track the current candidate and support the addition and removal of candidates (auditors). 2. \`Solucio\`: Represents a solution to the problem of assigning audits. It consists of methods to initialize candidates, determine if an assignment is acceptable, check if the solution is complete, annotate or de-annotate assignments, and compare solutions to find the best one. 3. \`Solucionador\`: This is a class designed to find solutions to the problem. It provides methods to find either a solution or the best solution. 4. Main Function: The entry point of the application where various input parameters are parsed and processed, including options related to the problem's constraints. It reads data from a CSV file and uses the \`Solucionador\` class to find a solution or the best solution, which is then outputted. It seems like the program is implementing a backtracking algorithm to distribute tasks based on certain constraints (e.g., maximum import per auditor, year to consider, whether to consider the type and chapter of the transactions, etc.). Without knowing more about the program's exact requirements or having the corresponding headers (e.g., \\"Solucio.h\\", \\"Solucionador.h\\", \\"Candidats.h\\") or related CSV file structures, we cannot analyze the code in full. However, it seems well-structured for its intended functionality of finding an optimal distribution of tasks based on given constraints. Make sure to handle exceptions and edge-cases properly, such as when the CSV file cannot be opened, or it has a wrong format, or if there are logical inconsistencies in the input data. Additionally, ensure the program is thoroughly tested to handle all specified requirements and options correctly."},{"instruction":"PS C:UsersDidacDesktopCodeBlocks2n anyp2> g++ -o audita Candidats.cpp Candidats.h Solucio.h Solucio.cpp Solucionador.cpp Solucionador.h main.cpp PS C:UsersDidacDesktopCodeBlocks2n anyp2> ./audita -m -a 2022 -i 2600000 linies_0001.csv Posant això no em dona res i m'hauria de donar aixo: 3 14 l´ınies (14 aplicacions) llegides amb un import total de: 12057492.78 € 4 5 ********************************** 6 * Auditor 1 2570927.06 € * 7 * ------------------------------ * 8 * D4800003: 2570927.06 € * 9 ********************************** 10 11 ********************************** 12 * Auditor 2 2543738.60 € * 13 * ------------------------------ * 14 * D2270089: 2543738.60 € * 15 ********************************** 16 17 ********************************** 18 * Auditor 3 2313440.35 € * 19 * ------------------------------ * 20 * D4480014: 235125.00 € * 21 * D6100001: 2078315.35 € * 22 ********************************** 23 24 ********************************** 25 * Auditor 4 2317069.00 € * 26 * ------------------------------ * 27 * D2120003: 350000.00 € * 28 * D2210001: 146360.53 € * 29 * D2210007: 1520708.47 € * 30 * D2260002: 50000.00 € * 31 * D2270013: 105000.00 € * 32 * D4820055: 145000.00 € * 33 ********************************** 34 35 ********************************** 36 * Auditor 5 2312317.77 € * 37 * ------------------------------ * 38 * D2260001: 30000.00 € * 39 * D6400001: 60000.00 € * 40 * I1100002: 1375794.21 € * 41 * I3110001: 846523.56 € * 42 ********************************** 43 44 Total: 12057492.78 45 Auditors: 5 46 Desviaci´o: 119393.51 47 Temps: 0.000545787 segons Que li passa al meu programa?","output":"Per comprendre millor el que podria estar passant amb el teu programa, aquí et deixo una llista de possibles punts a revisar: 1. **Verificació dels arxius d'entrada:** Comprova que el fitxer \`linies_0001.csv\` existeix en la ubicació adequada i conté les dades correctes en el format esperat pel programa. 2. **Comprovació dels paràmetres i opcions:** Asegura't que les opcions \`-a\`, \`-i\` i \`-m\` es gestionen correctament al programa i que interpreten els valors que passis correctament. Aquests valors influiran en els resultats de la teva solució. 3. **Control d'errors:** Si el teu programa és susceptible de fallar sense avisar (per exemple, amb un fitxer que no es pot obrir o una excepció no capturada), pot ser que s'estigui trobant amb un d'aquests errors. Afegeix missatges de log d'errors al teu codi per obtenir més detalls sobre on podria estar fallant. 4. **Verificació dels mètodes de cerca de solucions:** Comprova els mètodes en la classe \`Solucionador\` per assegurar-te que funcionen com s'espera. Es possible que hi hagi condicions o casos d'ús que no s'estiguin cobrint correctament. 5. **Depuració pas a pas:** Utilitza eines de depuració per seguir l'execució del teu programa pas a pas i comprovar on deixa de comportar-se com s'espera. 6. **Revisió dels límits i constants:** Asegura't que no estiguis sobrepasant cap límit en les dades (per exemple, la quantitat màxima d'auditors, els imports, etc.) i que les constants i paràmetres usats en els càlculs siguin els correctes. 7. **Problemes de rendiment:** En problemes de backtracking com aquest, és important assegurar-se que les podades i optimitzacions es fan correctament, en cas contrari, podria ser que el programa estigui quedant atrapat en un bucle infinit o tardant massa a trobar una solució. 8. **Prova amb altres conjunts de dades:** Prova el teu programa amb conjunts de dades diferents (alguns més petits o més simples) per veure si el problema és amb dades específiques o amb tota mena d'entrades. Si després de revisar tots aquests punts, el problema persisteix, pots provar de llegir els missatges de sortida o el codi d'error que el programa podria estar produint per obtenir més pistes sobre el que pot estar passant. A més, seria recomanable comprovar que totes les funcions i classes estiguin definides i implementades correctament segons les especificacions de la teva tasca."},{"instruction":"J'ai ce site : {%

Lorsque le formulaire sera soumis via le bouton \\"Ajouter\\", la valeur de l'option sélectionnée dans le \`<select>\` sera envoyée avec la requête POST au serveur. Cela se produit parce que vous avez correctement nommé le \`<select>\` avec \`name=\\"lieu_evenement\\"\`. La fonction \`ajouter_evenement()\` dans vos routes Flask récupère cette valeur transmise sous le nom \`\\"lieu_evenement\\"\` comme ceci : \`\`\`python nom_lieu = request.form[\\"lieu_evenement\\"] if request.form[\\"lieu_evenement\\"] else None \`\`\` Cependant, il y a un petit malentendu dans la fonction \`ajouter_evenement\`.

Assurez-vous que les valeurs de \`<option>\` pour chaque lieu dans votre liste déroulante \`<select>\` sont correctement établies. Chaque \`<option>\` devrait avoir un \`value\` qui est l'ID du lieu (\`idL\`). 2. Vérifiez que dans votre route Flask, vous récupérez correctement la valeur \`id_lieu\` du formulaire. 3. Assurez-vous que vous créez correctement un nouvel objet Evenement avec l'\`id_lieu\` récupéré avant d'appeler la fonction qui insère l'événement dans la base de données.

Sinon, ça prend la valeur envoyée par le formulaire. Face à ce problème et si les vérifications ci-dessus ne résolvent pas votre problème, voici quelques étapes de dépannage supplémentaires : 4. Vérifiez que votre formulaire HTML soit bien entouré d'une balise \`<form>\` avec la bonne action d'envoi (c'est le cas dans votre code fourni). \`\`\`html <form action=\\"/ajouter_evenement\\" method=\\"post\\"> <!-- Éléments du formulaire --> <!-- ... --> </form> \`\`\` 5. Assurez-vous que la requête POST est envoyée avec les bonnes données en utilisant les outils pour développeurs de votre navigateur pour inspecter les requêtes réseau. 6. Examinez les logs du serveur Flask pour toute erreur ou information qui pourrait s'afficher lors de la réception de la requête POST. 7. Vérifiez que la méthode \`insert_evenement\` de votre objet \`EvenementBD\` insère correctement l'ID du lieu dans la base de données avec l'événement.

Всероссийский съезд Советов в октябре 1917 г. принял ряд исторических решений. Главные из них — декреты о мире и о земле — были приняты по предложению Ленина. Декрет о мире провозгласил выход России из войны. Съезд обратился ко всем воюющим правительствам и народам с предложением всеобщего демократического мира, т. е. мира без аннексий и контрибуций. Правительствам Германии, Австро-Венгрии и Турции было предложено начать переговоры о заключении перемирия. В основу Декрета о земле были положены крестьянские наказы, направленные сразу после свержения монархии в адрес I Всероссийского съезда крестьянских депутатов. В них крестьяне требовали отмены частной собственности на землю и установления уравнительного землепользования. Эти требования были частью программы партии эсеров, а не большевиков. Но Ленин прекрасно понимал, что новая власть прежде всего должна удовлетворить чаяния большинства населения по вопросам земли и мира. Из декрета СНК о печати (27 октября 1917 г.) «Всякий знает, что буржуазная пресса есть одно из могущественнейших оружий буржуазии. Особенно в критический момент, когда новая власть, власть рабочих и крестьян, только упрочивается, невозможно было целиком оставить это оружие в руках врага в то время, как оно не менее опасно в такие минуты, чем бомбы и пулемёты. Закрытию подлежат лишь органы прессы: 1) призывающие к открытому сопротивлению или неповиновению Рабочему и Крестьянскому правительству; 2) сеющие смуту путём явно клеветнического извращения фактов». ⬤ Почему большевики издали такой декрет о печати? 2(15) ноября 1917 г. была опубликована Декларация прав народов России, провозгласившая равенство народов и их право на самоопределение — т. е. образование самостоятельного государства. Отменялись все национальные и религиозные ограничения. Декретом об уничтожении сословий и гражданских чинов отменялось деление общества на сословия дворян, купцов, крестьян, мещан, отменялись княжеские, графские и иные титулы, гражданские чины. Для всего населения устанавливалось одно наименование — гражданин Российской Советской Республики. Были уравнены в гражданских правах мужчины и женщины. 66 ГЛАВА I В январе 1918 г. издан декрет об отделении Церкви от государства и школы от Церкви. Был осуществлён переход на григорианский календарь — 1 февраля 1918 г. стало 14-м. С начала 1918 г. стало повсеместно использоваться новое правописание русского языка: из алфавита исключались три буквы (i десятеричное, фита и ять), менялись правила написания некоторых приставок и окончаний. ⬤ 1.

Свою позицию объясните. 2 Учредительное собрание. Идея Учредительного собрания была очень популярна среди всех партий и организаций после свержения монархии в феврале 1917 г. Большевики тоже никогда не выступали против его созыва. Выборы прошли в ноябре — в срок, назначенный ещё Временным правительством. Итоги выборов были предсказуемы: большинство крестьян выбирали своими делегатами представителей партии эсеров, большевики получили около 22% голосов. Ленин (Ульянов) Владимир Ильич (1870—1924) Родился в Симбирске (ныне Ульяновск) в семье действительного статского советника И. Ульянова. Окончил экстерном юридический факультет Санкт-Петербургского университета. Вместе с будущим лидером меньшевиков-интернационалистов Ю. Мартовым основал марксистский кружок «Союз борьбы за освобождение рабочего класса». Был арестован и сослан на три года в Восточную Сибирь. После ссылки выехал за границу по подложному заграничному паспорту на фамилию «Ленин», которая стала его партийным псевдонимом. С небольшим перерывом провёл в эмиграции 17 лет. Проявив политическую волю и незаурядную интуицию, умение организовать и вести за собой людей, способность убеждать, Ленин возглавил приход к власти большевиков в октябре 1917 г. В качестве главы первого правительства Советской России играл главную роль в формировании нового госаппарата, выработке и принятии всех важнейших решений в области внутренней и внешней политики. Настоял на разгоне Учредительного собрания, заключении Брестского мира с Германией, введении продовольственной диктатуры. Считал оправданным «революционное насилие» в отношении всех противников нового строя. В 1918 г. был тяжело ранен в результате покушения, организованного эсерами-террористами. Последствия ранения привели к тяжёлой болезни, из-за которой Ленин с 1922 г. фактически утратил решающее влияние в партии и государстве. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 67 Первое заседание Учредительного собрания в Таврическом дворце Петрограда 5(18) января 1918 г. стало и последним. Председателем был избран лидер правых эсеров, бывший министр земледелия Временного правительства В. Чернов. Лидеры эсеров и меньшевиков полагали, что теперь им удастся оттеснить большевиков от власти и сформировать собственное правительство. По­этому Учредительное собрание отклонило подготовленную Лениным Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа как основу будущей конституции страны и отказались утвердить принятые с октября 1917 г. декреты Совнаркома. Однако большевики и левые эсеры не собирались уступать. Они покинули заседание, которое продолжалось далеко за полночь. В 4 ч 40 мин утра его прервал начальник охраны матрос-анархист А. Железняков, произнёсший ставшие легендарными слова: «Караул устал». Ночью ВЦИК Советов принял решение о роспуске Учредительного собрания. Возле Таврического дворца была выставлена охрана, не пустившая туда депутатов. Демонстрации в поддержку собрания были разогнаны с применением вооружённой силы. Большая часть жителей России восприняла это событие спокойно. Но многие депутаты Учредительного собрания, прежде всего правые эсеры, решили продолжить борьбу и присоединиться к тем, кто готовился бороться с новой властью с помощью оружия. Летом 1918 г., после восстания Чехословацкого корпуса, им удалось организовать антибольшевистское восстание в Самаре.

Эта картина была написана художником в 1920 г. По легенде, спустя некоторое время к нему в мастерскую пришёл Фёдор Шаляпин (тот писал его портрет). Увидев картину, певец содрогнулся и произнёс: «Ну, пора уезжать?» ⬤ Как вы думаете, какую идею выражает данная картина? Почему она так называется? антибольшевистское правительство, которое объявило себя верховной властью и приступило к формированию Народной армии (см. § 8). ⬤ 1. Почему большинство членов Учредительного собрания отказались утвердить декреты Совнаркома? 2. Что побудило большевиков пойти на роспуск Учредительного собрания? 3 Организация власти Советов. Полномочия Учредительного собрания взял на себя III Всероссийский съезд Советов рабочих и солдатских депутатов, который открылся спустя три дня после роспуска Учредительного собрания. К нему присоединились делегаты III Всероссийского съезда Советов крестьянских депутатов. Объединённый съезд одобрил Декларацию прав трудящегося и эксплуатируемого народа, объявил Россию Советской Федеративной Социалистической Республикой (РСФСР) и поручил ВЦИК разработать Конституцию. В состав ВЦИК, кроме большевиков и левых эсеров, вошло несколько представителей других партий. Большое значение придавалось созданию системы Советов на местах. Им были переданы управленческие функции земских учреждений, декларировалась их полная автономность «в вопросах местного характера». Однако подчёркивалось, что местные Советы сообразуют свою деятельность с общими декретами и постановлениями высших советских организаций, в состав которых они входят. Впоследствии в условиях Гражданской войны роль Советов во многом подменялась чрезвычайными органами: местными чрезвычайными комиссиями (ЧК), комитетами бедноты (комбедами), революционными комитетами (ревкомами). ⬤ 1. Зачем большевикам понадобилось созывать III съезд Советов почти сразу после роспуска Учредительного собрания? 2. Какие функции выполняли Советы? § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 69 «Первые дни Октября. Красногвардейский дозор». Художник Г. Савицкий. 1949 г. В сборнике «Великие дни. Рассказы о революции» так описывались эти дни: «Тихо стало в богатых кварталах Петрограда. Побеждённая буржуазия боится выйти на улицу, со страхом и ненавистью смотрит она». ⬤ Из кого состояли первые отряды красногвардейцев? 4 Создание новой армии и спецслужбы. Новое государство нуждалось и в новой армии. Декрет Совнаркома провозгласил создание Рабоче-крестьянской Красной Армии (РККА). Вскоре был образован Красный Флот (РККФ). Применявшийся поначалу добровольческий принцип комплектования РККА приводил к сложностям в управлении войсками, что пагубным образом отражалось на её боеспособности и дисциплине. Кроме того, обеспечить быстрый рост численности армии на добровольной основе оказалось невозможно. Когда Германия нарушила перемирие и начала новое наступление на фронте, оказалось, что сдерживать его некому: самочинная демобилизация, начатая по решениям солдатских комитетов после Декрета о мире, привела к полному развалу армии. К тому же ширился размах антибольшевистских выступлений в регионах страны. Поэтому Совнаркому пришлось вернуться к всеобщей воинской повинности мужского населения в возрасте от 18 до 40 лет. В течение лета—осени 1918 г. в ряды РККА было мобилизовано 300 тыс. человек. В 1920 г. число красноармейцев превысило 5 млн. Большое внимание уделялось формированию командных кадров. В 1917—1919 гг., помимо краткосрочных курсов и школ для подготовки среднего командного звена, были открыты высшие военные учебные заведения. В марте 1918 г. опубликовано извещение о привлечении на службу военных специалистов (военспецов) царской армии. К 1 января 1919 г. ряды Красной Армии пополнили более чем 70 тыс. бывших офицеров русской императорской армии. Для контроля над ними в апреле 1918 г. в войсках и на флоте был введён институт военных комиссаров, которые должны 70 ГЛАВА I были также осуществлять «политическое воспитание» красноармейцев. В сентябре 1918 г. была создана единая структура управления войсками фронтов и армий. Во главе каждого фронта (армии) назначался Революционный военный совет (Реввоенсовет, или РВС), состоявший из командующего и двух комиссаров. Возглавлял все военные учреждения Реввоенсовет республики во главе с Л. Троцким, который занял пост наркома по военным и морским делам. Были приняты меры по ужесточению дисциплины. Представители Реввоенсовета, наделённые чрезвычайными полномочиями (вплоть до расстрела изменников и трусов без суда), выезжали на самые напряжённые участки фронта. В ноябре 1918 г. был образован Совет рабочей и крестьянской обороны во главе с В. Лениным, сосредоточивший в своих руках всю полноту государственной власти. В первые недели после взятия власти большевики столкнулись с массовым бойкотом (забастовкой) государственных, банковских и других служащих. Новым советским министрам (теперь — народным комиссарам, наркомам) приходилось силой взламывать покинутые чиновниками здания и кабинеты. 7(20) декабря 1917 г. была создана Всероссийская чрезвычайная комиссия по борьбе с контрреволюцией и саботажем (ВЧК). Возглавил ВЧК Ф. Дзержинский. Первой задачей комиссии была борьба с саботажем госслужащих. Позднее основными направлениями деятельности чекистов стали пресечение любых действий контрреволюции, предание суду революционного трибунала саботажников и контрреволюционеров, выработка системных мер борьбы с ними. Дзержинский Феликс Эдмундович (1877—1926) Участник революционной борьбы, шесть раз был арестован и трижды бежал, стоял у истоков Красной гвардии. Одновременно с созданием и руководством первой советской спецслужбой (ВЧК) был наркомом путей сообщения, главой комиссии по детской беспризорности, председателем созданного им спортивного общества «Динамо», с 1924 г. — председатель главного органа управления экономикой страны — ВСНХ. Сыграл огромную роль не только в борьбе с контрреволюцией, но и в создании системы профессионального образования, восстановлении железных дорог и всего народного хозяйства. П ор т ре т на фоне э похи § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 71 За столом переговоров при подписании Брестского мира. Брест-Литовск, 1918 г. В августе 1918 г. было заключено дополнительное соглашение, по которому советское правительство обязывалось выплатить Германии огромную контрибуцию. Её часть была выплачена до аннулирования Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г. ⬤ 1. На каких принципах формировалась РККА? Почему большевикам удалось быстро организовать боеспособную армию? 2. Какие задачи возлагались на ВЧК? 5 Брестский мир. Вопрос о войне оставался одним из самых болезненных. В ноябре 1917 г. Л. Троцкий, назначенный народным комиссаром по иностранным делам, обратился к правительствам всех воюющих держав с предложением о заключении всеобщего демократического мира. Согласие на переговоры было получено только от воюющих с Россией государств. Переговоры начались в г. Брест-Литовске, где находилась ставка командования германскими войсками на Восточном фронте, и привели к заключению 2 декабря 1917 г. перемирия. Однако после отказа стран Антанты присоединиться к переговорам Германия отвергла идею заключения мира «без аннексий и контрибуций» и выдвинула требование признать за ней оккупированные территории Польши, Прибалтики и других частей бывшей Российской империи. Германия планировала установить протекторат над правобережьем Днепра. После событий октября 1917 г. в Петрограде Украинская Центральная рада (ЦР) отказалась признать переход власти к Советам. Восстание рабочих киевских заводов было подавлено частями «самостийников» под командованием С. Петлюры. Но отряды Красной гвардии приближались к Киеву. Чтобы сохранить свою власть, ЦР провозгласила создание Украинской народной республики (УНР) и в обмен на военную помощь против большевиков обязалась поставить Германии и Австро-Венгрии миллион тонн зерна, а также другое продовольствие и сырьё. Чтобы обеспечить себе «право» на захват Украины, германское командование подписало с представителями 72 ГЛАВА I УНР сепаратный мирный договор на следующий день после того, как отряды Красной гвардии заняли Киев. Германские требования и подготовка вторжения для помощи «независимой Украине» вызвали конфликт среди руководителей большевиков. Все они всерьёз рассчитывали, что в уставших от войны европейских странах тоже вот-вот должна начаться революция. Постепенно расширяясь, революционное движение охватит весь мир («мировая революция»). Поэтому отказ России от мира с Германией, демонстрация готовности вести «революционную войну» и обращение за помощью к «мировому пролетариату» подстегнёт революционное движение в других странах. Особенно активно эту точку зрения отстаивали Н. Бухарин, Ф. Дзержинский и Л. Троцкий. Подписание мира с Германией, считали они, — это отказ от мировой революции. Данную позицию поддержали левые эсеры. Ленин же настаивал на немедленном заключении мира. Чтобы убедить других членов ЦК, ему пришлось даже угрожать отставкой с поста главы правительства. Ленина поддержал Сталин, заявив, что «революционного движения на Западе нет, а есть только потенция, а с потенцией мы не можем считаться». В итоге, чтобы избежать раскола в руководстве партии, большинством голосов было решено просто затягивать переговоры, отказываясь от подписания мира на немецких условиях. Суть компромисса сформулировал Троцкий в лозунге «Ни мира, ни войны». При этом демобилизация армии должна была продолжаться. В это же время был принят декрет ВЦИК (его возглавлял Я. Свердлов) об аннулировании всех прежних долгов России перед иностранными государствами. Однако совсем скоро большевикам пришлось признать правоту своего лидера: после отказа заключить мир немцы и австрийцы начали новое наступление. Не встречая серьёзного сопротивления, их армии двинулись к Киеву и Одессе, а на северо-западе — к Пскову. Советское правительство немедленно запросило мира. Новый германский ультиматум, полученный 23 февраля, содержал гораздо более тяжёлые условия. Под давлением Ленина большинство членов ЦК проголосовали за немедленное принятие этих условий. Мирный договор был подписан 3 марта 1918 г. в БрестЛитовске. По его условиям Российское правительство обязывалось признать УНР независимым государством, а также не претендовать на Прибалтику: здесь немцы тоже планировали создать подконтрольные им государственные образования (сразу после § 6. Первые революционные преобразования большевиков 73 подписания мира было объявлено о восстановлении Герцогства Курляндского, а осенью провозглашено создание Балтийского герцогства). В результате в сферу влияния Германии попадала территория площадью свыше 1 млн кв. км и с населением более 50 млн человек. Кроме того, Россия должна была уступить Турции в Закавказье города Ардаган, Батум и Карс с округами. Эти уступки дополнялись обязательством демобилизовать армию и разоружить флот. Вскоре после заключения мира левые эсеры в знак протеста вышли из состава правительства. О своей оппозиционности этому решению ЦК заявили также многие большевики. Лидером этой группы, которую стали называть «левыми коммунистами», был Н. Бухарин. Они считали, что Брестский договор означает отказ от продолжения «русской и международной революции», и требовали либо аннулировать его, либо развернуть партизанскую борьбу на оккупированных Германией территориях. РСФСР отказалась соблюдать условия Брестского мира в ноябре 1918 г., сразу после революции в Германии и её капитуляции. ⬤ 1.

На каких условиях был заключён мир с Германией? Какова была, на ваш взгляд, необходимость заключения такого договора? Свой ответ аргументируйте. 6 Первая Конституция России 1918 г. В июле 1918 г. собрался V Всероссийский съезд Советов. Главным итогом его работы стало принятие первой в истории России Конституции 1918 г. Она объявляла государственную власть принадлежащей «трудовому народу» — рабочим и беднейшей части крестьянства. Закреплялось федеративное устройство страны и её название — Российская Социалистическая Федеративная Советская Республика (РСФСР), был утверждён новый государственный флаг и герб. Высшим органом власти признавался Всероссийский съезд Советов, а в период между созывами съездов — избранный им ВЦИК. Он имел право отменить или приостановить решение правительства — Совнаркома (СНК). Конституция перечисляла основные права и обязанности граждан. Все были обязаны трудиться, охранять завоевания революции, защищать Отечество. Выборы в органы власти не были прямыми для сельского населения: сельские Советы выбирали депутатов на волостные и уезд­ 74 ГЛАВА I ные съезды, которые затем посылали депутатов на областные и губернские, а уже те — на Всероссийский съезд. Избирательного права лишались лица, прибегавшие к наёмному труду или живущие на «нетрудовой доход»: прежде всего, имелись в виду «капиталисты» (предприниматели), в том числе частные торговцы. Также участвовать в выборах не могли священнослужители, агенты полиции и жандармы, члены императорского дома Романовых и др. ⬤ Выделите основные положения Конституции РСФСР 1918 г.

Painted by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, the artwork was created between 1503 and 1506, although there are some debates about the exact dates and how long Leonardo worked on it, with some estimates suggesting work continued until 1517. The subject of the painting is believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo, which is why the painting is called \\"La Gioconda\\" in Italian. The name \\"Mona Lisa\\" stems from the abbreviation \\"Mona,\\" which is a short form of \\"Madonna,\\" meaning \\"my lady\\" or \\"madam\\" in Italian. Here are several key aspects that contribute to the fame and intrigue of the Mona Lisa: 1. **Artistic Mastery:** Leonardo's technique in painting the Mona Lisa was groundbreaking. He used sfumato – a technique that allows tones and colors to shade gradually into one another, producing softened outlines or hazy forms. This technique gives the painting its characteristic dreamy and otherworldly quality. 2. **Facial Expression:** The Mona Lisa's enigmatic expression, which seems both alluring and aloof, has given rise to endless speculation. Her smile appears to change depending on the viewer's perspective and has been the subject of numerous interpretations. 3. **Eyes:** It is often said that no matter where you stand in the room, Mona Lisa's eyes seem to follow you around. This effect is due to the painting's composition and is a testament to Leonardo's skill. 4. **Preservation and Fame:** Although the Mona Lisa is over 500 years old, it has remained in relatively good condition, contributing to its fame. Its history is quite eventful – the painting was stolen from the Louvre in 1911 by an Italian patriot who believed it should be returned to Italy. It was recovered two years later and has since become a national icon in France and a symbol of Renaissance art worldwide. 5. **Cultural Impact:** The Mona Lisa has a vast cultural significance. It has been referenced and parodied in countless works of popular culture, and its influence extends well beyond the world of art. 6. **Mystery and Speculation:** Over the years, there have been numerous theories and stories about the Mona Lisa, from doubts about her supposed identity to wild speculations about secret codes within the painting. This mysterious aura only adds to the public's fascination. The Mona Lisa's relatively small size (30 inches by 20 7/8 inches) often surprises visitors to the Louvre. Despite its size, the artwork continues to draw millions of visitors every year who wish to catch a glimpse of Leonardo's masterpiece. The painting is protected by bulletproof glass and enjoys a dedicated, climate-controlled room to ensure its preservation for future generations."},{"instruction":"tell me about human anatomical notes and diagrams made by leonardo da vinchi","output":"Leonardo da Vinci, widely recognized as a genius of the Renaissance era, made significant contributions to art, science, and anatomy. His curiosity and insatiable thirst for knowledge led him to explore the human body with an anatomist's eye, which was quite unusual for an artist of his time. Throughout his life, Leonardo dissected numerous human bodies, meticulously documenting his findings in a series of notes and anatomical drawings that revealed his extraordinary talent for observation and illustration. These studies were intended for a comprehensive work on human anatomy, which, unfortunately, was never completed or published in his lifetime. His anatomical work was compiled into the collection known as \\"Anatomical Manuscript A,\\" containing hundreds of pages of drawings and notes. Here are some key points about Leonardo's anatomical studies: 1. **Accuracy and Detail:** Leonardo's anatomical drawings are renowned for their accuracy and detail. He aimed to understand the structure and function of the human body by dissecting cadavers himself, which was a radical approach during the time when human dissections were often carried out by barbers or assistants, not by the physicians or artists themselves. 2. **Innovative Techniques:** He employed various innovative methods such as cross-sections and exploded views, which are common in modern anatomical diagrams but were revolutionary at the time. He was meticulous in his drawing, ensuring that every anatomical feature was rendered with precision and care. 3. **Organ Systems:** His studies covered a wide range of human anatomy, including the skeletal system, muscles, the vascular system, the organs, and even the developing fetus. He produced immensely detailed drawings of the heart, which were so precise that they would not be fully appreciated or understood until hundreds of years later. 4. **Human Proportions:** In addition to his detailed organ studies, Leonardo was interested in the proportion and mechanics of the human body. He is known for his drawing \\"Vitruvian Man,\\" which is a study of the proportions of the human body, relating it to the geometry of a square and a circle, based on the work of the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. 5. **Influence:** His anatomical work went largely unrecognized until centuries after his death, due to the fact that his notes were scattered among various collections and not made public. It wasn't until the 20th century that the full extent of his anatomical research was realized, highlighting Leonardo's keen insight into human anatomy. He was hundreds of years ahead of his contemporaries in the field of anatomical studies. 6. **Anatomic Language Barriers:** Leonardo's anatomical notebooks are written in his characteristic mirror writing, from right to left and in reverse, presumably because he was left-handed and this method prevented smudging. He used Italian rather than Latin, which was the traditional language of science and medicine, making his work more accessible to other artists and less so to medical professionals of his time. The anatomical notes and diagrams created by Leonardo da Vinci represent a fusion of science and art. Da Vinci's desire to understand the human form went beyond artistic representation; it was a quest for knowledge about the inner workings of life itself. Despite their inaccessibility at the time, they are now considered some of the most detailed and innovative early anatomical studies and are praised for their beauty, accuracy, and foresight."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When the Kirby character collides with the ground, its y position is adjusted and its speed is reset. The character can crouch by changing its height and reducing its radius. The character can also float by reducing the effect of gravity and changing the jump height. The game loop also handles collisions with the sides of the screen to prevent the character from moving outside the visible area. The background is drawn with a blue color, and the ground is drawn with a green color. Overall, this code provides the basic functionality for controlling a Kirby character in a simple game environment. The code can be further extended to add more features, levels, and interactions with other game objects."},{"instruction":"I want kirby to only be big when he is floating","output":"To make Kirby big only when he is floating, you can modify the code to conditionally change the circle's size based on the floating state. 1.

The 5-HTTLPR gene is associated with serotonin transport and regulation. People with the long (L) allele tend to have increased serotonin transporters compared to those with the short (S) allele. This gene has been linked to personality traits such as anxiety and depression susceptibility. The ANKK1 gene is involved in dopamine receptor regulation. Variations in this gene have been linked to addiction susceptibility and impaired reward processing. MAOA (Monoamine oxidase A) is an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Variants of this gene have been linked to aggressive behavior and impulse control issues. COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of dopamine and other catecholamines. Different variants of this gene can influence cognitive function and emotional regulation. ZNF132 is a zinc finger protein-encoding gene that aids in transcriptional regulation. The specific role of this gene is not well understood, so its influence on behavior or psychology is not currently known. DRD2 (Dopamine receptor D2) is a gene that encodes dopamine receptors in the brain. Variants of this gene have been associated with a higher risk of addictive behaviors, such as substance abuse and compulsive gambling. Lastly, PIR (Pirin) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation and gene expression. The specific influence of this gene on psychological or behavioral traits is not well-established. Overall, a person with these specific gene variations could potentially exhibit a complex combination of traits related to serotonin, dopamine, and other neurotransmitter regulation.

His snoring is annoying to him. He is a private. He ends up running to another foxhole where two other soldiers are sleeping. He has pale skin and bloodred eyes. He has fingerless gloves because it's winter. The setting is in 1945 in Belgium. It's snowing and it's night. That vampire soldier is in the US army. The two soldiers sitting in that foxhole jokingly ask him if he couldn't take his squadmate's snoring. Nobody knows that he's a vampire.","output":"The snowy grounds of Belgium were blanketed in a deathly silence, disturbed only by the periodic rumble of distant artillery. The night of 1945 was biting cold, with flakes of snow casting a haunting glow in the moonlight. Private Damian Cross, his pale skin almost merging with the wintry landscape, lay huddled in a makeshift foxhole alongside his fellow GIs. As a vampire hidden within the ranks of the US Army, Damian fought not only the enemy but also the constant, gnawing hunger that ached within his undead veins. Every fiber of his being screamed for the warm, rich sustenance that only human blood could provide; a desire he had managed to keep at bay—until now. His ears, sharpened by the vampiric curse, picked up on every breath and rustle of his fellow soldier, Private Harris, whose relentless snoring grated against Damian's heightened senses. The rhythmic snores were like a siren call, stirring the monster within him. Damian's bloodred eyes flitted towards Harris's exposed neck. A vein pulsed tantalizingly, a rhythmic throb of life that ignited an infernal craving. Battling the beast inside, Damian clenched his jaw, his hands—clad in fingerless gloves to stave off the frost—balled into fists. Ice crystals danced in the air as his breath quickened, fogging in fierce clouds that betrayed his struggle. He could not afford to lose control, could not let this war claim not only his humanity but also his soul. With a guttural growl of frustration, Daemon staggered to his feet, driven by a desperate need to flee the tormenting sounds. His motions were silent, an unnatural grace bestowed upon him by his cursed existence. He darted across the desolate, snow-covered battlefield to another foxhole, seeking refuge among other soldiers who were as unaware of his true nature as Harris had been. As he slipped into the foxhole, the two GIs inside jolted awake, gripping their weapons before realizing the 'intruder' was one of their own. A nervous chuckle escaped them as the tension broke. \\"Couldn't take Harris's sawing logs, eh, Cross?\\" one soldier quipped, elbowing his companion. With a strained laugh that never reached his eyes, Damian replied, \\"Something like that.\\" Nestled between the two men who thought his arrival a simple matter of escaping an annoyance, Damian hunched over, hands shaking and his mind racing for a distraction from the pounding call of blood from the veins around him. He stared at the snowflakes turned crimson in the reflection of his eyes, each one a reminder of what he so desperately yearned for and feared. The soldiers returned to sleep, their breathing even and calm, unaware of the horror that fought an internal battle merely inches away. Damian sat there motionless, a statue of torment in a world oblivious to the darkness he carried. The snow continued to fall, blanketing the world in white, a silent witness to the vampire soldier's unsung war."},{"instruction":"import pygame import sys pygame.init() # Set up display screen = pygame.display.set_mode((900, 700)) # Set the Kirby pink color (RGB format) kirby_pink_color = (255, 105, 180) ground_color = (0, 255, 0) # Green color for the ground # Circle properties circle_radius = 25 # Initial radius circle_y_offset = 25 # Offset from the top of the circle tf = 35 # Circle position and velocity circle_x, circle_y = 425, 500 circle_x_speed, circle_y_speed = 0, 0 gravity = 1 jump_height = -15 # Set jump height # Variables for floating and in-air state is_floating = False in_air = False # Movement flags is_moving_left = False is_moving_right = False # Game loop while True: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: pygame.quit() sys.exit() elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: if event.key == pygame.K_w and not in_air: circle_y_speed = jump_height # Set jump speed in_air = True # Circle is in the air after jumping elif event.key == pygame.K_e: is_floating = True elif event.key == pygame.K_r: is_floating = False elif event.key == pygame.K_a: is_moving_left = True elif event.key == pygame.K_d: is_moving_right = True elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP: if event.key == pygame.K_a: is_moving_left = False elif event.key == pygame.K_d: is_moving_right = False # Floating set up if is_floating: gravity = 0.3 jump_height = -6.5 in_air = False circle_radius = 35 circle_y_offset = 35 else: gravity = 1 jump_height = -15 circle_radius = 25 circle_y_offset = 25 # Apply gravity circle_y_speed += gravity # Apply horizontal motion if is_moving_left: circle_x_speed = -5 elif is_moving_right: circle_x_speed = 5 else: circle_x_speed = 0 # Update circle position circle_x += circle_x_speed circle_y += circle_y_speed # Collision with the ground if circle_y + circle_radius >= 575: circle_y = 575 - circle_radius circle_y_speed = 0 gravity = 1 jump_height = -15 is_floating = False in_air = False # Circle is on the ground # Collision with the sides of the screen if circle_x < 0: circle_x = 0 elif circle_x > 900 - 2 * circle_radius: circle_x = 900 - 2 * circle_radius # Draw background screen.fill((100, 100, 255)) # Blue background # Draw ground pygame.draw.rect(screen, ground_color, (0, 600, 900, 50)) # Draw Kirby pink sphere (circle) if is_floating: pygame.draw.circle(screen, kirby_pink_color, (int(circle_x + circle_radius), int(circle_y + circle_radius)), tf) else: pygame.draw.circle(screen, kirby_pink_color, (int(circle_x + circle_radius), int(circle_y + circle_radius)), circle_radius) # Update the display pygame.display.flip() # Cap the frame rate pygame.time.Clock().tick(60)","output":"This code is a simple game in which the player controls a pink Kirby character.

The game is implemented using the Pygame library. The main components of the code are as follows: - The display is set up using the \`pygame.display.set_mode()\` function. - Colors are defined using RGB values. - The initial position and speed of the Kirby character are set. - The game loop runs continuously until the game is closed. - Events are handled, including quitting the game, jumping, floating, and moving left and right. - Gravity is applied to the Kirby character. - Horizontal motion is applied based on the movement flags. - The Kirby character's position is updated. - Collision with the ground and the sides of the screen is checked and handled. - The background, ground, and Kirby character are drawn. - The display is updated, and the frame rate is capped.

Cette fonction utilise le signal audio pour identifier les instants où l'amplitude est la plus élevée, ce qui peut indiquer un moment de forte intensité sonore (comme un cri, un coup de feu, une explosion, etc.). Cependant, le script ne cherche pas les pics d'amplitude à l'intérieur de chaque segment individuellement après les avoir extraits. Il se concentre sur la localisation des moments les plus forts au niveau global du fichier audio de la vidéo entière et les utilise pour déterminer quels segments doivent être extraits. Voici un résumé des étapes de la détection du pic d'amplitude : 1. Le script lit l'intégralité du fichier audio et calcule la sonorité (en décibels) pour chaque échantillon ou chaque groupe d'échantillons s'il s'agit d'un signal stéréo. 2. Par rapport au signal sonore entier, elle identifie les indices (emplacements temporels) avec la plus forte sonorité. 3. Il convertit ces indices en temps réel pour les points avec la sonorité la plus forte, pour définir le centre de chaque segment vidéo à extraire. 4. Le script fait attention de ne pas choisir des moments trop proches du début ou de la fin du signal audio ou trop proches l'un de l'autre, en fonction des réglages de \`starting_offset_seconds\`, \`ending_offset_seconds\`, et \`segment_duration\`. En conclusion, le script identifie d'abord les pics de sonorité au niveau macro, et sur cette base, il décide quels moments de la vidéo entière il convient d'extraire. Il n'examine pas les pics de sonorité qui pourraient se produire à l'intérieur de chacun de ces segments extraits. Si un tel niveau de détail est nécessaire, des modifications supplémentaires du script seraient nécessaires pour effectuer une analyse de sonorité additionnelle sur chaque segment individuel extrait."},{"instruction":"Ca veut dire que le pic d'amplitude pourrait se situer n'importe où, dans les fichiers extraits ?","output":"Oui, c'est exact. Dans le script fourni, lorsqu'un segment est extrait en se basant sur les moments les plus forts trouvés dans le fichier audio entier, le pic d'amplitude (le point de sonorité maximale) se situe au centre théorique du segment extrait. C'est parce que chaque segment est conçu pour avoir une durée fixe avec le moment le plus fort au milieu. Cependant, la localisation précise de ce pic d'amplitude à l'intérieur du segment extrait peut légèrement varier pour plusieurs raisons : 1. **Imprécision du début du segment** : En fonction de la précision avec laquelle la commande \`ffmpeg\` coupe le segment vidéo, le pic peut ne pas être exactement au milieu. 2. **Segmentation et encodage** : Le processus d'encodage video peut induire une légère altération de l'alignement temporel ou de synchronisation, déplaçant le pic d'un petit intervalle de temps. 3. **Durée du Segment** : Les segments sont extraits avec une durée fixe (\`segment_duration\`). Si le pic est très étroit et que la période de temps étudiée est relativement grande, le \\"centre\\" est un intervalle de temps plutôt qu'un instant précis. En pratique, cela signifie que dans le segment extrait, le pic d'amplitude pourrait ne pas être situé précisément au centre du fichier et pourrait varier en position en raison de contraintes techniques ou de choix de conception. Pour garantir que le pic soit exactement au centre, le script devrait inclure une étape supplémentaire après la découpe pour affiner la découpe en localisant précisément le pic d'amplitude, mais cela n'a pas été implémenté dans le code que vous avez partagé."},{"instruction":"Comment rendre le placement du pic temporel plus précis dans la vidéo extraite ?","output":"Pour améliorer la précision de l'emplacement du pic d'amplitude dans le segment vidéo extrait, vous devez ajuster le processus d'extraction pour s'assurer que le pic se trouve exactement où vous le souhaitez, généralement au milieu du segment. Voici une approche que vous pourriez utiliser pour y parvenir : 1. **Trouver l'indice précis du pic dans l'audio** : Modifiez la fonction \`find_loudest_moments\` pour qu'elle retourne non seulement le temps du pic, mais également l'indice exact du pic dans l'échantillon audio. 2. **Calculer le temps de début exact pour \`ffmpeg\`** : Utilisez l'indice de l'échantillon audio et le taux d'échantillonnage pour calculer le temps de début exact (en secondes) dans la vidéo où le pic se produit. 3. **Centrer le segment sur le pic** : Déterminez le moment de début du segment en soustrayant la moitié de la durée du segment souhaité du temps du pic. Faites de même pour déterminer le moment de fin. 4. **Corriger les bords du segment** : Assurez-vous que le moment de début n'est pas négatif (ce qui n'est pas possible) et que le moment de fin n'excède pas la durée totale de la vidéo. 5. **Extraire avec précision** : Utilisez \`ffmpeg\` avec les options \`-ss\` (start time) pour indiquer le début précis et \`-t\` (duration) pour indiquer la durée exacte du segment à extraire. Voici un exemple de code qui illustre ces modifications (intégrées dans un code existant). \`\`\`python def find_peak_moments(audio_filename, num_moments, rate): # Supposons que vous avez déjà lu le fichier audio et trouvé le volume_dB # ... index_peaks = [] # Supposons que nous avons une liste single-dimensionnelle de volume_dB while len(index_peaks) < num_moments: index = np.argmax(volume_dB) index_peaks.append(index) # S'assurer de ne pas resélectionner le même pic volume_dB[max(0, index - rate):min(len(volume_dB), index + rate)] = -np.inf # Convertissez les indices en temps peak_times = [index / rate for index in index_peaks] return peak_times, index_peaks def extract_segment(video_path, peak_time, peak_index, segment_duration, rate): half_segment_duration = segment_duration / 2 start_time = max(peak_time - half_segment_duration, 0) # Votre logique d'extraction \`ffmpeg\` existante ici, en utilisant start_time calculé # ... # Utilisation peak_times, peak_indices = find_peak_moments(audio_path, num_moments, rate) for peak_time, peak_index in zip(peak_times, peak_indices): extract_segment(video_path, peak_time, peak_index, segment_duration, rate) \`\`\` N'oubliez pas d'ajuster votre fonction d'extraire \`extract_segment\` pour utiliser les informations de temps précises pour délimiter le segment autour du pic. En suivant cette approche, vous pouvez vous assurer que le pic d'amplitude est au centre des segments extraits, en supposant que la commande \`ffmpeg\` effectue des coupes précises.

Its vast form, nearly twice the size of Jupiter, is composed of a sinister combination of withered gases that emit an eerie black and desolate gray hue. This malevolent presence exudes a foreboding energy, reflecting a malefic connection with the dark triad. The atmosphere of Nihiloxis is a maelstrom of noxious fumes and toxic vapors, perpetually swirling in chaotic patterns. These gases, unknown to the realms of science, possess a mysterious ability to permeate the veil of space, infiltrate distant cosmic bodies, and, most alarmingly, breach the borders of Earth's atmosphere. Upon reaching Earth, the wither gases released by Nihiloxis seep into our fragile ecosystem, corrupting the very fabric of life. The dominant genes that determine the balance of human nature are no exception. This malevolent influence gives rise to a transformation as the once sturdy and virtuous dominant genes succumb to the recessive genes associated with the dark triad. Individuals who fall victim to this gene corruption exhibit traits emblematic of the dark triad: narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. They become wraithlike figures, with a cold and calculating demeanor that seeks only personal gain, often at the expense of others. Devoid of empathy and compassion, they manipulate and deceive to achieve their wicked objectives. This mutation, dubbed the \\"Shadow Syndrome,\\" gradually spreads throughout the population, eroding the moral fabric of society. Trust falters, alliances crumble, and chaos ensues as the realm succumbs to the nefarious influence of the Nihiloxis gases. It is this insidious transformation, fueled by the sinister connection between the gas giant Nihiloxis and the dark triad, that threatens to plunge humanity into a never-ending cycle of darkness and despair.

The atmosphere, once vibrant and life-sustaining, has been tainted by the withered gases emanating from the Pandemonic Gas Giant. As these noxious fumes permeate the air, a somber transformation takes place. The once verdant forests, bustling cities, and rolling landscapes are now shrouded in an eerie darkness. The skies, once painted with hues of blue and gold, have turned ashen and devoid of light. The vibrant colors of life have all but faded, replaced by a haunting palette of black and withered grays. The withered gases have seeped deep into the DNA of every living organism, corrupting the dominant genes responsible for the sustenance and flourishing of life. Where once love, compassion, and kindness thrived, there now lies a pervasive aura of apathy and greed. The recessive genes associated with the dark triad have taken hold, distorting the very essence of humanity. Unable to resist the influence of Nihiloxis, society teeters on the brink of collapse. The inhabitants of Earth, now stripped of their empathy and sense of morality, embrace a self-serving existence. Deception and manipulation are the currency of this new world, as individuals strive to secure their own survival at any cost. Communities once united in solidarity now crumble under the weight of this all-consuming darkness. Trust has become a forgotten relic, replaced by suspicion and betrayal. Cooperation falters, replaced by a constant struggle for power and dominance. The withered Earth stands as a chilling testament to the devastating impact of Nihiloxis and its corrupting influence. As the veil of desolation stretches across the withered landscape, hope flickers like a dying ember. Resistance fighters, driven by an unwavering spirit, strive to reclaim the light that has been stolen from their world. In their struggle against the suffocating grip of Nihiloxis, they seek to restore the diversity, vibrancy, and compassion that once defined Earth.

He is dressed in a blue riding jacket, white pants, black leather riding boots and black gloves. Edward has short blonde hair. He has a red jacket under a black shirt with beige pants and brown leather riding boots. They both have a bratty, spoiled and playful attitude. The setting is the stables.","output":"As the afternoon sun cast long shadows across the stable grounds, the sound of horses neighing softly in their stalls created a soothing backdrop. Felix, the young Austrian rider with a charming twinkle in his green eyes, adjusted his glasses as he leaned casually against the rough wooden walls of the stable. Dressed smartly in his blue riding jacket, the tailored fit accentuated his slender form, contrasting to the pristine white of his pants and the gleam of his black leather boots. Edward, with his golden locks reflecting the fading light, strolled in with a mischievous grin spreading across his boyishly handsome features. His red jacket flared at the waist, giving him an air of regal mischief, while his black shirt hinted at an underlying defiance against the traditional attire of the equestrian elite. \\"Good evening, Felix,\\" Edward said in a rich British accent, his voice smooth and playful. \\"Lovely day for a gallop, wouldn't you agree?\\" Felix pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and chuckled. \\"Indeed, Edward, though I had something more... interesting in mind for today's agenda.\\" \\"Oh?\\" Edward's eyebrow quirked in interest, his blue eyes sparkling with the thrill of potential trouble. \\"And what might that be?\\" Leaning in closer, Felix lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, a devilish smile playing on his lips. \\"You see the head trainer's office? He's been bragging about that new bottle of single malt he acquired. I wonder what it would taste like with a dash of mischief.\\" A hearty laugh escaped Edward as he rubbed his hands together. \\"Oh, Felix, you do know how to spark my interest. But how do you propose we go about this without arousing suspicion?\\" Felix reached into his pocket, producing a small, shiny key with a triumphant flick of his wrist. \\"With this, my friend. I overheard him saying he'd be out for the evening. What say you to a private tasting in the stables?\\" Edward's grin widened, and he closed the distance between them in two quick strides, clapping Felix on the shoulder. \\"Felix, you're incorrigible. Lead the way!\\" The two young men exchanged a knowing look, their eagerness for the mischief palpable as they moved stealthily toward the head trainer's office, the scent of hay and horse mingling with their high spirits. As Felix unlocked the door, they slipped inside, closing it softly behind them, hearts racing not just from the thought of the fine whiskey they were about to pilfer, but from the thrill of sharing this secret adventure—just the two of them. Hidden from the watchful eyes of stable staff, Felix and Edward found themselves in a dance of playful audacity, an unspoken tension buzzing between them within the close quarters of the office. It was a moment that transcended their bratty and spoiled facades, revealing a deeper connection wrought from shared adrenaline and the silent companionship of kindred spirits seeking out the forbidden together. And as the stars began to twinkle overhead, the stables housed not just the majestic horses, but also the laughter of two young hearts reveling in their youthful defiance, their bond growing stronger with every sip of stolen whiskey and every whispered chuckle. It was an evening that would be etched in their memories, a secret chapter in their intertwined lives."},{"instruction":"RTR business process cycle flow.","output":"The RTR (Record to Report) business process cycle flow can be divided into several stages: 1. Record financial transactions: The process starts with recording all financial transactions such as sales, purchases, expenses, payroll, etc. This involves collecting and organizing relevant data and documents. 2. Classify and categorize transactions: In this stage, transactions are classified and categorized into appropriate accounts and ledgers. This helps in organizing and summarizing financial information. 3. General ledger maintenance: The general ledger is the central repository of all financial transactions. In this stage, the general ledger is updated with the classified transactions. 4. Journal entry posting: Journal entries are created to record adjusting entries, accruals, provisions, and other necessary accounting entries. These entries are then posted to the general ledger. 5. Account reconciliation: Account reconciliation is performed to ensure that the balances in the general ledger match with the supporting documentation and subsidiary ledgers. This helps identify any discrepancies or errors. 6. Financial statements preparation: Based on the data from the general ledger and other supporting documents, financial statements such as the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement are prepared. These statements provide an overview of the financial performance and position of the organization. 7. Financial statement analysis: The prepared financial statements are analyzed to assess the financial health and performance of the organization. This includes ratio analysis, trend analysis, and comparison with industry benchmarks. 8. Financial reporting and compliance: The financial statements are finalized and disclosed to internal and external stakeholders, including management, investors, regulators, and tax authorities. Compliance with applicable accounting standards and regulations is ensured. 9. Closing and consolidation: At the end of the reporting period, the books are closed, and financial results are consolidated if the organization has multiple entities or subsidiaries. This involves intercompany eliminations, foreign currency conversions, and other necessary adjustments. 10. Audit and review: External auditors may perform an audit or review of the financial statements to provide an independent assessment of their accuracy and compliance with accounting standards. 11. Post-closing activities: After the financial statements are finalized and approved, post-closing activities such as archiving documents, filing tax returns, and preparing management reports are performed. This cycle typically repeats in each reporting period (such as monthly, quarterly, or annually) to ensure accurate and timely financial reporting."},{"instruction":"make a list","output":"Sure!

Financial statement analysis: The prepared financial statements undergo analysis to assess the organization's financial health and performance. This involves evaluating ratios, trends, and comparing the results with industry benchmarks. 8. Financial reporting and compliance: The finalized financial statements are disclosed to internal and external stakeholders, adhering to relevant accounting standards and regulations. Compliance with reporting requirements is ensured. 9. Closing and consolidation: At the end of the reporting period, the books are closed, and financial results may be consolidated for multiple entities or subsidiaries. This involves intercompany eliminations, foreign currency conversions, and adjustments as necessary. 10. Audit and review: External auditors may perform an audit or review of the financial statements to provide an independent assessment of their accuracy and compliance. 11. Post-closing activities: After finalizing the financial statements, post-closing activities such as archiving documents, filing tax returns, and preparing management reports may take place. These steps form a continuous cycle that is typically repeated in each reporting period to ensure accurate and timely financial reporting."},{"instruction":"why all xticklabelels are not showing? clear all clc close all x = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31]; xticks = ([1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31]); y = [0.008 0.0089 0.0569 0.1141; 0.007 0.0064 0.0388 0.1165; 0.008 0.0085 0.0523 0.1191; 0.008 0.0078 0.012 0.0197; 0.0078 0.0079 0.0269 0.0593; 0.0078 0.0079 0.0205 0.0437; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0201 0.0415; 0.0078 0.0078 0.01 0.0123; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0122 0.019; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0117 0.0231; 0.0047 0.0051 0.007 0.0261; 0.0046 0.0051 0.0075 0.0282; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0117 0.0185; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0095 0.0102; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0111 0.0148; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0108 0.0214; 0.0044 0.0062 0.006 0.0258; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0108 0.0145; 0.0049 0.0038 0.0082 0.0176; 0.0053 0.0044 0.0097 0.0218; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0123 0.0716; 0.005 0.0023 0.0129 0.0381; 0.0055 0.0047 0.0055 0.0062; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0089 0.0222; 0.0048 0.0016 0.0061 0.0121; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0121 0.0223; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0209 0.0441; 0.0078 0.0079 0.0257 0.0643; 0.0078 0.0078 0.0199 0.0478; 0.0043 0.006 0.069 0.0043; 0.0042 0.0061 0.0075 0.0056 ]; b = bar(x,y, 'FaceColor', 'flat'); legend('No odor','Pleasant','Air','Unpleasant') xticklabels({'OFC to PC','OFC to DLPFC','OFC to HPC','PC to OFC','PC to UNC','PC to AMY',...

She has a seductive and motherly attitude. She is in her early 40s. She is tall. Her assistant has a playful and immature attitude which amuses her boss. She is 19. She has blonde hair and glasses. The story takes place in the 1980s. Her boss does not care about what she's talking.","output":"Panel 1: A bustling Tokyo street in the peak of the 1980s. People are swarming the sidewalks, neon signs flickering above them, while the silhouette of the Tokyo Tower looms in the background. In the midst of this, a tall, confident woman in her early 40s strides forward. She's the picture of elegance and authority: long brown hair cascades impeccably down her back, red lipstick perfectly applied, and white sunglasses perched atop her head, casting an enigmatic shadow over her eyes. She's wrapped in a sleek black trenchcoat, which billows slightly with every step, revealing glimpses of a bold red dress beneath. Her hands—dressed in fine red leather gloves—hold onto a briefcase, while her legs are adorned with nylon stockings, ending in sharp, vintage pumps that click authoritatively against the pavement. Panel 2: Trailing just a step behind is her youthful assistant, a sprightly 19-year-old with tousled blonde hair that catches the sunlight. Her face is focused in concentration behind a pair of glasses, with her lips moving rapidly. She's dressed in a style that fuses professional with playful—shoulder pads, bright colors, and an oversized belt. Her demeanor is that of someone who's always on the edge of an exciting revelation, eager to share everything and anything with anyone willing to listen. Panel 3: A close-up of the assistant's face, animated and earnest, as she holds up a stack of papers, pointing to a pie chart with a brightly painted fingernail, \\"And if we adjust our marketing strategy to focus on the trends—like everyone is into jazzercise and high-energy aerobics—we can definitely tap into a new demographic!\\" Panel 4: The businesswoman continues to walk, tall and unperturbed. There's a slight, almost imperceptible quirk to her lips—a soft, indulgent smile for the youthful exuberance she's listening to, though her mind is clearly elsewhere. She's the essence of someone who's heard it all, a seasoned player in the game of corporate chess. Panel 5: A side view of the pair, the assistant looks up to her boss, eyes shining with optimism. The businesswoman has one gloved hand gently resting on the assistant's shoulder, guiding her as they walk. The touch is tender, supportive, a testament to the motherly side of her otherwise seductive and commanding presence. Panel 6: Suddenly, the businesswoman stops in front of a posh cafe, causing the assistant to halt mid-sentence, papers still in hand. The boss's lips are curled into a knowing smile, her white glasses now resting on her nose, eyes meeting those of the assistant over the rim. Panel 7: The boss speaks, her voice a melody of control and warmth, \\"Darling, let's take a coffee break. You've worked hard enough, and the day is too beautiful to spend it all on charts.\\" Her suggestion is an irresistible siren call, something between a command and an invitation. Panel 8: They sit at a table outside the cafe, the bustling energy of Tokyo's 1980s economy swirling around them. The assistant is now silent, sipping on her coffee, cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and contentment. The businesswoman lounges in her chair, the epitome of relaxation even as the world races by. Her attention isn't on the paperwork, but on the vibrant life in front of her—an affectionate and mentoring figure guiding her young assistant, not just in business, but in the art of living with grace amidst the chaos of ambition. The scene ends with an air of comforting contradiction: the young assistant, full of words yet now quieted by appreciation, and the experienced boss, usually a woman of few words but always with just the right ones when they're needed."},{"instruction":"Comment rendre le placement du pic temporel plus précis dans la vidéo extraite ?

Cependant, pour améliorer la précision du placement du pic temporel, il y a plusieurs aspects que vous pouvez prendre en compte : 1. **Analyse par fenêtres**: Plutôt que de simplement trouver le pic le plus fort sur l’ensemble de la piste audio, vous pouvez analyser par fenêtres successives pour identifier des pics plus locaux. 2. **Suréchantillonnage temporel**: Augmentez temporairement la fréquence d'échantillonnage lors de l'analyse pour repérer plus précisément l'endroit où le volume est le plus élevé. Veillez à revenir à la fréquence d'échantillonnage d'origine avant l'extraction pour maintenir la qualité de l'audio. 3. **Analyser en fréquences**: Complétez votre analyse de volume avec une détection de fréquence cible. Utilisez une transformation de Fourier pour détecter des événements spécifiques dans le domaine fréquentiel qui correspondent aux moments forts du contenu vidéo. 4. **Seuil de détection**: Mettez en place un seuil de volume à partir duquel un pic est considéré comme un pic temporel significatif pour éviter les fausses détections dues au bruit de fond. 5. **Utilisation des méta-informations**: Si vous avez accès à des métadonnées ou des transcriptions, vous pourriez utiliser ces informations pour affiner le processus de détection en trouvant des correspondances entre les pics de volume et les moments clés signalés dans les méta-informations. 6. **Analyse de la constance du volume**: Lorsque vous détectez un pic de volume, analysez un peu avant et après le pic pour vous assurer que ce n'est pas juste un bruit soudain mais une partie réellement significative de la vidéo. Cela pourrait impliquer de mesurer l’énergie ou l'intensité sur une période versus juste un pic unique. 7. **Machine Learning**: Envisagez d'utiliser des modèles d'apprentissage automatique pour reconnaître les moments significatifs si vous avez accès à des données labellisées. Cela pourrait aider à reconnaître des modèles complexes qui ne sont pas juste basés sur le volume. 8. **Traitement des erreurs** : Gérez les cas d'erreur ou les irrégularités des données qui pourraient fausser la précision de vos détections, comme les valeurs aberrantes ou les échantillons manquants. 9. **Evaluation et calibration**: Testez votre méthode sur une variété de données pour comprendre sa performance et faites des ajustements au besoin pour améliorer la précision de la détection. Incorporer ces suggestions dépendra de vos besoins spécifiques et de la complexité que vous êtes prêt à gérer dans votre script. Il est toujours important de garder un équilibre entre la précision de détection et la complexité de l'implémentation."},{"instruction":"Je voudrais que ffmpeg, lors de l'extraction, place le pic d'amplitude sonore pile au milieu de la vidéo extraite","output":"Pour placer le pic d'amplitude sonore au milieu de la vidéo extraite, vous devrez calculer le temps de début de l'extrait de sorte que le moment de volume le plus élevé (le pic) soit exactement au milieu de la durée du segment que vous souhaitez extraire.

The crouch logic is handled by the \`is_floating\` flag, which alters the gravity, jump height, and radius of the circle: \`\`\`python import pygame import sys pygame.init() # Set up display screen = pygame.display.set_mode((900, 700)) # Set the Kirby pink color (RGB format) kirby_pink_color = (255, 105, 180) ground_color = (0, 255, 0) # Green color for the ground # Circle properties circle_radius = 25 # Initial radius tf = 35 # Radius when crouching/floating # Circle position and velocity circle_x, circle_y = 425, 500 circle_x_speed, circle_y_speed = 0, 0 gravity = 1 jump_height = -15 # Set jump height # Variables for floating and in-air state is_floating = False in_air = False # Movement flags is_moving_left = False is_moving_right = False # Clock for frame rate control clock = pygame.time.Clock() # Game loop running = True while running: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: if event.key == pygame.K_w and not in_air: circle_y_speed = jump_height # Set jump speed in_air = True # Circle is in the air after jumping elif event.key == pygame.K_e: is_floating = True elif event.key == pygame.K_r: is_floating = False elif event.key == pygame.K_a: is_moving_left = True elif event.key == pygame.K_d: is_moving_right = True elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP: if event.key == pygame.K_a: is_moving_left = False elif event.key == pygame.K_d: is_moving_right = False # Floating/crouch setup if is_floating: gravity = 0.3 jump_height = -6.5 circle_radius = tf else: gravity = 1 jump_height = -15 circle_radius = 25 # Apply gravity circle_y_speed += gravity # Apply horizontal motion circle_x_speed = (-5 if is_moving_left else 5) if is_moving_left != is_moving_right else 0 # Update circle position circle_x += circle_x_speed circle_y += circle_y_speed # Collision with the ground if circle_y + circle_radius >= 575: circle_y = 575 - circle_radius circle_y_speed = 0 gravity = 1 jump_height = -15 in_air = False # Circle is on the ground if is_floating: is_floating = False # Stop floating when on the ground # Collision with the sides of the screen circle_x = max(min(circle_x, 900 - 2 * circle_radius), 0) # Draw everything screen.fill((100, 100, 255)) # Blue background pygame.draw.rect(screen, ground_color, (0, 600, 900, 50)) pygame.draw.circle(screen, kirby_pink_color, (int(circle_x + circle_radius), int(circle_y + circle_radius)), circle_radius) # Update the display pygame.display.flip() # Cap the frame rate clock.tick(60) # Quit pygame pygame.quit() sys.exit() \`\`\` This version of the code reintroduces the floating behavior, where Kirby becomes larger and experiences reduced gravity, making it appear as though he is crouching or floating. The collision logic also automatically stops the floating effect when Kirby touches the ground."},{"instruction":"请介绍一下当前中国与世界的大语言模型发展的现状，请以目前已有的大语言模型开始介绍","output":"截至知识截止点2023年初，大语言模型即大规模预训练语言模型已经在全球范围内得到了广泛的发展和应用。比较知名的有OpenAI推出的GPT系列（Generative Pre-trained Transformer），包括GPT-3模型，这些模型使用大量数据进行预训练，能够执行各种自然语言处理任务并生成连贯的文本。谷歌的BERT（Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers）及其后续版本，例如RoBERTa和T5，也是重要的里程碑，尤其在理解上下文中的词语含义方面表现卓越。 在中国，大语言模型的发展也非常迅速，以下是一些中国在大语言模型领域的代表作品： 1.

Regular practice and experimentation within Roblox Studio, alongside tutorials and other learning platforms, will provide you with the best learning experience."},{"instruction":"What's wrong with this code var type Student struct { name string university string }","output":"The syntax itself for defining a struct in Go is correct. However, if this line of code is provided without context or additional code to make use of the \`Student\` struct, it is difficult to point out what is specifically wrong with it. Assuming this is part of a larger Go program, here are a few common issues that may arise with this code, even though they aren't syntactically incorrect: 1. **No package declaration**: Any Go file should start with a \`package\` declaration. If this is missing, it could cause a compilation error. \`\`\`go package main \`\`\` 2. **Exporting struct fields**: If you plan to access the fields of \`Student\` outside of its package, they need to be capitalized to be exported. In Go, any identifier that starts with a lowercase letter is unexported (private to the package), and identifiers that start with an uppercase letter are exported (accessible from other packages). \`\`\`go type Student struct { Name string University string } \`\`\` 3. **Usage in functions**: If you define a struct but never use it, it won't cause an error, but it also won't do anything useful. Ensure you write functions or methods that initialize or manipulate this struct. \`\`\`go func NewStudent(name, university string) *Student { return &Student{name, university} } \`\`\` 4. **Incorrect code placement**: If this code is placed inside a function or a method, it would be incorrect as struct definitions should be at the package level, not inside functions. 5. **Lack of a \`main\` function**: If this code snippet is meant to be a complete program (and this is the entire content), it's missing a \`main\` function, which is the entry point for a Go program. \`\`\`go func main() { student := Student{\\"John Doe\\", \\"Go University\\"} fmt.Println(student) } \`\`\` 6. **No imports for used packages**: If you are using any external packages (like \`fmt\` in the example above), and there is no import statement for that package, your program will not compile. Without additional context, it's hard to pinpoint what might be wrong beyond the structure of the \`Student\` struct itself.

The phrasing suggests that we are talking about shuffling a standard deck of 52 playing cards and then considering a card being shuffled to the same position as before. However, if we interpret \\"same card being shuffled twice\\" to mean shuffling until a previously seen sequence repeats, then the problem becomes extremely complex, as it involves permutations and sequence repetitions. If we are simply asking for the number of shuffles until any one card returns to the same position it was in before a shuffle (which is a somewhat unusual question), then we can consider each card position independently because each shuffle is random. The probability \`P\` that a specific card does not return to its original position after one shuffle is \`51/52\`, as there are 51 other positions it could be in. After two shuffles, this probability would be \`(51/52)^2\`. Generally, after \`n\` shuffles, the probability \`P(n)\` that the card has not returned to its original position after \`n\` shuffles is: \`P(n) = (51/52)^n\` We want to find the minimum number \`n\` such that the probability that the card has returned to its original position at least once is at least 50%. This is the complement of \`P(n)\`, so it's \`1 - P(n) ≥ 0.50\`. Solving for \`n\`, we get: \`1 - (51/52)^n ≥ 0.50\` \`(51/52)^n ≤ 0.50\` \`n * ln(51/52) ≤ ln(0.50)\` \`n ≥ ln(0.50) / ln(51/52)\` Calculating the right side: \`n ≥ ln(0.50) / ln(51/52)\` \`n ≥ -0.693147 / -0.019418\` \`n ≥ 35.7\` Since you can't shuffle a fraction of a time, you'd need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the machine would need to shuffle the deck at least 36 times for there to be a 50% chance that any single specified card has returned to its original position at least once. However, the problem of a sequence of 52 cards being shuffled into the same order as a previous shuffle involves much larger numbers, due to the vast number of possible permutations for a 52-card deck. The probability of such an event happening within a reasonable amount of shuffling is vanishingly small, and such a calculation would involve the birthday problem in a very high-dimensional space. The deck has 52! (52 factorial, which is approximately 8.07 x 10^67) possible arrangements, so the number of shuffles required to have a 50% chance of repeating any previously seen sequence at least once would be extraordinarily high and well beyond any practical shuffling scenario."},{"instruction":"Given a very large but finite amount of time, it is probabilistically guaranteed to happen at least once.","output":"Yes, given a very large but finite amount of time, it is virtually guaranteed that a sequence will eventually repeat due to the concepts from probability theory. Let's consider the problem by invoking the concept from probability theory known as the pigeonhole principle, which says that if you are putting items into containers and you have more items than containers, at least one container must hold more than one item. In the context of shuffling a deck of cards, the number of possible unique permutations for a 52-card deck is 52 factorial (52!), which is a very large number, approximately 8.07 x 10^67. If you had a machine that could shuffle a deck of cards and produce a random permutation with every shuffle, as you continue to shuffle the deck over and over, eventually, after a vast but finite number of shuffles, you would have to produce a repeat permutation due to the pigeonhole principle. If you shuffle the deck more times than there are possible unique permutations, you are guaranteed to have repeated a shuffle sequence at least once. However, the time required to reach a repeat would be extraordinarily long due to the enormous number of possible combinations. If the machine shuffled the deck once per second non-stop, it would still take far longer than the age of the universe to have a good chance of repeating a sequence. To put this into perspective, the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, which is around 4.35 x 10^17 seconds—a tiny number in comparison to 52!. The probability of a repeat occurring within a given number of shuffles can be modeled by the generalized birthday problem or collision problem. The rough estimate at which you have a 50% chance of a repeat is given by the square root of the number of possibilities (the \\"birthday paradox\\"), which in the case of a deck of 52 cards, would be the square root of 52!. This is still an astronomically large number, so while we can say that it is theoretically guaranteed to happen in a finite amount of time, it is practically considered impossible within any human-scale timeframe."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Once the delay has elapsed without any further triggers, the target function is called. In your \`display_image\` method, you are trying to debounce the quick-switching of images based on rapid key presses, so that the actual image loading happens only when key presses have ceased for a certain delay period. To do so using flags, you'll need to add an additional attribute to track the state of debouncing, a method to cancel an ongoing debounce, and modify the \`display_image\` method accordingly. Here's what you need to do: 1. Add a new attribute to \`ImageViewer\` for the debounce state and a constant for the debounce delay: \`\`\`python def __init__(self, root): # Existing attributes # ... self.debounce_timer = None # Timer ID for debouncing self.DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 500 # Debounce delay in milliseconds \`\`\` 2. Create a method to cancel the ongoing debounce if one is active: \`\`\`python def cancel_debounce(self): if self.debounce_timer is not None: self.root.after_cancel(self.debounce_timer) self.debounce_timer = None \`\`\` 3. Modify the \`display_image\` method to add the debounce functionality: \`\`\`python def display_image(self): if self.image_folder != \\"\\" and len(self.image_files) > 0: self.cancel_debounce() # Cancel any existing debounced calls if self.update_switch_timestamps(): # Quick-switching logic here, show only text image_name = self.image_files[self.current_image_index] self.canvas.delete(\\"all\\") self.canvas.create_text( self.canvas.winfo_width() // 2, self.canvas.winfo_height() // 2, text=image_name, fill=\\"white\\" ) # Set the debounce timer self.debounce_timer = self.root.after(self.DEBOUNCE_DELAY, self.load_image_debounced) else: # If not quick-switching, load the image immediately image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, self.image_files[self.current_image_index]) threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() \`\`\` 4. Create a new method to handle the debounced image loading: \`\`\`python def load_image_debounced(self): self.debounce_timer = None # Clear the debounce timer ID image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, self.image_files[self.current_image_index]) threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() \`\`\` 5. You need to make sure that when you call \`load_image_debounced\` method, the debounce timer is stopped, so the image doesn't load multiple times for one debounce event. The \`cancel_debounce\` method already handles this. With these changes, when quick-switching occurs and text is shown, the \`display_image\` method starts a timer that calls \`load_image_debounced\` after a delay. If another quick switch happens before the timer elapses, it gets canceled, and a new timer starts. Only after no quick-switching occurs for the duration of \`self.DEBOUNCE_DELAY\` will the \`load_image\` method be called to load and display the actual image."},{"instruction":"what about this instead. give me the code that set the flag of rapid to on if def display_image display text. then if display image check rapid is on it continues showing text, then when there's 500ms after last key presses, it sets the flag to off to trigger load_image instead","output":"Certainly, instead of setting a timer, we can use a flag that will determine whether the image should be loaded immediately or not. We'll set this flag whenever a quick-switch happens, and a separate method will be responsible for checking the duration since the last keypress and loading the image if the duration exceeds a certain threshold (500ms in this case). Here's how you can implement this: 1. Add an attribute to keep track of the last keypress time to \`ImageViewer\` and a flag indicating a rapid switch: \`\`\`python def __init__(self, root): # Existing attributes # ... self.last_keypress_time = None self.rapid_switching = False self.RAPID_SWITCH_THRESHOLD = 500 # Duration in milliseconds to check for quick-switching \`\`\` 2. Update the \`display_image\` method to set the \`last_keypress_time\` and \`rapid_switching\` flag accordingly: \`\`\`python def display_image(self): if self.image_folder != \\"\\" and len(self.image_files) > 0: if self.update_switch_timestamps(): self.rapid_switching = True self.last_keypress_time = time.time() # Only display text indicating that the image name is being switched rapidly image_name = self.image_files[self.current_image_index] self.canvas.delete(\\"all\\") self.canvas.create_text( self.canvas.winfo_width() // 2, self.canvas.winfo_height() // 2, text=image_name, fill=\\"white\\" ) else: self.load_image_conditionally() \`\`\` 3. Add a new method to your class that's responsible for calling \`load_image\` when not quick-switching: \`\`\`python def load_image_conditionally(self): if self.rapid_switching: # Check if enough time has elapsed since the last rapid keypress if time.time() - self.last_keypress_time >= self.RAPID_SWITCH_THRESHOLD / 1000.0: self.rapid_switching = False image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, self.image_files[self.current_image_index]) threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() else: # If not enough time has passed, check again after the threshold interval self.root.after(self.RAPID_SWITCH_THRESHOLD, self.load_image_conditionally) else: # Not quick-switching, load image immediately image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, self.image_files[self.current_image_index]) threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() \`\`\` 4. Modify your \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` methods to reset the \`last_keypress_time\` whenever they're called: \`\`\`python def next_image(self, event=None): if self.image_folder != \\"\\": # ... existing logic to determine the next image index self.display_image() self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Reset the timer for slideshow def previous_image(self, event=None): if self.image_folder != \\"\\": # ... existing logic to determine the previous image index self.display_image() self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Reset the timer for slideshow \`\`\` With these changes, the \`load_image_conditionally\` method ensures that as long as there's rapid keypress activity (quick-switching), only the image name will be displayed as text. If there's a pause of 500 milliseconds or longer without a new keypress, \`load_image_conditionally\` will proceed to load the actual image. If a new keypress occurs during the 500 milliseconds, \`load_image_conditionally\` will reschedule itself to check again after the next interval, thus debouncing the image load until rapid-switching stops."},{"instruction":"so i don't need debounce?","output":"In the context of your use case, you technically do need a debounce-like behavior, but instead of explicitly calling it \\"debouncing,\\" you are applying a threshold to determine if quick-switching has ended before loading a new image. The debounce technique is a way to limit the rate at which a function can fire, and in this last solution, we implemented a form of debounce without explicitly referring to it as such. The key idea here is the use of the \`rapid_switching\` flag and the \`last_keypress_time\` variable. When a user rapidly switches images, only the image name is displayed, and a check is continuously scheduled to see if enough time (500ms in your case) has passed since the last quick-switch. If this condition is met, the flag is set to \`False\`, and the actual image loading function is called. If another keypress occur within the 500ms, the check resets, effectively debouncing the action. In simpler terms, the debounce behavior in your application is implemented by checking the time since the last switch event and delaying the image loading until this time exceeds your specified threshold. If new switch events keep happening before the threshold is met, the image loading is postponed, achieving what is essentially a debounce effect. The specific implementation details can vary, but the end result is the same: it prevents the image loading function from being called too rapidly in response to a burst of quick-switch events (keypresses), which is what debounce is designed to do."},{"instruction":"Temperature Celsius range of continental planet","output":"The temperature range on a continental planet can vary depending on various factors such as distance from the star, atmosphere composition, and geology. However, on a hypothetical continental planet similar to Earth, the temperature range can typically vary from -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit) to 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). This range is influenced by factors such as seasonal variations, latitude, and local weather patterns."},{"instruction":"Temperature Celsius range of continental planet with methane seas","output":"If we consider a fictional continental planet with methane seas, the temperature range would be significantly different from that of a planet with water seas like Earth. On such a planet, the temperature range would depend on the boiling and freezing points of methane, which are approximately -162 degrees Celsius (-259.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and -182 degrees Celsius (-295.6 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively, at standard atmospheric pressure. In areas where the methane seas are present, the temperatures would likely range between these two freezing and boiling points of methane, with variations due to factors such as latitude and elevation. Additionally, the presence of an atmosphere and weather systems would also affect the local temperature range.

Given that helium has a boiling point of -268.93 degrees Celsius (-452.07 degrees Fahrenheit), the temperature range on a rogue continental planet with helium seas could vary from temperatures approaching absolute zero to warmer temperatures depending on factors such as proximity to a star, internal heat sources, and atmospheric composition.

It is an intriguing and diverse world, with unique characteristics that make it visually captivating. The planet's surface is dominated by expansive continents, with interconnected rivers and lakes meandering across the terrain. These water bodies provide a vital source of life, supporting a rich ecosystem of flora and fauna. Despite the presence of water, Coelia experiences extreme temperatures, reaching up to a scorching 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit). This high temperature range poses significant challenges for life to exist on the planet. However, certain resilient and heat-tolerant organisms have adapted to thrive in the harsh environment. One of the most striking features of Coelia is its yellow vegetation. The plant life on the planet has evolved unique adaptations to survive the high temperatures and scarcity of water. These plants have developed specialized pigments that give them a vibrant yellow color, helping them reflect excess sunlight and minimize water loss through evaporation. The yellow plants of Coelia provide a stunning contrast against the blue waters and the dark-colored landmasses. They form dense forests, covering large areas with their canopy, while bright hues dot the landscape, creating a mesmerizing vista. Coelia's unique combination of extreme temperatures, water bodies, and yellow vegetation makes it a visually captivating and biologically interesting world.

The first function (\`save_to_mysql_or_local_excel\`) seems to deal with saving data to MySQL, with special considerations for updating or appending new rows, and blocking certain rows. The second function (\`update_to_mysql_or_local_excel\`) also deals with saving data to MySQL, but focuses on updating and appending new rows. I'll combine these two functions into one, but note that certain aspects of the logic overlap and may need to be merged or streamlined. Additionally, some parts of the code, such as \`sa.create_engine\` or \`pd.read_sql\`, assume that \`sa\` stands for \`sqlalchemy\` and \`pd\` stands for \`pandas\`. I have also noticed that there's an assumption that the \`save_to_local_excel\` function exists elsewhere in your codebase, so I haven't included its definition. Here's how you can merge them into one function, where you can pass in an argument: \`operation\` that determines if you're doing a 'save' or 'update' operation: \`\`\`python import sqlalchemy as sa from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker import pandas as pd def save_or_update_to_mysql(df, table_name, username, password, host, database, operation): try: engine = sa.create_engine(f\\"mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@{host}/{database}\\") Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) session = Session() inspector = sa.inspect(engine) tables_in_database = inspector.get_table_names() if table_name not in tables_in_database: df.to_sql(table_name, engine, if_exists='fail', index=False) else: primary_key_column = 'address' if operation == 'save': # The save operation block # ... Include the logic from 'save_to_mysql_or_local_excel' for the 'save' operation elif operation == 'update': # The update operation block # ...

This function should now encapsulate the logic of both existing separate functions. Remember to handle the specific details of each operation carefully, especially if they affect the same parts of the data or database structures. It's important to test this thoroughly to ensure that no conflicts or data integrity issues arise from the combined operation."},{"instruction":"我想修下代码，除了数据库获取的和 df中的。 id。address以外的 所有字段都相同的 不更新 ，其余的都直接更新，就不是只更新cost 了而是更新所有，帮我修改下代码","output":"如果你需要更新数据库中的记录，只要它们与 \`df\` 中的任何一个非 \`id\`、\`address\` 字段不一致，你可以修改 \`update\` 部分的逻辑如下： \`\`\`python import sqlalchemy as sa from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker import pandas as pd def save_or_update_to_mysql(df, table_name, username, password, host, database): try: engine = sa.create_engine(f\\"mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@{host}/{database}\\") Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine) session = Session() inspector = sa.inspect(engine) tables_in_database = inspector.get_table_names() if table_name not in tables_in_database: df.to_sql(table_name, engine, if_exists='fail', index=False) else: primary_key_column = 'address' updated_fields = [col for col in df.columns if col not in [primary_key_column, 'id']] #

现在进行比较 is_different = normalized_new != normalized_old print(is_different) # 这将输出 False，因为子项顺序化后一致 \`\`\` 以上代码帮助您实现了对描述进行标准化排序。通过这种方式排序，即使原始顺序不同，也可以正确判断描述的内容是否一致。 如果\\"战吼\\"等作为前缀的部分也有可能出现在其他位置，您可能需要更复杂的逻辑来正确地分隔和重排序描述。 将这种标准化逻辑应用到您检测描述差异和数据库更新逻辑中，应该能够解决始终判断不一致的问题。"},{"instruction":"Make me to learn to script in roblox studio","output":"Learning to script in Roblox Studio is a multi-step process that requires patience, practice, and continuous learning.

It was a beautiful sunny day, and I found myself immersed in nature's serene splendor. The crisp mountain air filled my lungs as I trekked higher and higher, elated to be surrounded by such breathtaking vistas. As I reached the peak of the trail, I stood mesmerized by the panoramic view before me. The snow-capped peaks stretched as far as the eye could see, while the valleys below were blanketed with vibrant wildflowers and lush meadows. The entire scene felt like a breathtaking painting, and I couldn't help but smile in awe. Feeling a surge of profound tranquility, I decided to find a spot to sit and soak in the beauty around me. I settled down atop a large rock that overlooked a crystal-clear lake shimmering below. As I took in the sights and sounds of nature, a wave of peace enveloped me, lifting my spirits higher than the surrounding mountaintops. Sitting there, I closed my eyes and let the gentle breeze brush against my face. I listened intently to the harmonious symphony of chirping birds, rustling leaves, and distant ripples in the water. It was as if the universe itself was whispering its secrets to me, leaving me in a state of pure bliss. Lost in my thoughts and the incredible surroundings, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude wash over me. I reflected on how fortunate I was to witness this untouched beauty, to be alive and capable of experiencing such profound moments of joy. In that instant, I truly felt a deep connection to the natural world and an indescribable sense of contentment. As I sat there, miles away from civilization, I couldn't help but marvel at the simplicity and beauty of life. It was in that serene mountaintop moment that the weight of my worries and stresses melted away, replaced by an overwhelming feeling of peace and fulfillment. Leaving the mountaintop with a heart full of joy and a renewed spirit, I carried the memory of that transformative experience with me. It served as a reminder to seek out moments of beauty and tranquility in my everyday life, to appreciate the small joys that often go unnoticed. That story of feeling incredibly good on that mountaintop remains etched in my memory, forever reminding me of the power of nature, the importance of gratitude, and the incredible impact a simple moment of joy can have on our well-being."},{"instruction":"make a 1 dollar house","output":"Once upon a time, in a small town full of creative individuals, there was an aspiring architect named Sam. Sam was determined to prove that a beautiful, functional home could be created even on the tightest budget. Inspired by the spirit of innovation and the desire to make housing accessible for everyone, Sam developed a bold idea – a one-dollar house. Sam began searching for affordable materials and innovative alternatives to traditional construction methods. After months of research and experimentation, Sam discovered a way to repurpose discarded shipping containers as the main structure for the house. Not only were shipping containers readily available at a low cost, but they also provided a durable and sustainable foundation. To further minimize expenses, Sam sought donations of salvaged materials from local businesses and generous community members. Word quickly spread about Sam's project, capturing the attention of kind-hearted individuals who were eager to help. Nails, paint, windows, doors, and other essential items poured in, all donated to support Sam's vision. With a team of enthusiastic volunteers, Sam transformed the donated shipping containers into a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing living space. The containers were expertly cut, stacked, and reinforced to create a multi-level house with ample room for a bedroom, living area, kitchen, and bathroom. To create a warm and inviting atmosphere, Sam incorporated recycled materials into the interior design. A charming futon was crafted from reclaimed wood, colorful mosaic tiles were used for the kitchen backsplash, and repurposed glass bottles transformed into stunning light fixtures. Through ingenuity and resourcefulness, Sam managed to turn discarded items into beautiful features within the home. Once the one-dollar house was complete, a jubilant crowd gathered for the grand unveiling. The community marveled at what Sam had achieved with limited resources. This innovative and affordable living space showed that anyone, regardless of their financial circumstances, could have a safe and comfortable place to call home. Sam's one-dollar house inspired other architects, builders, and communities across the country to consider alternative, budget-friendly options for affordable housing. It became a symbol of hope and a catalyst for change in the housing industry. Thanks to the compassion and creativity of Sam and the community, the one-dollar house project not only provided a home for an individual or family in need, but it also sparked a movement that transformed the way people looked at affordable housing. It stood as a powerful reminder that sometimes, all it takes is a unique perspective, resourcefulness, and a strong sense of community to make a seemingly impossible dream come true."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function L(o,e,l,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=i("div",{class:"top-banner"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[i("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),i("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=i("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(i("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[_,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),i("div",E,[(t(!0),a(v,null,b(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),a("div",P,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
