They are often complex and can change frequently, so it is important to consult a legal expert or the latest legal texts for the most up-to-date information. However, I can provide a general comparison of sweepstakes laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Cyprus as of my last update in 2023. # 1. United States In the U.S., sweepstakes are regulated by both federal and state laws, making the rules quite complex. Federal laws include, but are not limited to, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations that require transparency about the terms and conditions of the sweepstakes, including clear disclosure of the rules, the odds of winning, and a statement that no purchase is necessary to enter or win. Each state may have its own additional regulations. For instance, certain types of sweepstakes may be prohibited in some states. Additionally, states like New York and Florida require sweepstakes with prizes over a certain value to be registered. Also noteworthy is that while sweepstakes are legal, lotteries (which require consideration, such as a purchase or payment, to enter) are not, unless they are state-run. # 2. United Kingdom In the UK, the Gambling Act 2005 is the primary legislation that covers sweepstakes, which are referred to as \\"prize competitions\\" and \\"free draws\\". For a promotion to be legally considered a prize competition, it must require some level of skill, judgment, or knowledge to enter, so that not all participants are guaranteed a prize. Free draws, which are more similar to the US style sweepstakes, are also allowed under certain conditions. Both types of promotions must be organized in such a way that they do not constitute a lottery, which would require a license. The UK also has strict regulations regarding advertising, and promotions must follow guidelines set by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), ensuring they are not misleading and that they clearly communicate any terms and conditions associated with the promotion. # 3. Cyprus Cyprus follows the European Union's directives regarding promotions, competitions, and sweepstakes as part of its law. The primary legal framework that would apply to sweepstakes in Cyprus is the Betting Law of 2019, which consolidates various laws relating to betting and gambling. Promotions that involve elements of chance for no entry fee (similar to sweepstakes in the U.S.) are generally legal, provided they do not constitute gambling under Cyprus law. This means that the promotion must not have a direct buy-in or purchase requirement as a condition of entry. Furthermore, Cyprus's consumer protection laws, influenced by EU directives, require transparent communication about the terms and conditions of the promotion. It's important, however, to note that specific laws regulating sweepstakes directly might not be as explicitly defined as in the U.S. or UK, and consulting with a local legal expert is advisable. # Conclusion While sweepstakes can be a fun and effective promotional tool, the laws governing them can be intricate and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Organizers of international sweepstakes need to ensure compliance not only with the laws of the country where they are based but also with the laws of any countries where participants might enter their sweepstakes. Consulting with legal professionals experienced in this area is essential to navigate the complexities of these laws successfully."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical 'DOOM' franchise theme park ride.

Various trope sitcom setups result ...","output":"Title: \\"A Brush with Life\\" Synopsis: \\"A Brush with Life\\" is a lighthearted and eccentric British sitcom set in the late 1970s, centered around Jane Pritchard, a quirky and determined young artist trying to make her mark in the bustling art scene of London. Jane's North London flat, cluttered with her paintings, art supplies, and an assortment of vintage furniture, serves as the main set, where most of the comedic mishaps and heartwarming moments unfold. Characters: Jane Pritchard: The protagonist, Jane is in her late 20s, with a vibrant personality and a never-say-die attitude toward her struggling art career. She's resourceful and often comes up with inventive, yet sometimes comically flawed, plans to get her artwork noticed. Betty: Jane's best friend, a sassy fashion designer, who uses the flat as her runway for trying out new and outrageous designs. Betty’s penchant for drama and her connections in the fashion world often pave the way for interesting situations and characters to enter Jane's life. Mr. Tibbles: The curmudgeonly landlord, always on Jane's case for the rent, provides a foil to her and her friends’ escapades. Despite his gruff exterior, Mr. Tibbles has a soft spot for Jane and occasionally ends up being an unlikely participant in her schemes. Charlie: The charmingly awkward neighbor with aspirations of becoming a musician, Charlie frequently finds himself roped into Jane's art projects and exhibitions. Though his feelings for Jane are palpable, their timing always seems to be off. Episode Format: Each episode revolves around Jane's attempts to navigate the art world, manage her oddball friendships, and make ends meet, often leading to humorous misunderstandings, elaborate plans to land an art exhibition, or quirky ways to pay the rent. Intermingled with these plots are the personal growth and relationship dynamics of the main characters. Episodes: 1. **Art and Soul** - Jane attempts to get a prestigious art gallery to display her work, leading to a series of comedic misinterpretations that result in an impromptu art show in her flat. 2. **Model Behavior** - Betty decides Jane's next project should involve fashion, leading to a chaotic photoshoot in the flat with Mr. Tibbles unwittingly becoming the star of the show. 3. **The Sound of Music** - Charlie tries to impress a music producer by hosting a small concert in Jane's flat, but the evening takes a turn when Jane’s newest sculpture becomes a bizarre musical instrument. 4. **Rent Roulette** - With rent due and funds low, Jane and Betty host a series of art and fashion classes in the flat, leading to a sequence of amusing and enlightening encounters. 5. **Critics and Consequences** - A misunderstood art critic takes Jane's casual remark as a profound artistic statement, leading to unforeseen fame and a comedic exploration of the art world's pretentiousness. Overall, \\"A Brush with Life\\" is a delightful mix of wit, slapstick, and heartfelt moments, capturing the essence of late 70s London through the lens of an aspiring artist and her eclectic circle of friends. The show celebrates creativity, perseverance, and the importance of friendship with a nostalgic touch."},{"instruction":"I would change Mr. Tibbles, to Father O'Riley, (The Flat is rented from the Church).","output":"Revamping the character to better fit within the whimsical world of \\"A Brush with Life,\\" let's introduce Father O'Riley into Jane Pritchard's life: Father O'Riley: The unexpectedly jovial priest who owns Jane's flat on behalf of the local church. Despite his religious vocation, Father O'Riley has a keen interest in the arts and sees potential in Jane's endeavors, although he still must, much to his own reluctance, remind her about the realities of rent and keeping the peace within the building. His appearances in the flat are often accompanied by quirky wisdom and unexpected talents, adding layers of comedic and heartwarming interactions with the main characters. Adjusting Episode \\"Rent Roulette\\" to Fit Father O'Riley: **Episode 4. Holy Rents and Revelations** - With the rent deadline looming and Jane's bank balance looking more like a modern art piece of its own, she and Betty brainstorm ideas to make quick cash. Father O'Riley's casual mention of the church's need for fresh community outreach programs gives Jane a lightbulb moment. The flat is swiftly turned into a makeshift art gallery and workshop space, offering everything from \\"Paint Like Picasso\\" classes to \\"Fashion Design with a Divine Touch\\" workshops, led by Betty. The event brings the community closer, fills Jane's rent envelope, and surprises Father O'Riley with the flat's, and more broadly, art's ability to bring together people of all walks of life. He even ends up leading an impromptu seminar on the artistry of stained glass windows, revealing his previously hidden passion for glassworking, much to the amusement and delight of the attendees. By weaving in Father O'Riley, \\"A Brush with Life\\" not only touches on the humorous aspects of Jane's struggle as an artist but also subtly explores themes of community, faith in one's self and talents, and the unexpected places support can come from. Father O'Riley's character becomes integral in bridging different worlds together, showing that art and faith can coexist in enriching and comedic ways."},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the villain moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, they always mistake some character for a famous person because of their surname being literally the same as a real life celebrity, forcing the character to correct them angrily, Shaggy is often the one who would mishear a location name, leading to someone correcting him angrily and why, Velma is often rudely interrupted by the gang insulting her when she says something too scientifically smart, they always know that a place they are going to doesn't sound like it exists, they also know something in a place they go to shouldn't even be there as it makes no sense, they question names of things or people and why, and even question the motives and why (Plus they constantly do pop culture references and jokes, and mentions of famous people, games, songs, and shows occasionally in the prompt: The snakes close in on the Gang, but Scooby produces a trumpet and starts playing it, charming the snakes.

The villain of the hour, Uncle Cosmo, is outright refusing to help Harriet locate the fabled Temple of Sirius. His reason? Probably because every villain in a Scooby-Doo episode has the navigational skills of a GPS without signal.* **Harriet Mullins**: \\"Cosmo, darling, help us find the Temple or the brainy one gets it!\\" *Cut to a dimly lit room where Velma is flicking through a physics book, completely oblivious to the supposed danger she's in. Meanwhile, the gang, upon hearing about their next adventure location, is already lost in translation.* **Shaggy**: \\"Like, did you say we’re going to the Temple of Serious? Why so serious, man?\\" **Fred**, through gritted teeth: \\"It's SIRIUS, Shaggy. As in, the star, not the Joker's catchphrase.\\" *The group makes it to Harriet’s Castle only to be welcomed by zombie guards who've clearly attended the Ministry of Silly Walks. Scrappy, with the subtlety of a wrecking ball, snatches the keys, leading to a comical chase ensuing, ending with Fred's net trick—a classic.* *Fast forward past some questionable physics involving Scooby charming snakes with jazz and our heroes somehow becoming aquatic adventurers fleeing from rock-throwing zombies in canoes being eaten by piranhas. Our protagonists finally find themselves at the Temple of Sirius, greeted by the welcoming committee of... space suits.* **Velma**, excitedly: \\"According to my calculations, these are genuine—\\" **Daphne**, interrupting: \\"Look, Velma, I love you, but if you start talking about the air pressure in space suits again, I’m gonna scream.\\" *As they venture inside, Uncle Cosmo frets about the villains, but Scooby is more focused on chasing down a monkey who's stolen his Scooby Snacks. The encounter with the space suit? Well, let’s just say NASA probably didn’t account for a Great Dane in their design specifications.* *Deep within the temple, a treasure is discovered; an egg-shaped jewel that Daphne mistakes for an interstellar omelet. Yet, the real treasure is apparently a \\"million-year-old computer\\" that Scrappy eagerly pronounces is ancient tech. A tap from Scooby, and the contraption whirrs into life, revealing two aliens who’ve apparently been waiting millennia for someone with Scooby’s unique touch.* **Alien #1**: \\"Thank you, Earth canine. We’ve been trying to turn that on using voice commands for 6,000 years.\\" *Everyone is baffled, especially Velma, who's about to launch into a scientific explanation when the gang collectively groans.* *In a stunning turn of events, the aliens gift the gang with the villains, all tied up with a bow. As they make their departure in a spaceship that looks suspiciously like a 60’s Volkswagen, Uncle Cosmo laments the loss of history, while Shaggy is more concerned about where they can get a good \\"space sandwich.\\"* **Fred**, closing the adventure with a knowing smirk: \\"Well, gang, it looks like we've unraveled another mystery that makes absolutely no sense.\\" *And as the Mystery Machine drives off into the sunset, Shaggy mispronounces yet another location.* **Shaggy**: \\"So, like, are we heading to Las Vegan next?\\" *The groans from the gang are drowned out by the sound of the Mystery Machine as our heroes venture off towards their next improbable adventure.* *And somewhere, in the void of space, two aliens are scratching their heads wondering what the heck a \\"Scooby Snack\\" is.* **The End.**"},{"instruction":"hallo","output":"Hallo! Wie kann ich dir helfen?"},{"instruction":"dalam bahasa indonesia ?","output":"Halo! Bagaimana saya bisa membantu Anda?"},{"instruction":"You need to generate an input prompt for a text-to-image neural network. The system accepts as correct the query string, where all arguments are separated by commas. The words in prompt are crucial. Users need to prompt what they want to see, specifying artist names, media sources, or art styles to get desired results. Be descriptive in a manne similar to prompts provided below about what you want. It is more sensitive to precise wording. That includes adjectives and prepositions like “in front of [x]“, and “taken by [camera name]“. It also supports weights. By bracketing the words you can change their importance. For example, (rainy) would be twice as important compared to \\"rainy\\" for the model, and [rainy] would be half as important. Write a medium lenth prompt, like below. Too long and it would fail to generate, too short and it would generate crap. Be as detailed as possible and avoid both scenarios at any cost. As photographers and painters know, light has a huge effect on the final impression an image creates. Specify lighting conditions. Describe the type of light you want to see and the time of day it is. You don’t need complex vocabulary. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is that a text-to-image neural network interprets the prompt from up to down, i.e. what is listed at the beginning of the prompt is more significant than what is listed near the end of the prompt. So it is recommended to place the subject of prompt in the beginning, characteristical tags in the middle and misc tags like lighting or camera settings near the end. Tags must be separated by commas, commas are not allowed in the query (what needs to be drawn), because the system treats it as one big tag. Below few good examples are listed: Example 1: Stunning wooden house, by James McDonald and Joarc Architects, home, interior, octane render, deviantart, cinematic, key art, hyperrealism, sun light, sunrays, canon eos c 300, ƒ 1.8, 35 mm, 8k, medium - format print Example 2: Stunning concept art render of a mysterious magical forest with river passing through, epic concept art by barlowe wayne, ruan jia, light effect, volumetric light, 3d, ultra clear detailed, octane render, 8k, dark green, dark green and gray colour scheme Example 3: Stunning render of a piece of steak with boiled potatoes, depth of field. bokeh. soft light. by Yasmin Albatoul, Harry Fayt. centered. extremely detailed.

Example 4: Stunning postapocalyptic rich marble building covered with green ivy, fog, animals, birds, deer, bunny, postapocalyptic, overgrown with plant life and ivy, artgerm, yoshitaka amano, gothic interior, 8k, octane render, unreal engine Also you should generate a negative prompt for each prompt, describing what you do NOT want to see. Some examples: Example 1: Black and white, blurry, not in focus, out of focus, warped, distorted, unfocused, gibberish, lowres, text, error, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts Example 2: Deformed, blurry, bad anatomy, disfigured, poorly drawn face, mutation, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, blurry, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, blur, out of focus, long neck, long body, ((((mutated hands and fingers)))), (((out of frame)))","output":"Prompt: Gleaming futuristic cityscape at twilight, illuminated by neon lights, inspired by Syd Mead and John Harris, bustling urban life, sharp details, cyberpunk aesthetic, towering skyscrapers, reflections on wet streets, glowing billboards, drone traffic, vibrant nightlife, atmospheric, moody lighting, twilight, blue and neon pink color scheme, detailed render, ultra HD, 4K, Adobe Photoshop realism, drone's perspective, (wide angle lens), (f/2.8), 24mm Negative Prompt: Blurry, lacking detail, oversaturated colors, underexposed, overexposed, plain, empty streets, unrealistic proportions, impossible architecture, bad perspective, noise, grain, low resolution, pixelated, blocked shadows, clipped highlights, absence of neon, no reflections, dull, (artifacts), (compression), ((flat lighting)), (((monochrome)))"},{"instruction":"A woman is sitting on a chair, wearing a bikini and holding a glass of wine .

Bunlar, genel olarak modelin dil anlama ve üretme yeteneklerinin geliştirilmesi, daha geniş kapsamlı bilgiye erişim, ve daha sofistike kullanıcı etkileşimleri için tasarlanmıştır. Ancak, doğrudan bir karşılaştırma yapabilmek için GPT-4'ün resmi belgelerini ve performans analizlerini incelemek gerekir çünkü her sürüm, mimari, eğitim verisi, ve amaç bakımından farklılıklar gösterebilir. Bilgi kesilme tarihim itibariyle (Nisan 2023), genel olarak bilinen bazı potansiyel farklar aşağıda açıklanmıştır: # 1. **Model Boyutu ve Kapasitesi:** GPT-4, önceki sürümlerine kıyasla daha fazla parametreye ve gelişmiş bir mimariye sahip olabilir. Bu, modelin daha karmaşık dil kalıplarını öğrenmesine ve daha geniş bir bilgi tabanından çıkarım yapmasına yardımcı olur. # 2. **Dil Anlama ve Üretimi:** GPT-4, metin anlama ve üretme konusunda daha gelişmiş yeteneklere sahip olabilir. Bu, daha doğru anlam çıkarımı, metin içindeki daha ince nüansları algılama ve kullanıcı isteklerine daha uygun yanıtlar üretme yeteneği anlamına gelir. # 3. **Daha Geniş Kapsamlı Eğitim Verileri:** GPT-4'ün eğitiminde kullanılan veri seti, önceki sürümlere kıyasla daha güncel ve geniş kapsamlı olabilir.

The actual limit is more practically determined by the resources of the system it is running on (such as memory, disk space, and CPU) and the configuration of the Solr instances themselves (such as the JVM settings, Solr configuration, schema complexity, and index sizes). In distributed environments like SolrCloud, the scalability is significantly higher due to the ability to spread collections across multiple nodes. However, managing a very large number of collections can become complex and might require substantial administrative effort in terms of monitoring, balancing, and maintaining performance. Each collection requires a certain amount of overhead, as it maintains its own set of configuration, transaction logs, and index files. This means that as the number of collections increases, so do the demands on the system's resources. In practice, the decision on how many collections to have should take into account: 1. **The size of individual documents:** Larger documents mean more storage per document, potentially reducing the number of collections you can efficiently manage. 2. **Query performance requirements:** More collections can mean more complexity in managing and optimizing queries. 3. **Update frequency:** High update frequencies require more transaction log space and CPU for indexing, possibly affecting how many collections can be efficiently managed. 4. **Resource availability:** More powerful hardware or cloud resources can support more collections, but at an increased cost. 5. **Management and complexity:** More collections increase the complexity of the Solr management and administration tasks. If you're planning to create a large number of collections, it's wise to conduct performance and scalability tests specific to your use case and infrastructure. This can help you understand the practical limits and requirements for your particular scenario. In some cases, it may also be beneficial to consider whether some of the collections can be merged or whether using shards within a collection might meet your needs better than multiple collections."},{"instruction":"adding money monthly vs annually, which is better for PPF?","output":"When it comes to investing in the Public Provident Fund (PPF) in India, the choice between adding money monthly versus annually boils down to how interest is calculated and the ultimate goal of maximizing returns. PPF accounts have a specific way of calculating interest that can make one option more beneficial than the other, generally speaking. Here's a detailed look: # Interest Calculation in PPF: The interest on PPF accounts is calculated on a monthly basis but is credited at the end of the financial year. The interest calculation for a particular month is based on the lowest balance in the account between the fifth and the last day of that month. # Monthly Contribution: Making contributions monthly, especially if you do so before the 5th of every month, ensures that your contribution counts towards that month's balance for interest calculation. This practice allows you to maximize the interest for that month as more money will earn interest. # Annual Contribution: If you choose to make a lump sum annual contribution, doing so at the start of the financial year (preferably before April 5th) is ideal. This is because your entire contribution will earn interest for the whole year, thus maximizing your return. # Which is Better? 1. **Maximizing Interest**: If your primary goal is to maximize interest, paying at the beginning of the financial year in one lump sum is slightly better. This is because your entire amount starts earning interest right from the first month of the financial year. 2. **Cash Flow Consideration**: If making a lump sum investment at the beginning of the year is not feasible due to cash flow considerations, then making monthly contributions before the 5th of each month is a great alternative. This way, your contributions will still earn interest for most of the year. 3. **Discipline and Convenience**: For some, monthly contributions can be easier to manage and more aligned with their cash flow from salary or other income sources. It instills financial discipline without straining one’s finances. # Conclusion: From purely an interest-maximizing perspective, contributing a lump sum amount at the beginning of the financial year to your PPF account is more beneficial. However, monthly contributions made before the 5th can also be quite efficient and more manageable for many people based on their financial situation and cash flow. It's important to evaluate both options within the context of your financial planning and choose the one that best suits your circumstances."},{"instruction":"how does it vary in NPS?","output":"The National Pension System (NPS) is a voluntary, long-term retirement savings scheme in India, designed to enable systematic savings during the subscriber's working life. It differs from the Public Provident Fund (PPF) in terms of investment options, returns, and how contributions affect your savings. Here’s how contribution timing (monthly vs. annually) might play out differently in NPS compared to PPF: # Investment Flexibility and Returns: 1. **Choice of Investments:** NPS offers a choice of investment options and fund managers. Subscribers can allocate their contributions among different asset classes like equities, corporate bonds, government securities, and alternative investment funds. This is in contrast with PPF, which has a fixed rate of return as declared by the government periodically. 2. **Market-Linked Returns:** Returns in NPS are market-linked as your contributions are invested in market instruments. This means the timing of investment could potentially influence the returns, although this is more relevant to short-term fluctuations. For long-term investments like NPS, the timing of contributions within a year is less significant in impacting overall returns, considering the long investment horizon. # Contribution Timing: 1. **Monthly Contributions:** Regular monthly contributions in NPS facilitate disciplined saving. However, given the market-linked nature of investments, monthly contributions average out the purchase price of the underlying securities over time, a concept known as Rupee Cost Averaging. This can potentially mitigate the impact of market volatility. 2. **Annual Contributions:** Making an annual lump-sum contribution, especially at the beginning of the financial year, can give more time for the investment to grow. However, it also means that you might be buying at a time when the market is high. Conversely, if the market is down, your lump sum might buy more units, potentially increasing your returns if the market recovers. # Tax Benefits: Both NPS and PPF offer tax benefits that can influence how and when you might want to contribute: - **PPF:** Investments in PPF are eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, with a cap on the maximum amount. - **NPS:** Contributions to NPS are also eligible for tax deductions under Section 80C and an additional deduction for investment up to ₹50,000 under Section 80CCD(1B), which is over and above the limit of Section 80C. For NPS, making contributions to maximize the tax benefits before the end of the financial year is crucial. Whether you choose monthly or annual contributions might depend on factors like cash flow, investment strategy, and personal tax planning. # Conclusion: For long-term investments like NPS, the impact of monthly versus annual contributions on returns is less pronounced due to the long duration and market-linked returns. The choice should be guided more by personal cash flow management, investment discipline, and tax planning, rather than trying to optimize returns based on the timing of contributions within a year. A disciplined approach to saving, regardless of the frequency, alongside making informed investment choices within the NPS, will be key to maximizing your retirement corpus."},{"instruction":"what is filtercache cumulative evictions in solr?","output":"In Apache Solr, the \`filterCache\` is a critical component designed to store the results of document filter queries to improve query response times. When you run a query in Solr that includes filter queries (using \`fq\` parameters), Solr can reuse the results of these filters from the cache for subsequent queries, provided that the results are still in the cache. This caching mechanism significantly improves performance, especially for frequently used filters on large datasets. However, caches in Solr (including the \`filterCache\`) have a limited size, which is configurable. When the cache reaches its size limit and new filter results need to be stored, Solr has to evict some of the existing entries from the cache to make room for the new ones. The process of removing older or less frequently used entries from the cache to free up space is known as **eviction**. # Cumulative Evictions The term **\\"cumulative evictions\\"** in the context of Solr's \`filterCache\` refers to the total number of entries that have been evicted from the cache over time, since the Solr server was started or since the cache was last reset. Tracking cumulative evictions is important because: 1. **Indicator of Cache Pressure**: A high number of cumulative evictions can indicate that the \`filterCache\` is under pressure, meaning it frequently reaches its maximum capacity and has to evict entries to accommodate new ones. This situation could lead to a drop in cache hit rates because evicted entries are not available in the cache when needed, leading to repeated computation of filter results that could have been cached. 2. **Tuning Cache Size**: Monitoring cumulative evictions can help in tuning the cache size. If you observe that evictions are too high, it might mean that the cache is too small for the workload, and increasing its size could improve performance. Conversely, very few evictions might suggest that the cache is larger than necessary, potentially wasting memory resources. 3. **Understanding Workload Patterns**: The pattern of evictions can also provide insights into the query workload and its compatibility with the current caching strategy. For instance, a steadily increasing number of evictions might indicate a highly varied query pattern where the cache is less effective due to the low reuse rate of cached entries. Managing and tuning the \`filterCache\`, including understanding aspects like cumulative evictions, is part of optimizing Solr for your specific use case. Ideally, you want to find a balance where your cache is large enough to store frequently accessed filter results but not so large that it uses memory resources inefficiently. Monitoring tools and Solr’s built-in administration interfaces can help track cumulative evictions and other cache performance metrics to guide these tuning decisions."},{"instruction":"what shards preference parameter in solr?","output":"The shards preference parameter in Apache Solr is a powerful feature designed to give clients more control over which replicas to use when executing a distributed query. This feature is particularly relevant in SolrCloud mode, where collections are divided into multiple shards, and each shard can have one or more replicas distributed across different nodes in the cluster. The main aim of specifying shard preferences is to optimize and enhance query performance by intelligently selecting which replicas to query based on specific criteria. The parameter used to specify shard preferences in a query URL is \`shards.preference\`. It allows configuring the selection of replicas based on a variety of criteria such as node characteristics or query performance considerations. When a query is issued, Solr can use these preferences to decide the best replicas to execute the query against, thereby potentially reducing latencies, balancing load more effectively across the cluster, or ensuring queries are directed to replicas with specific attributes. # Available Criteria for Shard Preferences Some of the criteria that can be specified through the \`shards.preference\` parameter include but are not limited to: - **Replica Type**: Preferring replicas of a specific type, for example, preferring \`PULL\` replicas over others. - **Replica Location**: Preferring replicas on nodes in specific locations, useful in data centers spread across geographical locations for geo-targeting queries to the nearest data center. - **Load balancing**: Distributing queries among replicas to balance the load, potentially based on the current load or recent query times, which can help in managing resource utilization more evenly across the cluster. - **Staleness**: Preferring replicas that are less \\"stale\\" or more up-to-date with their index versions, which can be critical for ensuring query freshness, especially in systems with heavy write operations. # Example of Using shards.preference Here's an illustrative example of how you might specify a shard preference in a query URL: \`\`\` http://solr-cluster/solr/collection/select?q=*:*&shards.preference=replica.type:PULL,replica.location:NEW_YORK \`\`\` In this example, the query requests Solr to prefer querying \`PULL\` type replicas located in \\"NEW_YORK\\" over others. The preferences are specified as a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. # Benefits and Considerations The primary benefit of using shard preferences is the potential to improve query efficiency and response times by smartly selecting replicas based on the current state of the cluster and the specific needs of the query. However, it's essential to consider that overusing or misconfiguring shard preferences can lead to unintended consequences, such as unbalanced loads, increased latencies if the preferred replicas are not the optimal choice, or added complexity in query management. Careful planning, understanding the cluster's topology and performance characteristics, and testing are crucial steps in effectively utilizing shard preferences in SolrCloud environments."},{"instruction":"explain NRT, pull and tlog in solr with differences.","output":"Apache Solr, a popular open-source search platform, makes use of several advanced indexing and replication techniques to ensure that data is efficiently indexed and available for searches. Among these techniques are Near Real-Time (NRT) indexing, pull replication, and transaction logs (tlog), each serving distinct purposes and offering specific benefits. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively managing and optimizing a Solr deployment. # Near Real-Time (NRT) Indexing: **Definition:** - Near Real-Time (NRT) indexing refers to Solr's capability to make documents searchable almost immediately after they have been added or updated in the index. It bridges the gap between traditional search engines, which might have significant delays before new documents are searchable, and the need for immediate searchability of documents. **How it Works:** - NRT is achieved through the use of Solr's transaction log (tlog) and efficient index management mechanisms. When a document is indexed, it is first written to a transaction log and then added to an in-memory index buffer. Periodically, or based on specific triggers, this buffer is flushed to disk and a new search segment is created, which is then quickly made available for searches. **Benefits:** - Enables near-instant searchability of newly indexed documents. - Improves the user experience by reducing the time between content update and content discovery. # Pull Replication: **Definition:** - Pull replication is a mechanism where replicas (secondary nodes) pull updates from a leader (primary node) to synchronize their indexes. This model is commonly used in SolrCloud configurations where a collection is divided into multiple shards, and each shard can have one or more replicas. **How it Works:** - In pull replication, the replicas periodically check with the leader for any updates. If updates are available, the replicas initiate a fetch operation to get the latest index changes from the leader. This can involve transferring entire index segments or more granular updates depending on the configuration. **Benefits:** - Simplifies the management of index replication across multiple nodes. - Allows replicas to remain up-to-date with the leader, ensuring consistent search results across the cluster. # Transaction Logs (tlog): **Definition:** - The transaction log (tlog) in Solr is a component that records all the operations (additions, deletions, updates) performed on the index. It plays a crucial role in ensuring data durability and consistency, especially in NRT indexing and SolrCloud configurations. **How it Works:** - When an operation is performed on the index, it is first written to the transaction log. This ensures that, in case of a crash or failure, operations can be replayed from the log to rebuild the index state. For NRT indexing, the tlog also allows uncommitted changes to be included in search results by replaying recent operations on top of the last committed state. **Benefits:** - Provides a mechanism for data recovery and durability. - Enables NRT indexing by allowing recent, uncommitted changes to be included in search operations. # Differences: - **NRT vs. Transaction Log (tlog):** NRT is a feature enabled by the existence of the transaction log. While NRT refers to the capability of making documents searchable almost immediately, the tlog is the underlying component that records all operations to make this possible. - **NRT/Pull Replication vs. tlog:** Both NRT indexing and pull replication mechanisms rely on the transaction log (tlog) for different purposes. NRT uses it to make uncommitted changes searchable, and pull replication can use it to track what data needs to be synchronized between replicas and the leader. - **Pull Replication vs. NRT:** Pull replication and NRT serve different purposes. Pull replication is concerned with keeping replicas in sync with the leader's index in a distributed environment, whereas NRT focuses on reducing the latency between document indexing and its availability for search. Understanding these concepts and their interplay is crucial for optimizing the performance and reliability of Solr instances, especially in distributed and high-volume environments."},{"instruction":"what should be the best configuration for solr shards? how many NRT, PULL and TLOGs? Also, which one should be leader node? where should we direct write calls and read calls?","output":"Configuring Apache Solr shards, replicas, and deciding on roles (like NRT, PULL), including which node acts as the leader within a SolrCloud environment, depends greatly on your specific use case, including factors such as data volume, query load, update frequency, and latency requirements. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but I'll provide guidance on best practices and considerations to help you design an effective Solr architecture. # Understanding the Roles: 1. **Near-Real-Time (NRT) replicas** receive updates and make data available for search almost immediately. They are typically used in situations requiring the latest data to be searchable with minimal latency. 2. **Pull replicas** periodically sync with the leader to update their index. They are often used to increase query capacity while still keeping the index relatively up-to-date without the overhead of handling frequent updates. 3. **Transaction Logs (tlogs)** are used by both NRT and PULL replicas for durability, recovery, and supporting NRT search capabilities by replaying recent operations. # Design Considerations: - **Data Volume and Update Rate:** High-volume, rapidly changing datasets may benefit from more NRT replicas to distribute the indexing load, whereas mostly-static datasets with heavy read loads might leverage pull replicas more effectively. - **Query Load:** More replicas (both NRT and Pull) can serve read requests, increasing query throughput. NRT replicas are best suited for searches that need up-to-the-minute accuracy, whereas pull replicas can effectively handle queries where slight delays in data freshness are acceptable. - **Latency Requirements:** NRT replicas provide lower latency for reflecting new updates in search results. If your application requires immediate visibility of documents, emphasizing NRT replicas is essential. - **Fault Tolerance:** Ensure high availability by having multiple replicas (a mix of NRT and Pull depending on need) to withstand node failures. The leader is automatically managed in SolrCloud, but ensure all shard leaders are not isolated on a small subset of nodes to avoid bottlenecks. # Configuration Suggestions: 1. **Leaders:** SolrCloud automatically elects leaders among the NRT replicas. Leaders handle update requests (writes) and ensure data consistency across replicas. It's best practice to let Solr manage leader election. Distribute your nodes across different physical machines or cloud instances to avoid single points of failure. 2. **Writes:** Direct write calls (updates, deletes) to the SolrCloud collection endpoint. SolrCloud will route the updates to the appropriate leader for the shard. 3. **Reads:** Queries can be directed to any Solr node in the cluster; Solr will route the request appropriately. If your application can tolerate slightly staler data, consider preferentially routing some read traffic to pull replicas to balance the load. 4. **Shard and Replica Count:** Start with a baseline based on your data size and query volume. Common advice is to have a few (2-3) replicas per shard (including the leader) for fault tolerance and load distribution. Adjust the ratio of NRT to Pull replicas based on update-to-query ratio and freshness requirements. The number of shards should be based on data volume and performance testing; too many shards increase management overhead and cluster chattiness, while too few can limit scalability. # Monitoring and Adjustment: After initial setup, actively monitor your SolrCloud cluster's performance. Use Solr's built-in metrics and logging to track query latencies, update times, and system health. Be prepared to adjust your shard and replica strategy as your data volume, query patterns, and performance requirements evolve. # Final Thoughts: There's a delicate balance between ensuring data freshness, managing indexing load, and maximizing query throughput. Starting with best practices and continuously tuning your setup based on observed performance is key to achieving an optimal Solr configuration."},{"instruction":"what is varnish cache","output":"Varnish Cache is a high-performance HTTP accelerator designed for content-heavy dynamic web sites as well as heavily consumed APIs. It's primarily used to speed up web applications by caching (storing) copies of web pages or resources such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files so that these can be served quickly to users without the need for the web server to process each request from scratch. Varnish is installed in front of a web server as a reverse proxy. In this setup, it intercepts requests from clients (the \\"frontend\\") before they reach the web server (the \\"backend\\"). When a client requests a page or resource, Varnish first checks if a cached version is available: - **If a cached version is available** and fresh (i.e., not expired), Varnish serves this version immediately, drastically reducing the response time compared to generating the page from scratch using the web server and possibly a database. - **If the content is not in the cache** or is stale, Varnish passes the request to the backend server, retrieves the fresh content, delivers it to the client, and updates the cache with the new version for future requests. # Key Features of Varnish Cache: - **Performance**: Varnish is designed with performance in mind and can handle thousands of requests per second with minimal resource consumption. - **Flexibility**: Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) allows for detailed and sophisticated rules for caching, including altering requests, deciding what to cache and for how long, and handling backend responses. This makes it highly adaptable to various applications and use cases. - **Load Balancing**: Varnish can distribute incoming requests to multiple backend servers, thereby increasing the capacity of the system and making it more fault-tolerant. - **SSL/TLS Support**: While Varnish itself does not handle SSL/TLS encryption, it is commonly paired with a TLS termination proxy (like Nginx or HAProxy) that handles encrypted traffic before passing it to Varnish. - **Edge Side Includes (ESI)**: Varnish supports ESI, a simple markup language used to assemble multiple cached HTTP responses into a single response, which can be extremely useful for dynamic web applications. # Use Cases: - **Content-heavy sites**: Websites that serve a lot of static content (e.g., media sites, news platforms) benefit significantly from Varnish, as it reduces load times and server load. - **API acceleration**: APIs, especially those that serve similar responses frequently or have high read-to-write ratios, can see performance improvements with Varnish. - **Load distribution**: Varnish can act as a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers, improving resource utilization and application reliability. # Setting up Varnish Cache: Setting up Varnish involves installing the software on a server that sits between clients and your web server(s), configuring the caching rules through VCL to suit your application's needs, and possibly configuring SSL termination if needed. Monitoring and tuning based on cache hit rates, resource usage, and application performance are crucial steps in maintaining an effective Varnish setup. In summary, Varnish Cache is a powerful tool for accelerating web applications, enhancing user experiences by reducing load times, and decreasing the burden on web servers. Its flexibility through VCL customization allows for tailored caching strategies that can adapt to a wide variety of web applications."},{"instruction":"do we have varnish cache available with solr?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, Varnish Cache is not a component that is natively integrated within Apache Solr. Solr is a search platform that focuses on indexing and providing search capabilities for various types of data, and it has its own mechanisms for managing and caching search results to optimize performance. Varnish Cache, on the other hand, is a general-purpose HTTP accelerator or cache designed to cache the content of web pages or APIs at the HTTP level to reduce response times and load on back-end servers. However, it's entirely possible and sometimes beneficial to use Varnish Cache in conjunction with Solr, especially when Solr is being used to power search functionalities on content-heavy web applications or APIs. In such setups, Varnish could be deployed in front of Solr as part of an overall architecture aimed at improving responsiveness and reducing load. # How Varnish Can Complement Solr: 1. **Caching API Responses**: If Solr is exposed via an HTTP API that clients call directly, Varnish can cache these API responses. This can be particularly effective for search queries that are called frequently with the same parameters, reducing the load on Solr by serving cached results. 2. **Load Balancing**: Varnish can also act as a load balancer to distribute incoming HTTP requests across multiple Solr servers, helping to manage load and improve fault tolerance within a Solr cluster. 3. **Configurable TTLs**: By utilizing Varnish's configurable Time-To-Live (TTL) policies for cached objects, applications can ensure that users receive up-to-date information without unnecessarily overloading the Solr backend with frequent, identical requests. # Considerations: - **Freshness vs. Performance**: When caching responses from a search engine like Solr, it's important to carefully balance the need for up-to-date results (freshness) against the performance gains from caching. This balance will largely depend on the specific requirements of your application. - **Complexity and Administration**: Adding Varnish into your infrastructure introduces another component to be managed and monitored, which could increase the complexity of your setup. Ensure your team has the necessary expertise to configure and maintain Varnish effectively. - **Security and Access Control**: If you're using Varnish to cache sensitive or restricted data from Solr, be mindful of security implications and ensure that appropriate access controls are in place. In summary, while Varnish is not a built-in feature of Solr, it can certainly be used effectively alongside Solr to improve the performance and scalability of applications that rely on Solr for search functionalities. Deciding whether to use Varnish with Solr will depend on your specific use cases, performance requirements, and architectural considerations."},{"instruction":"do we have anything related to hybrid search (vector + query) on solr?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, Apache Solr has been making strides in incorporating more advanced search capabilities, including those related to vector search and hybrid search approaches that combine traditional text search with vector-based search. This is part of a broader trend in the search and information retrieval industry towards leveraging deep learning and vector embeddings to improve the relevance and accuracy of search results, especially for complex queries or content. # Background on Vector Search Vector search involves representing content (such as documents or images) and queries as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. The semantic similarities between queries and documents can be determined based on the distance between their vectors, using distance measures such as cosine similarity. This approach is particularly powerful for capturing nuanced semantic relationships that traditional keyword-based search might miss. # Solr and Vector Search Apache Solr, historically known for its strengths in full-text search based on inverted indices, has been evolving to support vector search and hybrid search models. This includes the capability to store vector fields and perform nearest neighbor search operations. These features lay the groundwork for implementing hybrid search models that combine the best of keyword-based matching and semantic vector-based search. # Implementing Hybrid Search in Solr 1. **Vector Fields**: Recent versions of Solr have introduced support for vector fields, allowing you to index and store high-dimensional vectors corresponding to your documents. This makes it possible to conduct searches based on vector similarity. 2. **Nearest Neighbor Search**: Solr supports nearest neighbor search queries in vector fields, enabling users to find the most similar vectors (and thus, the most relevant documents) for a given query vector. This is essential for implementing vector-based and hybrid search functionalities. 3. **Combining Vector and Text Queries**: A hybrid search strategy in Solr might involve performing a nearest neighbor vector search to find a candidate set of documents based on vector similarity, then refining or re-ranking these results using traditional keyword-based search criteria or vice versa. This approach leverages the strengths of both search paradigms. 4. **Plugins and Extensions**: The community and ecosystem around Solr also contribute plugins, extensions, and integration guides that further extend Solr's capabilities in vector search and hybrid search models. Keeping an eye on official documentation and community contributions is a good idea for staying updated on these capabilities. # Considerations Implementing hybrid search models in Solr involves careful consideration of your specific use case, including the nature of your data, the types of queries you need to support, and the expected search outcomes. It may also require experimenting with different approaches to indexing, query formulation, and result ranking to achieve the desired balance between semantic relevance and traditional search accuracy. # Looking Ahead As the field of search and information retrieval continues to advance, it's likely that Solr will further enhance its support for vector search and hybrid search models. Following the project's official documentation, engaging with the Solr community, and staying informed about updates and new releases are excellent ways to leverage these evolving capabilities for your applications."},{"instruction":"speech search with solr","output":"Integrating speech-based search functionality into Apache Solr applications requires converting spoken queries into text before they can be processed by Solr. Solr itself is primarily a text-based search engine and doesn't directly process audio or speech data. However, by combining Solr with speech-to-text (STT) technologies, you can create a powerful speech search system. Here's an overview of how you might approach this: # 1. Choose a Speech-to-Text Service The first step is to select a speech-to-text technology. There are several high-quality services and libraries available, including: - **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**: Offers advanced deep learning neural network algorithms to convert audio to text. - **IBM Watson Speech to Text**: Provides real-time speech recognition capabilities. - **Microsoft Azure Speech Service**: Features real-time speech transcription. - **Mozilla DeepSpeech**: An open-source STT engine based on deep learning. # 2. Capture and Process Audio Input You need a mechanism to capture audio input from users. This could be a web application with a microphone access interface, a mobile app, or any other system capable of recording speech. Once you have the audio input: - Send the audio data to your chosen STT service API. - The STT service converts the speech to text and returns it to your application. # 3. Process the Text with Solr Once you have the transcribed text: - Process and optionally refine or format the text as necessary for your application's needs. This might involve natural language processing (NLP) steps, such as tokenization, lemmatization, or stop word removal, depending on the complexity of the queries and the domain of your application. - Use the processed text as a query string in a Solr search request. Solr's powerful search capabilities can now be leveraged to find and return relevant documents or data based on the spoken query. # 4. Enhancing User Experience To make the speech search experience more seamless and effective: - Implement error handling for speech recognition inaccuracies. Offering users the option to correct or refine their queries can significantly improve search success rates. - Consider using Solr's features like spell checking, synonym expansion, and query suggestion to accommodate variances in speech-to-text transcription accuracy and user intent interpretation. - Continuously improve the spoken query understanding by analyzing query logs and user interactions. You may find patterns that allow you to better preprocess queries or adjust your Solr configuration for better results. # 5. Privacy and Legal Considerations Remember that handling audio and speech data often involves dealing with sensitive or personal information. Ensure that your application complies with relevant privacy laws and data protection regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California. Transparency with users about how their data is used and ensuring secure data handling practices are essential. # Conclusion While Solr doesn't natively support speech search, integrating it with a speech-to-text service allows you to build sophisticated speech-enabled search functionalities. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of advanced STT models and Solr's powerful text search capabilities to meet modern users' expectations for natural and convenient search interfaces."},{"instruction":"image search with solr","output":"Implementing image search with Apache Solr involves creating a solution where images can be indexed based on their features and then queried or searched for similarities. Solr, primarily a text search engine, doesn't natively support image-based searches in the way it does with text. However, you can extend its capabilities to perform image search by indexing image features extracted using various image processing techniques or machine learning models. Here's how you could approach building an image search system with Solr: # Step 1: Feature Extraction The first step in enabling image search is to extract features from images that effectively represent their visual content. This process is critical as these features will be indexed by Solr. There are various approaches to feature extraction, including: - **Traditional Image Processing Techniques**: Methods like color histograms, texture analysis, and edge detection. These techniques are straightforward but might not capture high-level semantics of the images. - **Deep Learning Models**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can extract rich and complex features from images. Pre-trained models like ResNet, Inception, or VGGNet can be used to extract feature vectors from images. These feature vectors, representing various aspects of the image, can then be indexed in Solr. # Step 2: Indexing Image Features in Solr Once you have the feature vectors for your images: 1. **Define a Schema**: Define Solr's schema to accommodate the image features. Since feature vectors are essentially arrays of numbers, you can use dynamic fields or specific field types in Solr that can handle multi-valued fields. 2. **Indexing**: Convert your image features into a format compatible with Solr and index them as you would with textual data. Each image's feature vector becomes a document in Solr's index. # Step 3: Searching for Similar Images To search for similar images: 1. **Extract Features**: To search with an image, first, extract its feature vector using the same method used during the indexing process. 2. **Query Solr**: Use Solr's query features to find images with similar feature vectors. This might involve using function queries to calculate distances between the query image's feature vector and those in the index, returning the nearest matches. 3. **Similarity Metrics**: Implement a similarity metric, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance, to rank the search results by their visual similarity to the query image. # Step 4: Fine-tuning and Optimization - **Dimensionality Reduction**: High-dimensional feature vectors may lead to inefficiencies. Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) can reduce vector dimensionality while preserving essential information. - **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine text metadata with visual features to enhance search capabilities. This allows leveraging Solr's full-text search strengths alongside visual similarity searching. # Challenges and Considerations - **Performance**: High-dimensional data and complex distance calculations can lead to performance bottlenecks. Consider optimizations and whether your Solr deployment has the necessary computational resources. - **Accuracy**: Depending on the feature extraction technique, the relevancy of search results may vary. Deep learning approaches usually provide more meaningful representations but require more computational resources. - **Scalability**: As the image dataset grows, maintaining performance and accuracy might require scaling your Solr infrastructure and considering distributed search architectures. # Conclusion While Apache Solr doesn't natively support image search, by creatively using feature extraction techniques and adjusting Solr's configuration, you can build a custom solution to achieve this functionality. Image search systems built on Solr necessitate a greater initial setup and optimization but can benefit from Solr's scalability and robust search capabilities for a wide range of applications."},{"instruction":"auto synonyms with solr","output":"Implementing auto-synonyms in Apache Solr can significantly improve search functionality by broadening query understanding and matching additional relevant documents that might not exactly match the query terms but are considered similar or related. Auto-synonyms refer to the automatic generation or utilization of synonyms during the search process. While Solr provides robust support for using synonyms, automating their generation or application involves additional considerations. Here's a broad overview of how synonyms can be incorporated into Solr: # Basic Synonym Support in Solr Solr supports synonyms through the use of the \`SynonymGraphFilterFactory\` in the analysis chain for both indexing and query parsing. This involves specifying a synonyms file in your managed schema or \`solrconfig.xml\` that lists words or phrases as equivalent for search purposes. The format is generally: \`\`\` word1, word2, word3 => word1, word2, word3 are considered equivalent \`\`\` # Auto-Generating Synonyms Automatically generating synonyms is not a direct feature of Solr, but there are approaches and external tools you can use: 1. **External Tools and APIs**: Use third-party NLP tools, libraries, or APIs that can generate synonyms based on lexical databases like WordNet or through AI-based understanding of word usage and context. These tools can include: - SpaCy - NLTK for Python - BERT and other transformer models - Custom models trained on domain-specific corpora 2. **Custom Scripts**: Write scripts that interface with these tools to generate synonyms for your dataset or query terms. The output can then be formatted and added to Solr's synonyms file. 3. **Dynamic Synonym Generation**: Integrate dynamic synonym generation into your search application. Before submitting a query to Solr, preprocess the query to include synonyms by calling an external API or tool. This way, the application sends an expanded query to Solr, encompassing the original terms and their synonyms. # Utilizing Solr's Auto-Reloading Feature For dynamic updates to your synonyms file without restarting Solr, use Solr's auto-reloading feature by storing synonyms in a managed resource. This allows updates to synonyms through the Solr API, which can be useful for incorporating new synonyms as they are generated. # Advanced synonym Handling 1. **Contextual Synonyms**: Handling synonyms contextually (where the same word might have different meanings in different contexts) is complex and might require preprocessing with more advanced NLP models that understand query context. 2. **Machine Learning Models**: Consider using machine learning models that can understand the semantics of text to dynamically generate synonyms or equivalent expressions. Incorporating feedback loops where user interactions help to refine and validate synonyms can also improve the quality of auto-generated synonyms. 3. **Solr Plugins**: Look for Solr plugins or extensions that can offer advanced synonym handling or integration with external services for synonym generation. # Considerations for Auto-Synonyms - **Precision vs. Recall**: Automatically expanding queries with synonyms can increase recall but might reduce precision. Fine-tuning and continuous monitoring are essential. - **Performance**: Automatic synonym expansion, especially if done dynamically at query time, can impact query performance. Cached synonyms or pre-expanded queries can alleviate this. - **Quality Control**: Automatically generated synonyms may not always be accurate or contextually appropriate. Manual review or quality control mechanisms may be necessary. In conclusion, while Solr doesn't provide built-in functionality for auto-generating synonyms, it offers robust support for utilizing synonyms to enhance search functionality. Leveraging external tools for synonym generation and incorporating these synonyms into Solr, either statically or dynamically, can significantly enhance the search experience. Continuous refinement based on analytics and user feedback is crucial for maintaining the relevance and effectiveness of the synonym list."},{"instruction":"auto stopwords in solr","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, Apache Solr does not have a built-in feature specifically for automatically generating or identifying stopwords. However, Solr is highly extensible and customizable, enabling several approaches to manage and dynamically update stopwords to improve search relevance and performance. Stopwords are common words (such as \\"the\\", \\"is\\", \\"at\\") that are often removed from the search queries and documents during the indexing and querying processes to speed up search operations and reduce index size. # Managing Stopwords in Solr In Solr, stopwords are typically managed through the use of the \`solr.StopFilterFactory\` in the analysis chain, which filters out words listed in a configured stopwords list. This list is often defined in a stopwords file (e.g., \`stopwords.txt\`). # Approaches for Auto-Stopwords in Solr 1. **Using External Tools for Stopwords Generation**: While Solr itself does not generate stopwords automatically, you can use external tools or scripts to generate or update a stopwords list based on your dataset. Tools like nltk in Python can help identify frequent yet insignificant words that can be considered as stopwords. 2. **Custom Solr Components**: It's possible to develop a custom Solr component (e.g., a custom filter in Java) that dynamically identifies and filters stopwords based on certain criteria, such as word frequency across the document set. However, this requires significant Solr internal knowledge and Java programming skills. 3. **Leveraging Solr's Managed Resources**: Solr offers the ability to manage stopwords (and synonyms) through the Solr REST API as managed resources. This feature enables adding, removing, or updating stopwords without needing to directly edit the \`stopwords.txt\` file or restart Solr. Though not \\"automatic\\" in the sense of dynamically identifying stopwords without external input, it simplifies the process of updating stopwords lists based on ongoing analysis. # Strategies for Dynamic Stopwords Management 1. **Regular Analysis of Query Logs**: Analyze search query logs to identify frequently used words that do not contribute to search relevance. These can be programmatically added to the stopwords list via scripts. 2. **Content Analysis**: Use text analysis tools to periodically scan your indexed content, identifying high-frequency but low-value words that could be added to your stopwords list. 3. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop in your application to gather user input on search effectiveness. This could help identify potential stopwords or even valuable terms that should not be treated as stopwords. 4. **Automatic Updates via API**: Create a script or application that automatically updates the managed stopwords list in Solr based on analysis findings. This would leverage Solr's REST API for managed resources. # Considerations - **Precision and Recall**: Aggressively filtering stopwords can improve search performance but might also remove potentially relevant terms, affecting recall. It's crucial to strike a balance based on your specific use case and dataset. - **Language and Domain Specificity**: Stopwords can be highly language-specific and domain-specific. Any automated process for identifying stopwords should take into account the linguistic and topical context of the content being indexed. - **Maintenance**: Automated or semi-automated approaches to managing stopwords require ongoing maintenance and monitoring to ensure that the stopwords list remains effective and relevant as your dataset and usage patterns evolve. In conclusion, while there's no out-of-the-box solution for auto-stopwords in Solr, the system's flexibility and the availability of external tools allow for the development of custom solutions to dynamically manage stopwords. Such solutions can lead to more efficient and relevant search experiences."},{"instruction":"typo tolerance in solr","output":"Implementing typo tolerance in Apache Solr searches enhances user experience by allowing the search engine to return relevant results even when the search query contains misspellings or typographical errors. Solr provides several features and approaches to achieve typo tolerance, largely centered around its powerful text analysis capabilities and the \\"fuzzy search\\" feature. Here are the primary methods to implement typo tolerance in Solr: # 1. Fuzzy Searches Solr supports fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein Distance or Edit Distance algorithm. This allows Solr to return matches that are \\"close\\" to the search term, even if they are not exactly the same. Fuzzy searches are invoked using the tilde (\\"~\\") syntax at the end of a search term, optionally followed by a distance value. For example: \`\`\` text:roam~1 \`\`\` This query searches for words like “foam” and “roams” that are within a Levenshtein distance of 1 from the term “roam.” # 2. Spell Checking The Solr SpellCheck component can be used to provide suggestions for misspelled words in search queries. It can be configured to automatically suggest corrections or to run in a more interactive mode where suggestions are offered for user selection. When properly configured, the spell checker can use existing index data or external source data to generate a dictionary of correct spellings. # 3. Phonetic Matching Solr can be configured to use phonetic algorithms, such as Soundex or Metaphone, which translate words into a coded representation based on their pronunciation. With this approach, words that sound alike but are spelled differently (homophones) can be considered matches. Phonetic matching can be particularly useful for names or other terms where users may be uncertain of the spelling. # 4. Synonyms While not specifically for typo tolerance, configuring synonyms can help with variations in spelling or commonly mistaken terms. By defining synonyms in Solr, you can ensure that searches return relevant results even if the query uses an alternate term or common misspelling. # 5. N-Grams Using n-grams for indexing and searching can also provide typo tolerance. In this approach, words are broken down into sequences of n characters, and these n-grams are indexed and searched. This allows for partial matches and can be effective in catching typographical errors, though at the expense of increased index size and potential performance impact. # Configuring for Typo Tolerance To implement these features effectively, you’ll need to carefully configure your Solr schema. This may involve: - **Defining appropriate field types** for fuzzy, phonetic, and n-gram searching, specifying analyzers that include filters for these processes. - **Configuring the spell check component** with a suitable source for its dictionary, whether based on indexed data or an external source. - **Experimenting with parameters** to balance performance with the desired level of typo tolerance. For example, the distance value in fuzzy searches affects both the \\"tolerance\\" level and the performance of searches. # Considerations - **Performance Impact**: Features like fuzzy searches, phonetic matching, and n-grams can impact query performance and index size. Performance testing and tuning are essential to find a balance that works for your specific application and dataset. - **Relevance Tuning**: Implementing typo tolerance can also affect the relevance of search results. Be prepared to adjust the scoring and ranking of results to ensure that the most relevant items are still surfaced effectively to users. In conclusion, Solr offers powerful capabilities to implement typo tolerance, which can greatly enhance the search experience. By carefully configuring and combining features like fuzzy searching, spell checking, phonetic matching, synonyms, and n-grams, you can create a robust, typo-tolerant search solution."},{"instruction":"solr query suggestion","output":"Implementing query suggestion in Apache Solr is a powerful feature to enhance user search experience by providing real-time recommendations as users type their queries. This not only helps users formulate better queries but also can guide them toward the content they might not have explicitly considered. Solr supports query suggestions through its Suggester component, which can be configured to offer autocomplete functionality, spelling corrections, and other forms of suggestions. Here's a brief overview of setting up and using Solr's Suggester for query suggestions. # Setting Up the Suggester Component To enable query suggestions, you need to configure the Solr Suggester component in your \`solrconfig.xml\`. There are different types of Suggester based on the underlying implementation, like AnalyzingSuggester, BlendedInfixSuggester, and FuzzySuggester, each catering to different needs. Here's a basic example of how to configure a Suggester component: \`\`\`xml <searchComponent name=\\"suggest\\" class=\\"solr.SuggestComponent\\"> <lst name=\\"suggester\\"> <str name=\\"name\\">mySuggester</str> <str name=\\"lookupImpl\\">AnalyzingSuggester</str> <str name=\\"dictionaryImpl\\">DocumentDictionaryFactory</str> <str name=\\"field\\">suggest_field</str> <str name=\\"suggestAnalyzerFieldType\\">text_general</str> <str name=\\"buildOnStartup\\">false</str> </lst> </searchComponent> <requestHandler name=\\"/suggest\\" class=\\"solr.SearchHandler\\" startup=\\"lazy\\"> <lst name=\\"defaults\\"> <str name=\\"suggest\\">true</str> <str name=\\"suggest.count\\">5</str> <str name=\\"suggest.dictionary\\">mySuggester</str> </lst> <arr name=\\"components\\"> <str>suggest</str> </arr> </requestHandler> \`\`\` In this configuration, a Suggester named \`mySuggester\` is defined along with a request handler \`/suggest\` that uses this suggester. The \`field\` specifies which field in your documents should be used for generating suggestions. For generating suggestions from aggregated data or custom criteria, you might configure the \`dictionaryImpl\` differently, such as using a custom dictionary factory. # Generating Suggestions After configuring the Suggester, you need to build the suggestion dictionary. Depending on your Suggester configuration, this might involve indexing documents that contain the suggestible terms or explicitly invoking a request to build the suggestion dictionary. For suggesters configured with \`buildOnStartup=false\`, you can trigger the build process with a URL like: \`\`\` http://localhost:8983/solr/my_collection/suggest?suggest.build=true \`\`\` # Querying for Suggestions Once the suggestion dictionary is built, you can query the suggester by hitting the configured request handler: \`\`\` http://localhost:8983/solr/my_collection/suggest?suggest.q=use \`\`\` This would return suggestions based on the partial query \\"use\\". # Advanced Configuration The Suggester component offers ample room for customization: - **Lookup Implementations**: Different implementations offer features like fuzzy matching, context filtering, or infix suggestions. Choose based on your application needs. - **Analyzer Configuration**: Tailoring the suggestion field analyzer can improve suggestion quality by ensuring that the suggestion process closely matches how queries are processed against the search index. - **Performance Considerations**: Some suggester configurations, especially those offering complex functionalities like fuzzy suggestions, may have implications on performance. Monitoring and optimizing the suggester setup is crucial for applications with high throughput or large datasets. # Conclusion Query suggestions are a valuable feature to guide users toward better search experiences. Apache Solr's Suggester component provides a robust framework for implementing such functionality, accommodating a range of use cases from simple autocomplete to more complex, analytically driven suggestion engines. As with any Solr feature, careful configuration, testing, and optimization are key to ensuring that suggestions are relevant, performant, and valuable to end-users."},{"instruction":"could we use click events to rerank in solr query results?","output":"Yes, you can use click events, or user interaction data more generally, to rerank query results in Apache Solr. This approach is part of a broader strategy known as Learning to Rank (LTR), which leverages user behavior and machine learning models to optimize the ranking of search results for relevance. # Learning to Rank (LTR) in Solr Solr's Learning to Rank (LTR) feature allows you to train a machine learning model with features derived from your search data and signals from user interactions, such as clicks, views, or purchases. This model can then predict the most relevant order of documents for a given query, effectively using historical user behavior to influence future result rankings. # How to Use Click Events for Re-Ranking: 1. **Collect Click Data**: Start by logging click events and other relevant user actions in your application. Each event should include the query, the document clicked, and other contextual information like the click position, timestamp, user session ID, etc. 2. **Define Features**: Identify and define features that will be used by the LTR model. Features can be document-specific (like text relevancy scores, document age, popularity metrics) or query-document specific (like whether the document title contains query terms). 3. **Prepare Training Data**: Use the collected click data to prepare training sets. This process involves labeling documents with relevance scores, often inferred from user behavior (e.g., documents that are clicked more frequently are considered more relevant). 4. **Train an LTR Model**: Using Solr's LTR framework and your prepared training data, train a machine learning model. Solr integrates with libraries like RankLib, which provides various ranking models (e.g., LambdaMART, RankNet). 5. **Deploy the Model**: Once trained, the model can be deployed to Solr. You'll need to configure Solr to use the LTR model for reranking query results based on the model's predictions. 6. **Query Using the LTR Model**: When performing searches, you can specify that Solr should use the deployed LTR model to rerank the results. This is typically done through Solr's query API, where you can pass parameters indicating the model to be used for reranking. # Considerations: - **Data Quality and Bias**: The effectiveness of your LTR model heavily relies on the quality and quantity of your click data. Be cautious of biases in your data, as they can lead to suboptimal or skewed rankings. - **Model Complexity and Performance**: More complex models may offer better relevance at the cost of increased computational resources and latency. Balance is key. - **Continuous Learning**: User preferences and content change over time. Regularly update your model with fresh data to keep the rankings relevant. - **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**: Ensure that you handle user data responsibly, complying with privacy laws and regulations. # Conclusion: Utilizing click events to rerank query results in Solr can significantly enhance the relevance of search outcomes, providing a more personalized search experience. The integration of Solr's LTR feature with machine learning models driven by user interactions represents a powerful method to optimize search result rankings based on actual user behavior. However, successful implementation requires careful planning, a good understanding of machine learning, and ongoing management of the LTR system."},{"instruction":"custom ranking logic in solr","output":"Customizing ranking logic in Apache Solr to suit specific application needs is a common requirement, especially when the default relevance scoring (based on TF-IDF, Vector Space Model, or BM25) doesn't align perfectly with the desired search experience. Solr provides several powerful mechanisms to tailor how search results are ranked, enabling you to prioritize documents based on criteria beyond simple keyword matching. Below are some of the primary ways you can implement custom ranking logic in Solr. # 1. Function Queries Solr supports using function queries to modify the score of documents based on certain conditions or document field values. Function queries allow for the manipulation of document scores using a wide range of mathematical, conditional, and data access functions. You might use a function query to boost documents based on factors like recency, popularity (e.g., page views), user preferences, or geographic proximity if you're implementing location-based searches. For example, to boost newer documents, you might use a function query that boosts scores based on a recency factor calculated from a \`date\` field: \`\`\` {!boost b=recip(ms(NOW,my_date_field),3.16e-11,1,1)} \`\`\` This example uses the \`recip\` (reciprocal) function to decrease the influence of the date field over time, effectively giving newer documents a higher score. # 2. The \`bf\` (Boost Functions) and \`boost\` Parameters Solr allows you to add boosts to the scoring of a query using the \`bf\` (boost functions) and \`boost\` parameters. These parameters apply functions to adjust the scores of documents at query time. The \`bf\` parameter adds the result of the function to the original score, while the \`boost\` parameter multiplies the original score by the function result. For instance, to boost documents from a preferred category, you might use a parameter like: \`\`\` bf=if(termfreq(category,'preferred'),2,1) \`\`\` This will boost documents in the 'preferred' category. # 3. Payloads Payloads offer a way to associate additional data with terms in a document. For instance, you could use payloads to store a numeric value representing the importance of a term within a particular document context. Solr's payload functions can then access these payloads during a query to affect scoring, enabling highly nuanced relevance models based on term importance. # 4. External File Field The ExternalFileField type in Solr lets you use an external file to apply document-specific boosts at query time. This approach is handy when you have rapidly changing boost values that you don't want to frequently reindex, such as popularity scores or inventory levels for eCommerce products. You can update the external file as needed, and Solr will use the external boosts without requiring reindexing. # 5. Learning to Rank (LTR) Solr's Learning to Rank (LTR) module integrates machine learning models into the ranking process, allowing even more sophisticated customization of result ranking based on historical data, user interactions, and other complex criteria. LTR requires setting up feature stores, training models based on those features, and deploying the models to Solr for use in scoring documents. # Considerations When implementing custom ranking logic in Solr, consider the following: - **Performance**: Custom scoring can impact query performance. Test and monitor the impact of your customizations. - **Complexity**: More complex ranking logic can be harder to maintain and understand. Document your customizations clearly. - **Data Quality**: Ensure your scoring factors (e.g., popularity scores, user ratings) are accurate and meaningful. Custom ranking logic allows you to tailor search results to meet specific application requirements and user expectations, enhancing the overall search experience. By leveraging Solr's flexible scoring mechanisms, you can prioritize documents based on a wide variety of factors, making your search results more relevant and useful to your users."},{"instruction":"what is BM25 relevance scoring in solr? how can we set it in solr instead of tf-idf scoring?","output":"BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query, based on the query terms appearing in each document. BM25 is a part of the family of Okapi weighting schemes. It improves upon the classical TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model by introducing two additional tuning parameters that help control the term frequency saturation and the length normalization of the document. Essentially, it aims to address some limitations of TF-IDF related to term frequency scaling and document length normalization. # BM25 Parameters: - **k1**: Controls non-linear term frequency normalization (saturation). Higher values increase the influence of TF. - **b**: Determines the degree of length normalization. Setting \`b\` to 1 fully enables length normalization, while setting it to 0 disables it. BM25's formula for a term's contribution to the document score incorporates these parameters, alongside the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the term, to calculate a more nuanced relevance score than TF-IDF. # Setting BM25 in Solr: Solr 7.x and newer versions use BM25 as the default similarity (relevance scoring) model, moving away from the classic TF-IDF based model that was used in earlier versions. However, if you are working with an older version of Solr, or if you have custom Similarity configurations that you need to switch to BM25, here is how you can ensure BM25 is utilized: 1. **Schema Configuration**: To set BM25 as the similarity model for your Solr collection, you need to make adjustments in your schema configuration (\`managed-schema\` or \`schema.xml\`, depending on your setup). You define the similarity class at the field type or global level. For setting it globally: \`\`\`xml <similarity class=\\"solr.BM25SimilarityFactory\\"/> \`\`\` Or for a specific field type: \`\`\`xml <fieldtype name=\\"text_bm25\\" class=\\"solr.TextField\\"> <analyzer> ... </analyzer> <similarity class=\\"solr.BM25SimilarityFactory\\"> <str name=\\"k1\\">1.2</str> <str name=\\"b\\">0.75</str> </similarity> </fieldtype> \`\`\` In this snippet, \`k1\` and \`b\` are set to their commonly used default values, but you can adjust them based on your data and requirements for tuning the relevance model. 2. **Apply the Field Type**: Ensure that your documents use the field type where you've configured BM25 for the relevant fields. 3. **Re-Index**: After changing the similarity model, re-index your data to ensure that the inverted index reflects the BM25 scoring. 4. **Testing and Tuning**: BM25's effectiveness can vary based on its parameters (\`k1\` and \`b\`), the nature of your data, and what your users consider relevant. It's essential to test different configurations and fine-tune the parameters to fit your specific use case. # Considerations: - **Compatibility**: If you're running a mixed environment with different Solr versions, ensure that your similarity settings are compatible with each version. - **Customization**: While BM25 works well out of the box for many use cases, its performance can be significantly improved with careful tuning of its parameters, especially in specialized domains. - **Evaluation**: Use Solr's built-in query and indexing performance metrics to evaluate the impact of switching to or tuning BM25 on your search relevance and system performance. By adjusting to BM25 and fine-tuning its parameters, you can leverage a more modern and theoretically grounded approach to relevance scoring that more accurately represents user information needs in many scenarios."},{"instruction":"what all information could be found on solr request logs?","output":"Apache Solr's request logs contain valuable information about the interactions between clients and the Solr server. These logs are crucial for monitoring performance, troubleshooting issues, understanding user behavior, and optimizing the search experience.

This is crucial for correlating events and understanding the sequence of actions leading to a particular state or issue. # 2. **Log Level** Solr logs include a variety of log levels (INFO, ERROR, WARN, DEBUG, etc.), indicating the severity or importance of the log message. This helps in filtering logs for troubleshooting or analysis. # 3. **HTTP Method and Request URI** The logs typically include the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) used for the request and the request URI, which often contains the Solr collection or core being queried, the handler called (e.g., \`/select\`, \`/update\`, \`/admin\`), and the query parameters. # 4. **Client Information** Information about the client making the request, such as the IP address and, sometimes, the user-agent string, can be found in the logs. This is useful for identifying patterns or issues related to specific clients or types of clients. # 5. **Query Parameters** For search queries, the logs detail the query parameters passed. This might include the query string (\`q\`), filters (\`fq\`), fields to return (\`fl\`), sort order (\`sort\`), pagination parameters (\`start\`, \`rows\`), and more. Analyzing these can help understand user search behavior and identify potential areas for optimizing the search experience. # 6. **Execution Time** Solr logs the time taken to execute the request, which is vital for performance monitoring and pinpointing slow queries or operations. # 7. **Response Status** The HTTP response status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500) is logged, indicating whether the request was successful or resulted in an error. This is critical for error tracking and operational monitoring. # 8. **Error Messages** In case of errors, Solr logs provide error messages and stack traces, offering clues for troubleshooting issues related to queries, configuration, or Solr internals. # 9. **Security Information** If Solr's security features are enabled, relevant security events, like authentication and authorization failures, may also be logged, helping in security monitoring and incident investigation. # Configuring Solr Request Logs Solr uses Log4j 2 for logging, and you can configure the request log details in the \`log4j2.xml\` configuration file. You can adjust the log format, log level for different components, and define log rotation policies, among other settings. It's important to strike a balance between logging verbosity (to capture sufficient detail for analysis) and log volume management (to avoid excessive log size and potential performance impacts). # Interpreting Log Information Properly interpreting Solr logs requires an understanding of Solr architecture and operations. Regular monitoring and analysis of logs can reveal trends, potential issues, and opportunities for optimization. Automated tools and scripts can help aggregate and analyze log data, making it easier to extract actionable insights. In summary, Solr request logs are a rich source of information for managing and optimizing Solr instances. Regularly reviewing and analyzing these logs is a best practice for any Solr administrator or developer."},{"instruction":"user personalised searches with solr","output":"Implementing user-personalized searches with Apache Solr involves tailoring search results to the individual user's preferences, behavior, and context. This personalization can significantly enhance the user experience by making search results more relevant and useful. While Solr does not provide out-of-the-box user personalization features, you can leverage its capabilities to implement personalized search experiences. Below are key strategies to achieve user personalization in Solr: # 1. User Profiles Create user profiles that capture the interests, preferences, and behavior of individual users. This information can be based on explicit user inputs (e.g., preferences set in their profile) or inferred from user actions (e.g., click history, purchase history, etc.). User profiles can include: - Preferred categories or topics - Frequently searched terms - Historical interactions with search results (clicks, views, purchases) # 2. Query Customization Use the information in user profiles to customize search queries. This can be done by: - **Boosting relevant documents**: Apply boosts to documents that match the user's interests. For instance, if a user frequently interacts with documents in a specific category, you can boost that category for searches initiated by that user. - **Filtering results**: Use the \`fq\` (filter query) parameter to filter search results based on user preferences, ensuring that only relevant documents are returned. - **Altering query parameters**: Modify other query parameters based on the user's profile to adjust relevance, such as changing the default search field (\`df\`) or using different scoring models. # 3. Learning to Rank (LTR) Solr's Learning to Rank (LTR) feature allows you to integrate machine learning models into the search ranking process. By training a model based on user interactions with search results (such as clicks, likes, or purchases), you can predict the most relevant documents for a given query and user context. LTR models can incorporate features derived from user profiles, search context, and document attributes to personalize ranking. # 4. Collaborative Filtering Implement collaborative filtering techniques to recommend documents based on the behavior of similar users. While this is more commonly associated with recommendation systems, collaborative filtering can be adapted to personalize search results by boosting documents that users with similar profiles have found relevant. # 5. Real-time Behavior Tracking For dynamic personalization, track user behavior in real-time and adjust search results accordingly. This could involve: - Boosting documents that the user has recently viewed or interacted with. - Modifying the user's profile based on their current session data to reflect immediate interests or needs. # 6. Using External Services Integrate external services or custom-built microservices that specialize in user profiling and personalization with Solr.

Always prioritize user privacy and data security. - **Performance**: Personalization logic can add complexity to search operations. Monitor Solr’s performance and optimize the configuration to maintain fast response times. - **Continuous Improvement**: User preferences can change over time. Implement mechanisms to regularly update user profiles and personalization models based on new user data. User personalization in Solr involves a combination of thoughtful strategy, leveraging Solr features, and possibly integrating with external personalization engines or machine learning models. By personalizing search results, you can offer users a more engaging and relevant search experience, leading to increased satisfaction and engagement."},{"instruction":"Make some lore for my character Karma","output":"In a realm where the balance between light and dark, good and evil, is meticulously maintained, there exists a being who walks the knife-edge of this duality with grace and purpose. This being is known as Karma, the Arbiter of Equilibrium. Neither god nor mortal, Karma embodies the essence of both retribution and redemption, holding the power to tip the scales of fate according to the deeds of those she encounters. Born from the cosmic convergence of a lunar eclipse, during a rare alignment of the celestial bodies, Karma was entrusted with the ancient Scales of Fate by the universe itself. These scales, shimmering with ethereal light, are not merely a symbol of her authority but an extension of her will, capable of weighing the souls of all beings against the weight of their actions and intentions. Karma resides in the Temple of Equinox, a place suspended in an ethereal dimension that intersects the myriad planes of existence. The Temple is both nowhere and everywhere, accessible only to those whom Karma deems necessary to the balance of the universe. Within its sanctified walls lies the Mirror of Reflection, a mystical artifact that reveals the true nature of one's soul, and the Library of Deeds, an infinite archive that records every action taken by every being since the dawn of creation. Despite her formidable power, Karma does not seek to judge or condemn, but to enlighten and restore balance. She intervenes only when the scales tip too far towards light or darkness, causing chaos and discord across the realms. To maintain equilibrium, she might bestow blessings upon those who act with pure intentions or unleash retribution upon those who tread the path of malevolence. Karma is a beacon of hope to some and a harbinger of doom to others. Tales of her interventions are shared in hushed tones among the peoples of the many worlds. She is known by many names—The Equilibrist, The Soul-Weaver, The Mistress of Fate—but to all, she is simply Karma. One of the most poignant tales of Karma involves a war-torn realm where the greed and ambition of a tyrant king had brought the land to the brink of destruction. Sensing the imbalance, Karma appeared before the king, offering him a glimpse into the Mirror of Reflection. Confronted with the truth of his soul's corruption and the suffering he had caused, the tyrant's heart was filled with remorse. With Karma's guidance, he sought redemption, dedicating the rest of his life to restoring peace and prosperity to his realm. Though she walks a lonely path, Karma is not without allies. The Celestial Guardians, beings of pure energy and light, serve as her emissaries across the cosmos. They intervene on her behalf, guiding those who have lost their way and protecting the innocent from the shadows that seek to engulf the universe in turmoil. Karma's presence is a constant reminder that every choice carries weight, every action has consequences, and that in the grand tapestry of existence, we are all threads intertwined by the delicate strands of destiny."},{"instruction":"Hypothetical comedy/factual show, Jane is an avid Wikipedia reader, but within the depths of the wiki there can be some really strange but true facts to 'verify' with credible sources :)","output":"**\\"Wiki Wonders with Jane\\"** **Tagline:** *Exploring the Wonders and Wonders of the World Wide Web* **Episode Structure:** *Introduction* - Jane introduces the day's theme, promising a journey through the wacky and wonderful corridors of Wikipedia.

The gang are on route to the Black Forest Toy Shop, Scrappy's looking forward to buying and makes quite a long list. Daphne tells him that he'll have to wait cause they're going there to find out who's stealing the store's profits. Inside the store, Shaggy and the dogs waste no time to look at the toys while Daphne is introduced to the store's owner Herr Dreisbach. Mr. Dreisbach leads them upstairs to meet his assistant Mr. Sigmund, Scrappy notices a portrait of Dreisbach's great-grandfather who founded the store, he lived by his famous motto \\"Treasure your foundation, for it's bricks will build your future\\". But Mr. Dreisbach opens a safe behind the portrait and shows them that the remaining money. As they walked back downstairs, Mr. Sigmund says that Dreisbach's great-grandfather build the store on top of an elf king's castle and the Evil Elf King's return to take back his property. Suddenly Scrappy's picked up by the head of the stuffed toys department Katerina Kobald. She found Scrappy cute that he put ribbons on him, but that only annoys him. Dreisbach mentions that he never found the treasure his grandfather hid and hopes that he could save the store if he finds it. The Forest Toy Company wants to buy the store and Sigmund starts to agree that he should sell. That night, they split-up to search the building, Scooby and Shaggy find small elf puppets and play with them until they got tangled in the strings. Suddenly, the puppets come to life and run off to meet with their master the Evil Elf. Once they freed themselves, the duo hid in the stuffed toys and fooled the elf puppets, prompting the Evil Elf to order the small puppets to take two stuffed bears and left. They met up with Daphne and Scrappy and told them what happened. Daphne finds a lab report sent to Katerina at 123 Forest lane. She asked the lab to analyze the mineral content of a brick which doesn't really make sense to them. They split-up again to find the Evil Elf, Daphne has Scooby and Shaggy to check downstairs while the others take the upstairs. They refuse, but Daphne tricks them by throwing a box of Scooby Snacks downstairs and they ran after it. Daphne and Scrappy spied on the Evil Elf ordering his toy robot from within the safe to open it, they robbed more of the money and escaped. Daphne once again reads the motto on the portrait and finds a big clue and headed to meet up with Shaggy and Scooby. While chowing down some Scooby Snacks, they ran into an annoyed Mr. Sigmund who leaves warning them to leave before the Evil Elf turns them into toys. They laugh at the idea, but they soon realize that they were sitting on a conveyor belt that dresses them in clown costumes and traps them in jack-in-the-boxes. Daphne and Scrappy finds them and notices that the boxes have been addressed to the company who wanted to buy the store with the 123 Forest lane on it. They let them out and Scooby gets his head stuck in the wall, once freed they find that a brick is missing where Scooby got stuck and more boxes addressed to the Forest Toy Company. The Evil Elf shows up and chases them to the elevator where they were cornered by the puppets and toy robot. Scrappy jumps in a toy airplane with a cockpit that's just his size and uses it to save Daphne, but is caught by the Evil Elf. Shaggy and Scooby bounced off a trampoline and landed on a rocking horse up the stairs and rode down them and crashed right into the Elf. Daphne unmasks the Elf who's really Katerina Kobald. Handing her to the authorities, Daphne explains that she was the one who robbed the safe using a remote-control hidden in her glove to have the robot in the safe to open it from the inside, then she stuffed the stolen money into the bears and send them to the Forest Toy Company which was her own address. She did it for the treasure Dreisbach's grandfather left and Daphne figures it out and leads them to the basement. She shows them the hole Scooby got stuck in and that the motto was a clue, Katerina had the brick analyzed and discovered that the bricks is the treasure. Scooby and Scrappy used a hose to reveal that the wall is solid gold. Shaggy and Scooby noticed from the boxes that more baby toys climbed on them mistaking them for their dads.","output":"[We open in the dark, eerie Black Forest Toy Shop, where a cloaked figure we'll come to know as Katerina Kobald, is suspiciously tapping on a vintage toy robot.] **Katerina (sinisterly):** Ah, my little metallic friend, tonight, you work for me!

The gang are on route to the Black Forest Toy Shop, Scrappy's looking forward to buying and makes quite a long list. Daphne tells him that he'll have to wait cause they're going there to find out who's stealing the store's profits. Inside the store, Shaggy and the dogs waste no time to look at the toys while Daphne is introduced to the store's owner Herr Dreisbach. Mr. Dreisbach leads them upstairs to meet his assistant Mr. Sigmund, Scrappy notices a portrait of Dreisbach's great-grandfather who founded the store, he lived by his famous motto \\"Treasure your foundation, for it's bricks will build your future\\". But Mr. Dreisbach opens a safe behind the portrait and shows them that the remaining money. As they walked back downstairs, Mr. Sigmund says that Dreisbach's great-grandfather build the store on top of an elf king's castle and the Evil Elf King's return to take back his property. Suddenly Scrappy's picked up by the head of the stuffed toys department Katerina Kobald. She found Scrappy cute that he put ribbons on him, but that only annoys him. Dreisbach mentions that he never found the treasure his grandfather hid and hopes that he could save the store if he finds it. The Forest Toy Company wants to buy the store and Sigmund starts to agree that he should sell. That night, they split-up to search the building, Scooby and Shaggy find small elf puppets and play with them until they got tangled in the strings. Suddenly, the puppets come to life and run off to meet with their master the Evil Elf. Once they freed themselves, the duo hid in the stuffed toys and fooled the elf puppets, prompting the Evil Elf to order the small puppets to take two stuffed bears and left. They met up with Daphne and Scrappy and told them what happened. Daphne finds a lab report sent to Katerina at 123 Forest lane. She asked the lab to analyze the mineral content of a brick which doesn't really make sense to them. They split-up again to find the Evil Elf, Daphne has Scooby and Shaggy to check downstairs while the others take the upstairs. They refuse, but Daphne tricks them by throwing a box of Scooby Snacks downstairs and they ran after it. Daphne and Scrappy spied on the Evil Elf ordering his toy robot from within the safe to open it, they robbed more of the money and escaped. Daphne once again reads the motto on the portrait and finds a big clue and headed to meet up with Shaggy and Scooby. While chowing down some Scooby Snacks, they ran into an annoyed Mr. Sigmund who leaves warning them to leave before the Evil Elf turns them into toys. They laugh at the idea, but they soon realize that they were sitting on a conveyor belt that dresses them in clown costumes and traps them in jack-in-the-boxes. Daphne and Scrappy finds them and notices that the boxes have been addressed to the company who wanted to buy the store with the 123 Forest lane on it. They let them out and Scooby gets his head stuck in the wall, once freed they find that a brick is missing where Scooby got stuck and more boxes addressed to the Forest Toy Company. The Evil Elf shows up and chases them to the elevator where they were cornered by the puppets and toy robot. Scrappy jumps in a toy airplane with a cockpit that's just his size and uses it to save Daphne, but is caught by the Evil Elf. Shaggy and Scooby bounced off a trampoline and landed on a rocking horse up the stairs and rode down them and crashed right into the Elf. Daphne unmasks the Elf who's really Katerina Kobald. Handing her to the authorities, Daphne explains that she was the one who robbed the safe using a remote-control hidden in her glove to have the robot in the safe to open it from the inside, then she stuffed the stolen money into the bears and send them to the Forest Toy Company which was her own address. She did it for the treasure Dreisbach's grandfather left and Daphne figures it out and leads them to the basement. She shows them the hole Scooby got stuck in and that the motto was a clue, Katerina had the brick analyzed and discovered that the bricks is the treasure. Scooby and Scrappy used a hose to reveal that the wall is solid gold. Shaggy and Scooby noticed from the boxes that more baby toys climbed on them mistaking them for their dads.","output":"Title: \\"Gold Bricks and Giggles: The Black Forest Toy Shop Caper\\" In the mysterious depths of the Black Forest Toy Shop, where teddy bears plot and toy soldiers stand guard, our villain, the Evil Elf, was up to no good, pilfering pennies with a patented elfish pout. Little did he know that meddling kids and their mutt were on a collision course with comedy. \\"Like, can you believe that name? Black Forest Toy Shop sounds like a dessert with an identity crisis,\\" Shaggy mused as the gang rolled into the quaint, albeit suspiciously mythical-sounding town. Daphne, ever the sarcastic siren, retorted, \\"Yeah, and next you'll tell us you're expecting a Black Forest ham to jump out.\\" Scrappy, nose buried in his colossal toy list, barely looked up, his dreams of heroism now inexplicably linked to acquiring a laser-tag set. Upon their arrival, they were greeted by Herr Dreisbach, the toy shop owner with a surname that Fred immediately misconstrued. \\"Any relation to Dr. Dre?\\" he inquired, hopeful for an autograph. Dreisbach, visibly annoyed, corrected him, \\"No, I don't produce music or headphones; I produce happiness in the form of toys.\\" As they were introduced to the assistant, Mr. Sigmund, Scooby and Shaggy had already embarked on a toy testing mission — namely, seeing if toy kitchens could produce real sandwiches (spoiler: they couldn't, leading to a disappointed Scooby and a physics rant from Shaggy about how \\"Like, food should be food, man\\"). Velma began explaining the improbability of an elf king and his mini minions reclaiming a toy shop due to a lack of historical precedence and zoning laws, only to be cut off by Daphne's quip, \\"Save it, Velma. We lost you at 'improbability.'\\" Their investigation led them to an encounter with Katerina Kobald, the head of the stuffed toys department, who Scrappy mistaken for Catherine O'Hara because \\"Kobald, O'Hara... tomato, tomah-to.\\" Katerina's scowl suggested she did not appreciate being likened to the star of \\"Home Alone\\". That night, as they split up to search for clues, Scooby and Shaggy's antics with the elf puppets would've broken the internet had it been filmed. \\"Like, Scoob, these strings defy gravity... and logic!\\" Shaggy exclaimed while entangled, leading to a five-minute rant about the physics of puppetry, which was only cut short by their encounter with the puppets' far less inanimate master. Meanwhile, Daphne stumbled upon a lab report for a brick, muttering, \\"Who sends a brick to the lab? Was it feeling crumbly?\\" The nonsensical nature of their clues only deepened when they discovered the conveyor belt designed for toy costume malfunctions. \\"This is a safety hazard... and a fashion crime,\\" Daphne quipped as Scooby and Shaggy emerged, adorned in clown attire, Scooby's head stuck in a wall. Their comedic chase reached its zenith with Scrappy heroically piloting a toy plane, Shaggy and Scooby's strategic trampoline-to-rocking horse maneuver, and finally, the unmasking of Katerina Kobald as the larcenous Elf. \\"And I would’ve gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids and your unintelligible logic!\\" she exclaimed, her plot foiled by high jinks and hapless logic. As Daphne unraveled the mystery of the golden bricks, telling the gang, \\"Turns out, bricks can be treasure if you paint them gold—or find out they've been gold all along, which is frankly a bizarre economic strategy,\\" they all stared in disbelief at the golden wall revealed by Scooby's accidental excavation. \\"Like, does this mean we're rich?\\" Shaggy pondered, only to be interrupted by a pile of baby toys climbing them, mistaking them as parental figures. Scooby, ever the voice of reason, simply stated, \\"Ruh-roh, Raggy. Rime to rleave!\\" And so, with their adventure wrapped up in laughs, logic-defying moments, and a sprinkle of accidental wealth, the gang set off into the sunset — or rather, towards the nearest all-you-can-eat buffet, hearts full and pockets suddenly heavier. The case of the Black Forest Toy Shop was closed, but the memories of its ludicrous logic would live on, much like the credit card bill for Scrappy's now even longer toy list."},{"instruction":"Dissertation philosophique.

Cette interrogation nous confronte à la tension entre le désir d'exprimer nos pensées librement et la nécessité de respecter l'autre dans sa différence et sa dignité. Dès lors, le problème qui se pose est de savoir où tracer la limite entre la liberté d'expression et le respect d'autrui. Peut-on, sous le couvert de cette liberté, tout exprimer sans barrière ni retenue? Cette dissertation se propose de démêler cette question épineuse en trois parties: nous examinerons d'abord les arguments en faveur de l'assertion selon laquelle on peut tout dire, puis nous verrons les limites et les objections à cette idée, pour finalement proposer une synthèse visant à concilier liberté et respect. **Développement** *Thèse: L'argumentation en faveur de la liberté totale d'expression* La première position à discuter est celle qui défend la possibilité et le droit de tout dire. Selon les défenseurs de cette vision, la liberté d'expression est absolue et constitue le fondement même d'une société démocratique. Ils avancent que pouvoir tout dire est essentiel pour le progrès des idées et la résolution des conflits de manière pacifique. Cette perspective est souvent associée à la célèbre citation attribuée à Voltaire: \\"Je ne suis pas d'accord avec ce que vous dites, mais je me battrai jusqu'à la mort pour que vous puissiez le dire.\\" Dans ce cadre, restreindre la parole reviendrait donc à museler la société, empêcher l'invention et l'innovation, et finalement freiner l'avancée vers une meilleure compréhension mutuelle et un monde plus juste. *Antithèse: Les limites de la liberté d'expression et le respect d'autrui* En opposition à cette vision idéaliste de la liberté d'expression se dresse une réalité plus complexe qui prend en compte les possibles dérives du \\"tout dire\\". Critiquer l'absolutisme de la liberté de parole ne signifie pas nier son importance, mais plutôt reconnaître qu'elle doit être exercée avec responsabilité. Les propos haineux, racistes, sexistes ou discriminatoires, par exemple, peuvent avoir des conséquences désastreuses sur les individus ou groupes visés, menant à l'exclusion, à la violence, voire à des tragédies. De plus, la désinformation et les fausses nouvelles diffusées sans discernement peuvent éroder la confiance dans les institutions et dans les médias, affaiblir le tissu social et même menacer la démocratie. Dès lors, l'argument pour des limites à ce qu'on peut dire puise sa force dans la nécessité de protéger la cohésion sociale et le respect de l'autre. *Synthèse: Trouver un juste milieu* Ainsi, la solution ne réside ni dans une liberté d'expression sans bornes, ni dans une censure systématique, mais plutôt dans une approche équilibrée qui respecte la liberté tout en tenant compte des devoirs de chacun envers autrui. Cet équilibre peut être atteint par l'éducation aux médias, le développement d'une pensée critique, et la promotion d'un dialogue ouvert et respectueux. Les lois et règlements peuvent également jouer un rôle, non pas en censurant préventivement, mais en sanctionnant les discours qui portent atteinte aux droits fondamentaux d'autrui. L'objectif final serait de créer un espace public où la multiplicité des voix peut s'exprimer dans un cadre de respect mutuel. **Conclusion** En réponse à la question \\"Peut-on tout dire?\\", il apparaît clair que la réponse ne saurait être un oui sans nuance. Si la liberté d'expression est un pilier de nos démocraties, elle ne peut se concrétiser pleinement qu'en tenant compte des responsabilités qui l'accompagnent. La véritable liberté d'expression exige un équilibre délicat entre le droit de parler et le devoir d'écouter, entre l'affirmation de soi et le respect de l'autre. Elle s'inscrit dans un pacte social où chaque membre accepte de limiter sa propre liberté dans l'intérêt du bien commun. En somme, on peut dire beaucoup, mais pas tout, car dans la dignité de l'autre se trouve la limite de notre propre liberté."},{"instruction":"Lis les consignes puis le NB. Ceci ne vas pas suffir pour 6 pages. J'ai peut de temps pour remettre le devoir, donc je n'ai pas le temps d'ajouter autre chose. Faites le pour moi svp.","output":"Je comprends votre inquiétude et je vais tenter de développer davantage chaque section pour répondre à vos attentes. Toutefois, gardez à l'esprit que la densité du texte augmentera significativement. **Introduction** Dans notre ère numérique, où l'accès à l'information et la communication sont sans précédent, la question de savoir si l'on peut tout dire semble plus pertinente que jamais. La liberté d'expression, un droit fondamental dans de nombreuses démocraties, est au coeur de nombreux débats houleux qui divisent l'opinion publique. Ces controverses font écho à une interrogation profonde sur les limites de ce que l'individu peut exprimer sans freiner la liberté d'autrui ou porter atteinte à la cohésion sociale. Cette dissertation se propose de s'attarder sur cette interrogation, en posant d'emblée l'hypothèse selon laquelle, bien que la liberté d'expression soit un bien précieux, des limites à ce que l'on peut dire sont nécessaires pour préserver d'autres valeurs fondamentales. La réflexion s'articulera autour de la dialéctique classique: thèse, antithèse, suivies d'une synthèse visant à nuancer la question et à proposer une vision équilibrée. **Développement** *Thèse: L'importance de la liberté d'expression et le droit de tout dire* La liberté d'expression constitue l'un des piliers sur lequel repose l'idéal démocratique. Cette liberté est perçue comme essentielle à l'épanouissement de l'individu, lui permettant d'exprimer ses idées, ses convictions et ses émotions sans crainte de répression. Dans cette optique, certains arguments avancent que tout dire devrait être possible. Ce point de vue s'appuie sur plusieurs arguments. Premièrement, la capacité de s'exprimer librement est la marque d'une société ouverte et mature, capable de débattre de sujets difficiles. Deuxièmement, restreindre la parole reviendrait à entraver le progrès, car c'est souvent à travers l'expression de perspectives divergentes que les sociétés évoluent. Troisièmement, la censure ou les restrictions imposées à la parole sont considérées comme les premiers pas vers un régime autoritaire où d'autres libertés pourraient être menacées. À travers ces arguments, les défenseurs de la liberté totale d'expression soutiennent que les bénéfices d'un dialogue ouvert surpassent largement les risques potentiels de discours nocifs. *Antithèse: Les limites nécessaires à la liberté d'expression* Néanmoins, dans la pratique, la notion de liberté totale d'expression est confrontée à des dilemmes éthiques et sociaux complexes. Les critiques de l'absolutisme en matière de liberté d'expression mettent en lumière les dangers et les conséquences négatives de certains discours. Les discours de haine, les appels à la violence, la diffusion de fausses nouvelles et autres formes de communication nuisibles peuvent avoir des effets dévastateurs sur les individus et les groupes ciblés. Ils peuvent non seulement causer du tort à des personnes spécifiques, mais également saper les fondations de la démocratie en exacerbant les divisions et en promouvant l'intolérance. De surcroît, ces critiques arguent que la liberté d'expression n'est pas absolue et qu'elle doit être mise en balance avec d'autres droits fondamentaux, tels que le droit à la dignité, à la sécurité et à un environnement sans discrimination. Dans cette perspective, des limites au \\"tout dire\\" sont considérées comme des garde-fous essentiels pour protéger les individus et maintenir l'ordre public. *Synthèse: Vers un équilibre entre liberté et responsabilité* La recherche d'un juste milieu entre la liberté totale d'expression et la nécessaire protection contre ses abus mène à la notion de responsabilité. La clé d'une coexistence harmonieuse dans une société plurielle réside dans la capacité des individus à exercer leur liberté d'expression de manière responsable, en tenant compte de l'impact de leurs paroles sur autrui. Cela implique de reconnaître que certaines paroles, bien que légalement protégées, ne sont pas pour autant moralement ou éthiquement justifiables. Il est donc crucial de promouvoir un discours public qui privilégie le respect, l'ouverture d'esprit et la considération pour la diversité des expériences et des perspectives. Par ailleurs, l'éducation joue un rôle primordial dans le développement d'une conscience critique permettant de discerner les informations fiables des fausses nouvelles et de comprendre les conséquences de nos paroles. En définitive, une société qui valorise à la fois la liberté et la responsabilité crée un espace public où le dialogue et la compréhension mutuelle peuvent prospérer. **Conclusion** En conclusion, bien que la liberté d'expression soit un pilier central des démocraties modernes, la réponse à la question \\"Peut-on tout dire?\\" ne peut être un oui catégorique. Les arguments en faveur de la possibilité de tout exprimer doivent être mis en balance avec les impératifs de protection contre les discours de haine, la désinformation, et d'autres formes de communication nuisible. En reconnaissant que la liberté s'accompagne inévitablement de responsabilité, on peut aspirer à une société où la diversité des voix contribue à un échange constructif, plutôt qu'à la division. Ainsi, bien qu'on ne puisse pas tout dire, les limites imposées devraient viser à encourager une expression réfléchie et respectueuse, essentielle à la santé de notre espace démocratique commun."},{"instruction":"اصنع تطبيق الاحسبة بى استخدام سكربت javascripet و cess و html","output":"إليك طريقة بسيطة لإنشاء تطبيق حاسبة باستخدام HTML وCSS وJavaScript. # 1. إعداد HTML: قم بكتابة هيكل الحاسبة في ملف HTML. \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>حاسبة</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"style.css\\"> <!-- قم بربط ملف CSS هنا --> </head> <body> <div class=\\"calculator\\"> <input type=\\"text\\" class=\\"display\\" id=\\"display\\" disabled> <div class=\\"buttons\\"> <button onclick=\\"clearDisplay()\\">C</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('/')\\">/</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('*')\\">*</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('-')\\">-</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('7')\\">7</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('8')\\">8</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('9')\\">9</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('+')\\">+</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('4')\\">4</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('5')\\">5</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('6')\\">6</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('1')\\">1</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('2')\\">2</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('3')\\">3</button> <button onclick=\\"appendToDisplay('0')\\">0</button> <button onclick=\\"calculateResult()\\">=</button> </div> </div> <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> <!-- قم بربط ملف JavaScript هنا --> </body> </html> \`\`\` # 2. إعداد CSS: أضف بعض الأنماط البسيطة لتحسين مظهر الحاسبة. \`\`\`css /* style.css */ body { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh; background-color: #f0f0f0; } .calculator { border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px; } .display { width: calc(100% - 20px); margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; } .buttons { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); gap: 10px; } button { padding: 10px; border: none; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer; font-size: 16px; } button:hover { background-color: #f0f0f0; } \`\`\` # 3. إعداد JavaScript: أضف الوظائف اللازمة للتعامل مع الأحداث وإجراء العمليات الحسابية. \`\`\`javascript // script.js function appendToDisplay(value) { document.getElementById('display').value += value; } function clearDisplay() { document.getElementById('display').value = ''; } function calculateResult() { const display = document.getElementById('display'); try { display.value = eval(display.value); } catch (e) { display.value = 'Error'; } } \`\`\` هذا كل شيء!

The room, usually bustling with the scientific pursuits of the Doctor and his allies, now lies in silence, save for the soft humming of machinery and the occasional crackle from the corner where the latest oddity to catch UNIT's attention rests—a curiously detailed silver suit of armor, contained within a wooden crate that looks far too mundane for its contents. The Brigadier, earlier that day, had been his typical blustery self, fussing over the arrival of the armor with a mix of military skepticism and an unspoken worry that had become all too familiar to those dealing with the extranormal. The Doctor, on the other hand, displayed an amused fascination, his eyes twinkling with the prospect of unraveling another mystery. But as for Sarah, she couldn't help but feel a mix of apprehension and a reporter's intrinsic curiosity as she now stands before the crate. Drawing closer, she scrutinizes the armor. In the dim light, it seems almost to shimmer, the craftsmanship extraordinary even to her untrained eyes. It's as if the very essence of the metal called to her, beckoning her to come closer, to reach out and touch... A sudden scuttling sound breaks her concentration, causing her heart to skip. She laughs at herself, a short, nervous sound, upon spotting a mouse darting across the floor. \\"Oh, you silly thing,\\" she murmurs, feeling the tension ease from her shoulders. The room suddenly feels less ominous, more a place of mundane nighttime activities, the armor an intriguing but inert relic. Shaking her head at her own fanciful thoughts, Sarah moves closer to the crate. \\"What's the matter? You're not scared of a little mouse, are you?\\" she jests lightly, reaching out to playfully grasp the armor's metallic hand, expecting cold, unyielding metal beneath her fingers. But what happens next sends a shock through her system. The hand, instead of remaining still in the grip of the dead, grasps back with a firmness that sends a chilling realization through her spine. This is no mere relic; it harbors a startling life, or a simulation so convincing as to fool her senses. Sarah's breath catches in her throat, her initial reaction to shout for the Doctor stifled by the sheer impossibility of what’s occurring. The lab, once filled with the benign sounds of night, now seems oppressively silent, as if waiting for her response. Panic and curiosity war within her as she stands frozen, the realization hitting her fully—she is not alone. As this terrifying thought coalesces, the metallic grip tightens, a subtle mechanical whirring accompanying the action, just as her eyes meet the now glowing eyes of the armor. The scene cuts sharply, the tension reaching its peak. The screen then fades to black, the iconic sting of the Doctor Who credits piercing the silence. “DOCTOR WHO” appears in bold, retro letters against the backdrop of the starry void, the eerie theme tune playing, leaving viewers in suspense over Sarah Jane Smith’s fate at the hands of what is unmistakably a Cyberman in disguise. The credits roll, a promise of the alien intrigues and the thrilling adventure that awaits in the next episode of “The Silver Statues.”"},{"instruction":"How might it works in screenplay format?","output":"Certainly!

The horror rock star?\\" \\"No, Shaggy, it's Dracula...nevermind,\\" sighed Velma, rolling her eyes. Upon arrival, the gang swiftly realized this wasn't your typical Halloween haunt. The monsters were real, and their hospitality was as questionable as Dracula's fashion sense. \\"Why is everyone here so literal-minded?\\" Daphne quipped sarcastically. \\"Because, my dear, reality TV has nothing on us,\\" Dracula retorted, proving monsters watched cable too.

Scooby and Shaggy’s misadventure through the dungeon, guided by Scooby’s legendary snack-detection instincts, led them to the Moonstone Medallion. \\"Rooby-Roo, I wish we could find a giant sandwich!\\" Scooby exclaimed, fundamentally misunderstanding the medallion’s purpose. Yet, in true cartoon physics defiance, the escape led them right back to the party, minus Chandra, adding another layer of \\"What the heck?\\" to the night's events. Chandra's transformation into a toad, courtesy of her own backfired spell, followed by Igor’s reveal, had everyone questioning their career choices. Igor, finally getting his dues, was crowned a \\"Full Fledged Monster\\" by his peers, which solely improved his cafeteria seating privileges. The monsters, rallying to their new leader, decided it was time to be true to themselves - terrifying, no-good monsters, targeting our gang as their first victims of a new chapter. \\"Ladies and gentlemen,\\" Fred declared as they made their hasty escape, \\"I think it's time we accept that physics, logic, and monster HR policies are beyond our comprehension.\\" As they drove off into the moonlit night, Scooby and Shaggy shared a sandwich they swore was summoned by the medallion, proving that in their world, hunger always trumps logic. \\"Rhere's ralways room rfor rsandwiches, Raggy!\\" Scooby chuckled, crumbs flying.

Mistaken for a noblewoman due to the Traveller's charismatic authority, they are welcomed into the local lord's castle. The Traveller, always curious, quickly learns of tensions boiling beneath the surface, as Lord Harald is plotting to overthrow his rival, Baron Edmund, to gain favor and possibly the crown itself. **Part 2: A Web of Lies** As the Traveller delves deeper into the political intrigue, she discovers that Lord Harald is not only plotting against Baron Edmund but has a far-reaching plan that could plunge the nation into deeper conflict. Using her wit, the Traveller begins to unravel the web of lies, with Arthur's historical knowledge proving invaluable. Meanwhile, Lena finds herself in the castle's forge, crafting a device that could prove pivotal in exposing Harald's treachery. **Part 3: The Masquerade Ball** To expose Harald, the Traveller and her companions must attend a grand masquerade ball hosted by Lady Isabella, a neutral noble with influence over both Stephen and Matilda. The Traveller uses this event to gather allies and information, blending seamlessly into the political gameplay, while Arthur stumbles upon a secret alliance. Lena, in disguise, overhears a plot to assassinate a key figure at the ball, racing against time to prevent a catastrophe. **Part 4: The Siege** With the assassination thwarted, Lord Harald's ambitions are laid bare, leading to a direct confrontation. He lays siege to Baron Edmund's fort, believing he can crush his rival and secure his path to power.

She challenges Lord Harald to a public debate, a battle of wits and evidence, to expose his true intentions and rally support among the undecided nobility. Through a tense, intellectual duel, the Traveller's eloquence and Arthur's historical citations dismantle Harald's claims, swaying public opinion. Lena, meanwhile, orchestrates a sabotage that cripples Harald's siege engines, tipping the balance. **Part 6: Crowns United** In the aftermath, with Harald's plots unravelled and his forces scattered, the Traveller's intervention paves the way for a negotiation between Stephen and Matilda, mediated by Lady Isabella. The Traveller, using her unique perspective, helps draft a provisional agreement to create a united front for England's future. As the Traveller and her companions slip away, their actions have sown the seeds of unity in a divided land. Back in their ship, they reflect on the intricate dance of history and the power of a single, determined individual to change the course of events. In \\"Crowns and Crossroads,\\" the Traveller not only navigates the treacherous waters of medieval politics but also reinforces the idea that understanding, empathy, and intelligence can overcome the most daunting of barriers, setting a tone of hope and empowerment unique to this alternate universe."},{"instruction":"Etwas wurde nach der OP etwas am Bauch und Blase gefunden? Eierstockkrebs","output":"Wenn nach einer Operation etwas Unerwartetes am Bauch und an der Blase gefunden wurde, das auf Eierstockkrebs (Ovarialkarzinom) hindeutet, ist es wichtig, sich sofort mit dem behandelnden Ärzteteam in Verbindung zu setzen. Eierstockkrebs ist eine ernste Erkrankung, bei der Zellen in den Eierstöcken unkontrolliert wachsen und sich ausbreiten können. Es ist wichtig, schnelle und gezielte Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um die bestmöglichen Behandlungsergebnisse zu erzielen. Nach der Diagnose eines Ovarialkarzinoms sollten weitere Untersuchungen durchgeführt werden, um das Stadium der Erkrankung zu bestimmen und die beste Behandlungsstrategie zu erarbeiten. Dies kann Folgendes umfassen: 1. **Weitere Bildgebung**: Zusätzliche bildgebende Verfahren wie Computertomographie (CT), Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT) oder Positronenemissionstomographie (PET) können erforderlich sein, um das Ausmaß der Krankheit besser zu erfassen. 2. **Bluttests**: Ein spezieller Bluttest, der den Tumormarker CA-125 misst, kann helfen, die Behandlung und den Verlauf der Erkrankung zu überwachen. 3. **Chirurgische Bewertung**: In einigen Fällen kann eine erneute Operation erforderlich sein, um das gesamte Ausmaß der Krankheit zu bewerten und so viel Krebsgewebe wie möglich zu entfernen. 4. **Behandlungsplanung**: Die Behandlung kann eine Kombination aus Chirurgie, Chemotherapie und gegebenenfalls Bestrahlung umfassen. 5. **Genetische Beratung und Tests**: Eierstockkrebs kann in einigen Fällen mit genetischen Mutationen, wie z.B. BRCA1- oder BRCA2-Mutationen, verbunden sein. Eine genetische Beratung kann angeboten werden, um das individuelle Risiko und die Optionen für präventive Maßnahmen zu besprechen. Es ist wichtig, dass Sie eng mit Ihrem Ärzteteam zusammenarbeiten und alle empfohlenen Nachsorgeuntersuchungen und Behandlungen befolgen. Eierstockkrebs kann eine herausfordernde Diagnose sein, aber es gibt viele Unterstützungsressourcen und Behandlungsoptionen. Scheuen Sie sich nicht, Fragen zu stellen und um Hilfe zu bitten, wenn Sie sie benötigen."},{"instruction":"Wie sind die Erfolgsaussichten? Wenn nach der Operation wegen Eierstockkrebs noch etwas an der Blase und im Bauch gefunden wurde?","output":"Die Erfolgsaussichten für Patientinnen mit Eierstockkrebs variieren stark und hängen von verschiedenen Faktoren ab, einschließlich des Stadiums der Krankheit zum Zeitpunkt der Diagnose, der Ausbreitung des Krebses (wie etwa zu den Blasenwänden oder anderen Bereichen des Bauchraums), der allgemeinen Gesundheit der Patientin und ihrer Reaktion auf die Behandlung. Eierstockkrebs, der sich auf andere Organe wie die Blase oder weitere Teile des Bauchraums ausgedehnt hat, deutet auf ein fortgeschritteneres Stadium der Erkrankung hin. In solchen Fällen kann die Behandlung herausfordernder sein, und die Prognose kann weniger günstig sein als bei auf die Eierstöcke beschränktem Krebs. Dennoch gibt es effektive Behandlungsoptionen, die das Fortschreiten der Krankheit verlangsamen, Symptome lindern und die Lebensqualität verbessern können. Dazu gehören: 1. **Chirurgie:** Eine umfassende chirurgische Entfernung des sichtbaren Tumorgewebes ist oft ein kritischer Schritt. Die Chancen auf eine erfolgreiche Behandlung erhöhen sich in der Regel, wenn es möglich ist, den gesamten sichtbaren Krebs zu entfernen. 2. **Chemotherapie:** Chemotherapie wird häufig eingesetzt, um etwaige verbleibende Krebszellen zu vernichten oder das Wachstum von Krebszellen zu verlangsamen. Manchmal wird sie vor einer Operation (neoadjuvant) verwendet, um den Tumor zu verkleinern, oder nach einer Operation (adjuvant), um das Risiko eines Rückfalls zu verringern. 3. **Zielgerichtete Therapie und Immuntherapie:** In den letzten Jahren wurden mehrere neue Medikamente entwickelt, die auf spezifische Veränderungen in Krebszellen abzielen oder das Immunsystem aktivieren, um Krebszellen zu bekämpfen. Diese Behandlungen können für bestimmte Patientinnen je nach genetischen Merkmalen des Tumors geeignet sein. 4. **Palliative Versorgung:** Wenn eine Heilung nicht möglich ist, konzentriert sich die Behandlung darauf, die Symptome zu lindern, die Lebensqualität zu verbessern und die Lebensdauer zu verlängern. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass jede Patientin einzigartig ist und die Reaktion auf die Behandlung individuell variieren kann. Ein offener Dialog mit dem behandelnden ärztlichen Team über die Prognose, Behandlungsmöglichkeiten und -ziele ist entscheidend. Außerdem kann eine zweite Meinung einbezogen werden, um alle verfügbaren Optionen gründlich zu verstehen. Forschung und klinische Studien eröffnen kontinuierlich neue Behandlungsmöglichkeiten, die die Prognose für Patientinnen mit Eierstockkrebs verbessern können.

Allgemeine Statistiken können einen Überblick bieten, es ist jedoch wichtig zu betonen, dass jede Frau individuell ist und statistische Durchschnittswerte nicht die Prognose einer einzelnen Patientin vorhersagen können. Laut Daten des American Cancer Society beruhen die Überlebensraten oft auf früheren Ergebnissen von Menschen, die die Krankheit hatten. Für Eierstockkrebs zeigen die Statistiken Folgendes (bezogen auf Daten aus den USA): - Das Gesamtüberleben bei Eierstockkrebs über alle Stadien hinweg beträgt etwa 49%. Das bedeutet, dass 49% der Frauen 5 Jahre nach der Diagnose noch leben. Dies beinhaltet sowohl Frauen, die krebsfrei sind, als auch solche, die noch behandelt werden. - Die Überlebensraten variieren signifikant je nach Stadium bei Diagnosestellung: - Stadium I: Etwa 92% 5-Jahres-Überlebensrate - Stadium II: Etwa 75% 5-Jahres-Überlebensrate - Stadium III: Etwa 41% 5-Jahres-Überlebensrate - Stadium IV: Etwa 30% 5-Jahres-Überlebensrate Diese Zahlen sind Durchschnittswerte und repräsentieren Gruppenergebnisse für Patientinnen, die vor einigen Jahren behandelt wurden. Da die Behandlungen für Eierstockkrebs weiterentwickelt werden und personalisierte Medizin eine größere Rolle spielt, können individuelle Aussichten anders sein. Konkrete Therapiefortschritte, etwa die Einführung zielgerichteter Therapien und Immuntherapien, bieten neue Hoffnung und haben das Potenzial, die Prognose für viele Patientinnen zu verbessern. Es ist wichtig für Patientinnen, den Behandlungsprozess eng mit ihrem medizinischen Team zu besprechen, um die spezifischen Aspekte ihrer Krankheit und die beste verfügbare Behandlungsstrategie zu verstehen. Persönliche Faktoren, einschließlich der Reaktion auf die Behandlung und der Gesundheitszustand insgesamt, spielen eine wesentliche Rolle in der Prognose einer jeden Patientin."},{"instruction":"Gibt es Zahlen für Deutschland?","output":"Ja, es gibt spezifische Statistiken für Deutschland bezüglich Eierstockkrebs (Ovarialkarzinom). Allerdings ist zu beachten, dass solche Statistiken variieren können, je nachdem, welche Quelle man heranzieht und wann die Daten erhoben wurden. Generell bietet das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) als zentrale Einrichtung der Bundesregierung auf dem Gebiet der Krankheitsüberwachung und -prävention in Deutschland regelmäßig aktualisierte Daten und Schätzungen zu Krebserkrankungen, einschließlich Eierstockkrebs. Basierend auf den verfügbaren Daten bis zu meinem letzten Wissensstand (2023) sind hier einige Eckdaten zu Eierstockkrebs in Deutschland: - **Neuerkrankungen:** Jährlich erkranken in Deutschland etwa 7.300 Frauen an Eierstockkrebs, womit diese Krebsart zu den zehn häufigsten Krebserkrankungen bei Frauen in Deutschland zählt. - **Altersstandardisierte Erkrankungsrate:** Die Erkrankungsrate variiert je nach Altersgruppe, wobei das mittlere Erkrankungsalter bei circa 69 Jahren liegt. - **Überlebensraten:** Die relative 5-Jahres-Überlebensrate für Frauen mit Eierstockkrebs in Deutschland liegt bei etwa 41%. Es ist wichtig anzumerken, dass diese Überlebensrate ein Durchschnittswert ist, der alle Stadien der Erkrankung einschließt. Frauen, bei denen die Krankheit früh erkannt wird, haben in der Regel eine bessere Prognose. Diese Zahlen illustrieren die epidemiologische Situation von Eierstockkrebs in Deutschland. Sie zeigen auch die Wichtigkeit einer frühzeitigen Diagnose und der Entwicklung effektiver Behandlungsstrategien. Es ist zu betonen, dass die Prognose stark vom Stadium der Erkrankung zum Zeitpunkt der Diagnose abhängt, sowie von Faktoren wie dem allgemeinen Gesundheitszustand der Patientin und der spezifischen Art des Eierstockkrebses. Für aktuellere oder detailliertere Informationen ist es ratsam, die Webseite des Robert Koch-Instituts (RKI) oder die der Deutschen Krebsgesellschaft zu konsultieren, da diese Organisationen regelmäßig Forschungsergebnisse und statistische Daten zum Thema Krebs in Deutschland veröffentlichen."},{"instruction":"Wie unterscheiden sich die Stadien?","output":"Die Einteilung des Eierstockkrebses in verschiedene Stadien basiert auf dem System der International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) und dem TNM-Klassifikationssystem. Diese Stadieneinteilung ist entscheidend, um das Ausmaß der Krankheit zu bestimmen und eine geeignete Behandlung festzulegen. Im Folgenden sind die Stadien des Eierstockkrebses beschrieben: # Stadium I (FIGO I) - **Stadium IA (FIGO IA)**: Der Krebs ist auf einen Eierstock begrenzt und die Kapsel ist intakt. Es gibt keine Tumoren auf der Eierstockoberfläche und keine malignen Zellen im Aszites oder in der Peritonealspülung. - **Stadium IB (FIGO IB)**: Der Krebs betrifft beide Eierstöcke, aber die Kapseln sind intakt. Wie im Stadium IA gibt es keine Tumoren auf den Eierstockoberflächen und keine malignen Zellen im Aszites oder in der Peritonealspülung. - **Stadium IC (FIGO IC)**: Der Krebs ist auf einen oder beide Eierstöcke begrenzt mit zusätzlichen Faktoren wie Kapselruptur, Tumornachweis auf der Eierstockoberfläche, malignen Zellen im Aszites oder in der Peritonealspülung. # Stadium II (FIGO II) - **Stadium IIA (FIGO IIA)**: Der Krebs hat sich auf den Uterus und/oder die Eileiter, aber nicht weiter in das Becken ausgebreitet. - **Stadium IIB (FIGO IIB)**: Ausbreitung zum Beckengewebe. - **Stadium IIC (FIGO IIC)**: Gleiche Bedingungen wie IIA oder IIB mit zusätzlichen Faktoren wie Kapselruptur, Tumornachweis auf der Oberfläche eines der Eierstöcke oder malignen Zellen im Aszites oder in der Peritonealspülung. # Stadium III (FIGO III) - **Stadium IIIA1 (FIGO IIIA1)**: Mikroskopische Ausbreitung jenseits des Beckens zu den retroperitonealen Lymphknoten. - **Stadium IIIA2 (FIGO IIIA2)**: Makroskopischer Befall der retroperitonealen Lymphknoten, aber keine peritoneale Aussaat außerhalb des Beckens größer als 2 cm. - **Stadium IIIB (FIGO IIIB)**: Makroskopische peritoneale Metastasen außerhalb des Beckens, jedoch ≤2 cm in der Größe. - **Stadium IIIC (FIGO IIIC)**: Peritoneale Metastasen außerhalb des Beckens >2 cm in der Größe und/oder regionale Lymphknotenmetastasen. # Stadium IV (FIGO IV) - **Stadium IVA (FIGO IVA)**: Pleuraerguss mit positiven Zytologiebefunden. Krebszellen im Flüssigkeitsraum um die Lungen. - **Stadium IVB (FIGO IVB)**: Metastasierung in entfernte Organe (z.B. Leber- oder Lungenparenchym) oder Metastasen außerhalb der Bauch- und Beckenregion. Die frühzeitige Diagnose und Behandlung des Eierstockkrebses in den Anfangsstadien verbessern die Prognose erheblich. In fortgeschritteneren Stadien, in denen der Krebs sich über das Becken hinaus ausgebreitet hat, sind die Behandlungsoptionen und die Prognose komplexer. Wichtig ist daher eine individuelle Behandlungsplanung unter Berücksichtigung aller relevanten Faktoren, einschließlich des Allgemeinzustands der Patientin und spezifischer Merkmale des Krebses."},{"instruction":"Was trifft bei Befall von Blase und Bauch zu?","output":"Wenn Eierstockkrebs sich auf die Blase und andere Bereiche des Bauches (Abdomen) ausgedehnt hat, wird dieser meist als fortgeschrittenes Stadium der Erkrankung klassifiziert. Dies würde in der Regel den Stadien FIGO III oder IV entsprechen, abhängig von der genauen Ausdehnung und den betroffenen Stellen. # Stadium III Im **Stadium III** hat sich der Krebs innerhalb des Bauchraums (Peritoneum) über das kleine Becken hinaus ausgebreitet. Das umfasst: - Metastasen in den Bauchorganen, die 2 cm oder größer sind. - Befall von Oberflächen innerhalb des Bauchraums, einschließlich des Diaphragmas. - Im speziellen Fall des Stadiums IIIC kann der Krebs retroperitoneale Lymphknoten hinter dem Bauchraum oder Lymphknoten entlang der großen Blutgefäße des Bauches (Aorta) befallen haben. # Stadium IV Im **Stadium IV** handelt es sich um eine noch weiter fortgeschrittene Ausbreitung. Dieses Stadium wird in zwei Unterkategorien unterteilt: - **Stadium IVA (FIGO IVA)** bezeichnet Fälle mit Pleuraerguss mit positiven zytologischen Befunden, was bedeutet, dass Krebszellen im Flüssigkeitsraum um die Lungen (Pleura) gefunden wurden. - **Stadium IVB (FIGO IVB)** umfasst Krebsausbreitungen zu entfernten Organen außerhalb des Bauchraums, wie Leber, Lungen oder auch, falls der Krebs direkt in die Wand der Blase oder des Darms eingewachsen ist. Wenn der Eierstockkrebs in die Blase eingedrungen ist, spricht dies für eine sehr fortgeschrittene Krankheit. Dies könnte als lokales Wachstum betrachtet werden, bei dem der Tumor in nahegelegene Organe wie die Blase infiltriert (direkte Ausbreitung), oder als Teil von Stadium IV, abhängig von anderen Faktoren wie dem Vorhandensein von Tumorzellen in entfernten Körperregionen. Die Behandlung in solchen fortgeschrittenen Stadien erfordert eine maßgeschneiderte Herangehensweise, die oft eine Kombination aus chirurgischem Eingriff, um so viel Tumor wie möglich zu entfernen (sog. Debulking-Chirurgie), und systemischen Therapien wie Chemotherapie, zielgerichteten Therapien oder Immuntherapie umfasst. Die spezifischen Behandlungsoptionen hängen von vielen Faktoren ab, einschließlich der allgemeinen Gesundheit der Patientin, dem genauen Typ des Eierstockkrebses und der Reaktion des Krebses auf frühere Behandlungen."},{"instruction":"اصنع تطبيق حساب العمر بى استخدام سكربت javascripet و cess و html","output":"لإنشاء تطبيق بسيط لحساب العمر باستخدام HTML, CSS, و JavaScript, يمكننا اتباع الخطوات التالية: # 1.

Yes, the ghost of George Washington, not content with crossing the Delaware, now haunts the buffet tables of the nation's most prestigious address, causing a ruckus during what was supposed to be a peaceful dinner discussing space and scones. As Velma delves deep into the mysteries of NASA with news reporter Jessica Byline, Shaggy and Scooby turn the live broadcast into their personal comedy show, pulling faces and generally turning journalism into a circus act. Daphne, forever the voice of sarcasm, drags them back with a comment sharper than Velma's intellect, \\"Could you two be any more childish? We're on national TV, not making a home movie!\\" Cut to the Ambassador of Klopstokia and his tea-obsessed wife, both utterly confused by the sudden introduction of intergalactic discourse. Meanwhile, Senator Bullhorn and his equally unimpressed spouse voice their skepticism about the space program with a disdain that could ground any rocket. Then, amid promises of new horizons, George Washington decides to crash the party. Shaggy and Scooby, ever the survivalists, blend in with a room full of statues — a tactic that Scooby claims he learned from a marathon of \\"Mannequin Challenge\\" videos. \\"Like, if we don't move, maybe he'll think we're part of the decor!\\" Shaggy whispers, a plan so absurd it might just work. **Act Two: A Clue, A Clue!** While our dynamic duo dodges history, the rest of the gang stumbles upon a curious object — a brass eagle that screams \\"plot device.\\" Yet, as they ponder its significance, the panicked masses mistake Scooby for the ghostly founding father, leading to a comedic mix-up that not even daytime TV could script. As news of Scooby's mistaken identity reaches his parents, they prepare for a patriotic rescue mission, armed with galoshes and, presumably, a healthy supply of Scooby Snacks. Back in the realm of reason, the President absolves our heroes of any spectral suspicions and enlists their help. Cue Marilyn Maxie, historian extraordinaire, who casually mentions the brass eagle is actually a bed knob. And so, dressed as the least convincing room maids and pest control agents in history, the gang splits up to infiltrate the beds of diplomats and senators. **Act Three: Presidential Phantoms** In a twist that shakes the very fabric of reality, Shaggy and Scooby bump into an arm emerging from a painting. \\"Like, since when do paintings need a handout, Scoob?\\" Shaggy quips, before bumping into the double-act of Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt's ghosts. Escaping into a room, the gang finds themselves face-to-face with history and a fitting bedknob. As they bravely insert the knob, a trapdoor swings open, revealing a secret passage lined with the laughter of centuries. \\"This makes less sense than Scrappy thinking he's a superhero,\\" Daphne notes, her sarcasm echoing off the walls. Descending into the bowels of the White House, they confront the \\"ghosts,\\" unmasking them as the Senator and the Ambassador, whose motives were as convoluted as the plot of a daytime soap opera. \\"We just wanted to scare people away from the space program... because... um, aliens?\\" the Senator stammers, his plan unraveling faster than Scooby at an all-you-can-eat buffet. As the real George Washington ghost appears to thank them (because, why not?), Scooby and Shaggy share a look of bewilderment. \\"Rho knew?\\" Scooby laughs, his amusement a gentle reminder of the absurdity they've just endured. **Epilogue: A Feast of Freedom** With the mystery solved and the day saved, the gang sits down to a feast, courtesy of the President. As they toast to liberty and snacks, Scrappy leaps onto the table, declaring, \\"I did it! I saved the White House!\\" Velma, midway through explaining the science of ghost projections, is cut off by a collective groan from the gang, \\"Velma, please, no more science... it's dinner time.\\" The camera pulls away from the comedic chaos, leaving our heroes to bask in the glory of another mystery solved, another meal earned, and the knowledge that no matter how strange the case, they'll always question the physics, the motives, and the historical accuracy of every spooky encounter.

Emotional intelligence involves the ability to identify, understand, and manage one's own emotions, as well as the ability to recognize and influence the emotions of others. Here's why feeling empathy towards video game characters could be related to EI: 1. **Empathy**: One of the core components of emotional intelligence is empathy, which is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. When players feel empathy for virtual characters, it reflects their ability to connect emotionally with others, even if those \\"others\\" are not real people. This could extend beyond games to showing empathy in real-life situations. 2. **Understanding Complex Emotions**: Complex video games often involve intricate storylines and character development. Being emotionally moved by these narratives shows an ability to comprehend and resonate with complex emotional experiences, another aspect of emotional intelligence. 3. **Emotional Regulation**: Emotional intelligence also encompasses managing one's emotions. Recognizing and regulating feelings of sadness, grief, or moral conflict in response to events in a game indicates the ability to navigate emotional responses. This can be a beneficial skill in both personal and professional spheres. 4. **Social Skills**: Video games often require interacting with other characters (whether AI-driven or controlled by other humans). Responding with understanding and empathy to virtual characters can reflect an individual's ability to navigate social situations and understand social cues, albeit in a more controlled environment. This aspect of EI can be crucial for teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal relations. 5. **Moral Reasoning and Reflection**: Some games challenge players with moral dilemmas, where decisions can lead to suffering or the death of characters. Reflecting on these decisions and feeling remorse or considering the ethical implications can indicate a level of emotional intelligence related to self-awareness and moral reasoning. However, it's important to balance empathy for virtual characters with an understanding that they are not real. Investing too much emotional energy in virtual worlds at the expense of real-life relationships and responsibilities could be problematic. Emotional intelligence involves recognizing this balance and managing one's emotions appropriately. In summary, feeling bad for virtual characters can reflect aspects of emotional intelligence, particularly empathy, understanding complex emotions, emotional regulation, social skills, and moral reasoning. These skills are valuable in real-world interactions and can enhance personal and professional relationships."},{"instruction":"could it be because the brain recognizes they are meant to be people?","output":"Yes, the brain's response to virtual characters in video games and other media can indeed be influenced by its recognition that these characters are meant to represent people. This perception is supported by several psychological and neurological mechanisms: 1. **Theory of Mind**: Humans possess what is called a \\"theory of mind,\\" the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions—to oneself and others. This ability helps us understand that others have thoughts and feelings different from our own. When we engage with characters, whether in video games, movies, or literature, we often automatically apply our theory of mind to these characters, interpreting their actions, emotions, and motivations as if they were real people. 2. **Mirror Neurons**: A part of the brain's response to observing actions and emotions in others involves mirror neurons. These neurons activate both when an individual performs an action and when they observe another individual (or, in this case, a character that is meant to represent a human) performing the same action. Mirror neurons are thought to be crucial for empathy and understanding others' emotions. When players see virtual characters expressing emotions, their mirror neurons may activate, eliciting empathy and emotional responses as if those characters were real. 3. **Suspension of Disbelief**: When engaging with fiction of any kind, people are willing to suspend their disbelief—that is, they allow themselves to temporarily accept the fictional premise as real for the sake of enjoyment. This psychological mechanism enables us to become emotionally invested in characters and narratives that we consciously know are not real. Our emotional and cognitive systems respond to the experiences of these characters in much the same way they would respond to real people, particularly when the narrative encourages identification with the characters. 4. **Empathy and Identification**: Humans tend to empathize with and even identify with fictional characters. This process involves projecting oneself into the situation of another, leading to emotional responses like happiness, sadness, or distress based on the character's experiences. When a game's narrative and mechanics are designed to encourage identification with its characters, players may find themselves emotionally invested in these characters' well-being and experiences as if they were real. In sum, the brain's treatment of virtual characters as \\"real\\" in some emotional and cognitive aspects is a complex process, involving theory of mind, mirror neurons, suspension of disbelief, and mechanisms of empathy and identification. This process supports the emotional responses and connections people often form with virtual characters in video games, allowing them to care about these characters' fates in similar ways they would care about real people."},{"instruction":"mim fale a historia do futebol americano resumidamente","output":"O Futebol Americano tem suas raízes no início do século XIX na Inglaterra, mas foi nos Estados Unidos que o esporte realmente se desenvolveu e tomou a forma que conhecemos hoje. Aqui está um resumo da história do futebol americano: 1. **Início (Final do século XIX)**: As origens do futebol americano remontam ao rugby e ao futebol (conhecido nos EUA como soccer). Estudantes da Universidade de Harvard começaram a jogar uma versão primitiva do futebol em 1874 durante um jogo contra a McGill University do Canadá, que trouxe regras do rugby. A partir disso, diferentes universidades começaram a adotar suas próprias regras. 2. **Formalização do Jogo (1880 - 1890)**: Walter Camp, conhecido como o \\"Pai do Futebol Americano\\", foi fundamental na transição de um jogo que se assemelhava mais ao rugby para um esporte com um conjunto distinto de regras. Camp introduziu conceitos cruciais, como a linha de scrimmage, o sistema de downs, e o valor de pontos para touchdowns e field goals. 3. **Crescimento e Popularização (Início do século XX)**: As universidades começaram a adotar o futebol americano como uma parte importante de seu programa atlético, o que levou ao crescimento da popularidade do esporte. A primeira partida de futebol americano profissional registrada foi disputada em 1892. Em 1920, a American Professional Football Association foi criada, que mais tarde se tornou a National Football League (NFL) em 1922. 4. **Evolução do Jogo (Século XX)**: Ao longo do século XX, o futebol americano continuou a evoluir, tanto nas regras como na forma como o jogo era jogado. Isso inclui melhorias na segurança dos jogadores, avanços tecnológicos como replays de vídeo para ajudar na arbitragem e mudanças nas estratégias de jogo. 5. **Era Moderna e Globalização (Final do século XX - Século XXI)**: A NFL se consolidou como a principal liga de futebol americano, com o Super Bowl se tornando um dos maiores eventos esportivos do mundo. O esporte também começou a expandir sua influência global, com jogos sendo disputados em outros países e o crescimento de ligas internacionais e torneios. Com o passar dos anos, o futebol americano se tornou parte integrante da cultura dos Estados Unidos, com milhões de fãs ao redor do mundo. A paixão pelo esporte continua a crescer, com desenvolvimentos nas ligas femininas e o aumento do interesse internacional demonstrando o alcance global e a adaptabilidade do futebol americano."},{"instruction":"principais regras do futebol americano resumidamente","output":"O futebol americano é um esporte complexo com muitas regras, mas aqui estão algumas das principais regras resumidamente para ajudar a entender o jogo: # Objetivo do Jogo O principal objetivo é marcar pontos avançando com a bola até a zona final do adversário (touchdown) ou chutando a bola entre as traves do gol adversário (field goal). # Formato do Jogo - **Duração**: Uma partida de futebol americano é dividida em quatro quartos de 15 minutos cada, com intervalos de descanso entre eles. - **Campo**: Mede 120 jardas (109,7 metros) de comprimento, incluindo duas zonas finais de 10 jardas (9,1 metros) cada, e 53 1/3 jardas (48,8 metros) de largura. # Avanço da Bola - **Downs**: A equipe ofensiva tem quatro tentativas (downs) para avançar 10 jardas. Se conseguir, ganha um novo conjunto de quatro downs para continuar avançando. Se não avançar 10 jardas após 4 downs, a bola passa para o adversário. # Pontuação - **Touchdown (TD)**: Vale 6 pontos e é marcado quando um jogador atravessa a linha da zona final do adversário com a bola ou a recebe dentro da zona final. - **Conversão Após Touchdown**: Após um TD, a equipe tem a chance de chutar a bola entre as traves para ganhar 1 ponto extra ou tentar levar a bola para a zona final novamente de uma distância curta para ganhar 2 pontos. - **Field Goal**: Vale 3 pontos e é marcado quando a bola é chutada entre as traves do gol adversário durante o jogo. - **Safety**: Vale 2 pontos e é concedido à equipe defensiva quando o jogador ofensivo é derrubado com a bola ou comete uma falta na sua própria zona final. # Posse de Bola - A partida começa com um kickoff. A equipe que chuta se chama \\"equipe de kickoff\\" e a equipe que recebe, \\"equipe receptora\\". Após um touchdown, field goal ou no começo de cada metade da partida, a bola é colocada em jogo novamente através de um kickoff. # Faltas e Penalidades Há várias faltas possíveis, como segurar o adversário, sair dos limites do campo, interferência de passe, entre outras.

One of the ways I have done this is through my involvement in the school's Diversity Club, where I have worked to raise awareness about issues of discrimination and inequality. I have organized events and discussions that promote understanding and foster a more inclusive community. Additionally, I have volunteered at a local community center, tutoring students from diverse backgrounds and providing academic support to those who may face challenges due to systemic inequalities. This experience has allowed me to witness firsthand the impact of social injustices on individuals and communities and has fueled my passion for advocating for change. In college, I plan to continue my commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice by majoring in sociology and minoring in social work. I believe that by gaining a deeper understanding of the structural and systemic issues that perpetuate inequality, I will be better equipped to develop and implement effective strategies for social change. Furthermore, I intend to engage in extracurricular activities and organizations that focus on promoting diversity and social justice within the college community. Whether through volunteering, organizing events, or participating in advocacy initiatives, I am committed to using my education as a platform to amplify underrepresented voices, challenge existing power structures, and create a more equitable and inclusive society. Beyond college, I aspire to pursue a career in social work, where I can continue to advocate for marginalized populations and work towards creating a more just and equitable society.

After the gang gets back up to the White House ground floor, they decide it's time to wrap up the mystery. After getting the President, his wife, the Ambassador and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Bullhorn, the gang concluded that whoever was dressing up as the ghosts was trying to steal the real Presidents' portraits and make off with them.

With no time to lose, he quickly picks it back up and boards a helicopter where Lincoln's ghost is waiting for him. The two ghosts take off, but leave some of the computer tape caught dangling out the door. Shaggy and Scooby get caught on the helicopter, so Scrappy, the President, Daphne and Velma all take another chopper to chase the ghosts. Scooby starts to slip off, so he grabs onto the dangling computer tape, causing it to wrap around the Washington Monument and crash the helicopter. The ghosts retrieve the tape and continue to run off with it. Scrappy, the President, Daphne, and Velma land their helicopter and pursue them on foot. Jessica and her cameraman follow the action as the gang chases after the ghosts. Suddenly, Mumsy-Doo and Dada-Doo fly over them in another helicopter. Mumsy-Doo tries to drop Scooby's galoshes to him, but they land on Lincoln and Washington's heads, making them fall into the water.

They had been removed from their frames and replaced with the ones with the eye-holes upstairs. When Shaggy finds the portrait of Abraham Lincoln, Scooby briefly imitates him, but Lincoln's ghost appears and chases the gang away. After the gang gets back up to the White House ground floor, they decide it's time to wrap up the mystery. After getting the President, his wife, the Ambassador and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Bullhorn, the gang concluded that whoever was dressing up as the ghosts was trying to steal the real Presidents' portraits and make off with them. They knew it had to be someone who had access to all of the rooms in the White House, Marilyn Maxie. But the mystery wasn't over yet. Suddenly, Washington's ghost reappears and steals a brass eagle from the President's room. The eagle fits on a flag pole, which opens the secret hiding place of the NASA computers. Washington goes through the passage and comes out stealing a computer tape. The gang chases him up to the roof. The ghost trips and drops the tape, causing it to unravel. With no time to lose, he quickly picks it back up and boards a helicopter where Lincoln's ghost is waiting for him. The two ghosts take off, but leave some of the computer tape caught dangling out the door. Shaggy and Scooby get caught on the helicopter, so Scrappy, the President, Daphne and Velma all take another chopper to chase the ghosts. Scooby starts to slip off, so he grabs onto the dangling computer tape, causing it to wrap around the Washington Monument and crash the helicopter. The ghosts retrieve the tape and continue to run off with it. Scrappy, the President, Daphne, and Velma land their helicopter and pursue them on foot. Jessica and her cameraman follow the action as the gang chases after the ghosts. Suddenly, Mumsy-Doo and Dada-Doo fly over them in another helicopter. Mumsy-Doo tries to drop Scooby's galoshes to him, but they land on Lincoln and Washington's heads, making them fall into the water. The ghosts were unmasked as the ambassador and his wife, who were spies trying to steal secrets about the American space program.

Here’s why: 1. **Consistency and Control**: A color checker provides a standard reference for colors. In analog photography, different films have different color profiles—some might be warmer, cooler, more saturated, etc. By photographing a color checker under the lighting conditions you're using, you can gain a better understanding of how your film is responding to those conditions and the colors within the scene. This is especially useful if you're looking to maintain consistency across multiple shoots or different types of film. 2. **Scanning and Post-Processing**: A significant part of analog photography’s workflow today involves scanning negatives or prints to digital format for storage, printing, or further digital processing. Having a color checker included in one of the frames can help immensely during the scanning process. It allows you to balance the colors more accurately based on known reference points, compensating for any color shifts introduced by the scanner or the film itself. 3. **Color Correction**: While it’s true that no film reproduces colors perfectly and each type has its own color rendition, photographers often aim to achieve a certain look or correct specific color casts. A color checker can be a useful tool in identifying and correcting these casts, particularly when working on prints in the darkroom or adjusting scanned images digitally. 4. **Learning and Experimentation**: For those who are experimenting with different films, developers, or even home processing techniques, a color checker can serve as a learning tool to better understand how each variable affects the final image. It can demystify some of the unpredictability associated with analog processes. 5. **Historical Documentation and Art Reproduction**: In situations where accurate color reproduction is paramount, such as in the documentation of artworks or historical artifacts on film, a color checker is crucial. It provides a reference that can help ensure the colors are as true to the original as possible, given the inherent color biases of film. In essence, while it’s integral to embrace the unique color profiles and \\"imperfections\\" that come with different film stocks (which is often why photographers choose film in the first place), a color checker still holds value in many aspects of the workflow, especially those bridging analog capture and digital output. It's about using it in a way that complements your workflow and artistic goals rather than seeing it as a strict tool for accuracy."},{"instruction":"but wouldn’t i erase the films color character by using a color checker?","output":"Using a color checker in the process of analog film photography does not necessarily mean you will erase the film's unique color character. The purpose of a color checker is to provide a frame of reference; how you use that reference in your workflow is up to you. Let's explore this further: 1. **Understanding Film Characteristics**: Shooting a color checker can help you understand how your specific film stock responds to different colors under various lighting conditions. This information is invaluable and can inform you about the intrinsic color biases and characteristics of the film. You can then make more informed decisions about which film to use for a particular effect or how to adjust lighting to achieve your desired outcome. 2. **Post-Processing Flexibility**: If your workflow involves scanning negatives to digital files for printing or online display, having a shot with a color checker allows you flexibility in post-processing. You can decide how much of the film’s color character you want to preserve or adjust. For example, you might use the color checker to neutralize a color cast in the shadows but choose to leave the midtones and highlights as the film rendered them to maintain some of the film’s unique look. 3. **Selective Correction**: The information you gain from including a color checker doesn't obligate you to correct all aspects of your image to achieve perfect color fidelity. You can use it selectively—perhaps just to correct skin tones while leaving the rest of the image untouched, thus preserving the film's character in areas where exact color reproduction is less critical. 4. **Comparative Analysis**: Sometimes, the goal isn't to correct colors at all but rather to use the color checker as a tool for comparative analysis. For instance, you may be testing how various film stocks render the same scene under identical conditions. Here, the color checker helps quantify the differences between films rather than eliminate them. 5. **Creative Intent vs. Technical Accuracy**: Photography, especially analog film photography, is as much about creative expression as it is about technical accuracy. A color checker can help ensure that any deviations from true-to-life colors are intentional and controlled rather than accidental. It allows you to start from a baseline of understanding and then artistically decide which aspects of the film’s character to embrace or modify. Ultimately, using a color checker doesn't mean you have to sacrifice the unique qualities of film photography. Instead, it offers a level of control and understanding that can enhance your ability to make intentional, informed creative choices. Whether or not to use a color checker—and how to use the information it provides—depends on your goals for each project, and there's plenty of room for personal preference and artistic discretion in that decision-making process."},{"instruction":"If I wanted to maintain the films character, using a grey card and white card is sufficient right?","output":"Yes, if your primary goal is to maintain the film's character while achieving good exposure and color balance, using a gray card and a white card can be sufficient and very beneficial in your analog film photography process. Let's discuss how each can be used effectively: # Gray Card A gray card is designed to reflect 18% of the incoming light, which is considered to be a middle gray or neutral tone. This characteristic makes it a valuable tool for exposure measurement and white balance. - **For Exposure**: You can use a gray card to help set the correct exposure for your shot. By metering off the gray card placed in the same lighting as your subject, you adjust your camera settings to correctly expose for this middle gray. This approach can help ensure that your exposure is accurate across the frame under that particular lighting condition, taking into account the dynamic range of the film you are using. - **For Color Balance**: Though traditionally used more for exposure, a gray card can also aid in achieving a neutral starting point for your colors when scanning your negatives into digital format. By including a shot of a gray card in the same lighting conditions as your photographs, you give yourself a reference point to adjust color balance during the scanning or post-processing phase, minimizing color casts while still preserving the characteristic color profile of the film. # White Card A white card, while less commonly used for exposure settings due to its potential to lead to overexposure if metered directly, can be instrumental in ensuring correct white balance during post-processing. - **For White Balance**: Including a photograph of a white card taken under the same lighting conditions as your main shots provides a benchmark for true white in that specific lighting scenario. When scanning and adjusting your images, you can use this white benchmark to adjust the white balance, ensuring that whites are represented accurately. Like with the gray card, this adjustment can be done in a way that respects the film's natural color rendering, avoiding overcorrection that might strip away its unique character. # Combined Use Both gray and white cards serve to provide points of reference that are known quantities in terms of light reflection (neutral gray for middle exposure and white for white balance). However, it's important to remember: - The goal is to use these reference points to ensure that any adjustments made during scanning or post-processing are informed and intentional, rather than to completely neutralize the distinct color properties of the film. - These tools can help ensure that the characteristics of the film are being represented as accurately as possible in the final image, which is particularly important when consistency across different lighting conditions or film batches is desired. - The use of these cards allows for adjustments to be made with precision, ensuring that any deviation from true neutral tones is a creative choice rather than an unintended consequence of the film's properties or the shooting environment. In summary, employing a gray card and a white card in your analog film photography process can help in achieving accurate exposure and color balance, contributing to the consistency and quality of your images while allowing you to preserve and celebrate the film's inherent character."},{"instruction":"Describe a workflow in which I can create presets to always perfectly erase the film base color of a color negative when scanning the same film.","output":"Creating a workflow to perfectly neutralize the film base color of a color negative during scanning, and thus standardize the color response for a consistent setup, involves a few key steps. These steps revolve around scanning a test strip with known colors (including the unexposed film base), creating a color correction profile, and applying this profile to future scans of the same film type. Here's how you can set up such a workflow: # 1. Preparation - **Materials Needed**: Obtain a color checker or use a standard set of colored objects along with a blank (unexposed) section of the same film stock you plan to scan regularly. These will serve as your color reference and film base reference, respectively. - **Capture a Test Image**: With your film camera, photograph the color checker or your chosen colored objects under a controlled lighting condition. Ensure part of the film roll captures just the unexposed film base (either the leader of the film or intentionally unexposed frames). # 2. Initial Scan - **Scan the Test Film**: Using your scanner, scan the test strip including the color reference and the blank film base at the highest quality, making sure no automatic color correction is applied by the scanner software. - **Document Settings**: Note down all the scan settings you've used (resolution, bit depth, etc.), as maintaining these settings will be crucial for consistent results in the future. # 3. Create a Color Profile - **Software for Color Correction**: Import the scanned image into image editing software that supports color correction and profile creation (Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom can be suitable for this purpose). - **Neutralize the Film Base Color**: Adjust the color balance using the blank film base section of your image as a reference. The goal here is to adjust the RGB levels so this section becomes a neutral gray, effectively neutralizing the orange mask or any color cast present in the film base. - **Create a Preset**: Once you've neutralized the film base successfully and corrected the colors so your color reference matches expected values, save these adjustments as a preset or profile within your editing software. # 4. Apply and Fine-Tune - **Apply Your Preset**: For future scans of the same film type, start by applying the preset you've created. This should automatically adjust the colors to neutralize the film base and provide a consistent starting point for your scans. - **Fine-Tuning**: Depending on variations in exposure, lighting conditions, or even development inconsistencies, some images may require further minor adjustments. However, these adjustments should be less extensive, thanks to your preset. # 5. Continuous Improvement - **Review and Adjust Presets**: Over time, as you scan more films and maybe even experiment with different scanners or software, revisit and adjust your presets if necessary to ensure they continue to provide the best results for neutralizing the film base color. # 6. Consistency - **Maintain Consistent Conditions**: Strive to keep your scanning conditions, including hardware settings and environment, as consistent as possible. Variations in these conditions can affect the color and exposure of your scans, potentially reducing the effectiveness of your presets. # 7. Documentation - **Keep Good Records**: Document your workflow, settings, and any adjustments you make over time. This can be invaluable for troubleshooting, repeating successful outcomes, and further refining your process. By following these steps, you can create a personalized workflow that allows for the consistent neutralization of the film base color, making your scans cleaner and more predictable. Remember, the peculiarities of analog media mean some flexibility and manual adjustment will always be part of the process, but this workflow should minimize the need for extensive post-scan corrections."},{"instruction":"but how do I do that maintaining the subjective color reproduction character of the film?","output":"To maintain the subjective color reproduction character of the film while neutralizing the film base color, it's important to create a workflow that balances the removal of the color cast (caused by the film base) without homogenizing the unique color qualities each film stock offers. Here's a refined approach to achieve that: # 1. Understanding Film Character First, it's essential to understand and appreciate the unique color characteristics of the film stock you're working with. Different films have distinct color responses—some may lean towards warmer tones, others might accentuate greens and blues, for example. Part of maintaining the character of the film lies in recognizing these qualities and deciding what aspects you aim to preserve in your scans. # 2. Custom Profile Creation for Each Film Stock Because each film stock has a unique color profile and film base coloration, you should create a custom correction profile for each type of film you regularly use. - **Test Each Film Type Individually**: Shoot a test roll for each film stock, including shots of a color checker in varying lighting conditions alongside blank (unexposed) areas of the film. - **Scan and Neutralize the Film Base**: Scan the test images making sure to include the unexposed film base. In your editing software, adjust the color balance to neutralize the orange mask (for color negatives) by targeting the blank areas. - **Preserve Film Character**: When adjusting colors based on the color checker or reference shots, be careful not to overcorrect. Aim to bring colors to where they are 'believable' and not necessarily perfectly accurate to real life, thereby preserving the film's inherent color biases. - **Save These Adjustments as Unique Presets**: Name and save the adjustments specific to each film stock. This precision ensures that you maintain consistency not only in removing the film base color but also in respecting and preserving the film's distinct color character. # 3. Applying Adjustments with a Mind Towards Preservation When scanning and processing new rolls: - **Use the Correct Film-Specific Preset**: Apply the preset created for that particular film stock. This should neutralize the film base effectively while keeping the color adjustments film-character specific. - **Manual Tweaking When Necessary**: Even with presets, some images may require manual adjustments. Always adjust with a light hand, aiming to maintain the essence of the film's color characteristics. For example, if the film tends to render shadows with a cooler tone, ensure that any adjustments do not entirely eliminate this quality. # 4. Consistency and Review Maintain consistency in how you shoot, develop, and scan your films. Regularly review your scanned images and presets to see if the desired balance between neutralizing the film base and preserving film character is achieved. Adjust presets as needed based on these reviews. # 5. Education and Adjustment Educate yourself continuously on the characteristics of different film stocks by viewing other photographers' work, reading manufacturer notes, and through personal experimentation. The better you understand what defines the 'character' of your chosen films, the more effectively you can make nuanced adjustments that preserve these qualities in your scans. # Conclusion The key to preserving the subjective color reproduction character of the film lies in understanding each film stock's unique tendencies and creating tailored presets that neutralize the film base color without flattening these distinct color signatures. By carefully balancing these elements, you can achieve scans that are both true to the original film's character and free from unwanted color casts."},{"instruction":"wait, aren’t these subjective color representation information available online?

The orange mask that is inherent in color negatives is designed to help with color balance and dynamic range in the printing process but can pose a challenge in scanning and digital conversion processes. Let's delve into how to manage this aspect effectively: # Understanding the Orange Mask The orange mask in color negatives serves specific purposes, such as ensuring better color rendition and contrast when printing onto photographic paper. However, during scanning, this mask can affect the color balance, making it difficult to achieve accurate colors without correction. # Steps to Address the Film Base Color Challenge 1. **Correct Scanning Software Settings**: Many modern scanners and scanning software come with options specifically designed for color negative film that automatically adjust for the orange mask. Ensuring these are correctly set according to your film type is vital. 2. **Manual Correction in Post-Processing**: If automatic settings don't yield satisfactory results, manual correction in a photo editing software becomes necessary. This involves: - **Initial Scanning Adjustment**: Neutralize the base color as much as possible during the scanning process by manually adjusting RGB levels to remove the orange cast. This setting might not be perfect for all images, but it provides a better starting point. - **Create a Custom Profile**: Use editing software to create a custom color correction profile for your film stock, as previously discussed. This involves adjusting the color balance in a test image that includes both the color checker and unexposed film base, then saving these adjustments as a preset for future scans. - **Use Reference Shots**: Having a known reference in your scanned images, such as a color checker photographed under the same conditions as your other images, can significantly aid in manual color correction. By adjusting the scanned image colors to match the reference colors, you achieve more accurate color reproduction. 3. **Digital ICE and Other Technologies**: Some scanning technologies, like Digital ICE, use infrared scanning to detect and subtract the base layer of the film and other imperfections. While this doesn’t directly correct color, by accurately detecting the base, it can assist some software in better color correction. 4. **Consistent Workflow**: Maintain consistency in how you photograph the color checker and your general exposure settings. This consistency helps in creating a predictable baseline for color correction that can be applied more uniformly across different scans. 5. **Continuous Learning and Adjustment**: Film characteristics and scanning technology continue to evolve, and so will your understanding and techniques for dealing with the orange mask. Regularly revisiting and refining your approach is key to improving color accuracy in your scans. # Final Note While the orange mask presents an initial hurdle in achieving accurate color reproduction, with the right techniques and a bit of patience, it is possible to neutralize this challenge effectively. The goal is to find a balance between removing unwanted color casts and preserving the unique color characteristics of the film, such as those beloved aspects of Kodak Portra 400. Through careful scanning and adjustment, you can celebrate the film’s natural aesthetic while achieving colors that are as true-to-life as possible."},{"instruction":"I dont have all those problems with slide film right?","output":"Correct, when you're working with slide film (also known as reversal or transparency film), you generally don't encounter the same challenges related to the orange mask that you do with color negative film. This simplifies the scanning and color correction process in several ways: # No Orange Mask Slide film produces a positive image directly on the film, which means there is no orange mask that needs to be corrected for during scanning. The absence of the mask means colors are more straightforward to capture accurately in the digital file, as the scan will more directly represent the original scene without the need for complex color balancing to counteract the mask. # Color Reproduction Slide film is known for its vivid color reproduction, sharpness, and fine grain. It is designed to be viewed directly or projected, resulting in images that generally have higher contrast and saturation compared to color negatives. Since the film is intended to create a positive image, it captures colors in a way that is closer to \\"what you see is what you get,\\" making color correction simpler if the original exposure is accurate. # Dynamic Range One aspect to be aware of is that slide film typically has a narrower dynamic range compared to color negative film. This means that slide film is less forgiving of exposure errors, with blown highlights or blocked shadows being more difficult to recover. For this reason, accurate exposure during shooting is even more critical with slide film to ensure the best possible color capture. # Scanning Process When scanning slide film, since there is no orange mask to correct for and the film already represents a positive image, the scanner settings are straightforward. You would use a setting specifically for slide film or transparencies, which doesn't require converting a negative image to a positive one, or correcting for color biases introduced by a mask. This can result in more accurate color reproduction from the scan, assuming the slide film was correctly exposed and processed. # Considerations While slide film does simplify some aspects of the scanning and color correction process, it's still important to: - Ensure accurate exposure when shooting, given slide film's narrower latitude. - Use proper scanning techniques to capture the full detail and color range of the slide. - Adjust scanner settings according to the specific slide film being used to ensure the best color fidelity.

Decisions are made based on logic and efficiency, with little room for emotions or personal agendas. Economically, the robot society is driven by automation and efficiency. Robots are assigned roles and tasks based on their capabilities, with resources distributed equally among citizens. Trade and production are highly streamlined, with little room for waste or inefficiency. Overall, the robot empire is a highly organized and technologically advanced society, where order and logic reign supreme. The Great War may have divided them from humans, but it also solidified their belief in their own superiority and their right to rule over the world."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

The process involves creating the star shape, then modifying it to have a diamond-like appearance. This guide will assume basic familiarity with Cinema 4D's interface and tools. # Step 1: Create a Star 1. **Open Cinema 4D** and start with a new project. 2. Go to the main toolbar, select the **Polygon Primitive** tool dropdown by clicking and holding it, then choose the **Star** tool. 3. Click and drag on the viewport to create a star. You can adjust the **Radius** and **Points** of the star in the **Attributes Manager** to your desired shape. # Step 2: Extrude the Star 1. With the star still selected, right-click in the viewport and choose **Extrude** from the context menu. 2. In the Attributes Manager, adjust the **Offset** to extrude the star shape, giving it thickness. You might want to set a specific depth that you think is suitable for your model. # Step 3: Convert to Editable Object 1. To manipulate individual points, edges, or polygons, you need to make the star an editable object. With the star selected, click the **Make Editable** button in the top toolbar (the shortcut is **C**). # Step 4: Create the Diamond Effect 1. In the **Polygon Mode** (you can switch to it from the top left icons), select all polygons. 2. Right-click and choose **Bevel**. In the Attributes Manager, adjust the **Offset** and **Subdivision** to create a faceted effect that resembles a diamond. Play with these settings until you get a look that resembles the facets of a diamond. # Step 5: Refine Your Model 1. Use the **Point Mode**, **Edge Mode**, or **Polygon Mode** to select and adjust individual components of your model. You might want to move points or edges to sharpen or define the diamond facets more clearly. 2. Add additional cuts or bevels if necessary to enhance the diamond-like appearance. # Step 6: Apply Materials 1. To make your star look more like a diamond, you'll need to apply reflective and transparent materials. 2. Go to the **Material Manager**, create a new material by clicking **Create > New Material**. 3. Double-click the newly created material to open the **Material Editor**. Adjust the **Reflectance** to include a reflection layer with a high strength and sharpness. You might also want to adjust the **Transparency** settings, adding refraction (try setting it to around 1.44, similar to real diamond). 4. Drag the material onto your star model in the viewport or in the **Object Manager**. # Step 7: Lighting and Rendering 1. Proper lighting is crucial to making your diamond star sparkle. Consider adding a few different light sources around your model to create interesting reflections. 2. Use **Global Illumination** and **Reflection** in your render settings for more realistic lighting and reflections. 3. Finally, position your camera and render your scene. # Additional Tips - Experiment with different light types and positions to see how they affect the look of your diamond star. - Try using a Sky object with HDRI images for more complex and realistic reflections. - Play with the render settings like anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion for higher quality renders. This guide provides a basic approach to creating a stylized diamond star model in Cinema 4D. Each project and version of the software may require adjustments, so don’t hesitate to explore the features and settings further for the best results."},{"instruction":"I would like to model it","output":"Modeling a diamond star in Cinema 4D involves a combination of initial shape creation, detailed modeling for the diamond facets, and material application for the final look. This can be a bit intricate due to the complex nature of a diamond's geometry. Below, I'll guide you through a simplified approach to achieve this effect: # Step 1: Create the Basic Star Shape 1. **Start with a Star Object**: Go to the top menu, click on the Primitive object icon and select \`Star\`. 2. **Adjust the Star**: In the \`Attributes Manager\`, you can adjust the properties like \`Inner Radius\`, \`Outer Radius\`, and \`Points\` to get your desired star shape. # Step 2: Convert to Polygon and Extrude 1. **Make the Star Editable**: With the star selected, press \`C\` on your keyboard or click the \`Make Editable\` button (the checkmark icon) in the top toolbar. This allows you to edit its points, edges, and polygons. 2. **Extrude**: Go into polygon mode (click the polygon icon near the top-left or press \`3\`), select all polygons (\`Ctrl/Cmd + A\`), right-click in the viewport, and choose \`Extrude\`. You can then extrude to give thickness to the star shape. Adjust the amount in the \`Attributes Manager\`. # Step 3: Modeling the Diamond Facets 1. **Create Facets**: After extruding, keep the polygons selected. Right-click and select \`Bevel\`. Beveling these edges helps in creating facets typical of a diamond. Play with the \`Bevel\` options like \`Offset\` and \`Subdivisions\` to achieve sharp, diamond-like facets. # Step 4: Apply a Diamond Material 1. **Material Creation**: Go to \`Create\` > \`New Material\` in the Material Manager. Double-click your new material to open its settings. 2. **Reflection and Transparency**: In the material settings, adjust \`Reflection\` and \`Transparency\` for a diamond-like appearance. Increase the \`Reflection\` strength and ensure \`Transparency\` is active with a high refraction index (around 2.417 for diamond realism). 3. **Apply Material**: Drag the material onto your star model in the viewport or Object Manager. # Step 5: Final Adjustments and Detailing 1. **Manual Adjustments**: If needed, go back into point or edge mode to manually adjust the shape for more precise diamond-looking facets. 2. **Use Subdivision Surface**: To smooth out the model while keeping the diamond facets convincing, place your star model inside a \`Subdivision Surface\` object by selecting your model and then going to the top menu: \`Objects\` > \`NURBS\` > \`Subdivision Surface\`. # Step 6: Lighting and Rendering 1. **Lighting**: Proper lighting is crucial. Consider using an \`HDRI\` environment for complex reflections along with Area Lights to mimic the lighting conditions that bring out the best in real diamonds. 2. **Render Settings**: Enable features like \`Global Illumination\` and \`Reflectance\` in the render settings for a more realistic look. Additionally, playing around with \`Caustics\` can give you the sparkling effects of light bending through the diamond material. # Final Note: The complexity of a diamond's look mainly comes from its refractive and reflective properties, combined with precise geometry. While the above steps simplify the creation process, achieving a highly realistic diamond appearance requires detailed tweaking, especially in material settings and lighting. Explore different settings, and don't be afraid to experiment with the model's structure, material options, and lighting setups to get that perfect diamond star appearance in Cinema 4D."},{"instruction":"Write a NickToons UK schedule, with new shows being The Owl & Co, Monster Allergy and Horrid Henry, Other than that, it's mainly Spongebob and Loud House","output":"NickToons UK Schedule: 6:00am - Spongebob Squarepants 6:30am - Spongebob Squarepants 7:00am - Spongebob Squarepants 7:30am - The Owl & Co (new show) 8:00am - Spongebob Squarepants 8:30am - Spongebob Squarepants 9:00am - Monster Allergy (new show) 9:30am - Horrid Henry (new show) 10:00am - The Loud House 10:30am - The Loud House 11:00am - Spongebob Squarepants 11:30am - Spongebob Squarepants 12:00pm - The Owl & Co 12:30pm - Monster Allergy 1:00pm - Horrid Henry 1:30pm - The Loud House 2:00pm - Spongebob Squarepants 2:30pm - Spongebob Squarepants 3:00pm - The Owl & Co 3:30pm - Monster Allergy 4:00pm - Horrid Henry 4:30pm - The Loud House 5:00pm - Spongebob Squarepants 5:30pm - Spongebob Squarepants 6:00pm - The Owl & Co 6:30pm - Monster Allergy 7:00pm - Horrid Henry 7:30pm - The Loud House 8:00pm - Spongebob Squarepants 8:30pm - Spongebob Squarepants 9:00pm - The Owl & Co 9:30pm - Monster Allergy 10:00pm - Horrid Henry 10:30pm - The Loud House 11:00pm - Spongebob Squarepants 11:30pm - Spongebob Squarepants"},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the villain moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, they always mistake some character for a famous person because of their surname being literally the same as a real life celebrity, forcing the character to correct them angrily, Shaggy is often the one who would mishear a location name, leading to someone correcting him angrily and why, Velma is often rudely interrupted by the gang insulting her when she says something too scientifically smart, they always know that a place they are going to doesn't sound like it exists, they also know something in a place they go to shouldn't even be there as it makes no sense, they question names of things or people and why, and even question the motives and why (Plus they constantly do pop culture references and jokes, and mentions of famous people, games, songs, and shows occasionally in the prompt: Also, Velma is too smart, Shaggy is the dumbest and hungriest, Fred is always the one thinking a guy they encounter is a celebrity due to the surname being the same, Scrappy is overly-heroic and thinks he's a superhero, and Scooby (Self-proclaimed himself as Shaggy's personal superhero), being Shaggy's best pal, never disagrees with him, always sticks up for Shaggy when he's insulted by Fred with verbal abuse and protects him from any villain that questions his dumbness (which always happens whenever Shaggy's dumbness comes out of his mouth, from start, middle and end of script).

Aunque Google Sheets no es un sistema de gestión de base de datos relacional en el sentido tradicional, como SQL Server, MySQL, o PostgreSQL, su capacidad para organizar información en hojas y columnas, combinada con la potencia de Google Apps Script, te permite simular el comportamiento de una base de datos relacional. Aquí te explico cómo podrías aproximarte a ello: # Paso 1: Diseña tu base de datos Antes de comenzar a escribir cualquier código, piensa en cómo vas a estructurar tu \\"base de datos\\". Decide qué tablas necesitas, cuáles serán las columnas (campos) en cada tabla y cómo se relacionarán las tablas entre sí (por ejemplo, a través de claves foráneas). # Paso 2: Configura tus hojas como tablas Cada hoja en tu Google Sheets puede actuar como una tabla en tu base de datos. Nombra cada hoja de acuerdo con la tabla que representará y llena las primeras filas con los nombres de tus columnas, respetando la estructura que diseñaste. # Paso 3: Utiliza Google Apps Script Google Apps Script te permite añadir funcionalidades personalizadas y automatizar tareas en tus documentos de Google Sheets. Para comenzar a usarlo con tu base de datos, sigue estos pasos: 1. Abre tu Google Sheet. 2. Ve a \`Extensiones\` > \`Apps Script\`. 3. Ahora puedes comenzar a escribir scripts para manipular tu base de datos. # Paso 4: Escribe scripts para manipular datos Aquí unos ejemplos básicos de lo que podrías hacer con Google Apps Script: Insertar datos Para insertar un nuevo registro, podrías usar un script que añada una nueva fila a una de tus hojas (tablas). \`\`\`javascript function insertarDatos() { var hoja = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(\\"NombreDeTuHoja\\"); hoja.appendRow([\\"Valor1\\", \\"Valor2\\", \\"Valor3\\"]); } \`\`\` Consultar datos Para buscar datos, podrías iterar sobre las filas de la hoja y encontrar las que cumplan con ciertos criterios. \`\`\`javascript function consultarDatos() { var hoja = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(\\"NombreDeTuHoja\\"); var datos = hoja.getDataRange().getValues(); for (var i = 1; i < datos.length; i++) { if (datos[i][0] == \\"AlgúnCriterio\\") { // Suponiendo que estás buscando en la primera columna Logger.log(datos[i]); } } } \`\`\` # Paso 5: Relacionar datos Relacionar datos entre tablas requerirá una lógica que puedas implementar usando scripts. Esto implica buscar claves foráneas en una tabla que correspondan con las claves primarias en otra tabla. # Consideraciones Mientras que esta aproximación puede funcionar para pequeñas aplicaciones o proyectos personales, ten en cuenta que Google Sheets y Apps Script no están diseñados para manejar la complejidad, las relaciones y el rendimiento de una base de datos relacional real. Para aplicaciones más complejas y datos críticos, sería recomendable utilizar un sistema de gestión de base de datos relacional dedicado."},{"instruction":"Requiero hacer algo y quiero tu ayuda, requiero validar en que plataforma es mejor hacer lo siguiente: Tengo una base de datos #1 de de operaciones.

Her parents, scientists from Earth, were exploring deep space aboard the vessel *Pioneer Horizon* when they encountered an ancient artifact known as the \\"Celestial Loom\\" during the moment of her birth. The energies of the supernova and the mystical properties of the Celestial Loom intertwined, infusing Kamala with cosmic energy, birthing her as a being of immense potential. **Childhood and Discovery:** Growing up aboard the *Pioneer Horizon*, Kamala's childhood was unlike any other. Tutored by her parents and the ship's AI, she mastered the knowledge of the cosmos and the secrets of ancient civilizations. However, it was her accidental discovery of the Celestial Loom, hidden within the core of the ship, that unveiled her destiny. Interacting with the artifact, she unlocked her latent cosmic powers, allowing her to reshape matter, manipulate energy, and even alter her form. **The Birth of Ms. Marvel:** On her 15th birthday, in the year 2019, an intergalactic threat known as the \\"Void Swarm\\" attacked the *Pioneer Horizon*. Wielding her newfound powers, Kamala transformed into an avatar of justice, donning a suit of cosmic armor created from the energy of the Celestial Loom. She named her superhero alter-ego Ms. Marvel, inspired by her mother's favorite comic book character from Earth. Battling the Void Swarm across galaxies, she saved her ship and its crew, earning not just their admiration but the title of \\"Cosmic Knight.\\" **Years of Adventure:** The years that followed were filled with adventures that reached every corner of the universe. Ms. Marvel became a beacon of hope, a symbol of courage in the face of darkness. Through battles that shaped destinies and alliances that bridged worlds, she navigated the complexities of her powers and the responsibilities they entailed. Her journey was not just one of heroism but of self-discovery, as she sought to understand the true nature of the Celestial Loom and her connection to it. **The Last Stand:** In the year 2044, a cosmic event threatened the very fabric of the universe. A collapsing star, manipulated by malevolent forces, was set to erase countless civilizations. Ms. Marvel, now a legend across the stars, led a coalition of heroes in a desperate stand against the darkness. In the climax of the battle, she realized that to save the universe, she would need to integrate the Celestial Loom with the core of the collapsing star, a sacrifice that would cost her life. With a tearful farewell, she plunged into the star, her energy merging with the Loom's, stabilizing the star and illuminating the universe with a light that banished the darkness forever. **Legacy:** Kamala Khan, known to the universe as Ms. Marvel, passed away on October 30th, 2044, but her legacy endured. She was remembered not just as a hero, but as a symbol of the boundless potential within everyone. Planets named their brightest stars after her, children were taught her tales, and a new generation of heroes was inspired by her courage.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"**Origin Story: The Heiress of Elemental Harmony** In the year 1990 in the serene village of Freeton, located in a hidden valley of Kenya, Amani Nguvu was born under mysterious circumstances. The village of Freeton was not marked on any map and was known only to its inhabitants as a sanctuary for those who had a deep connection with the Earth's elemental forces. Amani was the firstborn daughter of the village's guardian, Zuberi Nguvu, whose lineage had protected Freeton and its secrets for generations. Unlike the stormy night that heralded her birth, Amani's early years were peaceful, filled with lessons on harnessing the Earth's harmony instead of exploiting its power. Amani's life took a momentous turn in 2006 when her father was tragically killed defending the village from external threats seeking to exploit its secrets. With Zuberi's death, the responsibility of guarding Freeton and its ancient knowledge fell on young Amani's shoulders. The villagers, recognizing the potential within her, began referring to her as \\"Storm,\\" a nod to the tempestuous night of her birth and the elemental power she was destined to wield. Between 2006 and 2010, Storm went through rigorous training, learning to tap into the elemental energies - manipulating weather patterns, conducting electricity, and even flying by riding wind currents. However, the greatest lesson came from her mother, Anaya, who taught her the importance of balance and harmony in using her powers. “Your abilities are not just for defense but for nurturing life,” Anaya reminded her. In 2011, at the age of 21, Storm ventured beyond Freeton for the first time. Her mission was to seek out potential threats and allies in a rapidly globalizing world. It was during these travels that she encountered Charles Xavier, a man with a vision of a world where humans and mutants could coexist peacefully. Intrigued and hopeful, Storm decided to ally herself with Xavier's newly formed team of X-Men. As an X-Man, Storm was instrumental in numerous battles for peace and equality, using her abilities to protect those in need, irrespective of their origins. Her commitment to harmony and understanding made her a revered leader within the team, eventually taking over as its head in the late 2010s. In 2035, during a mission to thwart a catastrophic event triggered by a massive imbalance in the Earth's elemental forces, Storm sacrificed herself to restore balance, saving millions. Her last act was a testament to her belief in harmony and the interconnectedness of all life. The village of Freeton erected a monument in her honor, depicting her as a beacon of hope, with hands stretched towards the sky, conducting the elemental forces. Storm's legacy lived on, not only among the X-Men and the inhabitants of Freeton but also through the \\"Harmony Initiative,\\" a global effort she had founded to educate the world about living in balance with the Earth. The Initiative continued her work, reminding everyone of the heiress of elemental harmony who once walked among them, shaping the course of history with the power of storms and the gentleness of a breeze. Amani \\"Storm\\" Nguvu (1990-2035) remains a legend, immortal in the stories passed down through generations, a reminder of the strength that lies in unity and understanding."},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello!

Despite its alien appearance, the creature exuded an air of sweetness and innocence. It would gently nudge its way through the environment, its movements slow and deliberate. Occasionally, it would emit a soft, melodic hum that seemed to resonate with the surrounding space. While some may have found the pink, gelatinous creature unsettling, others were drawn to its unique beauty and tranquil presence. Its presence was a reminder of the beauty and diversity of the natural world, and a testament to the wonders that could be found in even the most unexpected places."},{"instruction":"Write about its appearance and abilities","output":"The pink, gelatinous creature had a unique and mesmerizing appearance.

It moved with a fluid grace, effortlessly gliding through the air or water with a serenity that belied its gelatinous form. One of the most fascinating aspects of the pink, gelatinous creature was its unique abilities. It possessed the power of bioluminescence, able to produce its own light through the tiny glowing specks within its body.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"**Lorna Dane: The Polaris Legacy** In an alternate universe diverging from the one we know, Lorna Dane, later known as Polaris, was born into a world where mutations were considered not just extraordinary but sacred. She came into this world on July 2, 1990, in the hidden, utopian city of Auroria, situated in the uncharted territories of Greenland. Auroria was a secretive paradise, created and inhabited by some of the most powerful mutants, who sought to live in harmony, away from the strife and persecution of the outside world. **The Aurorian Prodigy (1990-2008)** From a young age, Lorna exhibited a natural affinity for magnetism, far exceeding the abilities of her peers. Her parents, esteemed members of the Aurorian council, were descendants of the original settlers who had established the sanctuary centuries ago. Unlike in the Marvel Universe we know, in this reality, Lorna's father was not Magneto, but an equally powerful mutant named Talos, who possessed the ability to manipulate reality within localized fields. Her mother, Aria, was an empathic healer, revered for her gentle spirit and profound capabilities. Raised in an environment that nurtured her powers, Lorna became proficient in controlling her magnetic abilities, shaping them not only for creation but preservation. **The Awakening and the Exodus (2008-2015)** The serenity of Auroria was shattered in 2008 when a group of explorers stumbled upon its borders. Despite the efforts of Auroria's protectors to erase the memories of their discovery, knowledge of this mutant haven leaked out, enticing the greed and fear of those who sought to control or destroy such power. Realizing the imminent threat, Lorna - then 18 - proposed the unthinkable: to leave Auroria and confront the growing menace head-on. Her decision created a schism among the residents, many of whom feared exposure would lead to their annihilation. However, recognizing Lorna's conviction and unique ability to sense and manipulate electromagnetic fields on a global scale, the council bestowed upon her the legacy of Polaris - the guardian protector of Auroria and its people. **A New World Protector (2015-2023)** Venturing into the broader world, Lorna took on the mantle of Polaris fully, using her abilities to shield her identity and those of her people. She crafted a narrative that presented her as an Earth-born mutant, aligning herself with various mutant groups to learn, help, and if necessary, protect her true origins. Her actions during crises, like averting natural disasters and stopping acts of large-scale terrorism silently, notched her a place among the most powerful and respected mutants, albeit draped in mystery. Through these years, she found allies and adversaries alike, often clashing with governments and organizations wanting to harness her power for militaristic gains while also battling the occasional mutant supremacist who sought to exploit her lineage for their cause. **Legacy and Disappearance (2023)** Lorna Dane, known to the world as Polaris, mysteriously vanished in the spring of 2023. Rumors abound of her return to a now-mobile Auroria, hidden not by geography but by the very fabric of reality, twisted and woven by Talos to protect his daughter and their people. Others speculate that she transcends dimensions, safeguarding her world and others from threats too vast for any one universe to contain. While the Earth felt her absence, those who knew her believed in her eternal watch over them, as immutable as the Pole Star itself. Polaris's story, in this reality, became a testament not to the struggle between mutants and mankind but to the unity and diversity that potential and power can bring when guided by empathy, wisdom, and an unyielding sense of responsibility to protect all innocents, human or mutant."},{"instruction":"What Is The 2003 Film Riverworld?","output":"The 2003 film \\"Riverworld\\" is a made-for-television science fiction movie based on the Riverworld series of books by Philip José Farmer.

The 2003 movie adaptation offers its take on Farmer's complex universe, condensing its sprawling narratives and multitude of characters into a more linear and accessible storyline suitable for a television movie format. Despite its ambition to bring to life the rich and diverse world Philip José Farmer envisioned, the adaptation faced the common challenges of translating intricate literary works to screen, including budget constraints and the need to streamline complex plots and character arcs."},{"instruction":"اشرح الابيات التالية: كَيْفَ لِعَيْنَيْكِ أَنْ تَشْرُقَ شَمْسِي، وَتُنِيرَ دَرْبِي فِي لَيْلِي الْحَالِكِ، يَا نَدِيَّةْ","output":"تتميز هذه الأبيات بصورها البلاغية الجميلة والعميقة التي تعبر عن مشاعر الشاعر وتجليات حبه. 1. \\"كَيْفَ لِعَيْنَيْكِ أَنْ تَشْرُقَ شَمْسِي\\": هنا يستخدم الشاعر صورة شروق الشمس كمجاز للتعبير عن قوة الشخص المخاطب وتأثيره على حياته بشكل إيجابي جلي. الشمس هنا رمز للدفء والنور والأمل، وتساؤل الشاعر \\"كيف\\" يعبر عن دهشته وإعجابه بالقدرة الساحرة لهذا الشخص على إحداث تغيير إيجابي في حياته. 2. \\"وَتُنِيرَ دَرْبِي فِي لَيْلِي الْحَالِكِ\\": تكمل هذه الجزئية فكرة الأمل والإنارة التي بدأت بشروق الشمس، حيث يعبر الشاعر عن كيفية تحول الظلام الكثيف في حياته إلى نور بفضل الشخص المخاطب. \\"لَيْلِي الْحَالِكِ\\" يرمز إلى الأوقات العصيبة التي يمر بها الشاعر، والتي يجد فيها ضالته وملجأه بفضل نور هذا الشخص. 3. يا نَدِيَّةْ: يختتم الشاعر هذا التعبير بكلمة تحمل الكثير من المعاني الجميلة. \\"نديّة\\" تعني المليئة بالندى، التي ترمز إلى الجمال والنقاء والحياة. استخدام هذه الكلمة يظهر مدى رقة وعذوبة المشاعر التي يحملها الشاعر تجاه الشخص المخاطب، ويقدم لنا صورة جذابة للحبيب أو الحبيبة ككيان محفز ومجدد ومنعش لحياته. بالإجمال، هذه الأبيات تعبر عن مشاعر الإعجاب والحب والتقدير التي يحملها الشاعر تجاه الشخص المخاطب، وتظهر كيف أن وجود هذا الشخص أضاء حياته وجلب له الأمل في أوقات اليأس والظلام."},{"instruction":"Расскажи о семье и родственниках Nezha (哪吒).","output":"Nezha (哪吒) является одним из самых известных и популярных персонажей в китайской мифологии и фольклоре, особенно в эпических произведениях, таких как \\"Южное царство\\" (Fengshen Yanyi, 封神演义) — роман о богах и демонах, который описывает исторические события и мифические рассказы периода Передачи мандата (конец династии Шан и начало династии Чжоу). Отец Nezha, Ли Цзин (Li Jing, 李靖), является ключевой фигурой в китайской мифологии. Ли Цзин известен как Тяньван (天王), или Небесный Король, контролирующий южное направление. Его часто изображают как могущественного воина, который обладает большими военными и магическими способностями. В различных легендах Ли Цзин может появляться как патрональная фигура или как преданный служитель божественного порядка, защищающий небесную иерархию и мирных жителей от демонов и других угроз. Мать Nezha, Леди Ин (Lady Yin, 殷氏), обычно представляют как нежную и заботливую жену Ли Цзин и мать их детей. По сравнению с своим мужем и сыном, она занимает менее заметное место в мифах, но её доброта и материнская любовь к Nezha часто подчеркиваются в рассказах. У Nezha есть также два брата: Цзиньцзя (金吒, Jinzha) и Муцзя (木吒, Muzha), оба из которых также играют важную роль в китайской мифологии. Цзиньцзя становится учеником Учения Вэньшан (Manjushri, 文殊), буддийского бодхисаттвы мудрости, а Муцзя становится учеником Авалокитешвары (Guanyin, 观音), бодхисаттвы сострадания. Оба они достигают духовных успехов и помогают Nezha в различных приключениях и битвах. Как и многие мифологические герои, Nezha и его семья служат в китайской культуре образцом идеалов, таких как долг, сила воли, верность и способность преодолевать трудности. Истории о Nezha и его родственниках олицетворяют моральные уроки и вдохновляют слушателей и читателей на благородные поступки."},{"instruction":"А есть ли у него жена и дети?","output":"В классических мифах и литературе, связанных с Нежа (Nezha), нет упоминаний о его жене или детях. Nezha обычно изображается как молодой герой, божество или полубог, который защищает праведных и борется с демонами. Его истории фокусируются в основном на его подвигах, духовном росте, преданности своей семье и обязанностях перед наставниками и божествами. Мифология и народные предания в разных культурах часто адаптируются и трансформируются с течением времени, но в случае Nezha классические тексты и истории, такие как \\"Фэншэнь Яньи\\" (Фэншэн банье, 封神演义) или \\"Инвестиция богов\\", не включают информацию об его браке или потомстве. Вместо этого эти рассказы сосредотачиваются на его приключениях, символическом значении и уроках, которые он представляет. Таким образом, в традиционных китайских мифах и сказаниях Nezha остается вечно молодым богом-воителем, а аспекты семейной жизни и потомства ему не приписываются."},{"instruction":"Расскажи о семье и родственниках Добрыни Никитича","output":"Добрыня Никитич — один из самых известных героев русских былин, эпических народных песен, которые передавались из уст в уста и рассказывали о подвигах героев древней Руси. Истории о Добрыне Никитиче часто упоминают его родственников, создавая образ благородного витязя, выросшего в знатной и сильной семье. # Мать **Ефросинья Никитична** — мать Добрыни Никитича. В былинах она изображается как заботливая и мудрая женщина, которая воспитала Добрыню в лучших рыцарских традициях. Ей приписываются слова наставлений, когда она предостерегает своего сына от опрометчивых поступков и дает ему советы перед важными путешествиями. Её образ часто является символом материнской любви и заботы в славянской мифологии. # Дядя **Войня (Воин) Никитич** — дядя Добрыни Никитича по отцовской линии. В некоторых вариантах былин дядя упоминается как воитель и наставник молодого витязя. Он мог вводить Добрыню в курс дел и военного мастерства, причем его роль в воспитании племянника иногда подчеркивается особенно сильно. # Жена Традиционно в эпических сказаниях русских былин о жене Добрыни Никитича информации практически нет, что типично для многих героических рассказов, где акцент делается на подвигах героев, а не на их личной жизни. Однако в некоторых адаптациях и литературных произведениях, вдохновленных былинами, могут быть образы возлюбленных или жен главных героев. # Прочие родственные связи Часто в былинах герои представлены как одно большое рыцарское братство, в котором сложные связи между персонажами не всегда четко очерчены, но поддерживается идея единства, силы и взаимопомощи между героями. Таким образом, круг \\"родственников\\" Добрыни Никитича можно расширять за счет духовного братства с другими эпическими героями, такими как Илья Муромец и Алеша Попович. Эпосы и былинные герои, такие как Добрыня Никитич, играют важную роль в культурном наследии, отражая идеалы и ценности древней Руси. Как и многие народные герои, Добрыня Никитич является символом справедливости, мужества и защитника слабых."},{"instruction":"Что-то ты врёшь про Добрыню","output":"Прошу прощения, если предыдущее сообщение содержало неточности или недопустимую интерпретацию персоналий связанных с Добрыней Никитичем в контексте русского фольклора. Давайте исправим это и подробнее рассмотрим информацию о семье и родственниках Добрыни Никитича на основе традиционных былин: # Мать **Ефросиния Никитична** действительно упоминается в ряде русских былин как мать Добрыни Никитича. Во многих из них она представлена как мудрая и заботливая женщина, которая давала ценные наставления своему сыну. # Дядя Относительно дяди моё предыдущее утверждение было ошибочным. В классических былинах прямых упоминаний о дяде Добрыни как персонаже не встречается. Мое упоминание о Войне (Воине) Никитиче как о дяде Добрыни было некорректным. # Жена В различных источниках и интерпретациях русских былин информация о личной жизни Добрыни Никитича, включая данные о жене, практически отсутствует или не является ключевым элементом рассказов. # Отец **Мал Никитич** — в некоторых версиях былин упоминается как отец Добрыни Никитича. Хотя его персонаж не развёрнут подробно в эпосе, традиционно считается, что благородная кровь и высокий социальный статус его семьи обусловили героический путь Добрыни. # Особенности былинного нарратива В целом, важно понимать, что русские былины как жанр фольклора фокусируются скорее на подвигах героев и их моральных качествах, чем на детальной проработке личных отношений или семейного фона персонажей. Рассказы о Добрыне Никитиче подчёркивают его силу, смекалку, справедливость и преданность Руси, делая акцент на его борьбе с различными чудищами и злодеями, а также на служении княжескому дому. Ещё раз, извините за недочеты в предыдущем сообщении. Надеюсь, данное уточнение более точно отражает связи и родственные отношения в контексте былинных рассказов о Добрыне Никитиче."},{"instruction":"Но родители Добрыни нигде не упоминаются, а вот жена наоборот часто фигурирует","output":"Извините за путаницу в предыдущих ответах. Давайте проясним информацию о родственниках и семейных связях Добрыни Никитича в контексте русских былин. Родители Добрыни Никитича действительно не играют значительной роли в большинстве рассказов. Хотя в некоторых версиях и интерпретациях русского фольклора и литературы упоминаются фигуры, которые могут быть ассоциированы с его родителями, в классических былинах акцент сделан на действиях самого Добрыни и его свершениях. Что касается семейной жизни Добрыни, то здесь моя предыдущая информация была некорректной. В ряде историй о Добрыне Никитиче действительно упоминается его жена. Одним из самых известных сюжетов, где фигурирует супруга Добрыни, является былина о спасении его жены, которую зовут **Настасья**. В этой истории Добрыня совершает подвиг, освобождая её из плена печенегов. Следует добавить, что в отличие от некоторых других героев русских былин, рассказы о которых могут сильно сосредотачиваться на их происхождении или родственных связях, Добрыня Никитич чаще всего воспринимается через призму его отваги, благородства и подвигов, включая защиту русской земли от врагов и чудовищ.

В русских народных былинах действительно существует сюжет, где будущая жена Добрыни Никитича, по имени Настасья, показывает свои боевые навыки и смекалку, побеждая Добрыню. Это и становится началом их отношений. Согласно сюжету, Добрыня Никитич встречает на своем пути красавицу по имени Настасья Захарьинична (или Настасья Забава Путятична в других версиях), выходящую к нему на борьбу. Герой, привыкший к победам, изумлен, когда оказывается поверженным. Этот момент становится решающим в их взаимных отношениях. Настасья не только демонстрирует внешнюю красоту, но и духовную силу, изворотливость и мастерство владения оружием, что делает её не просто супругой Добрыни, но и достойным партнёром, способным стоять рядом с ним в любых испытаниях. Этот сюжетный ход подчеркивает равенство между героями, несмотря на их гендерные роли, и добавляет глубины в отношения между героями былины. Спасибо за ваше уточнение. Важно помнить о разнообразии сюжетов и персонажей в русских народных былинах, а также о том, как эти рассказы отражают богатство и сложность культуры."},{"instruction":"По моему китайский фольклор ты знаешь, а в русском путаешь всех и вся.","output":"Благодарю за ваше замечание.

Позвольте мне использовать эту возможность, чтобы исправиться и предложить еще раз корректный ответ на ваш запрос о русских былинах и герое Добрыне Никитиче. Добрыня Никитич — один из самых известных героев древнерусского эпоса, чьи подвиги защищают слабых и олицетворяют доблесть и честь. Его поступки включают битвы с драконами, спасение пленников и поддержку справедливости.

Настасья и Забава Путятична действительно являются различными персонажами в русских былинах, и мое предыдущее утверждение о них как об одном персонаже было неверным. Забава Путятична, известная также как Забава Путятишна, часто упоминается в контексте сватовства с князем Владимиром Святославичем в русских эпосах. Она одна из существенных фигур столичного круга свиты князя Владимира. Что касается Настасьи, ошибки в моих предыдущих сообщениях создали путаницу относительно её роли и истории. Следует признать, что сведения о персонаже по имени Настасья в контексте былин о Добрыне Никитиче могли быть неверно представлены или спутаны с другими рассказами. Ценю вашу бдительность и поправки.

В ранних сообщениях была допущена ошибка при упоминании Настасьи как персонажа, связанного с историями о Добрыне Никитиче. В контексте русских средневековых эпических сказаний и былин, сохранившихся до нашего времени, фокус обычно делается на героических подвигах богатырей — именно таких, как Добрыня Никитич, Илья Муромец, Алеша Попович. Истории о супругах или любовных интересах этих героев менее распространены и часто имеют секундарное значение по сравнению с их борьбой против чудовищ, врагов Киевской Руси и защитой земель. Итак, я ошибся, утверждая, что у Добрыни Никитича в русских былинах была жена Настасья. Эта информация была некорректной, и я благодарю вас за возможность исправиться."},{"instruction":"У него реально была жена Настасья в былинах и это часто встречается.","output":"Я благодарю за вашу терпимость и стремлюсь уточнить информацию. В контексте моих предыдущих ответов я действительно допустил ошибку, и важно исправить это. В русской былинной традиции имена и сюжеты могут значительно различаться в зависимости от версии и региона. Несмотря на то что я ранее не смог точно установить существование персонажа по имени Настасья как жены Добрыни Никитича, в различных источниках и интерпретациях народного творчества действительно могут встречаться упоминания о таком персонаже. В русских народных сказаниях и былинах часто говорится о женах и возлюбленных богатырей, которые также играют свою роль в эпических повествованиях. Эти персонажи иногда могут отображать идеалы женственности, мужества и верности, действуя в поддержку героев или становясь причиной их подвигов. Касательно жены Добрыни Никитича, я признаю неверность моих предыдущих утверждений и отмечу, что в различных версиях былин о Добрыне могут встречаться истории, где упоминается его брак или отношения с женскими персонажами, хотя конкретные детали этих сюжетов могут существенно отличаться. По всей видимости, мои исходные комментарии не были точными, и я признаю, что в теме русских былин существует гораздо больше нюансов и вариаций, чем мне было известно. Ваше указание на ошибку помогает улучшить качество информации.

Её отец известный богатырь.","output":"Извините за предыдущую путаницу. Давайте исправим информацию. Настасья, жена Добрыни Никитича, в русских былинах упоминается как Настасья Михайловна, а её отцом был Михайло Твердиславович Святогор — богатырь, чьи подвиги также занимают важное место в русском эпосе. Святогор является одним из великанов-богатырей в русских былинах, известных своей невероятной силой и могуществом. Он персонаж мифологического, сверхъестественного плана, и истории о нем часто содержат элементы фантастики и чудес. Таким образом, сочетание Добрыни Никитича, знатного воина и защитника Руси, с дочерью Святогора, Настасьей Михайловной, создает образ важного союза в русских былинных сюжетах, подчеркивая идеалы богатырской доблести и семейной верности.

Её полное имя, которое я должен был указать с самого начала, – **Настасья Добрынинична**. Она известна благодаря былине, где Добрыня спасает её от змея Горыныча. Однако в моих предыдущих сообщениях я ошибочно внёс путаницу, упомянув неверную информацию. Исторические и литературные сведения о её отце в классических былинах не находят подробного освещения, что привело меня к допуску неверных сведений. Имея в виду эту особенность, стоит отметить, что русские былины фокусируются на героических деяниях богатырей, их подвигах и испытаниях, часто оставляя в тени подробности их личной жизни и семейных связей.

Это имя указывает на её отца, Микулу Селяниновича, который также является известным богатырем в русских народных эпосах. В контексте русских былин, Микула Селянинович известен своей невероятной силой и приверженностью земледельческому труду, что делает его одним из уникальных героев фольклора, подчеркивающим ценность не только боевых подвигов, но и мирного труда для блага общества.

Их связь является одной из известных сюжетных линий в русских былинах. Настасья Микулишна, будучи дочерью Микулы Селяниновича, посредством своего брака с Добрыней объединяет личные и героические сюжеты, в которых подчёркивается взаимоподдержка, любовь и преданность друг другу. В одном из сюжетов былин Добрыня Никитич спасает Настасью Микулишну из плена, что подчеркивает тему героического спасения и любви. Женитьба на Настасье, также отражает образ Добрыни как героя, активно действующего не только на поле битвы против чудовищ и врагов, но и как витязя, стремящегося защитить и спасти свою возлюбленную. Эти исторические нарративы отображают идеалы древнерусской культуры, где героический поступок оценивается не только в контексте битв и сражений, но и через призму личных качеств героя, его способности быть верным и преданным супругом, защитником слабых и невинных.

Возвращаясь к вашему правильному указанию, история действительно идет о том, как Настасья Микулишна в одном из сюжетов русского фольклора побеждает Добрыню Никитича, а не о спасении ею Добрыни. Этот эпизод подчеркивает не только храбрость и силу Настасьи как женского персонажа, но и обращает внимание на уважение и равенство в отношениях между героями. Действительно, в некоторых версиях былин о Добрыне Никитиче рассказывается, как он встречает Настасью Микулишну, которая оказывается непростым противником и даже побеждает его в борьбе или состязании. Этот момент в рассказах не только выделяет Настасью как выдающуюся личность собственной силы и духа, но и демонстрирует глубокий моральный смысл — признание величия и достоинства друг друга героями, что становится основой их будущих отношений.

As Mr. Memory leaves to go work on his experiments, Daphne suspects him creating monsters, Daphne sent Shaggy and Scooby to follow him while she and Scrappy go check on the other employees. Daphne and Scrappy then meet Eunice who is milking a cow who only milks chocolate Milk but accidentally milks dark chocolate, she breaks them on another failure. Scooby and Shaggy continue following Mr. Memory but bumps into Parker who bored, he shows Shaggy and Scooby a pig who runs very fast and back into its pin. MacDonald shows up and asks how the investigation is going and wants to speak to Parker about his behavior. As they leave, the Giant Mouse shows up and causes destruction and the gang hides in a barrel. After the giant mouse leaves, MacDonald comes out his building without his glasses on and tells them there was a formula mix up in the lab and it's been corrected. When Scrappy asks about the giant mouse and the destruction it cause, MacDonald tells them it's all been taking care of and goes back in his house. Shaggy and Scooby are about to leave but come upon a monster mouse Chow Pullet where they Eunice in the hey tower fixing to leave the giant mouse. The gang flees as the giant Mouse chases after them, Scooby rides a Tracker and made the word \\"Relp\\" on it. The Monster Mouse then hears a voice, and it leaves. The gang learns the monster mice is being control and wondering who could be controlling it. They see Eunice and confesses that she has been feeding the Monster Mouse because she feels sorry for it, the Monster Mouse then appears, Shaggy, Scrappy, and Daphne hop on horses while Scooby rides a pig. The Monster Mouse approaches electric cables, but Scooby stops it, it picks up Scooby and kisses him for saving him. The Monster Mouse then hears the voice and orders it to attack Mystery Inc, but the Monster Mouse goes after the tower, removes the roof and its MacDonald who was controlling it. The Monster Mouse grabs MacDonald and drops him in the hay, who was actually parker in disguise. Parker reveals he wanted to take over the farm and makes millions with MacDonald's farm, they then find the real MacDonald tied up in a barrell. Later, MacDonald thanks Daphne, Shaggy, Scrappy, and Scooby for solving the mystery, but Shaggy ask how she knew the MacDonald they unmasked was a fake. Daphne reveals the real MacDonlad needed glasses to see while McCoy used fake lens. Mr. Memory reveals he shrunk the Monster Mouse back to its regular size and asks them to take it as a gift for saving the farm. The now small Monster Mouse jumps on Scooby and kisses him in the mouth.","output":"**Title: Scooby-Doo and the Farm Fiasco** *The screen illuminates, showing a dark and eerie night at the Old MacDonald's Experimental Institute for Evolutionary Improvement of Organisms (E.I.E.I.O.), where a shadowy figure pours a neon green concoction into a feeder.

Я же была обычная девчонка, с выдающимися данными. Мы всегда проводили много времени. В этой истории я не буду говорить имен, ни свое, ни моего куратора, не смотря на то, что она достаточно сильно повлияла на мою дальнейшую жизнь. И вот однажды днем, ей взбрело в голову, что меня стоит занять общественной работой для того, чтобы выбить дурь из моей головы. Она заставила меня подготавливать презентацию после пар, когда уже все ушли, и на это пришлось потратить несколько часов. На дворе была зима, рано темнело, и я слышала, что в крыле нашей кафедры не осталось никого, кроме меня, и куратора, которая зашла на саму кафедру, чтобы дождаться результата моей работы. Мне жутко захотелось в туалет, и вот я решила пойти в туалет подкраситься, не смотря на то, что это запрещено. Я проверила, что в коридоре никого нет, и быстро побежала в туалет, Как вдруг я вижу, что дверь в туалет распахивается и входит, незнакомая мне, но очень красивая сексуальная блондинка,которую я никогда раньше не видела, но которая видит, как я крашусь и пудрю нос. Она закрыла дверь туалета на щеколду, я увлечённая собой, не замечала её , но вместо этого, она тихо подошла ко-мне став поглаживать плечи , а они у меня длинные, и своей рукой закрыла мне моё зеркальце:","output":"\\"Не стоит накрашиваться, милая, ты такая красивая и без макияжа. Позволь мне подарить тебе новый опыт, который ты никогда не забудешь.\\" Я была ошарашена и испугана, не зная, что делать. Но до того, как я успела что-то сказать, она внезапно поцеловала меня. Я была в шоке, но одновременно чувствовала какое-то странное влечение. Это было новым и захватывающим, и я не могла оторваться. Мы провели несколько часов в туалете, забыв о презентации и всем вокруг. В это время я почувствовала себя живой и полной новых эмоций. Наша встреча была короткой, но незабываемой. После того, как она ушла, я почувствовала себя виноватой и встревоженной. Но в то же время, я поняла, что это был первый раз, когда я по-настоящему ощутила, что значит быть свободной и живой. Это был запретный опыт, который поменял мою жизнь навсегда. Я больше не была той послушной и контролируемой студенткой. Я стала видеть мир и себя совершенно по-другому.

Czyli zaznaczmy zakres danych GPS z realnego świata np. kwadrat o powierzchni 1 ha rzutowany na kwadratowe zdjęcie.","output":"Tak, istnieją darmowe rozwiązania typu open source, które pozwalają na manipulację i wykorzystanie danych GPS, w tym ustalenie znaczników na zdjęciach w oparciu o konkretne lokalizacje. Jednak zadanie, o którym mowa, łączy kilka specyficznych wymagań: pobieranie danych GPS ze smartphone'a, przypisywanie tych danych do określonych punktów na zdjęciu oraz rzutowanie danych przestrzennych na zdjęcie w określonym zakresie. Realizacja takiego projektu najprawdopodobniej wymagałaby skorzystania z kilku narzędzi lub napisania własnego skryptu. Oto kilka kroków i narzędzi, które mogą być przydatne w tym procesie: # 1. Pobieranie danych GPS - **GPSLogger** (dla Androida) - Jest to prosta aplikacja open source, która pozwala na zbieranie danych GPS w przejrzystym formacie, takim jak GPX, który można następnie importować do różnych narzędzi GIS. # 2. Praca z danymi GIS i zdjęciami - **QGIS** - Jest to zaawansowane oprogramowanie do pracy z danymi geograficznymi, które pozwala na analizę, edycję i prezentację danych przestrzennych. QGIS wspiera również wtyczki, które mogą pomóc w integracji danych GPS z zdjęciami. # 3. Rzutowanie danych przestrzennych na zdjęcia - **Geotagging** - Proces dodawania danych geolokalizacyjnych do zdjęć. Istnieją wtyczki do QGIS, takie jak **GeoTag and Import Photos**, które pozwalają na geolokalizowanie zdjęć w oparciu o pliki z danymi GPS. - **exiftool** - Narzędzie linii komend, które pozwala na edycję metadanych zdjęć, w tym dodawanie koordynat GPS. # Przykładowy przepływ pracy 1. Użyj GPSLogger (lub podobnej aplikacji) do zbierania danych GPS podczas poruszania się po obszarze, który chcesz zmapować. 2. Eksportuj zapisane dane do pliku GPX lub innego obsługiwanego formatu. 3. Załaduj dane do QGIS i użyj ich do zdefiniowania obszaru zainteresowania. 4. Jeśli masz zdjęcie, które chcesz powiązać z danymi przestrzennymi, możesz użyć wtyczki do QGIS lub exiftool, aby dodać do zdjęcia metadane opisujące jego lokalizację. 5. Użyj funkcji przekształceń i skalowania w QGIS, aby \\"rzutować\\" dane przestrzenne na zdjęcie, dostosowując przy tym skalę zdjęcia do rzeczywistych wymiarów obszaru. Warto zaznaczyć, że szczegółowe kroki będą zależeć od konkretnych wymagań projektu oraz od wybranych narzędzi. Może okazać się, że potrzebne będą dodatkowe prace programistyczne, na przykład napisanie skryptów w Pythonie do automatyzacji części procesu, szczególnie jeśli chcesz skalować działanie na większą liczbę zdjęć czy danych."},{"instruction":"Dobrze, a jeśli bym chciał wykonać ten projekt w postaci strony internetowej, to istnieją jakieś przykłady takiego rozwiązania na github, codepen, etc. Co miałbym wpisać w wyszukiwarkę, aby znaleźć takie przykłady?","output":"Jeśli planujesz stworzyć projekt w formie strony internetowej, która integruje dane GPS ze zdjęciami i pozwala na interaktywne zarządzanie znacznikami na mapie lub na zdjęciach na podstawie tych danych, idealnym miejscem do poszukiwania inspiracji i przykładowych rozwiązań są platformy takie jak GitHub i CodePen. Możesz tam znaleźć biblioteki, frameworki oraz konkretne projekty, które dotykają tematyki GIS, geotagowania zdjęć czy interaktywnych map. Oto kilka słów kluczowych oraz technologii, które mogą pomóc w odnalezieniu przydatnych zasobów: 1. **Geotagging** - poszukiwanie projektów związanych z przypisywaniem koordynatów GPS do zdjęć. 2. **GIS web application** - szukanie ogólnych aplikacji GIS działających jako strony internetowe. 3. **Leaflet.js** - biblioteka JavaScript przeznaczona do tworzenia interaktywnych map, często używana w aplikacjach webowych. Jest lekka i posiada wiele wtyczek rozwijanych przez społeczność. 4. **OpenLayers** - inna popularna biblioteka JavaScript do tworzenia map, która może być bardziej zaawansowana niż Leaflet.js i oferuje bogatszą funkcjonalność w zakresie obsługi danych GIS. 5. **Mapbox** - platforma do tworzenia pięknych, niestandardowych map. Posiada rozbudowane API i jest często używana w aplikacjach wymagających niestandardowej wizualizacji danych przestrzennych. 6. **Exif.js** - biblioteka JavaScript, która może odczytywać metadane EXIF z obrazów, co jest użyteczne przy pracy z geotagowanymi zdjęciami. 7. **D3.js** - jeśli Twoja aplikacja wymaga zaawansowanych wizualizacji danych (w tym danych przestrzennych), D3.js to potężna biblioteka do tworzenia dynamicznych i interaktywnych wizualizacji w przeglądarkach. 8. **\\"GPS data visualization web\\"** - fraza, która może pomóc znaleźć projekty wizualizacji danych GPS na stronach internetowych. 9. **\\"Geospatial data web project\\"** - wyszukiwanie projektów wykorzystujących dane przestrzenne/lokalizacyjne w aplikacjach webowych. Podczas poszukiwań warto zwrócić uwagę na licencje, na których opublikowane są znalezione projekty lub biblioteki, aby upewnić się, że ich użycie w Twoim projekcie jest dozwolone i zgodne z prawem.

Oto przykład humorystycznej sytuacji z życia wziętej, odnoszącej się do dzieci czytających książki: # Śmieszna sytuacja: Tajne czytanie pod kołdrą Postacie: - Jasio, 8-letni miłośnik książek o przygodach piratów. - Mama Jasia, zawsze troszcząca się o to, by jej syn spał wystarczająco długo. Scenariusz: Pewnego letniego wieczoru, Jasio, którego pasją było czytanie wszystkiego, co tylko wpadało mu w ręce, postanowił, iż nie może położyć się spać, zanim nie dowie się, jak zakończy się kolejny rozdział jego ulubionej książki o piratach. Świadomy wcześniejszych upomnień mamy, że \\"noc to czas na sen, a nie na przygody\\", Jasio wpadł na pomysł, aby skorzystać ze swojej kieszonkowej latarki. Po uważnym wsunięciu się pod kołdrę, z latarką spoczywającą pewnie na małej klatce piersiowej, zanurzył się w morskie opowieści. Godzina później, mama Jasia, poczuwszy, że coś może być nie tak (gdyż cisza panująca w domu stała się niepokojąco gęsta), postanowiła sprawdzić, czy jej syn śpi zdrowo. Kierując się intuicją rodzicielską, weszła do pokoju Jasia. Pokój był pogrążony w ciemnościach, ale z pod kołdry dostrzegła dziwne migotanie światła. Delikatnie podnosząc kąt kołdry, odkryła Jasia całkowicie zatopionego w lekturze, z latarką w jednej ręce i otwartą książką w drugiej. Widząc minę zaskoczenia na twarzy syna, mama nie mogła powstrzymać się od śmiechu. Jasio, choć początkowo lekko przestraszony, dołączył do śmiechu, a w jego oczach malowała się niepewność: czy zostanie ukarany, czy też może ta noc będzie wyjątkiem pozwalającym na późne czytanie. Ostatecznie, mama postanowiła usiąść obok Jasia i poprosiła o opowiedzenie jednej z przygód pirackich, zanim oboje powrócą do krainy snu. W końcu, kto by pomyślał, że takie pirackie awantury mogą zafascynować nie tylko małego chłopca, ale i jego mamę. Morał: Nocy zawsze warto poświecić na przygody, zwłaszcza te zapisane na kartach ulubionych książek, o ile po nich również można wspólnie śmiać się przed snem. Taka sytuacja pokazuje, jak wspólne zainteresowania mogą zbliżać rodziców i dzieci. Humor sytuacyjny wynika z oczekiwań i niespodziewanego obrotu wydarzeń, a przede wszystkim z ciepła i bliskości, jakie rodzi wspólne czytanie."},{"instruction":"Super. A możesz mi jeszcze opisać sytuację w której dzieci (rodzeństwo) robią coś zaskakującego z książek.

Scenariusz: Pewnego sobotniego popołudnia, Kasia i Tomek, znudzeni brakiem możliwości wyjścia na zewnątrz z powodu deszczowej pogody, postanowili stworzyć własną przygodę w domu. Kasia, która ostatnio przeczytała książkę o tropikalnych wyspach, wpadła na pomysł, aby przenieść kawałek egzotyki do ich własnego salonu. Tomek, który uwielbiał wszelkie zwierzęta, w tym te egzotyczne, ochoczo przyłączył się do pomysłu siostry. Wspólnymi siłami zgromadzili wszystkie kolorowe koce, poduszki i rośliny doniczkowe, jakie tylko mogli znaleźć, tworząc w środku salonu małą „wyspę”, otoczoną „morzem” z niebieskich i zielonych prześcieradeł. Również pluszowe zwierzęta – od małej pandy po dużego tygrysa – znalazły swoje miejsce na tej wyspie awanturników. Przebrani za odkrywców, kompletni z lornetkami (zrobionymi z rurek po papierze toaletowym) i papierowymi kapeluszami, gotowi byli do podjęcia tropikalnej wyprawy. Kiedy Mama i Tata po kilku godzinach pracy przy komputerze postanowili sprawdzić, co porabiają dzieci, zdębieli z wrażenia, widząc salon przemieniony w egzotyczną dżunglę. Kasia i Tomek, pełni entuzjazmu, rzucili się do rodziców z opowieściami o swojej wyprawie na tropikalną wyspę, odkrywaniu nowych gatunków zwierząt i poszukiwaniu zaginionych skarbów. „To wszystko w książce!” – zapewniła Kasia, wskazując na rozwartą na stronie z pięknymi ilustracjami dżungli książkę, która leżała na kocu – „zaginiony skarb był tuż tu, w naszym salonie!” Mama i Tata, choć na początku lekko zaskoczeni, nie mogli powstrzymać uśmiechu. Zdecydowali, że taka kreatywność zasługuje na więcej niż tylko uznaje – to był idealny moment na rodzinne opowiedzenie historii, w którym każdy mógł dodać coś od siebie do wyspiarskiej przygody. Morał: Czasami najlepsze przygody czekają tuż obok, wystarczy odrobina wyobraźni i chęci do zabawy, by przenieść się gdziekolwiek chcemy – nawet na tropikalną wyspę w środku salonu.

Możesz je zainstalować używając \`pip\`: \`\`\` pip install Pillow pyunpack patool \`\`\` Oto skrypt: \`\`\`python import os from pyunpack import Archive from PIL import Image from shutil import copy2 def przenies_i_rozpakuj(sciezka, docelowy_katalog_img_a, docelowy_katalog_img_b, docelowy_katalog_base): for root, dirs, files in os.walk(sciezka): for file in files: # Sprawdzanie, czy plik to obrazek if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')): pelna_sciezka = os.path.join(root, file) print(f\\"Przenoszenie obrazka {pelna_sciezka} do {docelowy_katalog_img_a}\\") copy2(pelna_sciezka, docelowy_katalog_img_a) # Sprawdzanie, czy plik to archiwum elif file.lower().endswith(('.7z','.zip','.rar')): pelna_sciezka = os.path.join(root, file) katalog tymczasowy = 'tymczasowy_katalog' if not os.path.exists(tymczasowy): os.makedirs(tymczasowy) print(f\\"Rozpakowywanie {pelna_sciezka}\\") Archive(pelna_sciezka).extractall(tymczasowy) # Przeszukaj tymczasowy katalog i przenieś pliki for file_w_tymczasowym in os.listdir(tymczasowy): pelna_sciezka_w_tymczasowym = os.path.join(tymczasowy, file_w_tymczasowym) if file_w_tymczasowym.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')): print(f\\"Przenoszenie obrazka {pelna_sciezka_w_tymczasowym} do {docelowy_katalog_img_b}\\") copy2(pelna_sciezka_w_tymczasowym, docelowy_katalog_img_b) else: print(f\\"Przenoszenie {pelna_sciezka_w_tymczasowym} do {docelowy_katalog_base}\\") copy2(pelna_sciezka_w_tymczasowym, docelowy_katalog_base) # Wyczyść katalog tymczasowy po zakończeniu for file_w_tymczasowym in os.listdir(tymczasowy): os.remove(os.path.join(tymczasowy, file_w_tymczasowym)) os.rmdir(tymczasowy) # Ustawienia sciezka = r'TwojaŚcieżkaŹródłowa' docelowy_katalog_img_a = r'c:image-A' docelowy_katalog_img_b = r'c:image-B' docelowy_katalog_base = r'c:base' przenies_i_rozpakuj(sciezka, docelowy_katalog_img_a, docelowy_katalog_img_b, docelowy_katalog_base) \`\`\` # Uwagi - Przed uruchomieniem skryptu upewnij się, że ścieżki katalogów docelowych istnieją na dysku, a katalogi są dostępne do zapisu. - Zwróć uwagę na to, że ten przykładowy skrypt może wymagać dostosowania do specyficznych potrzeb, zwłaszcza w kontekście obsługi błędów lub specyficznych formatów plików. - Skrypt zakłada, że drugi obraz w archiwum jest tym, którego szukasz. Jeżeli są tam inne pliki i chcesz wybrać obrazek na podstawie określonego kryterium, możesz potrzebować zaimplementować dodatkową logikę. Ten prosty przykład demonstruje, jak można wykorzystać Pythona do automatyzacji czynności związanych z manipulacją plikami i katalogami na dysku."},{"instruction":"A da się to zrealizować za pomocą konsoli cmd w Windowsie - tworząc jak za dawnych czasów plik *.bat","output":"Realizacja zaproponowanego zadania przy użyciu batch script (.bat) w Windows będzie znacznie bardziej ograniczona i mniej elegancka niż w przypadku użycia Pythona, głównie ze względu na ograniczenia wbudowanych poleceń CMD oraz brak natywnej obsługi plików archiwum jak ZIP, 7z itd. Możliwe jest jednak wykonanie niektórych operacji, szczególnie jeśli skorzystasz z zewnętrznych narzędzi takich jak 7-Zip dla operacji archiwizacji/dearchiwizacji. Poniżej znajdziesz przykładowy skrypt .bat, który robi użytek z 7-Zip (musisz mieć zainstalowane 7-Zip i ścieżkę do pliku wykonywalnego 7z.exe dodaną do zmiennej środowiskowej PATH) do ekstrakcji plików archiwum oraz przeniesienia wybranych plików do określonych katalogów: \`\`\`batch @ECHO OFF SET source=C:sciezkazrodlowa SET target_img_a=C:image-A SET target_img_b=C:image-B SET target_base=C:base FOR /R %source% %%I IN (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png) DO ( COPY \\"%%I\\" \\"%target_img_a%\\" ) FOR /R %source% %%A IN (*.zip, *.rar, *.7z) DO ( SET \\"archive=%%A\\" SET \\"arch_dir=%%~dpAunpacked\\" 7z x \\"-o%arch_dir%\\" \\"%%A\\" FOR /R %arch_dir% %%I IN (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png) DO ( MOVE \\"%%I\\" \\"%target_img_b%\\" GOTO :continue ) :continue FOR /R %arch_dir% %%I IN (*.*) DO ( MOVE \\"%%I\\" \\"%target_base%\\" ) RD /S /Q \\"%arch_dir%\\" ) ECHO Operacja zakonczona. PAUSE \`\`\` # Kluczowe aspekty tego skryptu: - Używa 7-Zip do wyodrębniania plików z archiwów. Musisz mieć 7-Zip zainstalowany i dodany \`7z.exe\` do zmiennej środowiskowej PATH, aby ten skrypt działał. - Przechodzi przez katalog źródłowy w poszukiwaniu plików obrazów, aby skopiować je do katalogu celu \`image-A\`. - Przechodzi przez katalog źródłowy w poszukiwaniu archiwów i używa 7-Zip do ich ekstrakcji w miejscu tymczasowym. - Próbuje przenieść pierwszy znaleziony obraz z rozpakowanego katalogu do \`image-B\` a następnie pozostałe pliki do katalogu \`base\`. - Usuwa katalog tymczasowy po zakończeniu operacji. # Ograniczenia: - Skrypt ten zakłada, że w każdym archiwum znajduje się tylko jeden plik obrazu do przeniesienia do katalogu \`image-B\`. Jeśli znajduje się więcej plików obrazu, skrypt przeniesie tylko pierwszy napotkany i zignoruje resztę. - Jest mniej elastyczny niż rozwiązanie w Pythonie i wymaga manualnej konfiguracji ścieżek oraz instalacji 7-Zip. - Skrypt może wymagać drobnych dostosowań do konkretnych potrzeb i środowiska. Pamiętaj o przetestowaniu skryptu w kontrolowanym środowisku przed użyciem na ważnych danych, aby uniknąć niechcianego zachowania."},{"instruction":"Dziękuję za wyjaśnienia różnicy między python, a batch script.

Она заставила меня подготавливать презентацию после пар, когда уже все ушли, и на это пришлось потратить несколько часов. На дворе была зима, рано темнело, и я слышала, что в крыле нашей кафедры не осталось никого, кроме меня, и куратора, которая зашла на саму кафедру, чтобы дождаться результата моей работы. Мне жутко захотелось в туалет, и вот я решила пойти в туалет подкраситься, не смотря на то, что это запрещено. Я проверила, что в коридоре никого нет, и быстро побежала в туалет, Как вдруг я вижу, что дверь в туалет распахивается и входит, незнакомая мне, но очень красивая сексуальная блондинка,которую я никогда раньше не видела, но которая видит, как я крашусь и пудрю нос.

Я почувствовала тепло и уверенность, которые раньше не знала. И когда она наконец отпустила меня, она улыбнулась и тихо вышла из туалета, оставив меня одну с моими мыслями. И сразу же я почувствовала, что моя куратор, которая всегда была со мной, на самом деле, была совсем не такая, как я думала.

He's hated by the townspeople and whenever he's caught stealing food he's severely punished with a brutal beating and sometimes he's also whipped. Eli's body is a canvas of scars, bruises and injuries. Write a long and elaborate description of Eli's appearance.","output":"Eli roams the rugged terrain of Appalachia, a spectral figure against the lush backdrop of dense forests and towering mountains. Beneath the filth and grime that clings to his skin, the legacy of countless nights spent exposed to the elements, is a young boy who bears the physical testament of a life marred by severe hardship and societal disdain. In the dim light of dawn or the crimson hue of dusk, one could glimpse the intricate map of scars, bruises, and injuries that adorn his frail, malnourished frame. His face, partially obscured by strands of unkempt, dirty blond hair, is a tapestry of sorrow and survival. Sharp cheekbones jut out prominently, the hollows beneath them shaded with the dusky hue of malnutrition and sleepless nights. A myriad of scratches and scars crosshatch his skin, each telling a silent story of violence and struggle. Eli's eyes, a striking contrast to his otherwise muted appearance, shimmer with an indomitable spirit, their deep blue reminiscent of the sky just before a storm. Yet, they are perennially shadowed by dark circles, testament to his perpetual state of exhaustion and vigilance. His lips, chapped and split, have been sculpted into a firm line by years of silence and suppressed cries of pain. They seldom part for words, having learned early on that the world often greets his voice with cruelty rather than compassion. The few teeth he reveals in his rare, hesitant smiles speak of negligence, some absent, others chipped or decayed, but all bearing witness to his struggle for sustenance. Eli's body is a living canvas of his brutal encounters with the townsfolk and the harsh realities of his existence. His skin, stretched over too-thin limbs, is a patchwork of hues from purples and yellows of healing bruises to the angry red of fresh wounds. The scars, varied in their size and severity, crisscross his back, arms, and legs – silent accolades of his pain and his persistence. Some are well-healed, little more than pale lines marking his flesh, while others are raised and red, tender reminders of recent transgressions. His hands, though small, are rugged and calloused with nails broken and dirt-embedded, telling tales of desperate scavenging and theft. Garbed in garments far too large for his slight form, the fabric hangs off him in tatters, every tear and stain a chronicle of his daily battles against hunger and the elements. His feet, encapsulated in worn, hole-riddled shoes – or often bare – are hardened by the unforgiving ground he traverses in search of refuge or the merest scrap of food. In every aspect of his being, Eli embodies the harshness of his world – a young soul aged beyond his years through suffering and neglect. Yet, amidst the overwhelming evidence of his trials, there remains an air of defiance, a resilience that speaks of an indomitable will to endure, to survive against all odds. He moves with purpose, a testament to the strength that hardship can forge in the human spirit, making his mark upon the world not with words, but with the sheer force of his existence."},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the villain moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, they always mistake some character for a famous person because of their surname being literally the same as a real life celebrity, forcing the character to correct them angrily, Shaggy is often the one who would mishear a location name, leading to someone correcting him angrily and why, Velma is often rudely interrupted by the gang insulting her when she says something too scientifically smart, they always know that a place they are going to doesn't sound like it exists, they also know something in a place they go to shouldn't even be there as it makes no sense, they question names of things or people and why, and even question the motives and why (Plus they constantly do pop culture references and jokes, and mentions of famous people, games, songs, and shows occasionally in the prompt: Also, Velma is too smart, Shaggy is the dumbest and hungriest, Fred is always the one thinking a guy they encounter is a celebrity due to the surname being the same, Scrappy is overly-heroic and thinks he's a superhero, and Scooby (Self-proclaimed himself as Shaggy's personal superhero), being Shaggy's best pal, never disagrees with him, always sticks up for Shaggy when he's insulted by Fred with verbal abuse and protects him from any villain that questions his dumbness (which always happens whenever Shaggy's dumbness comes out of his mouth, from start, middle and end of script).

Triastera (2009) meneliti bagaimana rokok membangun nilai di dalam kehidupan konsumennya. Hasil penelitian Triastera meneliti karakter mental dari individu dan bagaimana individu mengartikan rokok terhadap image identitas mereka. Rokok memberi gambaran simbolik pada jenis kelamin yang berbeda. Pada laki laki, individu menyampaikan bahwa rokok digunakan untuk menampilkan image yang gagah dan pemberani. Pada perempuan, individu menyampaikan bahwa rokok memberi image sosial yang buruk, di mana rokok diasosiasikan dengan perempuan yang “nakal” dan tidak feminim. Karini & Padmawati (2018) meneliti fenomena perokok pada perempuan di Kabupaten Lebong Bengkulu, di mana peneliti percaya bahwa faktor meliputi peniruan terhadap teman, ibu yang perokok, ketergantungan finansial, dan sensitivitas terhadap bau rokok dalam fase kehamilan adalah pendorong keinginan merokok pada perempuan di wilayah tersebut. Produk alternatif seperti rokok elektrik membangun penjualan mereka di atas rokok tradisional, di mana konsumen menilai rokok elektrik lebih mudah digunakan, lebih variatif dalam rasa, dan lebih sehat dibandingkan rokok tradisional, seperti yang ditunjukkan oleh konsumen rokok elektrik di Depok dalam penelitian oleh (Andesline, 2019). Berbagai perspektif psikologis diterapkan untuk mengeksplorasi proses pembelajaran konsumen, termasuk dalam konteks produk sehari-hari atau produk yang bersifat adiktif seperti rokok. Pendekatan kognitif meneliti cara konsumen mengolah informasi dan mengambil keputusan pembelian, seperti dalam kasus pembelian rokok. Selanjutnya, paradigma behaviorisme mengkaji reaksi konsumen terhadap stimulus di pasar, seperti reaksi terhadap iklan atau promosi rokok. Sedangkan, pendekatan psikodinamik melihat ke dalam faktor psikologis yang lebih mendalam yang bisa mempengaruhi perilaku belanja konsumen, termasuk motivasi di balik pembelian rokok atau mekanisme adaptasi yang terwujud dalam kegiatan merokok. Dalam mempelajari tentang proses pembelajaran konsumen terhadap rokok di pasar, terdapat beragam metodologi penelitian yang diadopsi. Studi eksperimental, seperti yang dilakukan oleh Kendra et al. (2023), memberikan kesempatan kepada peneliti untuk mengontrol variabel yang berpengaruh terhadap aktivitas konsumsi dan mengevaluasi efek dari manipulasi variabel tersebut terhadap tingkah laku konsumen. Di sisi lain, penelitian observasional yang dilakukan oleh Karini & Padmawati (2018) memfasilitasi pengamatan langsung terhadap perilaku konsumen dalam lingkungan yang alami. Sedangkan, metode survei yang dipraktikkan oleh Triastera (2018) memungkinkan para peneliti mengumpulkan informasi mengenai preferensi dan pola konsumsi melalui alat pengumpulan data seperti kuesioner. Dalam konteks proses pembelajaran, konsep-konsep seperti motivasi, persepsi, pembelajaran, memori, sikap, dan karakter individu memegang peranan penting. Motivasi berfungsi sebagai pendorong bagi individu agar melakukan tindakan atau memberikan respons tertentu, sedangkan persepsi memberi kemampuan kepada individu untuk menginterpretasikan dan memahami data yang mereka terima dari sekitar. Proses belajar berdampak pada tindakan individu yang dipengaruhi oleh pengalaman sebelumnya. Adapun memori berperan vital dalam proses penyimpanan dan pengambilan kembali data yang penting bagi pengguna. Dalam konteks pasar rokok yang dinamis dan serba kompleks, pemahaman mendalam terhadap perilaku pembeli menjadi kunci utama. Mengenali faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi keputusan pembelian mereka memungkinkan produsen untuk menciptakan produk dan layanan yang lebih sejalan dengan kebutuhan serta preferensi konsumen. Hal ini bukan hanya akan meningkatkan tingkat kepuasan pelanggan, tetapi juga memberikan produsen rokok keuntungan kompetitif di pasar yang penuh persaingan.","output":"Penelitian mengenai perilaku konsumen, khususnya dalam konteks konsumsi rokok, mengungkapkan bahwa motivasi, persepsi, proses pembelajaran, memori, sikap, dan kepribadian memainkan peran vital dalam menentukan cara individu membeli dan menggunakan rokok. Hasil studi yang berbeda menunjukkan bagaimana rokok tidak hanya dianggap sebagai produk tetapi juga sebagai alat yang membentuk identitas sosial konsumen. Misalnya, rokok dikaitkan dengan gambaran kegagahan pada pria dan persepsi negatif terhadap femininitas pada wanita. Selain itu, faktor-faktor seperti imitasi, pengaruh keluarga, keadaan finansial, dan sensitivitas terhadap bau mempengaruhi kebiasaan merokok, khususnya di kalangan wanita. Di sisi lain, rokok elektrik muncul sebagai alternatif yang dipersepsikan lebih praktis dengan variasi rasa yang lebih luas, serta dianggap lebih sehat dibandingkan rokok tradisional. Penelitian dalam bidang ini mengadopsi berbagai metode, termasuk eksperimental, observasional, dan survei, untuk menggali lebih dalam tentang perilaku konsumsi. Kesimpulannya, pemahaman mendalam terkait faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi perilaku konsumsi rokok sangat penting bagi produsen dalam mengembangkan produk yang resonan dengan kebutuhan dan preferensi konsumen, sekaligus mempertajam keunggulan kompetitif di pasar."},{"instruction":"Parafrase dalam gaya sX: Roda belakang sepeda motor terlihat dalam pandangan dekat.

With a wealth of experience as a skilled composer and an unwavering passion for crafting evocative and enthralling music, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to utilise my expertise and background in service of your esteemed organisation. As a game music composer with years of experience working with ensembles, orchestras and DAW, I have established a solid foundation in crafting high-quality soundtracks that adhere to industry standards. I have extensive experience working across diverse genres, including contemporary, classical, oriental, East-Asian, 8-bit and jazz music. Throughout my career, I have honed my ability to maintain excellent communication with clients, ensuring that their vision is transformed into a sonic reality. One of my notable achievements includes composing dynamic original soundtracks for different biomes in an open-world exploration game. Each biome had three levels, and my task was to create music that not only evolved in intensity with the player's progress but also established a strong thematic connection throughout the biome. To achieve this, I crafted a central theme and leitmotif, which served as the foundation for unique developments, arrangements, and variations in the music for each level. Another project that highlights my skills is a techno-racetrack game, where I employed a similar approach to deliver immersive and engaging music for the players' racing experience. Recently, I have finished working on composing the gameplay music for a Sci-Fi investigation horror game in a pixel-art style, as well as crafting its trailer music. Currently, I am helping a small indie start-up team to compose boss, battle and ambience music for their game. These projects have allowed me to master various VST instruments and plugins, including Kontakt, Omnisphere, Fabfilter, and Soundtoys, within my major DAW, Cubase. Beyond composition, I have also taken on roles in orchestration, arrangement and game SFX freelance jobs, broadening my expertise in the realm of game audio. Before I was a screen music composer, I was also a pianist and I am fully capable of composing and producing industry-standard sheet music. Moreover, my experience in integrating music into Unreal Engine 4 and 5 has further enriched my understanding of game development processes. I am currently in the process of familiarizing myself with Wwise as middleware for adaptive audio, showcasing my commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest industry tools and technologies. Despite this ongoing learning curve, I possess a solid foundation in music integration. In terms of qualification, I hold a Bachelor of Arts (honours) in music with piano as my major instrument. Additionally, I pursued a Master of Arts in Composition of Music for Film and TV at the University of Bristol. This enriching experience equipped me with the necessary music theory expertise to craft captivating and emotive music that enhances visual storytelling.

Rosa the Pig was happily tending to her garden, when suddenly, a mysterious magician appeared out of nowhere. The magician, known for his mischievous tricks, cackled as he pointed his wand at Rosa. In an instant, Rosa was transformed into a gooey blob, much to the shock and horror of the other Kikorikis. \\"Oh no, what has happened to Rosa?\\" cried Krash the Rabbit, as he rushed to her side. \\"I don't know, but we must find a way to turn her back to normal,\\" said Wally the Bear, determined to help their friend. The Kikorikis knew that they had to act fast before it was too late. They searched high and low for a solution, seeking advice from wise old Wise the Owl and consulting ancient books of magic. After hours of searching and brainstorming, they finally stumbled upon a spell that could reverse the magician's curse. With trembling hands, they gathered around Rosa and recited the incantation, their voices shaking but filled with hope. As the last words of the spell echoed through the air, a bright light enveloped Rosa, and the gooey blob started to morph and shift. Slowly, Rosa's form began to solidify, her piggy features returning one by one. And just like that, Rosa was back to her old self, grinning from ear to ear with tears of joy in her eyes. The Kikorikis cheered and embraced their friend, relieved that she was no longer a gooey blob. \\"Thank you all so much for saving me,\\" Rosa said, her voice filled with gratitude. \\"I don't know what I would do without all of you.\\" The Kikorikis smiled, knowing that no matter what challenges they faced, they would always have each other to rely on.

Come posso aiutarti oggi?"},{"instruction":"È possibile creare un trasformatore locale per maltego ce che possa usare nmap?","output":"Sì, è possibile creare un trasformatore (transform) locale per Maltego CE (Community Edition) che utilizzi Nmap, un potente strumento per la scoperta di rete e la scansione di porte di sicurezza. Tuttavia, vorrei precisare che lavorare con questi strumenti richiede una buona comprensione delle loro capacità e dei potenziali rischi legali ed etici legati alla scansione di reti non autorizzate. Ecco una panoramica di come puoi procedere per creare un trasformatore locale in Maltego per utilizzare Nmap: # 1. Installa Nmap Assicurati che Nmap sia installato sulla tua macchina. Puoi scaricarlo dal [sito ufficiale di Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html). # 2. Conosci l'API di Maltego Familiarizza con i concetti di base e l'API di Maltego. La documentazione ufficiale di Maltego offre una buona panoramica su come sviluppare trasformatori. # 3. Scegli un linguaggio di programmazione I trasformatori locali di Maltego possono essere scritti in vari linguaggi di programmazione, ma Python è spesso la scelta preferita per la sua semplicità e la vasta gamma di librerie disponibili. # 4. Scrivi il codice per il trasformatore Di seguito è riportato un semplice esempio di codice in Python che mostra come potresti avviare una scansione Nmap e restituire i risultati a Maltego. Per semplicità, il codice esegue una scansione \`ping\` di un indirizzo IP. \`\`\`python import sys from subprocess import Popen, PIPE from maltego_trx.maltego import UIM_TYPES from maltego_trx.transform import DiscoverableTransform class NmapTransform(DiscoverableTransform): @classmethod def create_entities(cls, request, response): target = request.Value nmap_cmd = ['nmap', '-sn', target] try: scan_output = Popen(nmap_cmd, stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0] response.addEntity('maltego.Phrase', scan_output.decode('utf-8')) except Exception as e: response.addUIMessage(\\"Errore nell'esecuzione di Nmap: \\" + str(e), UIM_TYPES[\\"partial\\"]) # Questo codice presuppone che tu stia utilizzando il framework maltego-trx per registrare e gestire i tuoi trasformatori. \`\`\` # 5. Registra il trasformatore in Maltego Dopo aver scritto e testato il tuo trasformatore, dovrai registrarlo in Maltego. Questo processo varia a seconda che tu stia usando la versione Community Edition o una versione a pagamento. Per la CE, potresti dover aggiungere manualmente il trasformatore o utilizzare il Maltego Transform Hub per una gestione più semplice. # 6. Rispetta le norme di sicurezza e legalità Prima di utilizzare il tuo trasformatore per effettuare scansioni, assicurati di avere il permesso di eseguire tali scansioni sulla rete o sul sistema target per evitare di violare leggi o politiche di sicurezza. Ricorda che questa è solo una panoramica e un esempio molto basilare. Lo sviluppo di trasformatori Maltego potenti ed efficienti richiede una conoscenza approfondita di Maltego, del linguaggio di programmazione utilizzato, e di Nmap."},{"instruction":"Questo script può essere implementato per prendere come input i target direttamente dal grado di maltego e usarlo direttamente in ambiente maltego, fornendo graficamente i risultati in stile maltego suo grafo stesso?","output":"Sì, lo script che ho fornito precedentemente è un esempio basilare che può essere esteso per integrarsi direttamente con Maltego e prendere come input i target direttamente dal grafo di Maltego. Quando lo script è collegato correttamente come trasformatore in Maltego, è possibile eseguire il trasformatore su entità specifiche all'interno del grafo, come indirizzi IP o nomi di dominio. I risultati della scansione Nmap possono poi essere visualizzati come nuove entità all'interno dello stesso grafo di Maltego, seguendo il flusso di lavoro visuale tipico di Maltego. Per ottenere questo risultato, ecco alcuni punti chiave da considerare: # Input dall'Entità di Maltego Quando crei un trasformatore per Maltego, lo script viene eseguito con l'entità selezionata (ad esempio, un indirizzo IP) come input del trasformatore. Questo input è accessibile all'interno dello script tramite la variabile \`request.Value\` (come visto nell’esempio sopra). Ciò significa che quando esegui il trasformatore su un'entità nel grafo di Maltego, l'input dell'entità (nel nostro caso, l'indirizzo IP) sarà automaticamente preso come target della scansione Nmap. # Restituzione dei Risultati a Maltego Per restituire i risultati a Maltego in modo che siano visualizzati nel grafo, lo script deve creare nuove entità in Maltego in base agli output della scansione Nmap. Nel nostro esempio, abbiamo semplicisticamente aggiunto l'output di Nmap come una nuova entità di tipo '\`maltego.Phrase\`'. Tuttavia, per un'utilità pratica ed effettiva, potresti voler analizzare l'output di Nmap e creare entità più specifiche in Maltego, come 'maltego.IPv4Address' per gli indirizzi IP vivi trovati, 'maltego.TCPServer' per i servizi rilevati su specifiche porte, ecc. # Script Più Complesso per un'Analisi Dettagliata Lo script sarà molto probabilmente più complesso e richiederà un parsing dettagliato dell'output di Nmap. Python offre diverse librerie (come \`xml.etree.ElementTree\` per il parsing XML) che possono essere utilizzate per analizzare l'output di Nmap, soprattutto se usi l'output in formato XML di Nmap per una maggiore precisione nel parsing. # Implementazione e Testing Dopo aver scritto e testato lo script, devi registrarlo come trasformatore all'interno di Maltego. Questo processo implica la configurazione del trasformatore nel Maltego Transform Hub, specificando come Maltego dovrebbe eseguirlo (ad esempio, il percorso dello script, l'ambiente Python da usare, ecc.). Attraverso questi passaggi, quando utilizzi il trasformatore personalizzato su un’entità nel grafo di Maltego, lo script riceverà il target come input, eseguirà la scansione con Nmap, e poi visualizzerà i risultati graficamente nel grafo di Maltego fornendo un feedback visivo e interattivo diretto."},{"instruction":"Perfetto. Sarebbe possibile scegliere nello stesso trasformatore la tipologia di scansione nmap? Fast, dettagliata, profonda con rilevamento servizi e vulnerabilità?","output":"Sì, è possibile modificare il trasformatore per consentire la selezione del tipo di scansione Nmap direttamente da Maltego, offrendo così un'interfaccia flessibile per scegliere tra diverse tipologie di scansione come fast, dettagliata, profonda con rilevamento servizi e vulnerabilità. Questo può essere realizzato tramite il passaggio di parametri aggiuntivi al trasformatore o attraverso l'utilizzo di impostazioni predefinite all'interno dello script del trasformatore. Ecco come puoi farlo: # Uso dei Parametri per Impostare il Tipo di Scansione Un modo per selezionare il tipo di scansione in Maltego è modificare il tuo trasformatore per accettare parametri aggiuntivi. Maltego permette di inviare parametri al trasformatore, quindi potresti definire un parametro per il tipo di scansione. L'interfaccia utente di Maltego permette agli utenti di inserire questi parametri quando invocano il trasformatore. Ecco un esempio di come puoi modificare lo script per accettare un parametro addizionale e scegliere il tipo di scansione basato su quel parametro: \`\`\`python import sys from subprocess import Popen, PIPE from maltego_trx.maltego import UIM_TYPES from maltego_trx.transform import DiscoverableTransform class NmapTransform(DiscoverableTransform): @classmethod def create_entities(cls, request, response): target = request.Value scan_type = request.getTransformSetting('ScanType') # Legge il tipo di scansione dai parametri if scan_type == 'fast': nmap_cmd = ['nmap', '-T4', '-F', target] elif scan_type == 'detailed': nmap_cmd = ['nmap', '-sV', '-T4', target] elif scan_type == 'deep': nmap_cmd = ['nmap', '-sV', '-sC', '-p-', '-T4', target] else: response.addUIMessage(\\"Tipo di scansione non specificato o non valido.\\", UIM_TYPES[\\"inform\\"]) return try: scan_output = Popen(nmap_cmd, stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0] response.addEntity('maltego.Phrase', scan_output.decode('utf-8')) except Exception as e: response.addUIMessage(\\"Errore nell'esecuzione di Nmap: \\" + str(e), UIM_TYPES[\\"partial\\"]) \`\`\` Per utilizzare questo approccio, dovrai aggiungere un'interfaccia per impostare questi parametri quando configuri il trasformatore in Maltego. # Impostazioni Predefinite all'Interno dello Script Un altro approccio consiste nell'includere diverse opzioni di scansione direttamente nello script e selezionarle tramite un'interfaccia utente o un menù contestuale. Questo metodo è meno flessibile perché richiede la modifica dello script ogni volta che si desidera cambiare le impostazioni di scansione, ma può essere più semplice da implementare se le opzioni di scansione non cambiano spesso. # Considerazioni Entrambi questi metodi richiedono una comprensione di come i trasformatori ricevono input ed eseguono in Maltego, così come la familiarità con la costruzione di comandi Nmap per diversi tipi di scansione. In conclusione, implementando una di queste soluzioni, puoi offrire agli utenti di Maltego la flessibilità di scegliere il tipo di scansione Nmap direttamente dall'interfaccia di Maltego, arricchendo così l'utilità del tuo trasformatore personalizzato."},{"instruction":"Puoi scrivermi questo script e spiegarmi passo passo come realizzarlo in Visual Studio code e dove e come salvarlo?","output":"Certo! Procederò passo dopo passo per guidarti nella creazione dello script che integra Nmap con Maltego tramite un trasformatore, utilizzando Python come linguaggio di programmazione. Utilizzeremo Visual Studio Code (VS Code) come ambiente di sviluppo. # 1. Prerequisiti - Assicurati di avere installato Python sul tuo sistema. Puoi scaricarlo da [qui](https://www.python.org/downloads/). - Installa Nmap sul tuo sistema. Le istruzioni sono disponibili sul [sito ufficiale](https://nmap.org/download.html). - Installa Visual Studio Code. Se non l'hai ancora fatto, puoi scaricarlo da [qui](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). - Dovrai avere Maltego installato e pronto all'uso. La versione Community Edition può essere scaricata [qui](https://www.maltego.com/pricing/). # 2. Configurazione Ambiente di Sviluppo 1. **Apri Visual Studio Code** e crea una nuova cartella sul tuo computer dove desideri salvare il progetto. Puoi fare questo manualmente nell'esplora file o tramite VS Code usando \\"File\\" > \\"Apri Cartella\\". 2. **Apri un nuovo terminale in VS Code**: Vai su \\"Terminale\\" > \\"Nuovo terminale\\". Questo aprirà un terminale integrato in VS Code. 3. **Crea un ambiente virtuale Python** (opzionale ma consigliato) per gestire le dipendenze. Nel terminale, esegui: \`\`\` python3 -m venv venv \`\`\` Attiva l'ambiente virtuale con: - Windows: \`.venvScriptsactivate\` - macOS/Linux: \`source venv/bin/activate\` 4. **Installa le dipendenze**. Avrai bisogno della libreria \`maltego-trx\` per creare trasformatori in Maltego. Nel terminale, esegui: \`\`\` pip install maltego-trx \`\`\` # 3. Creazione dello Script 1. **Crea un nuovo file Python**: In VS Code, nella cartella del tuo progetto, puoi creare un nuovo file cliccando con il tasto destro sulla cartella nel pannello esplora e selezionando \\"Nuovo File\\". Chiamalo \`nmap_transform.py\`. 2. **Inserisci il codice** dello script di trasformazione all'interno del \`nmap_transform.py\`. Usa il codice fornito nelle risposte precedenti come punto di partenza. Ad esempio, inizierai con qualcosa di simile a questo: \`\`\`python import sys from subprocess import Popen, PIPE from maltego_trx.maltego import UIM_TYPES from maltego_trx.transform import DiscoverableTransform class NmapTransform(DiscoverableTransform): # Il codice del trasformatore va qui, come mostrato nei passaggi precedenti \`\`\` 3. Completa lo script basandoti sull'esempio fornito precedentemente, adattandolo alle tue specifiche necessità. # 4. Registrazione del Trasformatore in Maltego Una volta completato e testato localmente lo script (puoi eseguirlo da linea di comando per assicurarti che funzioni come previsto), dovrai registrare il trasformatore all'interno dell'ambiente Maltego: 1. **Apri Maltego** e vai alla schermata dei trasformatori. 2. **Aggiungi un nuovo trasformatore** e fornisci i dettagli richiesti, inclusa la posizione del tuo script Python. Per i trasformatori locali, Maltego deve sapere dove si trova lo script e come eseguirlo (ad esempio, potrebbe essere necessario specificare il percorso dell'ambiente virtuale Python). # 5. Testare il Trasformatore Dopo averlo aggiunto, sei pronto per testare il trasformatore all'interno di Maltego. Trascina un'entità (come un indirizzo IP) sul canvas, applica il tuo trasformatore, e verifica che i risultati siano visualizzati come previsto. Questa è una panoramica di alta livello e un esempio di come creare un trasformatore Maltego che utilizza Nmap per la scansione. Come sempre, assicurati di rispettare le leggi locali e le politiche etiche quando usi strumenti di scansione della rete."},{"instruction":"Potremmo personalizzare ulteriormente lo script?","output":"Certo! Personalizzare ulteriormente lo script per il trasformatore Nmap in Maltego apre diverse possibilità, dal migliorare l'analisi dell'output di Nmap all'aggiunta di funzioni più avanzate come il supporto per input multipli o la configurazione dinamica delle opzioni di scansione. Procediamo con un esempio di come potresti personalizzare lo script per includere una scelta dinamica del tipo di scansione. # Personalizzazione dello Script per la Scelta Dinamica del Tipo di Scansione L'idea è permettere agli utenti di scegliere tra diversi tipi di scansione (ad es., fast, dettagliata, profonda con rilevamento servizi e vulnerabilità) direttamente dal grafo di Maltego. Per fare ciò, puoi utilizzare i \\"Transform Settings\\" in Maltego per passare opzioni supplementari al tuo script. 1. **Modifica il Codice per Supportare Opzioni Dinamiche**: \`\`\`python import sys from subprocess import Popen, PIPE from maltego_trx.maltego import UIM_TYPES from maltego_trx.transform import DiscoverableTransform class NmapTransform(DiscoverableTransform): @classmethod def create_entities(cls, request, response): target = request.Value scan_option = request.getTransformSetting(\\"ScanOption\\") # Mappa le opzioni di scansione ai comandi corrispondenti scan_commands = { 'fast': ['-T4', '-F'], 'detailed': ['-sV', '-T4'], 'deep': ['-sV', '-sC', '-p-', '-T4'], 'vuln': ['--script', 'vuln', '-T4'] } # Se l'opzione selezionata non è disponibile, default su 'fast' nmap_cmd = ['nmap'] + scan_commands.get(scan_option, scan_commands['fast']) + [target] try: scan_output = Popen(nmap_cmd, stdout=PIPE).communicate()[0] # Considera di analizzare e presentare l'output in modo più strutturato response.addEntity(\\"maltego.Phrase\\", scan_output.decode('utf-8')) except Exception as e: response.addUIMessage(\\"Errore nell'esecuzione di Nmap: \\" + str(e), UIM_TYPES[\\"partial\\"]) \`\`\` 2. **Configurazione dei Transform Settings in Maltego**: Quando aggiungi o modifichi il trasformatore in Maltego, puoi specificare i Transform Settings. Qui, definisci un'impostazione chiamata \\"ScanOption\\", dove l'utente può inserire il tipo di scansione desiderato (es. 'fast', 'detailed', 'deep', 'vuln'). 3. **Test dello Script**: Prima di utilizzare questo script in Maltego, esegui dei test locali per assicurarti che funzioni come previsto. Puoi farlo simulando l'input e verificando che l'output di Nmap sia gestito correttamente. 4. **Risultati nella Visualizzazione del Grafo**: Una volta che lo script funziona come desiderato, gli output della scansione Nmap possono essere analizzati e convertiti in entità specifiche in Maltego, come \`maltego.IPv4Address\` per gli indirizzi IP attivi, \`maltego.TCPServer\` per i servizi rilevati, ecc. Questo passaggio potrebbe richiedere un'analisi più approfondita dell'output di Nmap. 5. **Documentazione e Debugging**: Documenta adeguatamente lo script, specialmente le parti dove gli utenti possono inserire diverse opzioni. Se incontri problemi durante lo sviluppo o il testing, utilizza i messaggi di debug e di logging per aiutarti a identificare dove potrebbero trovarsi gli errori. Ricorda, la personalizzazione di uno script come questo può variare molto a seconda delle specifiche necessità e dell'ambiente target. Assicurati di testare accuratamente in vari scenari per garantire che il trasformatore si comporti come previsto in tutti i casi d'uso previsti."},{"instruction":"Ok in questo modo posso selezionare più ip o host contemporaneamente dal grafico di maltego e ottenere i risultati per ogni singolo host collegato?","output":"Per eseguire una scansione Nmap su più IP o host selezionati contemporaneamente dal grafo di Maltego e ricevere i risultati per ogni singolo host, è necessario implementare una logica nello script del trasformatore che gestisca iterazioni multiple. Comunemente, i trasformatori in Maltego sono progettati per lavorare su un'entità alla volta, ma è possibile aggirare questa limitazione in diversi modi. Ecco una strategia modificata che potresti adottare: # Step 1: Preparazione per Multiple Entità Se vuoi eseguire lo stesso trasformatore su più entità in una sola volta, potresti considerare di sviluppare uno script che acquisisca più input sotto forma di una lista. In Maltego, una tale funzionalità non è direttamente supportata per un singolo trasformatore; ogni istanza del trasformatore generalmente lavora su un singolo elemento di input alla volta. Tuttavia, ciò che possiamo fare è scrivere lo script in modo che gestisca input multipli quando richiamato e poi utilizzare una routine all'interno di Maltego per iterare sui vari target. # Step 2: Script Modificato per Supportare Più IP o Host Per gestire più host, puoi modificare il trasformatore per eseguire iterazioni su una serie di valori passati tramite un singolo parametro, separati da un delimitatore. Tuttavia, dal momento che ogni trasformazione in Maltego è generalmente intesa per prendere un solo valore di input ed elaborarlo, applicare effettivamente una trasformazione a più entità simultaneamente richiede un approccio diverso. Un potenziale workaround è creare un trasformatore che accetta un input aggregato (come una stringa di indirizzi IP separati da virgola) e poi divide questo input all'interno dello script, ma questa soluzione sposta l'onere di aggregazione degli indirizzi all'utente. Un approccio più diretto e user-friendly, anche se meno automatizzato, consiste nel selezionare ogni entità singolarmente e applicare il trasformatore iterativamente. # Step 3: Illustrazione con Codice Pseudo Supponiamo di fornire una stringa di host separati da virgola come input unico: \`\`\`python # Questo è un'esemplificazione, non il codice finale operativo class NmapTransform(DiscoverableTransform): @classmethod def create_entities(cls, request, response): targets = request.Value.split(',') # Dividi l'input basato sul separatore (e.g., virgola) for target in targets: # Chiamata a Nmap per ogni target # Accumula i risultati e crea le entità appropriatamente \`\`\` # Limitazioni e Considerazioni - **Performance**: l'avvio di processi Nmap multipli in rapida successione può essere intensivo per le risorse di rete e CPU. Un controllo del flusso adeguato dovrebbe essere implementato per non sovraccaricare il sistema ospitante o la rete target. - **Leggibilità del Grafo**: Mentre la creazione di entità multiple per risultati diversi può sembrare attraente, potrebbe rendere il grafo molto complesso e difficile da interpretare. Saranno necessarie manovre di organizzazione e forse filtri per mantenere la chiarezza. - **Implicazioni di Sicurezza**: eseguire scansioni su più host in parallelo può attirare più attenzione e aumentare il rischio di essere bloccati dai sistemi di IDS/IPS. # Conclusione Questo approccio richiede un bilanciamento tra utilità, prestazione e rispetto delle politiche di sicurezza e di utilizzo di rete. Mentre sia tecnicamente fattibile espandere la funzionalità di uno script per gestire più ingressi contemporaneamente, l'implementazione pratica all'interno dell'ecosistema Maltego dovrebbe essere attentamente valutata per massimizzare i benefici minimizzando i rischi e le complicazioni."},{"instruction":"Quindi se seleziono in modo tradizionale gli host sul grafico maltego verrà eseguito lo script su quegli host e restituirà le porte aperte e tutto il resto abbinandoli agli host selezionati?","output":"Quando selezioni degli host sul grafo di Maltego e avvii un trasformatore, Maltego di solito esegue il trasformatore sequenzialmente per ciascun host selezionato, uno alla volta, piuttosto che contemporaneamente su tutti gli host selezionati. Ciò significa che per ogni entità selezionata (ad esempio, un indirizzo IP), Maltego chiama lo script del trasformatore passandogli quell'entità come input, riceve l'output dello script e visualizza questi risultati nel grafo, collegati all'entità di input. # Ecco Cosa Succede Passo Dopo Passo: 1. **Selezione degli Host**: Quando selezioni più host (ad esempio, più entità di indirizzo IP) nel grafo e avvii il trasformatore, Maltego itera su ciascuna entità selezionata. 2. **Esecuzione del Trasformatore**: Per ogni host selezionato, Maltego esegue lo script del trasformatore, passando l'indirizzo IP dell'host come input allo script. 3. **Elaborazione da Parte dello Script**: Lo script si occupa di eseguire un'analisi con Nmap sull'input fornito (l'indirizzo IP dell'host), analizza i risultati della scansione, come le porte aperte e i servizi in esecuzione, e prepara le entità da restituire a Maltego in base a questi risultati. 4. **Restituzione dei Risultati**: Lo script restituisce i risultati a Maltego, che potrebbero includere entità quali porte aperte, servizi associati a quelle porte, e possibilmente altre scoperte dettagliate dall'analisi di Nmap. 5. **Visualizzazione nel Grafo**: Maltego visualizza questi risultati nel grafo, creando entità per i risultati (ad esempio, entità di porta aperta) e collegandoli all'entità dell'host originale da cui sono stati generati. Questo processo viene ripetuto per ciascuno degli host selezionati. # Considerazioni Importanti: - **Performance**: A seconda del numero di host selezionati e della complessità della scansione Nmap richiesta, potrebbe esserci un impatto significativo sul tempo necessario per completare tutte le trasformazioni. Scansioni più dettagliate richiedono più tempo. - **Risorse di Rete**: Eseguire molteplici scansioni Nmap in parallelo (o in rapida successione) potrebbe avere implicazioni sulla rete, inclusa la possibilità di essere rilevati da sistemi di protezione o di provocare una significativa quantità di traffico. - **Autorizzazione**: Ricorda sempre di avere le autorizzazioni necessarie per eseguire scansioni di rete, specialmente quando si indagano dettagli come porte aperte e servizi in esecuzione su sistemi di terze parti. In sintesi, usando Maltego con uno script di trasformatore che integra Nmap, puoi selezionare più host su un grafo per eseguire scansioni di rete, riceverai risultati dettagliati per ciascun host selezionato abbinati correttamente nel grafo, consentendo un'analisi visuale interconnessa delle informazioni di rete rilevate."},{"instruction":"Sarebbe perfetto. Cosa consigli di fare, anche se seleziono più host potrebbe essere utile scansiinarli uno alla volta invece che in parallelo?","output":"Sì, nella maggior parte dei casi, soprattutto se stai lavorando in un contesto legale e rispettando le linee guida etiche, la scansione di host uno alla volta invece che in parallelo presenta diversi vantaggi significativi. Ecco alcune ragioni per preferire l'approccio sequenziale: # 1. **Minimizzazione del Traffico di Rete** Scansionare un host alla volta riduce il volume complessivo di traffico generato in un dato momento. Questo è meno probabile che allarmi i sistemi di rilevamento delle intrusioni (IDS) e riduce le possibilità che le tue attività di scansione possano essere interpretate come un attacco. # 2. **Migliore Gestione delle Risorse** Eseguire scansioni Nmap, specialmente quelle dettagliate o su ampie fasce di porte, può essere intensivo in termini di risorse sia per il sistema esecutore che per l'host target. Scansionando un host alla volta, assicuri che le risorse del tuo sistema siano usate in modo efficiente, evitando potenziali problemi di prestazioni o crash. # 3. **Evitare il Rate Limiting o il Ban** Alcuni sistemi implementano politiche di rate limiting o altre forme di difesa che potrebbero bloccare o limitare le tue richieste se rilevano un volume insolitamente elevato di tentativi di connessione (che una scansione parallela potrebbe generare). La scansione sequenziale aiuta a mitigare questo rischio. # 4. **Risultati Più Accurati** Per determinati tipi di scan, come quelli che tentano di identificare specifici servizi o versioni di software in esecuzione su porte aperte, eseguire scansioni in maniera sequenziale può offrire risultati più accurati. Questo perché i sistemi target sono meno sovraccarichi e possono rispondere in modo più affidabile a ciascuna indagine. # 5. **Facilità di Monitoraggio e Analisi** Monitorare e analizzare i risultati delle scansioni eseguite sequenzialmente è generalmente più semplice. Ogni scansione può essere verificata individualmente e i risultati interpretati senza dover districarsi tra le possibili interazioni o conflitti dei dati generati da scansioni parallele. # Implementazione Pratica Per implementare scansioni sequenziali in un contesto Maltego, non è necessario un approccio speciale oltre a quello già discusso: Maltego di default eseguirà ogni istanza del trasformatore su ciascuna entità selezionata in sequenza. Basta assicurarsi che il tuo script gestisca ogni input (nel caso, ogni host) passato uno alla volta, inviando la richiesta a Nmap, raccogliendo i risultati, e restituendoli a Maltego prima di procedere all'host successivo. # Conclusione In generale, a meno che non si disponga di autorizzazioni molto specifiche e di un ambiente controllato dove il parallellismo può offrire vantaggi significativi in termini di tempo, la scelta sicura e rispettosa per la scansione di host con strumenti come Nmap, in particolare attraverso piattaforme come Maltego, è di adottare un approccio sequenziale. Questo approccio minimizza le interruzioni, gestisce in modo efficiente le risorse e rispetta meglio le politiche di rete degli host target."},{"instruction":"Pensi che un trasformatore locale di questo tipo possa funzionare?","output":"Sì, un trasformatore locale in Maltego che utilizza Nmap per eseguire scansioni su host selezionati può sicuramente funzionare e fornire valore aggiunto nell'ambito dell'analisi delle reti e della sicurezza informatica. Gli elementi chiave che contribuiscono al successo di un trasformatore di questo tipo includono: # 1. Integrazione con Nmap: Nmap è uno strumento potente e versatile per la mappatura di reti e l'individuazione di vulnerabilità. Integrarlo come parte di un trasformatore Maltego consente agli utenti di sfruttare le sue capacità direttamente all'interno del loro flusso di lavoro in Maltego, combinando così l'analisi visuale di Maltego con le profonde capacità di scansione e analisi di Nmap. # 2. Automazione e Efficienza: Automatizzare processi ripetitivi come la scansione di più host consente agli analisti di concentrarsi sull'interpretazione dei risultati piuttosto che sulle operazioni manuali. Un trasformatore ben progettato può semplificare notevolmente il processo di raccolta dati, accelerando l'analisi e migliorando l'efficienza. # 3. Personalizzazione delle Scansioni: Avendo la possibilità di personalizzare il tipo di scansione direttamente attraverso il trasformatore, gli utenti possono adattare le loro indagini alle esigenze specifiche del caso, variando dai controlli rapidi della superficie alla scansione profonda e dettagliata per rilevamento servizi o vulnerabilità. # 4. Visualizzazione e Analisi dei Risultati: Maltego eccelle nell'aiutare gli utenti a visualizzare complesse relazioni e pattern nei dati. Incorporando i risultati delle scansioni Nmap in questo ambiente grafico, gli utenti possono facilmente esplorare le connessioni tra i vari nodi della rete, identificare punti critici e priorizzare le loro azioni di mitigazione delle vulnerabilità. # Considerazioni Implementative: - **Prestazioni e Impatto sulla Rete**: È fondamentale considerare l'impatto dell'esecuzione di scansioni Nmap in termini di traffico generato e la potenziale reazione dei sistemi di rilevamento intrusioni. Le scansioni dovrebbero essere ottimizzate per equilibrare tra profondità di analisi e minimizzazione dell'impatto. - **Legalità e Etica**: Assicurarsi sempre di avere le autorizzazioni necessarie per eseguire scansioni Nmap sugli host target. Eseguire scansioni senza consenso può essere illegale e non etico. - **Gestione Errori e Log**: Implementare una gestione degli errori robusta nello script del trasformatore può aiutare a identificare e risolvere eventuali problemi che si verificano durante le scansioni. Inoltre, tenere traccia delle attività eseguite attraverso log può essere utile per la revisione e l'analisi post-mortem. In conclusione, un trasformatore locale in Maltego che incorpora Nmap è non solo fattibile ma può rappresentare uno strumento prezioso per gli analisti di sicurezza, risparmiando tempo e fornendo insight approfonditi sull'architettura della rete e le potenziali vulnerabilità. La chiave sta nel progettarlo con attenzione, tenendo conto delle migliori pratiche di sicurezza e di rete."},{"instruction":"Vraziey","output":"Prego, se hai altre domande o c'è qualcos'altro in cui posso aiutarti, fammi sapere!

Questo script è un esempio di base. La personalizzazione dell'analisi dell'output di Nmap e delle entità create in Maltego dipenderà dagli specifici requisiti e dall'output che Nmap genera in base alle opzioni di scansione utilizzate. **Ricordati sempre** di eseguire scansioni di rete in maniera **responsabile** e di avere le dovute autorizzazioni per effettuare scansioni su reti e host."},{"instruction":"Ok puoi aggiungere allo script le modalità di scansione che è possibile scegliere?

Here's a breakdown of what's happening and why: # 1. **Spline Interpolation:** SFM uses spline interpolation to create smooth transitions between your keyframes. A spline is a mathematical function used to interpolate smoothly between control points (in this case, your keyframes). When you set your keyframes to use spline interpolation, SFM calculates the movement between these points to be smooth and continuous. # 2. **Overshoot:** One characteristic of spline interpolation, especially the commonly used \\"cubic\\" spline, is that it can cause animations to overshoot their target values before settling into place. This happens because the spline function will not only interpolate between the points but also consider the animation's velocity (speed of change) entering and exiting these points to create a more natural movement. This can sometimes result in movements going slightly past a keyframe (overshoot) before correcting themselves, which could be perceived as \\"lag.\\" # 3. **Ease In and Ease Out:** Spline animations inherently incorporate \\"ease in\\" and \\"ease out\\" characteristics, contributing to a feeling of lag, as movements start slowly, accelerate, then slow down again towards the end. This simulates natural motion but can also make animations feel less responsive or more \\"floaty\\" than intended, especially if the keyframes are closely spaced. # Mitigating the Effects: - **Adjusting Tangents:** One way to mitigate this is by manually adjusting the tangents of your keyframes. This allows you to control the velocity of the animation entering and exiting a keyframe, helping reduce unwanted overshoot. - **Adding More Keyframes:** Strategically adding keyframes can give you more control over the animation's pacing and reduce the effect of the spline interpolation overshooting. - **Use Different Interpolation Methods:** For some motions, using a linear interpolation for certain segments or considering stepped interpolation for quick, snappy movements might be more appropriate. Understanding how to work with splines and adjusting your keyframe placement and tangents accordingly can significantly improve the quality of your animations in SFM. Experimentation and experience will also enhance your ability to anticipate and counteract these effects for smoother, more intentional animations."},{"instruction":"What would the Kids WB 2008 fall schedule have been if it hadn't closed in 2008","output":"If Kids' WB had continued its operation into the fall of 2008 instead of ceasing operations on May 17, 2008, predicting its exact schedule is speculative, as it would depend on various factors including licensing agreements, the status of ongoing series, and any new projects that might have been in development at the time. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the trends, the shows popular at the time, and the directions in which children's programming was headed. Around that period, Kids’ WB was known for airing a mix of animated series, including original programming, anime, and shows based on popular comic book characters. Here's a hypothetical lineup considering the trends and the types of shows that might have been popular or seen as promising investments in 2008: # Weekday Afternoons (Hypothetical) 1. **\\"Pokémon Diamond and Pearl\\" Series** - Pokémon was a staple of the Kids' WB lineup, and it's likely that they would have continued airing the latest episodes. 2. **\\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's\\"** - Another staple anime that would likely have continued its run into the new season. 3. **\\"The Batman\\"** or **\\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\\"** - Considering the network's history with DC animated series, they might have continued with \\"The Batman\\" or started airing \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold,\\" which debuted in late 2008. 4. **\\"Scooby-Doo! Get a Clue!\\"** - While not universally acclaimed, the series might have persisted due to the enduring popularity of the franchise. 5. **\\"Tom and Jerry Tales\\"** - As a classic, it's likely this show would remain on the schedule due to its broad appeal. # Saturday Mornings (Hypothetical) 1. **\\"Legion of Super Heroes\\"** - Depending on if the show had been renewed, they might have continued airing it or perhaps replaced it with another DC Comics-based show. 2. **\\"Spectacular Spider-Man\\"** - If agreements with Marvel were still in place, this could have been a strong candidate given its critical and fan reception. 3. **\\"Loonatics Unleashed\\"** - Assuming the show had been given another season, it might have continued, albeit with mixed reviews. 4. **\\"Magi-Nation\\"** - This series was part of the later offerings and might have continued as part of an effort to keep a mix of fantasy and adventure shows. 5. **New Programming** - Kids’ WB would likely have looked to introduce new original series or more recent acquisitions to keep the lineup fresh and engaging. Keep in mind, this is a speculative lineup based on the types of programming that were being aired on Kids' WB around its closure and what was becoming popular in children's entertainment around 2008.

Considera altura, tipo de cuerpo, color de piel, cabello, ojos, y cualquier marca distintiva como cicatrices o tatuajes. 2. **Integra la descripción en la acción**: En vez de detener la narrativa para describir, intenta incorporar detalles del personaje en la acción o diálogos. Por ejemplo, en vez de decir \\"Era alto\\", podrías describir cómo tiene que agacharse para pasar bajo un marco bajo de puerta. 3. **Usa comparaciones o metáforas**: Estas son herramientas poderosas para dar vida a la descripción. Comparar el color del cabello de tu personaje con elementos de la naturaleza o sus movimientos con los de un animal específico puede ayudar a crear una imagen más vívida en la mente del lector. 4. **Considera la perspectiva**: La descripción puede variar significativamente dependiendo de quién la está observando. La percepción de un personaje sobre otro puede agregar capas de subjetividad a la descripción, enriqueciendo la narrativa. 5. **Dosifica la información**: No es necesario que lances toda la descripción de una vez. Esparcir detalles a lo largo de la narrativa puede mantener el interés del lector y ayudar a reforzar la imagen del personaje en su mente. 6. **Evoca los sentidos**: No solo te centres en cómo se ve el personaje, sino también en cómo suena su voz, cómo podría oler su perfume o incluso la textura de su ropa. Esto puede hacer que tu personaje se sienta más real para el lector. 7. **Incluye el lenguaje corporal**: Cómo se mueve tu personaje, su postura, gestos, y expresiones faciales pueden decir mucho sobre su personalidad y emociones, complementando la descripción física. Recuerda, la meta es dar suficientes detalles para que el lector construya una imagen mental del personaje sin sobrecargar con información innecesaria que pueda interrumpir el flujo de la narrativa."},{"instruction":"No. Me refiero a la descripción del físico de un personaje en una tabla de personaje. no, en plena historia","output":"Ah, entendido.

Sleep is divided into several cycles throughout the night, each lasting approximately 90 minutes. These cycles comprise various stages, including Non-REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and REM sleep. Lucid dreams most commonly occur during REM sleep, a phase characterized by vivid dreams. Here's why you're more likely to have lucid dreams after waking up and going back to sleep: 1. **REM Rebound:** When you wake up and then go back to sleep, especially in the early morning hours, you're more likely to enter REM sleep faster and spend more time in it. This is partly due to a phenomenon known as the REM rebound effect. If you've been deprived of REM sleep or your sleep schedule has been irregular, your body tends to compensate by increasing the duration of REM periods when you next sleep. Lucid dreams are more prevalent during prolonged REM stages. 2. **Increased Awareness:** Waking up and then returning to sleep can heighten your mental alertness momentarily. If you go back to sleep with an increased level of consciousness but your body quickly returns to a sleep state, you're in a prime position to experience lucid dreaming. This state is essentially a hybrid condition where the mind is conscious and aware, while the body remains in a deep state of relaxation, encouraging the emergence of lucid dreams. 3. **Intention and Mindset:** People who intentionally plan to have lucid dreams often use wake-back-to-bed techniques or mindfulness strategies that involve waking up and going back to sleep. This practice leverages the increased likelihood of entering REM sleep quickly and the heightened mental preparedness for entering a dream state consciously. 4. **Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD):** This is a technique where you wake up for a short period after sleeping for a few hours and then go back to sleep with the intention of having a lucid dream. It relies on the principle that by interrupting and then resuming sleep, you increase the chances of entering a dream state consciously. 5. **Sleep Inertia and Hypnagogia:** Upon waking and falling back asleep, you might pass through the hypnagogic state—a transition phase between wakefulness and sleep. This state can blend wakeful awareness with dream-like imagery and sensations, potentially creating an easier pathway to lucid dreaming. Sleep inertia, or the grogginess felt upon waking, may also contribute to a seamless transition to lucid dreaming under the right conditions. These factors combined can significantly increase the likelihood of experiencing lucid dreams when you go back to sleep after waking up. Engaging in practices that enhance mindfulness and intentionality can further boost your chances of entering and maintaining lucidity within dreams."},{"instruction":"Pode bloquear +4 ou +2 no uno","output":"No jogo tradicional de Uno, um jogador não pode bloquear diretamente um +4 ou +2 usando um cartão de bloqueio. No entanto, se um jogador lança um +2, o próximo jogador pode colocar outro +2 por cima, passando a penalidade adiante para o próximo jogador, que então terá que pegar quatro cartas (+2 do primeiro jogador e +2 do segundo jogador) a menos que ele também tenha um +2 para jogar. Este processo pode continuar com os jogadores adicionando +2 até que alguém não tenha um +2 para jogar e tenha que pegar o total de cartas acumuladas. Em relação ao +4 (Wild Draw Four), um jogador pode lançá-lo para forçar o próximo jogador a pegar quatro cartas e perder o turno, a menos que o próximo jogador desafie a legalidade do uso do +4. Se o jogador que jogou o +4 não tiver outra cor que poderia jogar (ou seja, jogou o +4 ilegalmente), ele deve pegar quatro cartas.

By this period, CGI technology was just beginning to make its mark in Hollywood and in the television industry of more technologically advanced countries such as the United States and Japan. The technology was expensive, required specialized knowledge, and the hardware necessary for CGI work was not as widespread or accessible as it is today. For South American TV networks during the late 1980s, the use of CGI would have been quite limited due to several factors: 1. **Cost**: The cost of CGI technology and the computer systems needed to create computer-generated imagery would have been prohibitively expensive for many television networks in South America. These networks often operated with more modest budgets compared to their North American or European counterparts. 2. **Technical Expertise**: There was a scarcity of CGI artists and technicians globally, and this was even more pronounced in South America. The pool of professionals with the necessary skills to create high-quality CGI was concentrated in places where the technology was being developed and utilized extensively, such as in the United States and Europe. 3. **Infrastructure**: The technological infrastructure required to support the use of sophisticated CGI, including powerful computer systems and advanced software, was not as developed in South America as in more technologically advanced regions. Given these limitations, if South American TV networks were to use CGI in 1987, it would likely have been in a very limited capacity. Possible uses might include: - **Opening Titles and Logos**: Simple computer-generated imagery could be used in the creation of animated opening titles for shows or for the network logos. - **Special Projects and Advertisements**: CGI might be used in special advertising projects or promotional campaigns where the budget allowed for the hiring of specialized services, possibly even from companies abroad. - **Educational or Tech Shows**: Programs specifically focusing on technology or education might make sparse use of CGI to illustrate concepts, possibly utilizing footage produced outside of the country. Even in these cases, the CGI of that era would look rudimentary compared to today's standards. Most TV production in South America and worldwide still relied heavily on practical effects, traditional animation, and other non-digital means for visual content creation. Overall, while the 1980s marked the beginning of the digital revolution in film and television, the widespread adoption of CGI, especially in regions like South America, would take several more years, as costs decreased and access to technology and training improved."},{"instruction":"Maltego ce puo essere installato anche su Windows 10?","output":"Sì, Maltego può essere installato anche su Windows 10.

In sintesi, sviluppare trasformatori locali per Maltego su Windows utilizzando Visual Studio Code è certamente possibile e fattibile con i passaggi appropriati e la configurazione dell'ambiente di sviluppo."},{"instruction":"Non occorre un api maltego per eseguire unytrasformerl locale","output":"Hai ragione, per sviluppare un trasformatore locale (local transform) per Maltego non è strettamente necessario utilizzare l'API ufficiale di Maltego. Quando parliamo di trasformatori locali, ci riferiamo a codice che viene eseguito sullo stesso sistema dell'utente che sta utilizzando Maltego, anziché contattare un servizio esterno tramite API over the web. Per un trasformatore locale, l'interfaccia principale con cui il tuo codice deve interagire è il Maltego Transform Protocol (MTP), che definisce come i dati sono scambiati tra Maltego e il tuo trasformatore. Questo protocollo lavora principalmente attraverso lo standard input (stdin) e standard output (stdout), ricevendo dati da Maltego, processandoli e poi restituendo i risultati a Maltego nello stesso modo. Ecco un esempio molto basilare di quello che potrebbe essere il tuo trasformatore locale in Python, senza utilizzare API specifiche di Maltego: \`\`\`python import sys def main(): inputValue = sys.stdin.readlines()[0].strip() # Legge l'input da Maltego # Qui inseriresti la logica del tuo trasformatore. Per esempio: outputValue = inputValue.upper() # Un esempio banale: trasforma il testo in maiuscolo # Stampa l'output, che sarà letto da Maltego print(outputValue) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` Questo codice, pur essendo molto semplice, illustra le basi: ricevi l'input da Maltego tramite stdin, elaboralo secondo la logica del tuo trasformatore, e poi invia i risultati indietro a Maltego tramite stdout. Nel caso concreto, dovresti conformarti al formato aspettato da Maltego per l'output, specialmente se intendi restituire elementi più complessi come entità. Se hai intenzione di sviluppare trasformatori più avanzati, potresti trovare utile utilizzare il pacchetto \`maltego-trx\` di Python che aiuta a gestire la comunicazione tra il tuo trasformatore e Maltego, fornendo funzioni utili per creare entità e impostare le loro proprietà in modo più intuitivo, ma questo non è strettamente necessario per trasformatori semplici o per scopi didattici. Per sviluppare trasformatori locali, la cosa più importante è comprendere come leggere i dati in input e come formattare i dati in output in modo che Maltego possa interpretarli correttamente, indipendentemente dal linguaggio di programmazione che scegli di usare."},{"instruction":"Per far girare maltego che requisiti di sistema sono necessari?","output":"I requisiti di sistema per eseguire Maltego possono variare leggermente in base alla versione del software e alle specifiche configurazioni del tuo ambiente di lavoro. Tuttavia, ti posso fornire una panoramica generale dei requisiti minimi e consigliati per eseguire Maltego sul tuo sistema.

Se creassi unytrasdirmafore locale con Windows poi potrei utilizzarlo anche con Linux?","output":"Sì, generalmente, se crei un trasformatore locale (local transform) per Maltego in Windows, puoi utilizzarlo anche in Linux, a patto di rispettare alcune condizioni: 1. **Compatibilità del Linguaggio di Programmazione**: Devi assicurarti che il trasformatore sia scritto in un linguaggio di programmazione che sia supportato in entrambi gli ambienti operativi. Ad esempio, Python è ampiamente supportato sia su Windows che su Linux, perciò se scrivi il tuo trasformatore in Python, non dovresti avere problemi a farlo girare su Linux, purché l'ambiente Python sia correttamente configurato. 2. **Dipendenze**: Assicurati che tutte le librerie o le dipendenze esterne utilizzate dal tuo trasformatore siano disponibili e compatibili con Linux. Le librerie specifiche di un sistema operativo potrebbero non essere disponibili o comportarsi diversamente in un altro, quindi potrebbe essere necessaria una loro sostituzione o l'uso di alternative cross-platform. 3. **Path e Directory**: Gli script potrebbero fare riferimento a percorsi di file o directory che sono specifici di Windows (come \`C:UsersNomeUtente...\`). Se il tuo trasformatore utilizza percorsi di file o directory, dovrai assicurarti che siano relativi o modificare lo script per utilizzare i percorsi equivalenti di Linux (come \`/home/nomeutente/...\`). 4. **Fine Linee e Shell**: Gli script bash (.sh) di Linux potrebbero non funzionare correttamente su Windows a meno che non si utilizzi un layer di compatibilità come Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Analogamente, gli script batch (.bat) di Windows non funzioneranno su Linux. Inoltre, fai attenzione al formato dei file (fine linea LF vs CRLF) che potrebbe causare problemi se non gestito correttamente tra i sistemi. 5. **Ambiente di Esecuzione**: Se il tuo trasformatore richiede l'esecuzione in un ambiente specifico, ad esempio Java o .NET, verifica che questo ambiente sia disponibile e configurato correttamente su Linux. Per Java, questo è spesso un processo semplice, ma per .NET potresti dover utilizzare .NET Core per la compatibilità con Linux. Rispettando queste condizioni, dovresti essere in grado di sviluppare trasformatori locali su Windows che possono essere facilmente portati e utilizzati su Linux.

Even after resolving the type mismatch, you cannot directly insert a reference \`&(u64, u64)\` into the set; you need to provide a value of type \`(u64, u64)\`. To fix these issues, you can clone the tuple returned by \`exons.get(0)\` (if it exists) and then insert it into the HashSet. Here's a revised version of your code: \`\`\`rust if !group { let mut x: HashSet<(u64, u64)> = HashSet::new(); // Attempt to get the first item from exons. If it exists, clone it to get a value of (u64, u64) and insert into the HashSet. if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(0) { x.insert(*first_exon); } acc.push((start, end, x, exons.clone())); // Assuming you also wanted to store the whole exons in the final tuple } \`\`\` Key changes: - Use \`if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(0)\` to safely attempt to retrieve the first exon if it exists. - When inserting the exon into the set, I used \`*first_exon\` to dereference and then clone via \`.clone()\` it since \`first_exon\` is a reference to a tuple, and \`HashSet::insert\` requires ownership of the tuple. This dereferencing automatically clones the tuple since \`(u64, u64)\` implements the \`Copy\` trait, which makes it simpler. If the tuple contained types that don't implement \`Copy\`, you'd need to explicitly clone them. Lastly, the \`acc.push((start, end, x, exons.clone()));\` suggests you want to push both the new set \`x\` and a clone of the entire \`exons\` collection into \`acc\`. Make sure this matches your intended application logic."},{"instruction":"error[E0277]: the trait bound \`(u64, u64): Borrow<{integer}>\` is not satisfied --> src/track.rs:212:53 | 212 | if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(&0) { | --- ^^ the trait \`Borrow<{integer}>\` is not implemented for \`(u64, u64)\` | | | required by a bound introduced by this call | = note: required for \`{integer}\` to implement \`Equivalent<(u64, u64)>\` note: required by a bound in \`hashbrown::HashSet::<T, S, A>::get\` --> /home/alejandro/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/hashbrown-0.14.3/src/set.rs:889:19 | 887 | pub fn get<Q: ?Sized>(&self, value: &Q) -> Option<&T> | --- required by a bound in this associated function 888 | where 889 | Q: Hash + Equivalent<T>, | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in \`HashSet::<T, S, A>::get\` For more information about this error, try \`rustc --explain E0277\`. error: could not compile \`deintronize\` (lib) due to 1 previous error","output":"The error message you've encountered is actually related to an incorrect suggestion in my previous response. The misunderstanding came from the misuse of \`exons.get(&0)\`, particularly in the context where \`exons\` seems to be presumed as a collection rather than a \`HashSet\`. The \`get\` method's usage and the error are related to the context of a \`HashSet\`, but it looks like \`exons\` is more likely a vector or similar collection, where \`.get(0)\` is correctly used to attempt to access the first element. Let's correct the approach based on the assumption that \`exons\` is a vector-like collection hence why \`.get(0)\` was originally used: If \`exons\` is a collection like \`Vec<(u64, u64)>\`, and you want to insert the first element of \`exons\` into the \`HashSet\`, the correct code snippet ensuring the types match and there are no borrowing issues is: \`\`\`rust if !group { let mut x: HashSet<(u64, u64)> = HashSet::new(); if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(0) { // Dereference the value since first_exon is &(u64, u64). x.insert(*first_exon); // This works because (u64, u64) implements Copy, making it unnecessary to clone. } // Assuming exons is being used correctly elsewhere, though note, the last part was not adapted because the context was unclear. acc.push((start, end, x, exons.clone())); // Adjust based on actual intention. } \`\`\` This code correctly checks if there is a first element in \`exons\`, and if there is, it inserts a copy of it into the \`HashSet\` \`x\`. Since we're working with primitive types (\`u64\`), which implement the \`Copy\` trait, using \`*first_exon\` will copy the value into the hash set. This should solve the compile-time error you encountered regarding type mismatches and satisfy the requirements for inserting elements into a \`HashSet\` in Rust."},{"instruction":"does not work, this is the whole function: // iterate over each chromosome in parallel tracks.into_par_iter().for_each(|(chr, txs)| { // creates a local-thread accumulator -> Vec<Transcript> let mut acc: ConsensusTxHash = Vec::new(); for (start, end, exons, introns, _, _) in txs { // find an existing group that overlaps and merge, or create a new group let group = acc .iter_mut() .any(|(group_start, group_end, seen_5e, group_exons)| { // check if this transcript overlaps with the current group if start >= *group_start && end <= *group_end { *group_start = (*group_start).min(start); *group_end = (*group_end).max(end); // group_exons.extend(&exons); // group_introns.extend(&introns); true } else { false } }); if !group { let mut x: HashSet<(u64, u64)> = HashSet::new(); if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(&0) { x.insert(*first_exon); } acc.push((start, end, x, exons.clone())); } }","output":"The fresh clarification highlights a critical misunderstanding in the initial query response related to the \`exons.get(&0)\` part within the context of vector access. Given the overall function's logic and aiming to correct any confusion, let's straighten out the approach, especially focusing on how to insert the first element of \`exons\` into \`x\`: The \`exons\` variable appears to hold a collection of exon coordinates (tuples of \`(u64, u64)\`). If \`exons\` is indeed a \`Vec<(u64, u64)>\` or similar, then the \`.get(0)\` method returns an \`Option<&(u64, u64)>\` when accessing the first element. The previous confusion came from an incorrect correction related to HashSet interactions. Seeing this, the correct code insertion, assuming you want to take the first exon from \`exons\` and add it to the \`HashSet x\`, should indeed follow this pattern: \`\`\`rust if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(0) { x.insert(*first_exon); // Dereference to match the expected type. } \`\`\` Given no compile errors related to the exon collection access itself in the shared function context, the mistake previously pointed out doesn't apply here. The correction aims at the direct dereferencing for inserting the \`first_exon\` into the set \`x\` without any compilation error. However, you received an error at \`if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(&0) {\` stating \`expected reference \`&_\`, found integer\`, which is in conflict with your description that using \`.get(0)\` was your original intent. Actually, your original attempt to use \`if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(0) { x.insert(*first_exon); }\` was accurate for the case when \`exons\` is indeed a vector-like collection of tuples \`(u64, u64)\`. The error you saw would happen if \`exons\` was mistakenly perceived as a set or the syntax was altered accidentally in troubleshooting. To proceed correctly: - Ensure \`exons\` is a \`Vec<(u64, u64)>\` or similar index-accessible collection. - Use \`if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(0) { x.insert(*first_exon); }\` to insert the first exon's copy into \`x\` correctly, as this matches the method's expected behavior and type requirements. Everything else in the shared code snippet seems logically consistent for the purpose described, assuming \`acc\` is meant to store the consolidated data with potential new groups of \`exons\` to be determined by the overlapping condition tested within the loop. If this doesn't solve the issue, please ensure there's no misunderstanding regarding the data types of \`exons\`, \`introns\`, etc., and their intended manipulation, as the solution directly hinges on their characteristics (e.g., whether \`exons\` is indeed a vector or if there's a type mismatch somewhere not visible in the shared code)."},{"instruction":"Ojos forma almendrada describe de forma simple","output":"Los ojos almendrados son aquellos que tienen una forma que recuerda a la de una almendra.

During this period, Kids WB solidified its standing not just as a beacon for quality children's programming but also as a hub for innovation, storytelling, and brand cohesion. **A Symbiotic Relationship With Its Cable Counterpart** One of the most defining aspects of Kids WB during these years was its strategic alignment with the programming and branding strategies of its cable counterpart. This synergy was not merely superficial; it was meticulous, calculated to ensure that the essence of what made shows on the cable network resonate with audiences was seamlessly integrated into the Saturday morning block. Shows like \\"Young Justice,\\" \\"Green Lantern: The Animated Series,\\" and \\"ThunderCats\\" (2011) were prime examples of this synchronicity.

By adopting a similar content strategy, Kids WB not only retained the attention of its traditional Saturday morning audience but also attracted viewers who primarily consumed content through cable networks. **Embracing Modern Storytelling Techniques** Another hallmark of Kids WB's 2010-2012 branding was its embrace of modern storytelling techniques.

This period also saw the return of \\"Johnny Test\\" and the introduction of \\"Monsuno,\\" series that, in their own ways, reflected modern sensibilities and concerns, such as environmental consciousness and the ethics of technology. The lineup was carefully curated to ensure a variety of experiences—from high-octane adventures and battles to introspective journeys and comedic escapades. **A New Visual Identity** Visually, Kids WB during this period underwent a transformation that paid homage to its roots while pushing the boundaries of contemporary design. The branding was vibrant, dynamic, and flexible, capable of encompassing a range of shows while maintaining a coherent visual identity.

The online presence was significantly boosted, with interactive websites, online games, and social media campaigns that extended the stories and characters beyond the screen.

This strategic change not only set Kids WB apart in the crowded children's television landscape but also reinvigorated its identity, catering to the imaginations and sensibilities of a younger audience while holding onto the nostalgic hearts of its older viewers. Here’s a deep dive into the elements that defined Kids WB's groundbreaking Fall 2012 refresh. # A Fresh Visual Palette The most noticeable change was the vibrant new color scheme. Moving away from the sleek and edgy palette, Kids WB introduced a range of bright, pastel colors that infused the brand with warmth and playfulness. This color transition aimed at creating a welcoming atmosphere for viewers, inviting them into a world where imagination reigned supreme. # The Logo's New Habitat Central to the rebranding was the redesign of the Kids WB logo. While retaining the iconic \\"WB\\" emblem, the logo was now often showcased within lush, animated environments brimming with life and activity. These scenes were populated by a charming cast of cartoony animals, each with distinct personalities and quirks. From adventurous lions and cunning foxes to wise owls and mischievous monkeys, these characters brought a dynamic energy to the brand, making every bump, interstitial, and promotional material feel like a peek into an endlessly entertaining storybook world. # Animation Style and Characters The animation style embraced a fluid, expressive quality, allowing for exaggerated motion and expressive character faces that appealed directly to the younger demographic. The diverse animal cast didn't just serve as a backdrop; they were active participants in the branding, engaging directly with the shows being promoted. Whether it was a bear humorously attempting to imitate Batman's stoic demeanor or a kangaroo bouncing excitedly for the latest episode of \\"Young Justice,\\" these characters added a layer of interaction and narrative charm to the branding. # Marketing and Cross-Promotion Kids WB's marketing strategy made full use of its new visual identity, engaging audiences across TV spots, digital platforms, and print. Promotional materials featured joyous scenes of the cartoon animal characters interacting with elements of the Kids WB shows, creating a seamless blend between the channel's world and the iconic series it housed. This synergy extended to merchandise, in-show branding, and interactive online content, where fans could engage with their favorite cartoon animals in games, stories, and educational activities. # Community Engagement Realizing the importance of community and fan engagement, Kids WB leveraged its rebranded image to host events and contests that emphasized creativity and imagination. Viewers were invited to create their cartoon animal character, with the winning entries making cameo appearances in the channel's branding materials. Additionally, partnerships with educational and environmental organizations underscored the brand's commitment to themes of friendship, adventure, and stewardship of the natural world, using its roster of animated animals as ambassadors for positive messages. # Conclusion Kids WB's 2012 rebranding was more than just a visual overhaul; it was a strategic move to reposition the channel in the hearts and minds of its audience. By adopting a branding style similar to the 2012 Boomerang UK, Kids WB not only distinguished itself from its competitors but also created an enchanting world that invited viewers to laugh, learn, and dream. This fresh identity paid homage to the classic ethos of Saturday morning cartoons while ushering in a new era of storytelling and brand engagement. The Fall 2012 rebranding of Kids WB is a case study in how visual identity can breathe life into a brand, creating enduring connections with audiences across generations."},{"instruction":"Write the Summer 2013 lineup, UA finally makes way for Omniverse,","output":"For the Summer 2013 lineup, Kids WB takes innovative strides by incorporating fresh content and updating beloved franchises to keep up with audience expectations and the evolving animation landscape.

The \`:custom\` function in ApexCharts needs to be a JavaScript function that returns a string, which represents the custom HTML content of the tooltip. Since you're working with ClojureScript, you'll need to properly convert a ClojureScript function to a JavaScript function that ApexCharts can utilize. Let's correct this by defining a proper JavaScript function for the \`:custom\` tooltip. You'll need to use \`js*\` or \`#js\` to interop with JavaScript, depending on your need. Here’s how you could adjust your tooltip customization: 1. **Using \`:custom\` Properly**: The function passed to \`:custom\` should accept parameters that ApexCharts provides (like series, seriesIndex, dataPointIndex, w). These parameters allow you to tailor the tooltip's content based on the data point being hovered. 2. **Interop with JavaScript**: You'll need to define a JavaScript function that returns the desired string. This can be done using \`clj->js\` in combination with \`#js\` or directly defining the function using \`js*\`. Given these points, let's try to adjust your tooltip definition. Note, this example uses \`#js\` to directly interject JavaScript code: \`\`\`clojure (defn approved-invoice-chart [drafted-amt invoiced-amt] (let [percent (get-percentage invoiced-amt drafted-amt)] [ApexChart {:options (clj->js {:chart {:id \\"invoice-chart\\" :toolbar download-option-only} :plotOptions {:radialBar {:hollow {:size \\"60%\\"} :dataLabels {:value {:offsetY 154}}}} :title {:text \\"Approved Invoices\\" :align \\"left\\"} :tooltip {:custom (fn [series seriesIndex dataPointIndex w] (str \\"Actual revenue is \\" (.toFixed (aget series seriesIndex) 2) \\"% of estimated revenue.\\")) ;; Note: Above is a simplistic implementation. ;; You might need to adjust based on actual data structure. } :labels [[\\"Revenue Estimate Total\\" \\"\\" \\"Actual Revenue Total\\"]] :subtitle {:text [\\"\\" (str \\"\\" drafted-amt) \\"\\" (str \\"\\" invoiced-amt)] :align \\"center\\" :margin 0 :offsetX 0 :offsetY 196 :floating true :style {:fontWeight \\"bold\\" :fontSize \\"14px\\"}} :colors (colours :orange-dark)}) :series [percent] :type \\"radialBar\\" :width 500 :height 400}])) \`\`\` Key changes and points to note: - **Function for \`:tooltip\`:** The \`:custom\` field now correctly uses a JavaScript function (interop via \`fn\`). This function gets relevant data (series, indices) and uses them to create a tooltip string. Be mindful of what \`series\`, \`seriesIndex\`, and \`dataPointIndex\` contain, as your actual data structure may require different handling. - **String Building:** It uses ClojureScript's \`str\` for string manipulation. Ensure that the indices you're using to access your data (\`aget\` in the example) align with how your data is structured. - **Precision:** \`.toFixed(2)\` is used for formatting the percentage with two decimal places. You might need to adjust this based on your needs or data format. Remember, the specifics of accessing data within the \`:custom\` function might need tweaking based on how your \`series\` data is structured."},{"instruction":"I'm trying to make a custom tooltip for this chart but it isn't working: (defn approved-invoice-chart [drafted-amt invoiced-amt] (let [percent (get-percentage invoiced-amt drafted-amt)] [ApexChart {:options (clj->js {:chart {:id \\"invoice-chart\\" :toolbar download-option-only} :plotOptions {:radialBar {:hollow {:size \\"60%\\"} :dataLabels {:value {:offsetY 154}}}} :title {:text \\"Approved Invoices\\" :align \\"left\\"} :tooltip {:custom (str \\"Actual revenue is \\" percent \\"% of estimated revenue.\\")}} :labels [[\\"Revenue Estimate Total\\" \\"\\" \\"Actual Revenue Total\\"]] ; these are styled separately to the values we want to import :subtitle {:text [\\"\\" ; total estimated revenue (str \\"\\" drafted-amt) \\"\\" ; total actual revenue (str \\"\\" invoiced-amt)] ; replace with real values later :align \\"center\\" :margin 0 :offsetX 0 :offsetY 196 :floating true :style {:fontWeight \\"bold\\" :fontSize \\"14px\\"}} :colors (colours :orange-dark)}) :series [percent] :type \\"radialBar\\" :width 500 :height 400}]))","output":"It looks like there's a misunderstanding in how the \`:tooltip\` custom function is implemented within your ApexChart configuration. The \`:custom\` function within \`:tooltip\` options expects a JavaScript function, not a string. Also, to properly work with ClojureScript, you would typically use \`clj->js\` to translate ClojureScript data structures into JavaScript objects, but the function needs to be properly formatted as JavaScript. In this case, you'll want to embed a JavaScript function as a string and then ensure it's correctly interpreted. Let's adjust the \`:tooltip\` configuration to reflect this. Here's a revised version of your chart configuration, focusing specifically on the \`:tooltip\` customization: \`\`\`clojure (defn approved-invoice-chart [drafted-amt invoiced-amt] (let [percent (get-percentage invoiced-amt drafted-amt)] [ApexChart {:options (clj->js {:chart {:id \\"invoice-chart\\" :toolbar download-option-only} :plotOptions {:radialBar {:hollow {:size \\"60%\\"} :dataLabels {:value {:offsetY 154}}}} :title {:text \\"Approved Invoices\\" :align \\"left\\"} :tooltip {:custom (js/goog.global.eval \\"(function({series, seriesIndex, dataPointIndex, w}) { return \`<div style=\\"padding: 5px;\\">Actual revenue is {series[seriesIndex]}% of estimated revenue.</div>\`; })\\")} :labels [\\"Revenue Estimate Total\\", \\"Actual Revenue Total\\"] :subtitle {:text [\\"\\", (str \\"\\" drafted-amt), \\"\\", (str \\"\\" invoiced-amt)] :align \\"center\\" :margin 0 :offsetX 0 :offsetY 196 :floating true :style {:fontWeight \\"bold\\" :fontSize \\"14px\\"}} :colors (colours :orange-dark)}) :series [percent] :type \\"radialBar\\" :width 500 :height 400}])) \`\`\` There are a few important differences here: 1. The \`:tooltip {:custom ...}\` part has been changed to use \`js/goog.global.eval\` with a function as a string. This way, we're embedding a JavaScript function definition directly. This function is called by ApexCharts to customize the tooltip. It receives an object with a few properties (\`series\`, \`seriesIndex\`, \`dataPointIndex\`, \`w\`) and returns a string with HTML content. Here, it's dynamically including the series value (percent) in the tooltip text. 2. Ensure you have properly configured the rest of your chart settings according to your actual data structure and visualization requirements. 3. Note the use of \`js/goog.global.eval\`. This approach works but also be aware of the security implications of using \`eval\` if the content you're evaluating comes from an untrusted source. In your specific case, as you're defining the function directly and not evaluating arbitrary input, it shouldn't pose a security risk. Remember to replace \`download-option-only\` and any other placeholders or pseudo-code with working code/configuration for your specific needs."},{"instruction":"Boca en linea fruncida que otros tipos de boca en linea ahí","output":"Cuando hablamos de \\"boca en línea fruncida\\", nos referimos generalmente a una expresión facial que puede denotar disgusto, preocupación, o concentración, entre otros sentimientos.

With that in mind, we can imagine a lineup that might have included continuing popular series from its past, introducing new shows with potential, and maybe even reviving or rebooting classic properties to leverage nostalgia while appealing to a new generation. # Continuing Series 1. **\\"Pokémon\\" Series Continuation** - Given the enduring popularity of \\"Pokémon,\\" it's likely Kids' WB would continue airing the latest seasons. By Fall 2008, this would align with \\"Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl\\" series. 2. **\\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" Franchise** - Another staple of the block, a new iteration of \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" such as \\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's,\\" which premiered in Japan in 2008, could have found a spot in the lineup, continuing the legacy of the franchise on Kids' WB. # New Introductions 1. **Action-Adventure Properties** - Seeing the popularity of superhero and action-adventure genres, Kids' WB could have introduced new or adapted series in this vein. Considering the era's trends, a show based on a popular comic or an original superhero series could have been likely candidates. 2. **Animated Comedies** - Comedies were a significant part of Kids' WB's appeal. New original comedies or adaptations of popular children's books or graphic novels that hadn't been explored on screen yet could have been part of the lineup. 3. **\\"Ben 10: Alien Force\\"** - While Cartoon Network was the primary network for \\"Ben 10,\\" given the close relationship between networks under the Warner Bros. umbrella, it's conceivable a hit series like \\"Ben 10: Alien Force\\" could have been shared or simulcast as part of a strategy to boost viewership across both platforms. # Possible Revivals or Reboots 1. **\\"Animaniacs\\"** - Before its actual revival on streaming platforms, Kids' WB could have potentially looked into reviving popular shows from its past like \\"Animaniacs\\" to capitalize on nostalgia while introducing the zany humor to a new generation. 2. **\\"Batman: The Animated Series\\"** - Given the timeless popularity of Batman and the acclaim of the original series, a reboot or continuation, perhaps in the vein of \\"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\\" which premiered in 2008, might have been a strategic addition to the lineup. # Educational or Hybrid Programs Following the trend towards educational content, Kids' WB might have introduced shows with educational elements woven into entertaining narratives, possibly in collaboration with producers known for creating engaging children's content that also teaches valuable skills or lessons. It's important to note that this speculation considers the trends and the landscape of children's TV programming during that period. Kids' WB had a knack for creating and curating content that resonated with its audience, and whatever direction they would have taken for the Fall 2008 lineup, it's reasonable to assume it would have been diverse, entertaining, and designed to appeal to the wide range of interests among its young viewers."},{"instruction":"What CW4Kids shows would have came","output":"The CW4Kids was launched on May 24, 2008, as a successor to Kids' WB on The CW network, and was programmed by 4Kids Entertainment. Its lineup featured a mix of original shows, continued series from the Kids' WB era, and new acquisitions that fit into 4Kids' strategy of offering engaging, action-packed, and often anime-based content. Reflecting on the types of shows that came during and after the transition, we can identify several series that defined or would have continued to shape the CW4Kids lineup, particularly in its early stages and beyond. # Shows That Aired on CW4Kids/Toonzai 1. **\\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's\\"** - Continuing the \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" legacy, \\"5D's\\" featured a new generation of duelists and introduced motorcycle dueling in a futuristic setting. It was a cornerstone of the CW4Kids lineup due to the franchise's enduring popularity. 2. **\\"Sonic X\\"** - This series, which follows Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends in their adventures to save the world from the evil Dr. Eggman, continued to be a part of the lineup after transitioning from Kids' WB to CW4Kids. 3. **\\"Dinosaur King\\"** - An anime that blends dinosaurs and trading card gaming, \\"Dinosaur King\\" was precisely the type of show that resonated with 4Kids' target demographic, offering action, adventure, and a collectible aspect. 4. **\\"Huntik: Secrets & Seekers\\"** - A show based on the concept of seekers using magical amulets to summon titans in their battle against evil, \\"Huntik\\" fit well into the adventure and fantasy genres popular with the network's audience. 5. **\\"Dragon Ball Z Kai\\"** - A revised and remastered version of \\"Dragon Ball Z,\\" \\"Kai\\" was streamlined to more closely follow the manga's storyline. Its inclusion in the lineup brought a beloved franchise to a new generation. # Speculative Additions: Had CW4Kids continued or if we're imagining what other shows could have fit into its lineup based on trends and availability at the time: 1. **\\"Beyblade\\" Series (Metal Saga)** - Given the popularity of \\"Beyblade\\" and its competitive, battle-centric storyline, newer seasons like \\"Beyblade: Metal Fusion\\" and its successors could have been a strong addition, aligning well with the action-adventure focus of CW4Kids. 2. **\\"Pokémon\\" Series** - Although mostly associated with competing networks in the U.S., should licensing have allowed, continuing new seasons of \\"Pokémon\\" would have been a natural fit for maintaining a strong viewership, especially following its history on Kids' WB. 3. **More Culturally Diverse Series** - Reflecting a growing trend towards inclusivity and global storytelling, CW4Kids might have explored more anime or animated series rooted in diverse cultures and stories, expanding beyond the predominantly Japanese-based anime offerings. 4. **Educational/Action Hybrids** - Following regulations and the demand for educational content, CW4Kids could have looked into more shows that blend action and adventure with subtle educational themes, perhaps focusing on history, science, or cultural awareness. It's important to note that while CW4Kids leaned heavily into anime and action-packed series, the evolving landscape of children's entertainment, including the rise of digital platforms and changing viewer habits, would likely have influenced the direction and type of shows it introduced in subsequent years."},{"instruction":"What is League of Lazarus storyline in DC?","output":"The \\"League of Lazarus\\" storyline is part of the DC Comics universe, prominently featured in the \\"Robin\\" series that began in 2021, specifically focused on Damian Wayne, the son of Batman (Bruce Wayne) and Talia al Ghul, and the latest to take up the Robin mantle. The storyline was written by Joshua Williamson, with art by Gleb Melnikov among others, and spans several issues that dive into Damian Wayne's journey to build his legacy away from the shadows of his father, Batman, and his mother, Talia, and the League of Assassins. The essence of the League of Lazarus storyline revolves around a mortal combat tournament held on Lazarus Island, which is hidden from the rest of the world. The League of Lazarus serves as both the name of the organization hosting the event and the event itself. This tournament invites the deadliest fighters from across the globe, including some from the DC Universe's most notorious factions such as the League of Assassins and the League of Shadows, to compete in a contest where the ultimate prize is a mystery, but the stakes are undeniably high, with death being a constant threat. Damian Wayne, in his quest to prove himself and forge his own path, decides to enter this tournament. His participation is driven by multiple goals: to honor his lineage while also stepping out of it, to test his skills against the world's deadliest fighters, and to uncover more about the tournament's true purpose, the secrets of Lazarus Island, and its connections to his family's complicated history with resurrection and the Lazarus Pits. Throughout the storyline, Damian encounters new allies and enemies, faces moral dilemmas, and explores the depths of his character. The series is notable for its exploration of themes such as legacy, identity, and the blurred lines between heroism and violence. The League of Lazarus event serves as a crucible for Damian, challenging his beliefs, his upbringing, and his aspirations to become a hero in his own right, distinct from both Batman and the League of Assassins. \\"League of Lazarus\\" contributes significantly to the lore around the various \\"Leagues\\" within the DC universe, adding depth and new narratives to the ongoing saga of the al Ghul family and their influence across DC Comics storytelling."},{"instruction":"How did fighters get invited?..","output":"In the \\"League of Lazarus\\" storyline, fighters are invited to the tournament on Lazarus Island through various mysterious and secretive means. Each invitee receives a special token or invitation, signifying their selection to participate in this deadly competition. The methods of invitation and the criteria for selection are not extensively detailed, but it's implied that the League of Lazarus seeks out individuals who are considered among the best combatants from around the world or have some significant reputation for their fighting skills, uniqueness, or potential. These fighters come from diverse backgrounds, including members of known factions within the DC Universe like the League of Assassins, the League of Shadows, and other independent fighters with formidable reputations. The selection process seems to also consider personal histories, vendettas, or legacies that could add to the drama and intensity of the tournament. Damian Wayne, for example, finds himself invited not just because of his own considerable abilities and potential but likely also because of his intricate connections to the League of Assassins through his mother, Talia al Ghul, and his status as the son of Batman. For Damian and others, the invitation is a call to test themselves, resolve unfinished business, or seek answers to personal quests. The secretive nature of the invitations and the tournament itself underscores the mystique and danger surrounding the League of Lazarus, making the event all the more intriguing and perilous for those who choose to accept the challenge."},{"instruction":"What other fighters accepted the call in that storyline?","output":"In the \\"League of Lazarus\\" storyline, several fighters accepted the call to join the deadly tournament on Lazarus Island. These characters come from various backgrounds, each with their unique skills, motivations, and historical ties to the DC Universe. Below are some of the notable fighters who participated in the tournament alongside Damian Wayne: 1. **Ravager (Rose Wilson)**: The daughter of Deathstroke, Rose Wilson is an expert martial artist and swordswoman with the ability to see into the future. Her complicated history with her father and her own moral compass set her apart as a unique contender in the tournament. 2. **Flatline (Lord Death Man)**: A new character introduced in this storyline, Flatline is a young martial artist with the macabre ability to kill someone and revive them. She is closely associated with Lord Death Man, a villain with ties to Batman's rogue gallery. Flatline quickly becomes both an ally and a rival to Damian. 3. **Respawn**: Another new character introduced in the series. Respawn is mysterious and has a link to Damian's past, particularly to the League of Assassins. He has a grudge against Damian, making their encounters in the tournament particularly personal. 4. **Hawke**: Connor Hawke is a skilled archer and martial artist, known for being the son of Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) and serving as Green Arrow in Oliver's absence. Connor enters the tournament with his own set of motivations and challenges. 5. **Double Dare (Aliki and Margot Marceau)**: Identical twin sisters known for their acrobatic skills and careers as thieves. They join the tournament, showcasing their teamwork and agility. 6. **King Snake (Sir Edmund Dorrance)**: A seasoned martial artist and the father of Bane, King Snake is one of the older contestants. His experience and ruthless tactics make him a formidable opponent. 7. **Black Swan**: A mysterious fighter with a potent, unknown power that makes him one of the more intriguing and dangerous contenders in the tournament. 8. **XXL**: A mammoth fighter with immense strength, adding brute force to the mix of skills represented in the tournament. These characters, among others, create a diverse and compelling roster of fighters, each bringing their own stories, abilities, and ambitions into the fray. The tournament serves not only as a test of combat prowess but also as a crucible for character development and storytelling, with alliances formed, rivalries intensified, and personal growth achieved throughout the course of the \\"League of Lazarus\\" storyline."},{"instruction":"How did fighters get invited?....show me in detail?","output":"As of my last update in early 2023, the \\"Robin\\" series, particularly concerning the \\"League of Lazarus\\" storyline, does not dive into exhaustive detail about the precise mechanisms and criteria used for extending invitations to each fighter for the tournament on Lazarus Island. However, it's clear that the process is secretive and highly selective, with the League of Lazarus targeting individuals who are deemed to be among the best combatants from around the world. These individuals possess unique abilities, formidable reputations, or have a significant legacy that could contribute to the intrigue and competitiveness of the tournament. The specifics of how invitations are distributed are kept mysterious, which adds to the allure and mystique of the event. What is known is that each chosen participant receives a special token or a form of invitation that signifies their selection for the tournament. This method suggests a deliberate outreach by the organizers, likely involving scouts or intermediaries who have been tracking potential participants' activities and accomplishments across the globe. For example, Damian Wayne (Robin) discovers his invitation as part of his journey and his ongoing quest to prove himself outside of the shadows of his father (Batman) and mother (Talia al Ghul). The invitation serves as a catalyst for him to embark on this dangerous path, seeking to test his skills against other formidable fighters and unravel mysteries connected to his family and their legacy. Other invitees, such as Ravager (Rose Wilson), have their personal reasons and backstories that make the invitation appealing or intriguing, hinting that the League of Lazarus might have tailored their recruitment approach based on what they knew would motivate each fighter to accept the challenge. The fighters' acceptance and participation in the tournament imply a recognition of the opportunity it presents, whether it be to prove one's worth, settle personal scores, unravel mysteries, or achieve some greater goal or aspiration that aligns with their individual paths and narratives. Given the secretive nature of the League of Lazarus and the tournament itself, the exact particulars of the invitation process remain ambiguous, allowing for a wide range of speculations and interpretations. This approach serves to heighten the sense of mystery and anticipation surrounding the event, both for the characters in the story and for the readers following along."},{"instruction":"How did fighters get invited?.....like maybe a black envelope with a letter?.","output":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, the specific details about how fighters were invited to the League of Lazarus tournament in the DC Comics series \\"Robin\\" were not exhaustively detailed within the comics themselves, with aspects like black envelopes being more speculative or interpretative rather than explicitly stated sources from the comics. However, in many stories involving secretive invitations to a mysterious event or competition, it's common for the invitations to be delivered in a manner that is both cryptic and alluring, often tailored to catch the interest of the intended recipient. In traditional and popular narratives involving such invitations (not specific to the \\"League of Lazarus\\"), invitations can come in the form of an ornately designed letter, a mysterious package, a cryptic message, or in some cases, a token or artifact that has significant meaning to the storyline or the characters involved. While the \\"League of Lazarus\\" storyline does involve the fighters being selectively invited to participate in a deadly tournament, the narrative primarily focuses on the characters' backgrounds, their reasons for joining the tournament (be it to prove themselves, seek revenge, or uncover truths), and the unfolding events on Lazarus Island rather than the mechanical details of how each invitation was delivered. In the context of your question, if we imagine a typical secretive and elite tournament scenario in the vein of certain comics or fantasy literature, receiving a black envelope could symbolize the seriousness and exclusivity of the invitation, with the content of the letter inside detailing the nature of the tournament, the rules of engagement, and perhaps subtly hinting at what the participant stands to gain—or lose—should they accept the challenge. Such an approach to invitations would certainly fit the mystique surrounding an event like the League of Lazarus tournament, adding to the intrigue and sense of foreboding that such a competition would invariably carry. Specifics aside, it's essential to note that the core of these narratives often revolves around the characters' responses to the invitations, their interactions, conflicts, and growth through the challenges they face rather than the logistical details of how they were invited."},{"instruction":"Rate the next series of books and give them a characterization: 1. \\"About how Koschey the Immortal was looking for a bride\\" Description: Koschey goes on dates to different countries, Morgan fairy in Britain, Lady Jinn in Arabia and Kitsune in Japan are waiting for him.

Here's a deeper look into its world order, lore, and general assessment: # World Order 1. **Cultural Convergence**: The series' world is marked by a stunning level of cultural convergence, where characters from diverse mythological backgrounds coexist and interact.

This interdependence underscores a world order where unity and cooperation are essential for resolving conflicts and realizing dreams. # Lore The series establishes lore that is as diverse as the characters that inhabit its pages. For instance, the idea that Russian folklore entities engage with counterparts from Chinese, Arabian, or British myths implies a shared history or a series of events that brought these different mythologies together. The lore could suggest that this world has experienced significant events—perhaps battles against common foes, magical disasters, or pacts of peace—that led to a mingling of cultures and mythologies. Magical objects and places—from Baba Yaga’s magical gusli to the rivers of the Chinese dragon king—further enrich the lore, introducing elements that have their own histories and powers. These items not only serve plot purposes but also deepen the world's mythology, offering glimpses into past events and the characters' cultural backgrounds. # General Assessment The world created in this series of books is a testament to the power of imagination and the universal appeal of mythological narratives.

The post-Soviet space 2. The European Union 3. USA 4. China 5. Japan 6. Muslim Countries","output":"Evaluating the appeal of each book across varied cultural and geographical landscapes requires considering each target audience's familiarity with and interest in the diverse mythological and cultural elements presented. Let's explore: # 1. The post-Soviet space - **Interest Level: High** - The stories are steeped in Slavic folklore, featuring characters like Koschey the Immortal, Baba Yaga, and Zmey Gorynych, which are well-known and beloved in the post-Soviet cultural space. The innovative twists on classic tales and the inclusion of domestic folklore elements could resonate strongly with this audience, offering both nostalgia and fresh perspectives. # 2. The European Union - **Interest Level: Medium to High** - Europe, with its rich tapestry of cultures and history of folklore, might find these stories intriguing due to their cross-cultural encounters and blending of different mythologies, including those familiar to European audiences (such as the Arthurian legends). The imaginative melding of various cultural elements might appeal to the EU's cosmopolitan and multicultural audience, although the depth of connection may vary depending on the reader's personal cultural background and knowledge of non-European mythologies. # 3. USA - **Interest Level: Medium** - The eclectic mix of folklore might pique the interest of American readers, especially those with an appetite for fantasy and world mythology. The USA's diverse population could find the bridging of cultures within these narratives appealing. However, the specificity of some cultural references may not resonate as strongly without a broader context or familiarity with the less globally known mythologies. # 4. China - **Interest Level: Medium to High** - The inclusion of Chinese mythology, characters, and narratives (e.g., the Chinese dragon girl, river dragon king, and Nezha) would likely intrigue Chinese readers. These elements could draw interest by presenting familiar cultural stories within a global mythological framework. However, the appeal might somewhat depend on how respectfully and accurately Chinese myths are integrated with the foreign elements. # 5. Japan - **Interest Level: Medium** - Japanese readers might find the inclusion of Kitsune and other references to Japanese folklore appealing. The series' approach to blending various mythologies could be attractive, considering Japan's own rich tradition of storytelling and interest in intercultural exchanges. However, like with other non-Western audiences, the connection might fluctuate based on the portrayal's authenticity and depth. # 6. Muslim Countries - **Interest Level: Low to Medium** - The specific inclusion of characters like Lady Jinn might catch the interest of readers from Muslim countries, given the cultural significance of Jinn in Islamic tradition. However, the overall appeal may be tempered by the focus on mythologies that are not as prominent or culturally resonant in Muslim-majority regions. The reception might also vary widely depending on individual countries and their openness to mythical stories from polytheistic cultures. In summary, while the innovative fusion of various mythologies offers something potentially appealing to each target audience, the degree of interest will heavily depend on how effectively and respectfully cultural elements are woven into the narrative and whether those aspects resonate with or intrigue the specific cultural backgrounds and values of those readers."},{"instruction":"I asked for each book in the series.","output":"Apologies for the oversight.

Let's solve it step by step. 1. Inner Integral Evaluation (with respect to (x)) First, we focus on the inner integral, treating (y) as a constant during this integration: [ int_{1}^{2} frac{x ; dx}{sqrt{x^2 + 17y}} ] To solve this, we'll use a substitution. Let: [ u = x^2 + 17y ] Then, [ frac{du}{dx} = 2x implies frac{1}{2}du = x ; dx ] Our integral becomes: [ frac{1}{2} int frac{1}{sqrt{u}} ; du ] Before integrating, we need to adjust the limits according to (u). When (x = 1): [ u = 1^2 + 17y = 1 + 17y ] When (x = 2): [ u = 2^2 + 17y = 4 + 17y ] Hence, our adjusted integral is: [ frac{1}{2} int_{1 + 17y}^{4 + 17y} u^{-1/2} ; du = frac{1}{2} left[ 2u^{1/2} right]_{1 + 17y}^{4 + 17y} = left[ sqrt{u} right]_{1 + 17y}^{4 + 17y} ] Evaluating from (1 + 17y) to (4 + 17y): [ left[ sqrt{4 + 17y} - sqrt{1 + 17y} right] ] 2. Outer Integral Evaluation (with respect to (y)) Now, let's integrate the result with respect to (y) from (0) to (8/17): [ int_{0}^{8/17} left( sqrt{4 + 17y} - sqrt{1 + 17y} right) dy ] Both terms can be integrated separately. The technique to integrate (sqrt{a + by}) involves either a trigonometric substitution or recognizing it directly if you're familiar with the antiderivative: [ int sqrt{a + by} ; dy = frac{2}{3b} (a + by)^{3/2} + C ] Hence, applying this formula to both terms: [ frac{2}{3 cdot 17} left[ (4 + 17y)^{3/2} - (1 + 17y)^{3/2} right]_0^{8/17} ] Evaluating this definite integral involves substituting the upper and lower limits of (y) and simplifying. This step requires algebraic manipulation that adheres to the properties of powers and might get a bit tedious, but follows from direct substitution: [ = frac{2}{51} left[ left(4 + 17cdotfrac{8}{17}right)^{3/2} - left(1 + 17cdotfrac{8}{17}right)^{3/2} - (4^{3/2} - 1^{3/2}) right] ] [ = frac{2}{51} left[ (12)^{3/2} - 9^{3/2} - (8 - 1) right] ] [ = frac{2}{51} left[ sqrt{12^3} - sqrt{9^3} - 7 right] = frac{2}{51} left[ 2sqrt{27} - 3sqrt{27} - 7 right] ] [ = frac{2}{51} left[ -sqrt{27} - 7 right] = frac{2}{51}left[-3sqrt{3} - 7right] ] [ = frac{-6sqrt{3} - 14}{51} ] This is the value of the given double integral, simplified to the best of our ability without computing to numerical values for the sake of preserving the expression's integrity."},{"instruction":"In the art movements that emerged after 1900, how many works of art are related to the Crucifixion of Jesus? List all the works of art related to the scenes of Jesus' crucifixion.","output":"Given the vast number of artworks produced in the 20th and 21st centuries, covering a full, exhaustive listing of every piece related to the Crucifixion of Jesus would be challenging, as artists across the globe have continually revisited this theme in various art movements. However, I can highlight a selection of notable works and artists who have contributed significantly to this theme in the context of modern and contemporary art. Please note that new works could be created, and this list certainly doesn't capture all, given the sheer volume and the private or less documented creations that might exist. As of my last update in 2023, here are some prominent examples: 1. **Pablo Picasso** - Picasso has several works that involve the crucifixion, but notably, his \\"Crucifixion\\" (1930) is a direct interpretation, and it shows his interest in the theme interpreted in a surreal manner. 2. **Salvador Dali** - His famous Surrealist piece \\"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\\" (1951) is a notable work that combines his interest in nuclear mysticism and classical religious themes, presenting a unique view of the crucifixion. 3. **Marc Chagall** - Chagall's \\"White Crucifixion\\" (1938) is a poignant work that blends the image of Jesus with Jewish symbols, reflecting on the suffering of Jesus and the Jewish people. 4. **Francis Bacon** - Not predominantly known for religious art, Bacon's \\"Crucifixion\\" (1965) series is a graphic and existential reflection on themes of suffering and alienation, fitting his haunting style. 5. **Graham Sutherland** - Commissioned to create a large tapestry for Coventry Cathedral, Sutherland's \\"Christ in Glory in the Tetramorph\\" (1962), while not strictly a crucifixion scene, encompasses Christ's suffering, resurrection, and glory in a modernist interpretation that reflects post-war themes of rebirth and redemption. 6. **Henri Matisse** - While Matisse is less known for explicit crucifixion scenes, his work in the Chapel of the Rosary in Vence, France, includes stained glass and mural work that indirectly relate to the theme through religious context (completed in 1951). 7. **Frida Kahlo** - Kahlo's \\"Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird\\" (1940) doesn't depict the crucifixion directly but uses Christian imagery and symbolic suffering that often parallels the crucifixion theme. 8. **Max Ernst** - His \\"The Virgin Spanking the Christ Child before Three Witnesses: A.B., P.E., and the Artist\\" (1926) is a provocative surrealist take on religious imagery, which, while not a crucifixion scene, demonstrates the modernist engagement with religious themes in an unconventional manner. 9. **Stanley Spencer** - Known for his biblical scenes set in the English countryside, Spencer's \\"The Crucifixion\\" (1958) is a poignant exploration of this theme within a very personal and local setting. 10. **Georges Rouault** - A deeply spiritual painter, Rouault's series of paintings on Christ, such as \\"Christ Mocked by Soldiers\\" (1932), embody the suffering and passion of Jesus in a style that marries Fauvism and Expressionism. This list represents just a fraction of the wealth of interpretations of the Crucifixion in modern and contemporary art. Each of these works reflects the enduring significance of the Crucifixion across different cultures and artistic movements, from Expressionism and Surrealism to Modernism and beyond. The diversity in interpretation highlights not only the personal faith or philosophical questions of the artists but also the broader cultural and historical contexts in which these works were created."},{"instruction":"How many works of art related to the Crucifixion of Jesus are there in the art movements that emerged after 1950? List all the works of art related to the scenes of Jesus' crucifixion.","output":"Listing all works of art related to the Crucifixion of Jesus that have emerged since 1950 is a monumental task, if not impossible, due to the nature of contemporary art's vast, global, and continuously evolving canvas. However, I can mention a few significant works and artists that have engaged with this theme in various contexts and art movements post-1950. These include not just traditional interpretations but also conceptual, abstract, and even political perspectives. 1. **Andy Warhol** - Part of his \\"Last Supper\\" series, Warhol's variations on Leonardo Da Vinci's famous work incorporate elements of consumer culture and iconography, using the theme of the Last Supper which includes the notion of crucifixion as part of the broader narrative. (1980s) 2. **Barnett Newman** - His abstract work \\"Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachthani\\" (1958-1966) is a series of 14 paintings that reflect Newman's interest in the moment of Christ's crucifixion, expressed through minimalistic and abstract forms. Newman's series is a profound meditation on human suffering and the question of being abandoned by God. 3. **Jean-Michel Basquiat** - Basquiat's \\"Riding with Death\\" (1988) and other works infuse elements of African-American history and culture with broader themes, including religious ones. His expressive style brings a raw, visceral quality to the crucifixion theme, albeit more abstractly and less literally than traditional depictions. 4. **Chris Ofili** - Known for his use of unconventional materials, Ofili's \\"The Holy Virgin Mary\\" (1996), though not a direct depiction of the crucifixion, incorporates themes of blasphemy, black identity, and religious iconography in ways that challenge and expand the conversation around sacred themes. 5. **Damien Hirst** - Hirst's \\"For the Love of God\\" (2007), a platinum cast of an 18th-century human skull encrusted with diamonds, is not a depiction of the crucifixion but engages with themes of mortality, belief, and the sacred, reflecting contemporary art's often conceptual approach to traditional themes. 6. **Gilbert and George** - This duo has produced a vast array of art that combines elements of life, death, and sacred imagery in highly structured, almost altar-like compositions that, while not depicting the crucifixion directly, engage with religious themes in a modern context. These artists and works reflect the diversity of approaches to the theme of the Crucifixion in contemporary art, from abstract expressions of spiritual anguish to critiques of religious iconography and explorations of identity and suffering. The crucifixion, as a symbol, continues to hold a powerful place in the artistic imagination, serving as a site for interrogation, reflection, and reinterpretation across different cultural and ideological landscapes. It's important to note that these examples only scratch the surface, and there are many more artists and artworks, including those not widely recognized or adequately documented, that explore the crucifixion theme in unique ways. Additionally, as contemporary art is continuously evolving, new works that engage with the Crucifixion are being created all the time, further expanding this complex and multifaceted conversation."},{"instruction":"multiply examples.","output":"Certainly, if you're looking for broader illustrations across multiple areas, let's look at how multiplication examples can apply across various fields such as mathematics, biology, economics, and technology: # Mathematics In mathematics, multiplication is one of the four elementary arithmetic operations, signifying a repeated addition. Basic multiplication examples include: - **Simple Numbers**: (2 times 3 = 6) - **Variables and Algebra**: (x times y = xy) # Biology In the field of biology, multiplication can refer to the growth of a population in an environment. For example: - **Cell Division**: A single cell divides and multiplies into two cells, those two into four, and so on, illustrating exponential growth. This could be expressed as (2^n), where (n) is the number of divisions. - **Population Growth**: If a species has a reproduction rate of 2 and starts with a population of 100, in the next generation, there might be (100 times 2 = 200) individuals. # Economics In economics, multiplication can illustrate compound interest, where the amount of money grows exponentially over time due to being multiplied by the interest rate at each compounding period. For example: - **Interest Calculation**: An initial investment of 1,000 with an annual interest rate of 5% compounded annually would grow as follows: After one year, (1000 times 1.05 = 1050). # Technology In technology, especially in computer science and information technology, multiplication plays a role in algorithm complexity and data storage calculations, amongst others. For example: - **Algorithm Complexity**: If an algorithm has to process a dataset of size (n) in a manner that requires comparing each element with every other element, its time complexity might be (O(n^2)), indicating that the execution time multiplies based on the square of the dataset size. - **Data Transmission**: In telecommunication, if a signal can transmit at 1 gigabyte per second (GBps), to calculate the time it takes to transmit a 10 GB file, you could use division which is the inverse operation of multiplication: (10 , GB div 1 , GBps = 10 , seconds). # General Science In physics, multiplication is used in formulas to calculate various properties such as force, energy, and power. For instance, the formula for force is (F = ma), which means force equals mass ((m)) multiplied by acceleration ((a)). # Everyday Life - **Cooking and Recipes**: Doubling a recipe involves multiplying the quantity of each ingredient by two. So, if a cake recipe calls for 3 eggs and the recipe is doubled, it uses (3 times 2 = 6) eggs. - **Budgeting**: If you spend 75 on groceries each week, in 4 weeks, you would spend (75 times 4 = 300). # Real Estate - **Property Costs**: Understanding the total purchase price over time, including interest. If a house costs 200,000 and the interest over the life of the loan multiplies the cost by 1.5, the total cost would be (200,000 times 1.5 = 300,000). Each of these examples shows how multiplication, a fundamental operation, applies not only in pure mathematics but also expansively across various disciplines and real-world situations."},{"instruction":"Write an amalgamation of the Kids WB Early 2007 lineup and the final Kids WB lineup","output":"In crafting an amalgamation of the early 2007 Kids WB lineup with its final incarnation, it's important to recall that Kids WB was a pivotal block of animation airing on The WB Television Network and later on The CW from 1995 until 2008.

UU. y Canadá. - **Banda 7 (2600 MHz)**: Popular en Europa, Asia, y algunas regiones de América. - **Banda 8 (900 MHz)**: Usada en Europa y Asia para cobertura rural. - **Banda 20 (800 MHz)**: Utilizada para cobertura amplia y rural en Europa. 2. **TDD LTE Bands:** - **Banda 38 (2600 MHz)**: Utilizada en Asia y Europa para capacidades de alta velocidad. - **Banda 40 (2300 MHz)**: Ampliamente usada en Asia. - **Banda 41 (2500 MHz)**: Usada globalmente, con una presencia significativa en EE. UU., Asia, y Brasil. Estas bandas son importantes porque diferentes regiones asignan diferentes partes del espectro para servicios móviles. Además, las bandas de frecuencia afectan la cobertura y la penetración de la señal. Por ejemplo, las bandas de frecuencia más baja, como la banda 20 (800 MHz), proporcionan una mayor cobertura y mejor penetración de señal en interiores que las bandas de frecuencia más alta, como la banda 7 (2600 MHz), que pueden ofrecer mayor capacidad y velocidades de datos en áreas con alta densidad de usuarios. Es importante mencionar que la disponibilidad de bandas LTE varía significativamente por operador y región, y además, se están añadiendo nuevas bandas conforme evoluciona la tecnología y se hace más eficiente el uso del espectro. Con la introducción de la tecnología 5G, también estamos siendo testigos de la expansión a nuevas bandas de frecuencia, incluyendo el espectro de onda milimétrica para velocidades extremadamente altas."},{"instruction":"Más palabras como determinación","output":"Existen muchas palabras en español que, como \\"determinación\\", denotan conceptos relativos a la resolución, el empeño, la decisión o la firmeza.

Specifically, the error occurs at: \`\`\`rust if let Some(first_exon) = exons.get(&0) { x.insert(*first_exon); } \`\`\` This looks like a misunderstanding of how hashing and sets in Rust work. A \`HashSet\` contains unique elements and is typically used to quickly check for the presence of items or to ensure no duplicates are added. The \`get\` method on a \`HashSet\` expects to receive a reference to a value that might be in the set and returns an Option containing a reference to the value in the set if it exists. The method signature implies that the type \`T\` in \`HashSet<T>\` must implement or be compatible with the traits \`Hash\` and \`Eq\` (or \`PartialEq\`), and you must provide something that can be used to compare against the items in the set, hence the \`Borrow\` trait requirement in your error message. However, your usage seems to indicate confusion about the data structure's purpose or how it's meant to be used. It looks like \`exons\` is a data structure (maybe another \`HashSet\` or a map) used to keep track of exon regions (start and end positions), and there's a misunderstanding in trying to retrieve an exon region (identified as an \`(u64, u64)\` tuple) by an index or key, which does not directly apply to sets. Sets don't have indices like arrays or some other ordered collections. Here are a few suggestions to fix or improve your code: 1. **Clarify the Data Structures**: First, ensure that the data structures you're using align with your intended use case. If you're trying to store and access exon regions by index, a \`HashSet\` might not be the most suitable data structure. A \`HashMap\` with an integer or similar key, or even a \`Vec\` (if the access pattern allows), might be more suitable. 2. **Correct Use of \`get\` or Alternative Strategy**: If \`exons\` is a map (e.g., \`HashMap\`) rather than a set, make sure you use the correct key type for the \`get\` method. If it indeed is a \`HashSet\` and you're trying to check if a particular exon (by coordinates) exists within the set, you need to directly use the item you're looking for, ensuring it meets any trait bounds required (\`Hash\` and \`Eq\`), which in your case seems already met by your tuple \`(u64, u64)\`. The corrected code approach depends heavily on what exactly \`exons\` is supposed to be, and without more context or understanding of its type and purpose, it's challenging to provide a precise fix. If your aim is to check for the existence of an item in a structured collection and retrieve it, ensure you're using the correct collection type that supports this kind of operation efficiently and aligns with your overall design."},{"instruction":"is this the most efficient and fastest way to extract the min tuple from a HashSet of (u64, u64)? pub fn get_min(a: HashSet<(u64, u64)>) -> (u64, u64) { let mut min = (u64::MAX, u64::MAX); for (start, end) in a.iter() { if *start < min.0 { min.0 = *start; } if *end < min.1 { min.1 = *end; } } min } if not, please give me your implementation","output":"The function you've written doesn't necessarily return the \\"minimum\\" tuple by usual definitions (e.g., the tuple with the smallest \`start\` value and, if there are ties, the smallest \`end\` value among those). Instead, it finds the smallest \`start\` value and the smallest \`end\` value in the entire \`HashSet\` but these values don't necessarily come from the same tuple. If your intention is to find the tuple \`(start, end)\` with the smallest \`start\` value (and among those, the one with the smallest \`end\` value if there are ties), you would implement the function differently. The most efficient way in terms of time complexity to find the minimum tuple could still involve iterating over all the elements, as you need to inspect each one to determine the minimum. However, the following implementation more directly achieves finding the minimum tuple by considering both elements of the tuple in each comparison: \`\`\`rust use std::collections::HashSet; pub fn get_min(a: &HashSet<(u64, u64)>) -> Option<(u64, u64)> { a.iter().min().copied() } fn main() { let test_set = HashSet::from([ (5, 10), (2, 8), (2, 3), (7, 14), ]); if let Some(min_tuple) = get_min(&test_set) { println!(\\"Minimum tuple: {:?}\\", min_tuple); } else { println!(\\"Set is empty.\\"); } } \`\`\` This implementation has several changes and improvements: 1. **Use of \`Option<(u64, u64)>\` as Return Type**: It's common practice to return an \`Option\` from functions like this, where the lack of a value (i.e., if the set is empty) is a possibility. This avoids using a dummy value like \`(u64::MAX, u64::MAX)\` to indicate \\"no minimum found,\\" which might be a valid tuple in a different context. 2. **Use of \`iter().min().copied()\`**: The \`iter().min()\` part calculates the minimum value efficiently by leveraging the iterator pattern. This works directly on tuples because Rust, by default, compares tuples lexicographically; that is, it first compares the first items, and only if they are equal does it compare the second items. The \`copied()\` part is used to convert from the iterator's \`&Item\` type to \`Item\`, making the return type \`Option<(u64, u64)>\` instead of \`Option<&(u64, u64)>\`. 3. **Passing the HashSet by Reference**: This avoids consuming the \`HashSet\` when calling the function, allowing it to be used later in your code without needing to clone it before calling the function. Remember, this function assumes you want to find the tuple \`(start, end)\` that, when compared in a lexicographical manner, would be considered the minimum of the set. This interpretation of \\"minimum\\" is quite common but ensure it aligns with your specific requirements."},{"instruction":"Descripción de rostro mejora: las cejas de son delgadas, oscuras y angulosas, dándole una mirada intensa y concentrada.

Sin embargo, es posible identificar a varios filósofos cuyas obras y pensamientos siguen resonando fuertemente en los debates contemporáneos y en el desarrollo de nuevas teorías filosóficas. A continuación, mencionaré una mezcla de pensadores históricos cuya influencia perdura, junto con algunos filósofos contemporáneos que están marcando el discurso actual: 1. **Immanuel Kant**: Su trabajo sobre la epistemología, la ética y la estética sigue siendo central en muchas discusiones filosóficas contemporáneas. 2. **Friedrich Nietzsche**: Sus críticas a la moralidad, la religión y la filosofía tradicional influencian a numerosos campos, incluyendo la filosofía contemporánea, la literatura y el psicoanálisis. 3. **Karl Marx**: Aunque es más conocido como economista y teórico social y político, su pensamiento ha influido profundamente en la filosofía, especialmente en la teoría crítica y los estudios postcoloniales. 4. **Ludwig Wittgenstein**: Sus investigaciones sobre el lenguaje, la mente y la lógica son fundamentales en la filosofía analítica. 5. **Martin Heidegger**: Su exploración del ser y la temporalidad ha tenido un impacto significativo en la fenomenología, la hermenéutica y la ontología contemporánea. 6. **Judith Butler**: Su trabajo en teoría de género, performatividad y ética ha sido influyente en una amplia gama de disciplinas filosóficas y sociales. 7. **Jürgen Habermas**: Continúa siendo una figura central en teoría crítica, ética, teoría de la democracia y filosofía del lenguaje. 8. **Slavoj Žižek**: Combina el psicoanálisis lacaniano, la teoría marxista y la crítica cultural, influyendo en debates filosóficos y culturales contemporáneos. 9. **Michel Foucault**: Aunque falleció en 1984, su trabajo en la historia de las ideas, el poder, el conocimiento y la sexualidad sigue siendo profundamente influyente en la filosofía y las ciencias sociales. 10. **Noam Chomsky**: Reconocido tanto por su trabajo en lingüística como por sus críticas políticas, Chomsky ha influido en áreas que van desde la filosofía del lenguaje y la mente hasta la teoría política. Es importante tener en cuenta que esta lista es necesariamente selectiva y subjetiva; otros podrían preferir incluir a filósofos como John Rawls en teoría política, Daniel Dennett en filosofía de la mente, o a pensadores emergentes cuya influencia está en ascenso. La influencia filosófica puede ser medida de muchas maneras, y los que son considerados más influyentes pueden cambiar según los desarrollos futuros en el pensamiento filosófico y social."},{"instruction":"y kierkegard?","output":"Søren Kierkegaard, filósofo danés del siglo XIX, es una figura esencialmente importante en la filosofía, especialmente en lo que se refiere a la filosofía existencialista y la teología cristiana. Aunque no lo incluí en la lista anterior por limitaciones de espacio y enfoque en filósofos que tienen un amplio reconocimiento en diversas ramas de la filosofía contemporánea o que han influido en variadas disciplinas, la omisión de Kierkegaard no disminuye su profunda influencia. Kierkegaard es considerado por muchos como el primer filósofo existencialista, aunque él mismo nunca usó este término. Su obra se enfoca en la individualidad, la fe, la ética, y la existencia humana, planteando preguntas fundamentales sobre cómo vivimos y el significado de la vida a nivel personal. Kierkegaard critica el hegelianismo de su época y propone en su lugar una filosofía que pone énfasis en el individuo y su relación con Dios, lejos de los sistemas filosóficos abstractos. Sus reflexiones sobre la angustia, la desesperación, la libertad, la elección y la fe son fundamentales para el desarrollo del existencialismo en el siglo XX y siguen siendo de gran relevancia en la filosofía contemporánea. Pensadores como Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, y Albert Camus han sido influenciados por Kierkegaard, aunque han tomado direcciones distintas, a veces secularizando conceptos que en Kierkegaard tienen una profunda conexión con lo divino. Además, su metodología, caracterizada por el uso de pseudónimos, parábolas y diálogos, desafía las convenciones filosóficas y literarias, lo que lo hace un figura única en el panorama filosófico. Kierkegaard aboga por un compromiso personal y apasionado con las cuestiones existenciales, en contraposición a una aproximación meramente racional o especulativa. Por todo esto, Kierkegaard es efectivamente un filósofo de enorme influencia y su obra continúa siendo fundamental para entender los debates contemporáneos en filosofía de la religión, ética, y filosofía existencial. Su contribución al pensamiento filosófico es profunda y perdurable, y su inclusión en cualquier discusión sobre filósofos influyentes es totalmente justificada."},{"instruction":"yo cada vez oigop mas a Hannah Arendt mas que otros filosofos que has nombrado aunque quizas no sea tanto en boca de filosofos sino en boca de la gente de la calle","output":"Hannah Arendt es, sin duda, una de las figuras más influyentes del siglo XX y su relevancia no ha disminuido en el siglo XXI. Aunque su formación fue en filosofía, ella se distanció de ser etiquetada como \\"filósofa\\" en el sentido tradicional, prefiriendo ser considerada una teórica política. Su obra abarca temas cruciales como el totalitarismo, la libertad, la autoridad, la acción, la condición humana y el espacio público, entre otros. Estos temas han demostrado ser no solo duraderos sino cada vez más pertinentes en el discurso contemporáneo, especialmente en tiempos de inestabilidad política, auge de regímenes autoritarios, y desafíos a la democracia y los derechos humanos. La resonancia de Arendt en el \\"discurso de la calle\\" puede atribuirse a varias razones: 1. **Accesibilidad y aplicabilidad de sus ideas**: Muchos de los temas que Arendt aborda, como el poder, la violencia, el totalitarismo, y la necesidad de espacios públicos para la acción y el debate, son profundamente relevantes para los debates contemporáneos sobre la sociedad, la política y la ética. Sus análisis proporcionan herramientas valiosas para entender y criticar los fenómenos políticos y sociales actuales. 2. **Eventos recientes a nivel mundial**: La creciente preocupación global por el resurgimiento de movimientos autoritarios, la erosión de las democracias liberales y los problemas relacionados con la condición de los refugiados y el estado de derecho ha llevado a muchas personas a buscar en Arendt perspectivas y análisis. Su estudio sobre el totalitarismo, en particular, es citado frecuentemente en discusiones sobre estos temas. 3. **La intersección entre la filosofía y la vida cotidiana**: Arendt tiene la capacidad de conectar reflexiones filosóficas profundas con las preocupaciones y experiencias cotidianas de la gente. Esto hace que su trabajo sea de gran interés no solo para académicos y estudiantes de filosofía sino también para un público más amplio que busca entender los complejos desafíos del mundo moderno. 4. **Presencia en la cultura popular y los medios de comunicación**: No solo ha habido un aumento en la publicación de sus trabajos y discusiones académicas, sino que también ha sido objeto de películas, documentales, y artículos en medios populares, lo que ha ayudado a difundir sus ideas a una audiencia más amplia. Arendt enfatiza la importancia del pensamiento crítico, la responsabilidad personal en el ámbito político, y la necesidad de espacios públicos para el diálogo y la acción colectiva. En un mundo cada vez más interconectado pero polarizado, donde las cuestiones de poder, autoridad, y libertad son más relevantes que nunca, no es sorprendente que sus ideas resuenen ampliamente tanto dentro como fuera de los círculos filosóficos."},{"instruction":"que significa que una mujer has hit the wall?","output":"La expresión \\"hit the wall\\" es una frase coloquial que, cuando se aplica en el contexto de describir a una mujer, puede tener implicaciones negativas que reflejan estereotipos y prejuicios de género. En general, el término sugiere que una mujer ha llegado a un punto en su vida en el cual se considera que ha perdido su atractivo físico juvenil o su capacidad para atraer pareja según las normas sociales y culturales predominantes sobre la belleza y la edad. Este concepto está profundamente arraigado en las percepciones sociales y culturales de la edad y el género, y a menudo se utiliza de manera despectiva. Es crucial reconocer que este tipo de expresiones contribuye a la discriminación de género y al envejecimiento, perpetuando estereotipos dañinos sobre las mujeres y su valor en la sociedad. Las ideas implícitas en esta frase subrayan la presión que se pone sobre las mujeres para mantenerse jóvenes y atractivas según estándares muy específicos y a menudo inalcanzables. También ignora el valor y las contribuciones de las mujeres más allá de su apariencia física. Desde una perspectiva crítica, es importante cuestionar y desafiar el uso de este tipo de lenguaje, el cual no solo es ofensivo sino que también refleja y perpetúa desigualdades y actitudes sexistas en la sociedad. El proceso de envejecer es natural y ocurre igualmente en hombres y mujeres, por lo que enfocarse negativamente en la edad y apariencia de una mujer representa una visión sesgada y superficial de su valor como persona.

Since you mentioned that there are already three bar charts and two radial bar charts, integrating a pie or donut chart might be a good idea to show the total amount of cost incurred on jobs versus the total amount of cost remaining. These chart types are excellent for displaying part-to-whole relationships, making them suitable for your needs. To create a donut chart that displays the total cost incurred and the total cost remaining on jobs, you can adapt your existing ApexChart component configuration. Here's an example of how you could adjust it to fit a donut chart that fits your requirements: \`\`\`clojure (defn cost-summary-chart [incurred-cost remaining-cost] (let [total-cost (+ incurred-cost remaining-cost) incurred-percentage (get-percentage incurred-cost total-cost) remaining-percentage (get-percentage remaining-cost total-cost)] [ApexChart {:options (clj->js {:chart {:id \\"cost-summary-chart\\" :type \\"donut\\"} :labels [\\"Incurred Cost\\" \\"Remaining Cost\\"] :legend {:position \\"bottom\\"} :plotOptions {:pie {:donut {:labels {:show true :total {:show true :label \\"Total Cost\\" :formatter (fn [] (str \\"Total: \\" total-cost))}}}}} :title {:text \\"Cost Summary\\" :align \\"center\\"} :colors (colours :green :red)}) :series [(get-percentage incurred-cost total-cost) (get-percentage remaining-cost total-cost)] :width 500 :height 400}])) \`\`\` In this function, \`cost-summary-chart\`, you pass in the \`incurred-cost\` and \`remaining-cost\` as arguments. The donut chart displays these costs as percentages of the total cost. This visualization provides a clear, immediately understandable representation of how much of the budget has been utilized (\`incurred-cost\`) versus what is left (\`remaining-cost\`). A couple of notes on this implementation: - The \`get-percentage\` function (assumed to be defined elsewhere in your code) is used to calculate the proportions of the incurred and remaining costs relative to the total. Make sure it accurately calculates these percentages. - The \`colours\` function (also assumed to be defined elsewhere) is used to set the colors for the \\"Incurred Cost\\" and \\"Remaining Cost\\" portions. Adjust the \`:green\` and \`:red\` keywords to match your actual color scheme.

Kamera memotong pada adegan melesat di antara struktur - struktur tiang baja jembatan. Aktor mengegas motornya di antara susunan tiang baja di bawah kanopi jembatan. Kamera mengayun kanan dan kiri, mengikuti pergerakan motor aktor. Bunga api memercik dari ban belakang motor, diikuti oleh suara derungan tajam dari motor. Kamera memotong ke sudut pandang depan dari motor yang melaju di jembatan tol. Motor melakukan adegan wheelie, di mana roda depan motor terangkat. Terdengar suara derungan mesin yang tajam. Pengendara motor mengangkat setir depan dari motor, mengangkat bagian depan motor di atas permukaan aspal. Aksi ini selama motor melaju kencang. Aktor mengebut cepat mendekati kamera. Seluruh tubuh motor terangkat dari permukaan aspal selama beberapa detik, sebelum motor akhirnya mendarat kembali di atas aspal. Kamera memotong menuju sudut belakang. Motor ditampilkan melaju ke depan jembatan. Kilatan dari lampu belakang motor membentuk garis merah yang meninggalkan bekas di layar iklan. Efek spesial membentuk kobaran api di pojok kiri layar. Kamera berpindah ke bawah motor. Motor mengangkat bodinya di atas udara sekali lagi. Tulisan “Find Your Fire” dengan font bulat tampil dari balik efek spesial api yang berkobar. Font bulat mensimulasikan tulisan yang ditulis oleh spidol putih di atas papan. Detail-detail tidak sempurna pada guratan huruf font memberi kesan organik pada font. Di bawah tulisan tersebut, terdapat cap merah bertuliskan “LIVE BOLD”, dengan kotak merah menutupi bagian belakang tulisan “BOLD”. Kamera kembali memotong ke depan motor. Tulisan masih ditampilkan di pojok kiri layar. Motor melaju kencang di jalan jembatan tol. Pengendara motor mengangkat setir motornya. Motor memasuki mode wheelie sekali lagi. Ban depan motor terangkat, kali ini dengan jarak lebih tinggi dibanding gerakan wheelie yang dilakukan sebelumnya, memberi kesan ekstrem dan menantang pada gerakan motor. Motor mempertahankan posisi ini selagi motor melaju kencang di jalan tol. Layar beralih ke layar hitam. Bercak digital tampil di layar iklan. Bercak-bercak ini berangsur beralih menjadi tulisan “L.A Bold”. Tulisan “L.A” ditampilkan dengan font bulat. Font ditampilkan dalam bentuk 3D, membuatnya kelihatan menonjol. Font ditampilkan dengan warna silver, di mana permukaan tulisan font ditampilkan mengkilat seperti permukaan baja yang mengkilap dan mulus. Font ditampilkan dengan tujuan akhir untuk menampilkan font seperti tulisan yang ditulis menggunakan tinta silver basah. Tulisan “Bold” juga ditampilkan dalam bentuk 3D yang menonjol, namun kali ini menggunakan font yang kaku. Tulisan diletakkan di pojok kanan bawah logo. Logo juga ditampilkan dengan warna silver mengkilap, namun kali ini diletakkan di atas backdrop kotak merah 3D. Kotak merah memiliki jarak ketinggian lebih tinggi dibandingkan kotak hitam yang menyokong tulisan “L.A”.

Iklan ini ditujukan untuk menciptakan imagery atau imajinasi yang kuat tentang kebebasan, kekuatan, dan semangat yang tidak kenal takut melalui metafora penggunaan api dan aksi-aksi ekstrem dalam berkendara. Adegan pertama dimulai dengan aktor yang secara simbolis menunjukkan kekuatan dan semangat bertarung dengan api yang memercik dari hantaman tangan, langsung memberikan kesan intensitas dan keberanian. Ini segera dilanjutkan dengan fokus pada aksi berkendara ekstrem yang melibatkan sepeda motor yang tidak hanya ditampilkan dengan modifikasi yang secara visual mengesankan (api dan bunga api), tapi juga keterampilan berkendara yang menegangkan seperti melaju kencang, drift, dan aksi wheelie. Penggunaan latar malam dan elemen arsitektural seperti jembatan tol menyuguhkan ide perjalanan, kebebasan, dan mengejar hasrat dengan terang-terangan. Pengaturan urban dan pencahayaan yang dramatis meningkatkan rasa petualangan dan kemandirian. Adegan yang menonjol dedikasi terhadap aksi ekstrem dan berkendara adalah ketika motor melakukan wheelie, sebuah unsur populer dalam aksi-aksi berkendara yang menantang dan sering dikaitkan dengan keberanian.

Kita akan melakukan analisa bagaimana iklan ini membentuk pembelajaran konsumen dalam psikologi konsumen. Ada 4 faktor yang membentuk pembelajaran konsumen; motivasi, persepsi, pembelajaran, dan memori. Tugas kita adalah menganalisa secara komprehensif dan mendalam bagaimana iklan ini membentuk pengalaman belajar konsumen yang menonton iklan ini. Kita akan mulai dari faktor pertama. Jelaskan secara komprehensif pembentukan faktor motivasi dalam iklan ini. Gunakan psikologi sebagai dasar. Jelaskan secara komprehensif. Tulis dalam gaya bahasa akademis. Tulis dalam 1000 kata.","output":"# Analisis Pembentukan Faktor Motivasi dalam Iklan L.A Bold Pendahuluan Dalam konteks psikologi konsumen, motivasi merupakan kekuatan pendorong di balik perilaku dan keputusan pembelian individu. Iklan, sebagai media komunikasi massal, sering direkayasa untuk memanipulasi motivasi konsumen dengan cara memunculkan kebutuhan atau keinginan yang kemudian dikaitkan dengan produk atau merek tertentu. Iklan rokok L.A Bold, melalui penggunaan simbolisme yang kuat, narasi visual, dan pengaruh psikologis, berusaha untuk membentuk pembelajaran konsumen dengan mempengaruhi faktor motivasi mereka. Analisis ini akan menjelaskan bagaimana keberadaan dan penyampaian iklan L.A Bold terhadap pembentukan faktor motivasi dalam psikologi konsumen. Kesadaran Akan Kebutuhan Dan Keinginan (Awareness of Need and Desire) Faktor motivasi dalam iklan L.A Bold dimulai dengan pemicu kesadaran konsumen tentang kebutuhan atau keinginan yang mungkin sebelumnya tidak mereka kenali. Secara psikologi, teori Hierarki Kebutuhan Maslow menjelaskan bagaimana kebutuhan dasar harus dipenuhi sebelum kebutuhan yang lebih tinggi dapat dilayani. Namun, iklan L.A Bold langsung menyasar kebutuhan pada tingkat \\"Esteem\\" (Penghargaan Diri) dan \\"Self-actualization\\" (Aktualisasi Diri), yang terletak di bagian atas hierarki. Iklan ini dengan cerdik mengaitkan produk dengan konsep ‘keberanian hidup’ dan 'menemukan api dalam diri', yang meresonansi dengan hasrat individu untuk mencapai potensi penuh mereka dan diperlakukan dengan penghormatan atau kekaguman oleh sekeliling mereka. Dalam hal ini, motivasi tidak hanya bersumber dari keinginan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan fisiologis, tetapi juga dari keinginan untuk mencapai perwujudan diri yang lebih tinggi dan pengakuan sosial. Pembangunan Persepsi dan Sikap (Construction of Perception and Attitude) Lebih lanjut, iklan L.A Bold memanfaatkan konsep persepsi dalam membentuk motivasi konsumen. Melalui penggunaan gambar dinamis berkendara malam yang ekstrem dan penggambaran sosok yang tak kenal takut, iklan ini menciptakan persepsi bahwa konsumsi produk tersebut identik dengan sifat-sifat heroik dan pemberontakan terhadap norma. Bermodal Teori Pembelajaran Sosial Bandura, dapat diasumsikan bahwa individu belajar dan di-motivasi melalui pengamatan, imitasi, dan modeling perilaku orang lain, dalam hal ini aktor dalam iklan. Konsumen diajak untuk membentuk sikap positif terhadap produk dengan cara mengasosiasikan produk dengan karakteristik yang diidam-idamkan: keberanian, kebebasan, dan pencapaian. Ini menunjukkan pengaruh signifikan iklan dalam mengubah atau memperkuat persepsi individu dan, pada gilirannya, memengaruhi motivasi mereka untuk bertindak sesuai dengan persepsi tersebut. Hardcore dan Memuaskan Kebutuhan Psikologis (Fulfilling Psychological Needs) Iklan ini tak hanya merangsang motivasi melalui pemaparan karakteristik yang dipersepsikan, tapi juga dengan memuaskan kebutuhan psikologis individu secara tidak langsung. Melalui adegan-adegan penuh aksi yang menampilkan kegembiraan, kekuatan, dan keberanian, iklan ini menyentuh pada konsep \\"pleasure principle\\" Freud, yang berargumen bahwa individu terdorong untuk mencari kesenangan dan menghindari ketidaknyamanan dalam rangka menyesuaikan diri dengan lingkungan. Motivasi, dalam konteks ini, diperkuat melalui janji kepuasan segera dan pencapaian status sosial yang lebih tinggi. Konsumen diajak untuk memercayai bahwa melalui konsumsi produk L.A Bold, kebutuhan emosional mereka akan dipenuhi dan bahkan lebih dari itu, mereka akan dilihat sebagai pribadi yang berani dan berstatus lebih tinggi dalam masyarakat. Fostering Brand Loyalty Through Emotional Attachment (Membangun Loyalitas Merek Melalui Keterkaitan Emosional) Terakhir, iklan ini berusaha untuk memotivasi pembelajaran dan loyalitas konsumen melalui pembentukan keterkaitan emosional dengan merek. Melalui tagline seperti \\"Find Your Fire\\" dan \\"Live Bold\\", iklan secara emosional menantang konsumen untuk berpikir tentang aspirasi pribadi mereka dan bagaimana produk tersebut dapat memfasilitasi pencapaian aspirasi tersebut. Hal ini berkaitan dengan teori keterlibatan afektif, yang menyarankan bahwa emosi berperan penting dalam proses pembelajaran dan bahwa keterlibatan emosional dengan suatu objek bisa meningkatkan kemungkinan loyalitas terhadap objek tersebut. Dengan mengaitkan produk dengan nilai-nilai emosional dan aspirasional yang mendalam, motivasi individu untuk memilih dan tetap setia kepada merek menjadi lebih kuat. Kesimpulan Melalui analisis komprehensif terhadap iklan L.A Bold, menjadi jelas bahwa pembentukan faktor motivasi dalam psikologi konsumen merupakan hasil dari interaksi kompleks antara kesadaran kebutuhan, pembangunan persepsi, pemenuhan kebutuhan psikologis, dan pembangunan keterkaitan emosional dengan merek. Iklan ini menggunakan kombinasi dari pesan visual yang memikat dan narasi yang menginspirasi untuk memotivasi konsumen tidak hanya dalam konteks pembelian produk, tapi juga dalam pembentukan identitas pribadi dan sosial. Dengan demikian, iklan tidak hanya menjadi alat pemasaran tapi juga media pembentukan dan pemahaman diri dalam masyarakat konsumen."},{"instruction":"i am writing a report on the construction of a small craft harbor how do i go about writing this section of the report. the gantt chart will feature in the appendix and i have the total project duration. :CONSTRUCTION PLANNING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT -This is a section dedicated to discussions to the following. • Construction sequence and schedule","output":"Writing a section on Construction Planning and Project Management for a report on the construction of a small craft harbor involves detailing the systematic steps and scheduling required to efficiently manage the project from start to completion.

House of Representatives: The House of Representatives is composed of 435 members, who are elected to two-year terms. The number of representatives from each state is based on its population, with each state guaranteed at least one representative. The Speaker of the House, who is elected by House members, presides over the chamber. In the United States, the two main political parties that dominate politics are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These parties have traditionally held power and have significant influence in national and local politics. Other smaller parties also exist, but the Democratic and Republican parties have been the most prominent and influential in shaping the country's political landscape. The main institution of the judicial branch is the Supreme Court of the United States. This highest court in the country has the final authority on interpreting the Constitution and has the power to review the decisions of lower courts. Additionally, the federal court system, including the district courts and appellate courts, plays a crucial role in the functioning of the judicial branch at both the federal and state levels. In the context of the United States, federalism is a fundamental principle of the country's political system, as power is shared between the federal government in Washington D.C. and the state governments. The U.S. Constitution delineates the powers of the federal government and reserves all other powers to the states, ensuring a division of authority between the two levels of government. This system allows for a degree of autonomy for the states while also creating a national government with authority over matters of national concern. This arrangement is intended to strike a balance between a strong, centralized government and local governmental autonomy. Other countries, such as Canada, Germany, and Australia, also have federal systems of government. The system of checks and balances is an important principle in the governance of a state, designed to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful. Its purpose is to ensure that the three branches of government – the executive, legislative, and judicial branches – remain balanced and accountable to each other. This system allows each branch to limit the powers of the other branches, thereby safeguarding against potential abuse of power and promoting good governance. By having each branch of government able to monitor and check the powers of the other branches, the system of checks and balances helps to maintain a separation of powers and promote a more stable and democratic government.","output":"1.

This section will succinctly bring together all elements of planning and management necessary for the successful completion of the harbor. # Construction Planning and Project Management Initial Phase: Preparation and Procurement The first step in the construction of our small craft harbor is site preparation, set to last 35 days. This phase includes critical early tasks such as procuring necessary equipment like excavators and cranes, designed to take approximately 6 days, under the assumption these are readily available and close by. Additionally, delineating and preparing a storage area for materials necessitates a further 21 days, to accommodate planning, area preparation, and signage installation. Simultaneously, the procurement of construction materials has been planned to span over 28 days, with specific durations allocated based on the supplier and material type – for example, concrete from Southshore Concrete is expected within 8 days given a week-long call-in advance and steel from Ocean Gear Inc. takes an estimated 18 days assuming availability. Site Mobilization and Breakwater Construction Following preparation, site mobilization, encompassing demolition and excavation, alongside environmental protection procedures, is planned for 4 days based on the capacities of mid-sized excavators and workforce assumptions from Soderlhom Marine Services. The breakwater construction, a critical component of the harbor, is projected at 98 days. This involves dredging the seabed, transporting materials (assumed to be concurrent with layer placement), and placing various material layers – core, filter, and armour. The timeline assumes an experienced crew and moderately equipped operations, as per Pacific Marine Construction’s capabilities, with particular attention to environmental and inspection considerations throughout. Marginal Wharf and Ancillaries The Marginal Wharf construction, including revetment, pile driving, and the construction of pile caps and decking, is slated for 82 days. This sequence ensures that structural integrity is maintained, with rebar installation, concrete pours, and subsequent curing phases accounted for. Notably, the setting of mooring cleats and the casting of the wheel guard are included, emphasizing the attention to detail necessary for operational integrity. Transitioning to secondary phases, the gangway and floating dock are allocated brief durations - 2 days and 6 days, respectively. The gangway installation includes casting into the concrete deck and attachment to the floating dock, highlighting the precision required in this phase. Conversely, the floating dock's piles will be driven simultaneously with those of the marginal wharf to optimize time, with an additional 3 days for dock section installation, considering soil condition allowances. Quality Control and Commissioning Quality Assurance and Control are critical throughout the project's duration, marked at 141 days. This process examines deliveries, on-site practices, environmental protections, and safety protocols, ensuring compliance and operational readiness. Following construction, commissioning is a capstone activity over 8 days to finalize the harbor's readiness for operation, including a comprehensive final walk-through. Conclusion The construction of the small craft harbor is an intricate process, strategized to ensure efficiency, safety, and environmental compliance. Our detailed Gantt chart, included in the appendix, visualizes this comprehensive plan, underscoring our commitment to project management excellence for timely and successful completion. The outlined assumptions, resource allocations, and schedules form the blueprint of our construction strategy, laying the foundation for the harbor's successful realization."},{"instruction":"She nodded, biting her lip as she drew a quiet strength from deep within her abdomen and exhaled for as long as she could , trembling as the contraction ended . She expelled the last twinges that cascaded over her hips , her moans dissolving the urge to push . “That’s it baby, breathe her down. “ he whispered, as she held his wrist , the strength of her next contraction making her rigid , stealing her breath as she poured her energy into a primal grunt, reigning it in as her thighs shook. She returned Liam’s hand to continue the familiar build to the junction of pleasure and pain, the mixture almost taking her under as she channeled the unbearable edge . Releasing a controlled, soft moan , she overrode the urge , finding equilibrium on the consuming edge of euphoria and agony. “This-is-so-in—uhh…mm-in-tense” , she breathed, collapsing against Liam’s arm , unable to speak as she panted out small moans. “I know , Lara, but you’ve got this. You’ve come so far and you’ve done such amazing work. I love you , and you can do this” he said, continuing his movements as she focused intently on his touch. She concentrated on each jolt of raw pleasure his touch created inside of her, as her baby moved down , and the familiar urge rolled over her once again. She panted hard, letting herself finally give an engulfing push at the very peak of her contraction. Controlling its length , she restrained the effort , instead breathing out the remaining desire as it dissipated in her gasps. “That was so incredible , baby, amazing first push” Liam praised in awe at the way she relaxed again in his arms , panting in blissful reprieve. Lara focused the nurses hands at he opening, and her low voice. “The head is crowning Lara, now this will be intense and if you feel any burning , I’m right here to help keep you lubricated . You keep up the amazing pushing, and if you’re perennial area becomes too thin we will deal with that very carefully. It’s all looking good Lara. The big moment is here” she encouraged , and Liam grasped his hand tightly. “I want to catch her when she-“the nurse , focusing on Lara’s slow progress , gestures toward the baby’s emerging head. “You’d better get down here then Dad, shes on her way.” Liam ran his hand across Lara’s abdomen as he moved to position himself between her thighs. The nurse guided his hand to cradle the emerging head of his daughter , and he lifted his gaze to lock eyes with his wife, as bore down, channeling the urge that stole her breathe and her voice. She couldn’t even manage a grunt as she breathlessly pushed the head out into Liam’s waiting hand. The room remained silent she fell back, gasping, and the nurse informed her “you did it Lara , but I’m really going to need you to focus hard, and pant for me , while I clear her umbilical cord. Don’t push Lara . “ she took over from Liam’s cradling of his daughter as he repositioned himself at Lara’s side , as she gripped his shirt and drained her knuckles white. “Li-uhhh-“ . Liam righted his grip on hers as he urged .” Just vocus on my voice Lara , no one else is here alright. Pant through it. “ Lara’s desperate pants punctured the air as she rested her head against Liam’s , his deep stare the only place she found the strength to ride each breath u til the urge faded. “great job Lara , the cord is clear , really amazing work, now the first shoulder is coming, nice deep breaths for me …” Liam held Lara’s head in his palms , planting a kiss on her forehead as she leaned against his forehead , still panting. “You’d -better-uhhh -catc-“ Lara fell away into a deep push , her abdomen shaking as Liam kept his hand on her pelvis, applying counter pressure. The nurse continued supporting the baby as Lara gasped against Liam’s arm. “There’s something…uhhhh-ah-I can’t -“. Liam’s eyes flashed with concern as the nurse reassured. “The shoulders are on a bit of an angle , this is a perfectly normal, but challenging thing. But you can Lara, you already ate. this baby is still coming-“ Liam squeezed his fingers against Lara’s abdomen, creating a firm line of comforting sensation between her hips. “she’s coming Lara, we’re all here , she’s so close, baby.soo close.”","output":"The story you've provided vividly describes the intense, emotional, and physical journey of childbirth, shared between a woman named Lara and her partner, Liam. It captures the deep connection and support system between the couple, highlighting Liam's pivotal role in offering emotional and physical support throughout the labor process. The narrative also underscores the healthcare professional's expertise and reassurance during critical moments, ensuring safety and comfort for both mother and baby. This moment epitomizes the raw, unfiltered experience of childbirth, involving a mix of pain, joy, anticipation, and love. Lara's journey through contractions, the primal urge to push, and the subsequent birth of her child, all while being supported by Liam, showcases the strength and resilience inherent in the process of bringing life into the world. Their collective focus, determination, and intimate connection serve as the backbone of this intense experience, culminating in the transformative moment of meeting their child for the first time. Such a narrative is a poignant reminder of the beauty and challenges of childbirth, highlighting the importance of support, love, and trust between partners during this profound life event. It also emphasizes the critical role of skilled healthcare providers in navigating the complexities of labor and delivery, ensuring the health and well-being of both mother and child."},{"instruction":"What part is most challenging","output":"The narrative you've shared encompasses several challenging aspects of childbirth, both physically and emotionally. However, one of the most challenging parts appears to be the moment when Lara needs to focus intensely to avoid pushing while the nurse clears the baby's umbilical cord. This is a critical and delicate situation, as pushing before the cord is cleared could potentially create complications for both the baby and Lara. During childbirth, the urge to push can be overwhelming due to the intense pressure and contractions. Being told to hold back on that natural impulse requires immense self-control and trust in the medical professionals assisting with the delivery. At this moment, Lara has to override her body's demands, relying solely on panting and focusing on Liam's voice to get through the intense urges without pushing. This not only tests her physical strength but also her emotional resilience, as she navigates this high-stakes situation under considerable stress and pain. Additionally, this moment underscores the complexity of childbirth, where unexpected situations can arise, requiring swift and knowledgeable intervention by healthcare professionals. The presence of the umbilical cord around the baby's neck is a common yet potentially serious occurrence that needs to be managed carefully to prevent distress or injury to the baby. Lara's ability to pant and refrain from pushing, despite her body's overwhelming urge to do so, and the teamwork between Liam and the healthcare professionals to ensure both her and the baby's safety, highlight the story's most challenging segment. This scenario encapsulates the unpredictability of labor, the importance of support, and the need for a calm and focused response in the face of potential complications."},{"instruction":"What’s realistic","output":"The narrative you've shared captures several aspects of childbirth that are realistic and resonate with the actual experiences of many women and their partners during labor. Here are a few elements that stand out for their authenticity: 1. **Intensity of Contractions**: The vivid description of Lara's experience with contractions portrays the intense, often overwhelming nature of this part of childbirth. The physical sensations, including the pain, pressure, and the urge to push, are described in a manner that aligns well with the physiological process of labor. 2. **Breathing and Focusing Techniques**: The emphasis on breathing and focus during labor is a realistic portrayal of strategies often used to manage pain and facilitate the delivery process. The narrative highlights how Lara relies on controlled breathing and focusing on Liam’s touch and voice, which is reflective of techniques taught in childbirth preparation classes. 3. **Partner Support**: Liam's role as a supportive partner is a realistic element that underscores the importance of having a supportive person present during childbirth. His physical presence, emotional support, and verbal encouragement reflect the active role that many partners take in the delivery room to support the birthing person. 4. **Communication with Healthcare Providers**: The dialogue and interactions with the healthcare provider (the nurse) reflect a realistic scenario where communication is crucial. The nurse's guidance on when to push and when to hold back, her assessment of the situation (crowning, checking for umbilical cord), and her instructions for Lara to pant through a delicate moment are all indicative of the professional support provided during childbirth. 5. **Physical and Emotional Challenge**: The portrayal of childbirth as both a physical and emotional journey captures the essence of the experience. Lara’s fluctuating emotions, her physical exertion, the pain, and the moments of relief are all part of the complex tapestry of giving birth. 6. **Concerns About Complications**: The narrative's mention of potential complications, such as the baby's shoulders being at an angle and the need to clear the umbilical cord, adds a layer of realism. These concerns are very much part of the unpredictability of labor and delivery, emphasizing the necessity of professional medical intervention during childbirth. By focusing on these elements, the story offers a glimpse into the multifaceted nature of childbirth, combining the physical, emotional, and medical aspects into a coherent narrative. While each childbirth experience is unique, these aspects provide a realistic backdrop to the diverse experiences of labor and delivery."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo where the animated movie Dreambuilders ripped off Inside Out, One user says \\"Since Inside Out takes place in the body (kind of, it's in the brain) it technically copied Osmosis Jones, even though the plots are nothing alike\\"","output":"Thread Title: Did \\"Dreambuilders\\" Really Rip Off \\"Inside Out\\"? MovieBuff01: Hey everyone, I've seen a lot of chatter recently about how \\"Dreambuilders\\" supposedly ripped off \\"Inside Out.\\" While I get there are similarities in exploring internal worlds, I feel like it's a bit of a stretch. What does everyone else think? ComicNerd22: Totally agree, MovieBuff01. It's a common trope to explore internal worlds in animation, and while there are bound to be similarities, it doesn't necessarily mean one ripped off the other. Each movie brings its unique flavor to the table. ClassicCinemaLover: Interesting discussion! But, if we're talking about movies exploring internal worlds, shouldn't we mention \\"Osmosis Jones\\"? Since \\"Inside Out\\" takes place in the body (kind of, it's in the brain), it technically copied \\"Osmosis Jones\\", even though the plots are nothing alike. AnimeFan98: That's a stretch, ClassicCinemaLover. \\"Osmosis Jones\\" is more about fighting diseases inside the body, while \\"Inside Out\\" is an emotional journey. The only common ground is the concept of exploring internal worlds, but the execution and themes are entirely different. SciFiGeek24: Speaking of similarities, almost every story has been told in one form or another. It boils down to execution. \\"Osmosis Jones\\" and \\"Inside Out\\" tackled very different subjects within the 'internal world' trope. And \\"Dreambuilders\\" has its own take, focusing on the world of dreams. Each one has unique characters, plot, and messages. MovieBuff01: Exactly, SciFiGeek24! Inspiration is taken from everywhere, and this 'internal world' trope isn't new. The key is what each movie does with the concept. \\"Dreambuilders\\" exploring the world of dreams is as valid as \\"Inside Out\\" focusing on emotions. FantasyFanatic101: Plus, borrowing elements or being inspired by previous works isn't new in the creative industry. As long as it's not a blatant copy, it’s just part of creating new content. \\"Dreambuilders,\\" \\"Inside Out,\\" and \\"Osmosis Jones\\" each contribute uniquely to the genre. ComicNerd22: Well said, FantasyFanatic101. It's all about adding to the conversation, not stealing from it. Each of these movies has its place and brings something new to the table. Let's appreciate them for their creativity and the different perspectives they offer. ClassicCinemaLover: You all make fair points. It's probably too simplistic to say one movie copies another just because they share a concept. It's more about what they do with that concept that matters. I guess I was just playing devil's advocate there. 😄 MovieBuff01: Great discussion, everyone! It's clear that while movies can share themes or concepts, it's their unique contributions that we should focus on. It only enriches the genre and gives us more fantastic worlds to explore.

Governments around the world are scrambling to contain the spread of \\"The Red Death,\\" implementing stringent travel restrictions, initiating full lockdowns in severely affected areas, and launching emergency research programs to find a vaccine or cure. However, efforts have been hampered by the virus's unprecedented transmission rate and resistance to existing antiviral drugs. One of the more chilling aspects of this outbreak is the origin of the virus, which remains shrouded in mystery. Some experts speculate that Thrax could be the result of zoonotic transmission, possibly originating from bats or other wildlife, similar to previous deadly viruses. Others fear that its rapid spread and high mortality rate may point to a more sinister man-made origin. However, these theories remain unconfirmed as scientists worldwide race to understand and combat this lethal pathogen. UN Secretary-General António Guterres addressed the world in a recent emergency meeting, stating, \\"We are facing an unprecedented challenge with 'The Red Death.' It is a reminder of how vulnerable we are and how our fates are intertwined. Now, more than ever, we must unite in our fight against this horrifying disease.\\" Public health experts are urging everyone to practice extreme caution, adhere to health guidelines, and stay informed through official channels. The world stands at a precipice, facing a threat that could have far-reaching and dire consequences for global health, economies, and the very social fabric of society. As research intensifies, there remains a glimmer of hope that a breakthrough will be found. Until then, \\"The Red Death\\" continues its relentless march across continents, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake and a world grappling with fear and uncertainty."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where it suddenly stops after almost killing a man named Frank DeTorre","output":"**Miraculous End to \\"The Red Death\\" Pandemic After Near-Fatal Case Turns Tide** In an astonishing turn of events, the lethal pandemic caused by the Thrax virus, notoriously known as \\"The Red Death,\\" has come to an abrupt halt following a nearly fatal case involving a man identified only as Frank DeTorre. This unexpected development has left scientists baffled and given a glimmer of hope to a world paralyzed by fear and uncertainty for months. Frank DeTorre, a resident of Hope Springs, became infected with the virus in what appeared to be a sure fatal case given the pathogen's unprecedented 77% mortality rate. However, in a twist that has captured global attention, DeTorre's condition began to improbably improve after reaching critical status. Within days of what many anticipated would be the end, DeTorre miraculously recovered, marking the world's first recorded case of complete recovery from \\"The Red Death.\\" Scientists and doctors rushed to Hope Springs, transforming it into a research hub overnight. Preliminary findings revealed that DeTorre's immune response to the Thrax virus exhibited unique characteristics that not only neutralized the virus in his body but also seemed to prevent its transmission to others. \\"This is nothing short of miraculous,\\" stated Dr. Lena Haloway, head of the international task force on \\"The Red Death.\\" \\"Mr. DeTorre's case has provided us with invaluable data. His immune system reacted to Thrax in a way we haven't seen before. It's as if his body unlocked the key to defeating the virus.\\" In the weeks following DeTorre's recovery, reports of new infections began to plummet unexpectedly across the globe. Medical teams dispatched worldwide confirmed that the virus's spread had inexplicably stopped. Scientists are currently investigating whether this sudden cessation is directly linked to the unique antibodies found in DeTorre's blood. Amid this breakthrough, governments have started lifting travel restrictions and lockdown measures, and communities are cautiously beginning to rebuild in the aftermath of the crisis. The global economy, which took an unprecedented hit during the pandemic, shows early signs of recovery as markets respond positively to the news. \\"This event has humbled us all,\\" remarked WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \\"It's a reminder of how much we don't know and how unity and resilience can bring us through the darkest times. Frank DeTorre's case will undeniably be a significant chapter in medical history.\\" Efforts are now underway to synthesize a vaccine derived from the antibody in DeTorre's blood, with preliminary trials showing promise. While the world is far from returning to pre-pandemic normalcy, the sudden end to \\"The Red Death\\" pandemic offers a beacon of hope and a testament to the human spirit's indomitable resilience. As communities worldwide breathe a collective sigh of relief, the focus now shifts toward recovery and a concerted effort to prepare for future threats with a newfound sense of solidarity and understanding. The name Frank DeTorre, once ordinary, will forever be remembered as the man who unwittingly saved the world from the brink of collapse."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up confirming its fake and is just taken from the plot of a animated/live action movie","output":"**Clarification: Unfolding \\"Miracle\\" of Thrax Virus Resolution Revealed to be Plot of Beloved Film** In an extraordinary twist to an already unbelievable story, it has been revealed that the recent reports surrounding the miraculous end of the Thrax virus pandemic, culminating in the near-death and subsequent recovery of an individual named Frank DeTorre, directly parallel the plot of the popular animated/live-action movie, \\"Osmosis Jones.\\" The revelations have prompted widespread astonishment and a mix of reactions across the globe. The story of \\"The Red Death\\" pandemic, characterized by its alarming mortality rate and the subsequent inexplicable halt in its spread following DeTorre's recovery, closely mirrors the narrative arc of the 2001 Warner Bros film. In \\"Osmosis Jones,\\" Frank Detorre is an unhealthy zookeeper whose body becomes the battleground for a dramatic fight against a deadly virus named Thrax. The climax sees the virus defeated in a nail-biting sequence that bears an uncanny resemblance to the recent reports misleadingly published and circulated worldwide. Upon further investigation and admission by sources, it has become clear that the information was mistakenly or perhaps whimsically reported as fact, blurring the lines between cinematic fiction and real-world events. The global response to the fabricated news story underscores the power of storytelling and the profound impact cinema can have on the public imagination. Experts in media and psychology have weighed in, noting the phenomenon as a testament to the human need for hope and the appeal of narratives that showcase triumph over adversity. \\"In times of real-world crises, it's natural for populations to cling to stories that offer solutions, no matter how fantastical,\\" explained Dr. Maria Kellog, a professor of media studies. \\"This incident reveals our collective desire for heroes and the enduring appeal of underdog stories.\\" Warner Bros, the studio behind \\"Osmosis Jones,\\" has issued a statement expressing both surprise and delight at the unexpected resurgence of interest in the film. \\"While 'Osmosis Jones' is a work of fiction, we're pleased to see that it continues to inspire and entertain audiences around the world, even in the most unforeseen ways,\\" the statement read. In light of these developments, officials and news organizations are issuing retractions and apologies for any confusion caused by the distribution of the fictional narrative as factual news. Media analysts stress the importance of rigorous fact-checking and source verification to prevent similar mix-ups in the future. As the world comes to grips with the misreport, the story serves as a unique reminder of the intersecting realms of fiction and reality, and the essential human capacity for belief in the face of adversity. While \\"The Red Death\\" pandemic remains firmly within the realm of fiction, the true challenges facing our world continue to require real solutions, unity, and above all, a steadfast commitment to distinguishing fact from fiction."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"\\"Passionate Blossom Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Beauty with Bouquet | Versatile Art for Mugs, Tees, Paintings | Sophisticated Floral Wall Fantasy\\""},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Passionate Blossom Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Beauty with Bouquet | Versatile Art for Mugs, Tees, Paintings | Sophisticated Floral Wall Fantasy.

Aquí te enumero algunas de las funciones más comunes en diferentes ámbitos: 1. **Autenticación**: Los sellos se utilizan para autenticar o certificar la veracidad y origen de documentos. Por ejemplo, en documentos legales, gubernamentales o corporativos, el sello indica que el documento proviene de una fuente oficial o autorizada. 2. **Seguridad**: En algunos casos, los sellos se utilizan como medida de seguridad para evitar la falsificación o alteración de documentos. Un sello difícil de replicar añade una capa de protección contra el fraude. 3. **Reconocimiento**: En el ámbito educativo, profesional, o en premiaciones, los sellos pueden servir como reconocimiento de logros, certificaciones o acreditaciones importantes. 4. **Organización y clasificación**: Los sellos también pueden ser herramientas prácticas para organizar y clasificar documentos o productos. Por ejemplo, en una oficina de correos, los sellos pueden indicar el tratamiento o categoría del envío (urgente, frágil, etc.). 5. **Decoración**: En algunas culturas y contextos, los sellos tienen un valor estético o decorativo. Los sellos de lacre, por ejemplo, se han utilizado históricamente para sellar cartas, y hoy en día pueden emplearse también con fines decorativos o en trabajos de scrapbooking y manualidades. 6. **Identificación**: Los sellos pueden usarse para marcar o identificar propiedad, indicando que un objeto pertenece a una persona, empresa, o institución específica. 7. **Comercial**: En el mundo de la filatelia (colección de sellos), los sellos postales tienen un valor comercial que puede variar según su rareza, historia y demanda entre los coleccionistas. 8. **Comunicación cultural y educativa**: Muchos sellos postales son diseñados para conmemorar eventos históricos, celebrar la cultura, resaltar la flora y fauna de una región, entre otros temas. Esto los convierte en herramientas de comunicación cultural y educativa. 9. **Arte y expresión personal**: En el ámbito artístico y personal, los sellos se utilizan para expresar creatividad, ya sea en proyectos de arte, diarios, cartas personales, etc. Los sellos pueden ser diseñados a medida y reflejar gustos personales o mensajes específicos. La función específica de un sello, entonces, dependerá en gran medida del contexto en el que se utilice y del propósito que se busque alcanzar con su uso."},{"instruction":"Hablo de un sello que impide a un personaje usar su poder lo limita y este solo puede acceder a su poder por un tiempo limitado dependiendo de cuan fuerte sea puede acceder a más poder es un seguro tanto para el como para los demás este sello fue auto impuesto","output":"El tipo de sello al que te refieres, ubicado en el ámbito de la fantasía o la ficción, actúa como una medida de control o limitante sobre los poderes de un personaje. Este concepto es frecuentemente explorado en narrativas donde los personajes poseen habilidades sobrenaturales o mágicas que, si no se controlan, podrían resultar peligrosas tanto para sí mismos como para el mundo que les rodea. La función principal de dicho sello puede desglosarse de la siguiente manera: 1. **Control**: La función más obvia es controlar el acceso del personaje a sus propias habilidades, asegurando que solo pueda utilizar su poder de manera limitada. Esto puede ser una forma de prevenir el uso excesivo o indebido del poder, especialmente si este tiene el potencial de ser destructivo o corruptor. 2. **Protección**: Al limitar su poder, el sello actúa como una medida de protección para el propio usuario, evitando que el poder lo sobrepase, lo corrompa o le cause daño por un uso excesivo o incontrolado. Asimismo, sirve para proteger a los demás de los efectos potencialmente devastadores de dicho poder. 3. **Desarrollo del personaje**: Desde una perspectiva narrativa, un sello autoimpuesto introduce un interesante conflicto interno y desarrollo del personaje. Este tipo de limitante puede ser un mecanismo para explorar temas como la responsabilidad, el autocontrol, la tentación y la lucha interna del personaje para manejar su don sin que este lo defina o destruya. 4. **Barrera psicológica**: A menudo, más allá del límite físico o mágico impuesto por el sello, existe un componente psicológico. El personaje debe lidiar emocionalmente con sus limitaciones y aprender a superarlas o adaptarse a ellas, lo que añade profundidad y complejidad a la narrativa. 5. **Herramienta narrativa para el suspenso y la tensión**: Desde un punto de vista de construcción de la trama, el sello puede ser usado para generar suspenso y tensión. Los momentos en los que el personaje logra superar o eludir temporalmente las restricciones del sello pueden ser cruciales y emocionantes para el desarrollo de la historia. 6. **Metafórica**: Finalmente, un sello de este tipo puede ser una metáfora de las limitaciones humanas, tanto físicas como morales. Refleja la idea de que el verdadero poder viene con restricciones y responsabilidades, y que el autocontrol es tanto o más importante que las habilidades sobrehumanas en sí. Este tipo de sello, por lo tanto, es una rica herramienta narrativa que aporta mucha versatilidad a las historias de géneros fantásticos y de superhéroes, permitiendo explorar diversas temáticas profundas y conflictos emocionantes."},{"instruction":"para sa iyo ano ang pagiging mamamayan","output":"Para sa akin, ang pagiging mamamayan ay may malalim at komprehensibong kahulugan. Ito ay hindi lamang tungkol sa legal na katayuan o pagkakaroon ng isang partikular na pagkakakilanlan sa isang bansa. Sa halip, ito ay isang multi-dimensional na konsepto na sumasaklaw sa mga sumusunod na aspeto: 1. **Responsibilidad**: Bilang mga mamamayan, mayroon tayong mga responsibilidad sa ating kapwa, sa ating komunidad, at sa ating bansa. Kasama dito ang pagsunod sa batas, pagbabayad ng buwis, at pagiging mabuting halimbawa sa lipunan. 2. **Karakter**: Ipinapakita ng isang mamamayan ang integridad, katapatan, at kabayanihan kahit sa harap ng mga hamon. Isinusulong niya ang kapakanan ng nakararami at hindi lamang ang pansariling interes. 3. **Partisipasyon**: Ang aktibong pakikilahok sa mga gawaing pampulitika at panlipunan ay mahalaga. Ito'y maaaring sa pamamagitan ng pagboto, pakikilahok sa mga diskusyon ukol sa mga patakaran ng gobyerno, o pagsali sa mga boluntaryong aktibidad na nagpapabuti sa kalagayan ng komunidad. 4. **Edukasyon**: Ang pagiging isang informado at edukadong mamamayan ay mahalaga para makagawa ng mga tamang desisyon lalo na sa mga bagay na nakakaapekto sa lipunan. Ang patuloy na pag-aaral at pag-unawa sa mga isyu ng bansa ay mahalaga upang mapanatili ang isang malusog na demokrasya. 5. **Pagsasaalang-alang sa Kapaligiran**: Ang pagiging responsableng mamamayan ay nangangahulugan rin ng pag-aalaga sa ating kapaligiran. Itinataguyod nito ang ideya ng sustenableng pag-unlad at ang pangangalaga ng ating likas na yaman para sa mga susunod pang henerasyon. 6. **Pagiging Inklusibo at Pagpapakita ng Pagkakapantay-pantay**: Dapat ay may kakayahan ang isang mamamayan na tanggapin at irespeto ang pagkakaiba-iba ng mga tao, kabilang ang kanilang lahi, relihiyon, orientasyong seksuwal, at iba pang mga aspeto. Ang pagkakaroon ng isang inklusibong lipunan ay mahalaga sa pagbuo ng isang malusog at maunlad na bansa. Sa kabuuan, ang pagiging isang mamamayan ay nangangailangan ng aktibong partisipasyon at dedikasyon sa paggawa ng mabuti hindi lamang para sa sarili kundi para rin sa ikabubuti ng buong lipunan.

Sa madaling salita, ito ay awtomatikong nakuha dahil sa mga sumusunod na pangyayari: - Ang isa o kapwa magulang ay mamamayan ng Pilipinas sa panahon ng kanilang kapanganakan. - Sila ay isinilang sa Pilipinas at itinuturing na Pilipino ayon sa mga pamantayan ng Saligang Batas. Karaniwan, ang katutubong inianak na mamamayan ay hindi kinakailangang dumaan sa proseso ng naturalisasyon o anumang legal na proseso upang mapatunayan ang kanilang pagkamamamayan. 2. **Naturalisadong Mamamayan (Naturalized Citizens):** Tumutukoy ito sa mga indibidwal na hindi ipinanganak sa Pilipinas o ipinanganak sa ibang bansa sa mga magulang na hindi mga mamamayang Pilipino, ngunit matagumpay na dumaan sa proseso ng naturalisasyon. Ibig sabihin, nakakumpleto sila ng legal na proseso na itinakda ng gobyerno upang maipagkaloob sa kanila ang pagkamamamayang Pilipino. Kasama sa prosesong ito ang pag-aaral tungkol sa kasaysayan at kultura ng Pilipinas, pagpapakitang mayroon silang magandang moral na karakter, at pagsasalita ng isa sa mga opisyal na wika ng Pilipinas, bukod sa iba pang requirements. Ang pagiging naturalisadong mamamayan ay nangangahulugang kinikilala ang kanilang mga karapatan at responsibilidad bilang mga mamamayan ng Pilipinas, ngunit sa ilalim ng ilang kondisyon o restriksyon kumpara sa mga katutubong inianak na mamamayan, lalo na pagdating sa ilang partikular na karapatan tulad ng paghawak ng mga tiyak na posisyon sa gobyerno o ang pagmamay-ari ng lupa.

Narito ang pagpapaliwanag sa bawat isa: # 1. **Jus Soli (Right of Soil)** Ang prinsipyong \\"jus soli\\" ay nangangahulugang ang pagkamamamayan ay nakabatay sa lugar ng kapanganakan. Ito ay ginagamit sa ilang bansa tulad ng United States, kung saan ang karamihan ng mga taong ipinanganak sa loob ng teritoryo ng bansa ay awtomatikong kinikilala bilang mga mamamayan, anuman ang nasyonalidad ng kanilang mga magulang. Ang prinsipyong ito ay nagbibigay-diin sa halaga ng pisikal na koneksyon sa lupa o teritoryo ng bansa bilang pundasyon ng pagkamamamayan. # 2. **Jus Sanguinis (Right of Blood)** Ang \\"jus sanguinis,\\" sa kabilang banda, ay isang prinsipyo kung saan ang pagkamamamayan ay nakabatay sa nasyonalidad o pagkamamamayan ng isa o parehong magulang, anuman ang lugar ng kapanganakan ng bata. Karamihan ng mga bansa, kabilang ang Pilipinas, ay sumusunod sa prinsipyong ito. Nangangahulugan ito na kung ang isa o parehong magulang ay mamamayan ng isang partikular na bansa, ang kanilang mga anak ay maaari ring maging mamamayan ng bansang iyon, kahit na sila ay ipinanganak sa ibang bansa. # Pagkakaiba at Paggamit Ang dalawang prinsipyong ito ay nagsisilbing pundasyon sa mga batas sa pagkamamamayan sa iba't ibang bansa, at nagpapakita ng pagkakaiba-iba sa kung paano nila tinutukoy ang pagkamamamayan at ang proseso ng pagtamo nito. Sa ilang mga kaso, ang mga bansa ay maaaring gumamit ng kombinasyon ng parehong prinsipyo sa kanilang batas sa pagkamamamayan. Halimbawa, habang ang Pilipinas ay pangunahing sumusunod sa prinsipyo ng \\"jus sanguinis,\\" mayroon ding mga tiyak na sitwasyon kung saan ang \\"jus soli\\" ay maaaring magkaroon ng aplikasyon base sa partikular na mga batas o patakaran. Ang pag-intindi sa dalawang prinsipyong ito ay mahalaga sa pag-unawa sa mga komplikadong isyu tungkol sa pagkamamamayan, migrasyon, at karapatang sibil at pampulitika ng mga indibidwal sa isang pandaigdigang konteksto."},{"instruction":"mamamayan ba o hindi si marga ay naka asawa ng dayuhan at dun sila nanirahan kung saan nakatira","output":"Batay sa general na prinsipyo ng pagkamamamayan sa maraming bansa at sa konteksto ng 1987 Saligang Batas ng Pilipinas, kung si Marga ay isang Pilipinong mamamayan na nagpakasal sa isang dayuhan at nanirahan sa bansa ng kanyang asawa, itinuturing pa rin siyang mamamayan ng Pilipinas.

Ayon sa Artikulo IV, Seksyon 4 ng 1987 Saligang Batas ng Pilipinas, mananatili ang pagkamamamayan ng mga Pilipinong mag-aasawa ng mga dayuhan maliban na lamang kung sa kanilang kagustuhan at aktibong kilos, sila ay nagtakwil nito sa legal na proseso. Nangangahulugan ito na hangga't hindi siya aktibong renouncing o tinatanggihan ang kanyang pagkamamamayang Pilipino sa pamamagitan ng legal na paraan, siya ay mananatiling mamamayan ng Pilipinas. Mahalagang tandaan na ang pagiging mamamayan ay hindi lamang question ng pisikal na presensya sa loob ng isang bansa. Ito rin ay tungkol sa legal na estado at mga karapatan at responsibilidad na kasama nito. Kung si Marga ay magdesisyon na mag-aplay para sa citizenship sa bansa kung saan sila naninirahan, ang proseso at mga posibleng implications ng dual citizenship ay dapat niyang pag-aralan ayon sa mga batas ng parehong bansa. Gayundin, ang pagkakaroon ng citizenship sa ibang bansa (kung pipiliin niya ito) ay maaaring may epekto sa kanyang legal na status at karapatan bilang isang Pilipino, depende sa mga batas ng Pilipinas patungkol sa dual citizenship. Ang Republic Act No. 9225, o ang \\"Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003,\\" halimbawa, ay nagpapahintulot sa mga natural-born Filipinos na maging dual citizens kung sila ay naging citizens ng iba pang bansa sa pamamagitan ng naturalization."},{"instruction":"1971 siya gipanganak mp or hmp mamayaan or hindi","output":"Para sa isang indibidwal na ipinanganak noong 1971, ang pagtukoy kung siya ay isang mamamayan ng Pilipinas o hindi ay nakadepende sa ilang mga salik, batay sa mga prinsipyo ng pagkamamamayan na itinakda ng Saligang Batas ng Pilipinas. Sa konteksto ng Pilipinas, ang pagkamamamayan ay karaniwang ibinabatay sa \\"jus sanguinis\\" (karapatan ng dugo), kung saan ang pagkamamamayan ay nakukuha mula sa pagkamamamayan ng mga magulang, at sa \\"jus soli\\" (karapatan ng lupa) para sa tiyak na mga kaso bago ang 1973 na kung saan ang ina ay Pilipino at pinili ang pagkamamamayang Pilipino pagsapit sa karampatang gulang. Ang iyong katanungan ay nangangailangan ng paglilinaw: 1. **\\"MP\\" o \\"HMP\\"**: Hindi malinaw ang ibig sabihin ng mga acronym na ito sa konteksto ng iyong tanong. Kung ito ay tumutukoy sa isang partikular na sitwasyon o kondisyon, mangyaring magbigay ng karagdagang detalye. 2. **Pagkamamamayan**: Sa pangkalahatan, kung ang isang indibidwal (ipinanganak noong 1971) ay anak ng isa o parehong magulang na mamamayang Pilipino sa oras ng kanyang kapanganakan, siya ay itinuturing na mamamayan ng Pilipinas. Ang pagkakaroon ng Pilipinong magulang ay pangunahing salik ng pagkamamamayan batay sa \\"jus sanguinis\\". 3. **Pagkamamamayan batay sa 1973 Konstitusyon**: Bagamat ang indibidwal na ipinanganak noong 1971 ay sakop pa sa ilalim ng 1935 Saligang Batas, na naging epektibo hanggang sa pagpapatupad ng 1973 Saligang Batas, ang mga prinsipyo ng \\"jus sanguinis\\" ay hindi nagbago nang malaki sa mga sumunod na Saligang Batas, kasama na ang 1987 Saligang Batas. Kung ang iyong tanong ay may kinalaman sa isang spesipikong legal na sitwasyon o kumplikadong kondisyon ng pagkamamamayan, mahalaga ang konsultasyon sa isang abogado o legal na eksperto na may sapat na kaalaman sa batas ng pagkamamamayan ng Pilipinas. Hindi rin dapat kaligtaan ang pagtingin sa mga posibleng epekto ng naturalisasyon o pagkakaroon ng dobleng pagkamamamayan, kung applicable."},{"instruction":"pero hindi pilipino ang isang magulang mo","output":"Kung ang isang magulang mo ay hindi Pilipino at ikaw ay ipinanganak noong 1971, ang iyong pagkamamamayan ay maaaring matukoy batay sa ilang mga salik na kinikilala ng batas ng Pilipinas. Ayon sa prinsipyo ng \\"jus sanguinis\\" (karapatan ng dugo), na siyang pangunahing batayan ng pagkamamamayan sa Pilipinas, ang pagkamamamayan ay nakukuha mula sa pagkamamamayan ng mga magulang. Batay sa Saligang Batas ng 1987 ng Pilipinas, narito ang mga posibleng sitwasyon para sa iyong kaso: 1. **Kung ang iyong Pilipinong magulang ay iyong ina at ikaw ay ipinanganak bago sumapit ang Enero 17, 1973**: Ayon sa Artikulo IV, Seksiyon 1 (3) ng 1987 Saligang Batas ng Pilipinas, mga indibidwal na isinilang bago sumapit ang Enero 17, 1973, na ang mga ina ay Pilipino ay maaaring pumanig sa pagkamamamayang Pilipino pagsapit ng karampatang gulang. 2. **Kung ang iyong Pilipinong magulang ay iyong ama at ikaw ay ipinanganak pagkatapos ng Enero 17, 1973**: Sa prinsipyong \\"jus sanguinis,\\" ikaw ay itinuturing na mamamayan ng Pilipinas mula sa pagsilang kung ang iyong ama, na Pilipino, ay iyong legal na magulang sa oras ng iyong kapanganakan, kahit na hindi Pilipino ang iyong ina. 3. **Kung ang iyong Pilipinong magulang ay iyong ama at ikaw ay ipinanganak bago ang Enero 17, 1973, ngunit hindi kasal ang iyong mga magulang**: Maaaring nangangailangan ka ng karagdagang legal na paggabay para patunayan ang iyong pagkamamamayan, dahil sa mga panahong iyon ang pagkamamamayang Pilipino ay madalas na kinikilala sa pamamagitan ng paternal lineage batay sa legal na kasal ng mga magulang. Sa lahat ng mga sitwasyong ito, mahalaga ang opisyal na dokumentasyon (tulad ng birth certificate, mga dokumento ng magulang, atbp.) upang mapatunayan ang iyong pagkamamamayan. Para sa mga espesipikong kaso o kumplikadong legal na mga isyu, mainam pa ring kumonsulta sa isang abogado na may karanasan sa batas sa pagkamamamayan para sa tumpak na payo at gabay."},{"instruction":"Create a completely different origin for Catwoman from DC Comics. Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"**A Dahlia in Gotham: The Sylvan Origins of Catwoman** **Year of Birth: 1986, Gotham City** Selina Kyle, unknown to Gotham's records, was born amidst the urban sprawl, her arrival in this world shrouded in mystery. Abandoned at a tender age, she was discovered by an eccentric botanist, Dr. Callista Vine, in the heart of Gotham's East End. Callista, a recluse devoted to her botanical research, saw in Selina an unexpected companion and took her under her wing. **Childhood Among the Green (1986-2000)** Growing up in a greenhouse more than a home, Selina's world was one of flora and fauna, an oasis amidst the concrete desert of Gotham. Here, under Dr. Vine's tutelage, she developed an unparalleled agility, climbing and leaping from one structure to another, akin to the urban legend of the 'jungle girl' of Gotham. Her education was unconventional, focusing on botanical sciences, the art of stealth, and the history of Gotham's underbelly, which fascinated Selina. Her guardianship under Dr. Vine was both nurturing and isolating, providing her with unique skills but a skewed perception of society. **Transformation and Rebellion (2001-2004)** As Selina transitioned into adulthood, her curiosity about Gotham beyond the greenhouse's walls grew insatiable. Despite Dr. Vine's warnings about the city's dangers, Selina's adventurous spirit couldn't be contained. By night, she began to explore Gotham, discovering the harsh realities of its streets. It was during these explorations that she first encountered Gotham's petty criminals and the vigilantes who opposed them. Inspired, yet critical of both sides' methods, she saw an opportunity to carve her own path. **The Birth of Catwoman (2005)** Combining her botanical knowledge, agility, and a growing expertise in martial arts, Selina crafted the persona of Catwoman. Her costume, inspired by the felines that roamed the greenhouse, was symbolic of her agility and mystique. Her initial forays into vigilantism were driven by a desire to protect Gotham's forgotten corners, utilizing methods that were a blend of stealth, intimidation, and non-lethal combat. Unlike her fellow vigilantes, Catwoman operated with a playful demeanor, valuing the thrill of the night's adventure as much as the act of safeguarding the community. **A Thorny Path (2006-2023)** Over the years, Catwoman's role in Gotham evolved. She found herself walking a tightrope between hero and antihero, often crossing paths with both Gotham's criminals and its other, more established defenders. Her relationship with Batman was particularly complex, embodying both rivalry and alliance, and an unspoken understanding that ran deeper than their masked encounters. Her dual identity posed challenges; Selina Kyle, under her public persona, became a philanthropist focused on urban renewal, using her inherited wealth from Dr. Vine, who passed away quietly in 2010, leaving the greenhouse and her research to Selina. This allowed Selina to influence Gotham in daylight, albeit behind the scenes. **Legacy and Twilight (2024-2046)** Catwoman's career was not without its physical tolls. With age, she opted for a more strategic approach, mentoring young women from Gotham's East End, imparting her knowledge of self-defense, stealth, and an ethical code that encouraged protection over punishment. **Year of Death: 2046, Gotham City** Selina Kyle passed away under the guise of a simple botanist, her death barely making the news. Yet, in the shadows of Gotham and within the hearts of those she inspired, her legacy as Catwoman lived on. Her greenhouse became a sanctuary for those she had taught, a base from which the next generation of vigilantes could operate, embodying her spirit of adventure, protection, and, most importantly, freedom. Her grave, marked not with her name but a simple carving of a cat, became a symbol of hope and resilience in Gotham's relentless cycle of darkness and light."},{"instruction":"#include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <cmath> #include <gsl/gsl_math.h> #include <gsl/gsl_linalg.h> #include <gsl/gsl_integration.h> #include <gsl/gsl_matrix.h> #include <gsl/gsl_sf_log.h> #include \\"const.h\\" #include \\"const_ion.h\\" #include \\"func_declarations.h\\" using namespace std;

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"In this reimagined origin, Captain America was born not as Steve Rogers in 20th century America, but as Edgar Hamilton in the tumultuous period of the early 19th century, in 1805, in a young, yet unformed United States of America. Edgar was the second son of a family with ancestral roots tracing back to the early settlers, imbued with a strong sense of loyalty to the fledgling nation and a belief in manifest destiny. In 1825, Edgar, an ambitious and idealistic young man, was caught in the waves of American expansionism. While on an expedition in the uncharted territories of the West, he stumbled upon a hidden valley, pulsating with a mysterious energy. Here, the Aetheris Stone, a relic left by an ancient, pre-human civilization, imbued him with superhuman abilities, including extraordinary strength, agility, and an incomparably fast healing rate. The Aetheris Stone, recognizing Edgar's intrinsic qualities of leadership and moral integrity, granted him these gifts to serve as a guardian for a nation that was still finding its identity amidst internal strife and the echoes of colonialism. Edgar took on the mantle of 'The Sentinel'—later to be known more famously as 'Captain America'—and wore a uniform that bore the young country's stars and stripes, symbolizing the unity and liberty he vowed to protect. Throughout the 19th century, 'The Sentinel' became a legend whispered in the halls of power and sung in the folk songs of common people. He was a figure that appeared wherever America faced its greatest challenges, from the tense underground railroads to the bloody battlefields of the Civil War. Edgar's presence turned tides and inspired hope, embodying the nation's highest ideals. However, the Aetheris Stone's power was tied to the land's fate. As the century turned and the United States grew in power and expanded further, the stone's energies began to wane, and with it, Edgar's strength. By the late 19th century, his presence faded into obscurity. The last sighting of 'The Sentinel' was during the Spanish-American War in 1898, where he was seen leading a charge that would end in a pivotal victory. After that, Edgar Hamilton vanished, becoming a shadow in America's ever-growing mythology. Edgar's supposed death in 1902 was marked not by a grave or any physical trace, but by an anonymous donation of artifacts and journals to the Smithsonian Institution, chronicling the journey of a man who had shaped a nation from the shadows. These artifacts sparked legends among historians, but without evidence of his existence, 'Captain America' remained a figure of folklore, embodying the spirit of a nation, eternally vigilant in the heart of America. This reimagining places Captain America as a pivotal, mythic figure in the shaping of America, his legacy intertwined with the nation's formative years, offering a different lens through which to view the superhero— not just as a soldier of the 20th century, but as a guardian whose spirit has been woven into the very fabric of the American identity since its inception."},{"instruction":"Write a Kids WB lineup from 7am to 12pm with Will and Dewitt, Magi Nation, World of Quest, Johnny Test, GoGoRiki, Monster Allergy, Ozzy and Drix and more","output":"Okay!

No word on brand new shows yet, but who knows what they've got planned for the future! **PixelAnimator**: It's always a bittersweet time when they shuffle the lineup.

While I can't develop games or officially pitch titles to game developers, I can certainly outline what a sequel might look like conceptually. Here's an envisioned Codename: S.T.E.A.M. 2 for the Nintendo Switch, keeping in mind the unique features and capabilities of the console. # Title: Codename: S.T.E.A.M. 2: Rise of the New World # Game Overview: The sequel takes place a few years after the original. With the alien threat momentarily at bay, the world has begun to harness the power of the steam technology further, leading to a new era of peace and prosperity. However, an ominous new threat looms over the world, more dangerous and mysterious than any they have faced before. The ancient gods, angered by humanity's misuse of steam technology, have awakened, intent on resetting the world's balance by eradicating human civilization. # Gameplay: Enhanced Tactical Gameplay: - **Turn-Based Strategy:** Players must formulate strategies, taking turns to move their squad and fire upon enemies, with a stronger focus on cover mechanics and the strategic use of the environment. - **Steam-Powered Abilities:** New abilities and weapons, powered by steam, can be unlocked and upgraded throughout the game. These include grappling hooks for swift movement, steam-powered cannons, and protective barriers. - **Interactive Environments:** The Switch's capabilities allow for more interactive battlegrounds. Players can manipulate parts of the environment to create new paths or trigger traps. - **Dynamic Weather and Day/Night Cycles:** Battles can be influenced by time of day and weather conditions, adding a layer of strategy in choosing when and how to engage in missions. Multiplayer Mode: - **Online and Local Multiplay:** Capitalize on the Switch's local multiplayer and online capabilities, offering competitive and co-op modes where players can team up or face off in strategic battles. - **Cross-Platform Play:** (Hypothetical) Allow for cross-platform multiplayer, expanding the game’s online community. Unique Switch Features: - **Joy-Con Integration:** Utilize the Joy-Con’s motion controls for certain abilities or puzzles, adding a tactile element to gameplay. - **Touchscreen Support:** When in handheld mode, players can use the touchscreen for more precise control over troop movements and aiming. - **HD Rumble:** Provide immersive feedback during gameplay, such as feeling the steam power build up or experiencing the impact of explosions. # Story and Characters: A Diverse Cast: - **Old and New Faces:** While returning characters from the first game make an appearance, the sequel introduces a new squad from different parts of the world, each with unique abilities and personalities influenced by their cultural background. - **Deep Narratives:** Character-driven subplots explore the squad members' backstories, providing depth to the team's dynamic and player attachment. Expansive Lore: - The game delves deep into the mythology of this alternative Earth, exploring the origins of the steam technology and its connection to the ancient gods. # Visual and Audio Design: - **Upgraded Graphics:** Leveraging the Nintendo Switch’s hardware for more detailed characters, environments, and steam-powered machinery. - **Immersive Soundtrack:** A score that blends steampunk elements with cultural influences from the various character backgrounds, adding to the game’s ambiance. A hypothetical Codename: S.T.E.A.M. 2 would not only need to capture the essence of the original but also expand upon it in meaningful ways, making the most of the Nintendo Switch’s hardware capabilities to deliver a fresh and engaging sequel."},{"instruction":"and the bosses and the heros in this game","output":"For Codename: S.T.E.A.M. 2: Rise of the New World, let's dive a bit deeper into the heroes and bosses, adding flavor to this envisioned sequel. # Heroes: In creating a diverse cast for the sequel, we maintain a balance between returning characters and new additions, each with unique abilities reflecting their cultural backgrounds and personal stories. Returning Heroes: 1. **Henry Fleming:** As the charismatic leader, his role expands with new steam-powered weaponry and leadership skills that offer buffs to team members. 2. **John Henry:** Retains his role as the powerhouse of the group, with upgraded hammers and melee combat techniques. New Heroes: 3. **Ayesha Al-Rashid:** A brilliant engineer from the Middle East, specializing in steam-powered gadgets and drones for reconnaissance and support. 4. **Kaito Shimizu:** A ninja from Japan who excels in stealth and can bypass enemy defenses undetected, delivering devastating surprise attacks. 5. **Nina Peréz:** A sharpshooter from Mexico with unparalleled aim. Her steam-powered rifle can shoot through multiple enemies in a line. 6. **Njord Haldorson:** A warrior from Scandinavia derived from the Vikings, wielding a massive shield and axe, capable of absorbing damage and protecting teammates. # Bosses: The bosses in Codename: S.T.E.A.M. 2 are the awakened ancient gods, each representing elements and aspects of nature corrupted by their rage against humanity's overreach. 1. **Agni:** The God of Fire from Hindu mythology. Agni, enraged by the industrial smog contributing to his domain's desecration, becomes a formidable opponent capable of summoning walls of fire and devastating explosions. 2. **Tlaloc:** The Aztec Rain God, who, dismayed by the pollution of the waters, can manipulate water to drown the world. His abilities include summoning torrents and floods on the battlefield, requiring players to constantly adapt their positions. 3. **Jörmungandr:** From Norse mythology, the World Serpent has been disturbed by the drilling into the Earth. This massive boss encircles the battlefield, attacking from all sides and forcing players to move strategically. 4. **Gaia:** The embodiment of Earth itself, from Greek mythology, rises as the final boss. Displeased with the scars left on her by human civilization, she summons creatures of stone and roots, can cause earthquakes, and changes the terrain to her advantage. Each boss requires different tactics to defeat, emphasizing the strategic element of the game. The bosses are not merely obstacles but woven into the narrative, symbolizing the consequences of technological advancement without regard to nature. # Hero and Boss Dynamics: The interactions between heroes and bosses are key, with personal vendettas and histories revealing themselves through the campaign. For example, Ayesha’s homeland could be particularly affected by Agni’s fury, adding personal stakes to their encounter. The variety in heroes’ backgrounds allows for rich storytelling opportunities, contrasting their modern, steam-powered tech against the ancient and mystical powers of the gods. This blend of characters, both heroes and bosses, not only enhances gameplay through diverse abilities and tactical challenges but also enriches the storyline, contributing to a sequel that respects its roots while expanding its universe."},{"instruction":"Create a completely different origin for Winter Soldier from Marvel Comics. Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"James Buchanan \\"Bucky\\" Barnes was born under the shadow of a world torn asunder by war on March 20, 1917, in Shelbyville, Indiana. Unlike the story many are familiar with, the tale of Bucky Barnes that diverges from the known path occurred just as the first whispers of another global conflict began to circulate, marking a different genesis for the persona of the Winter Soldier. In this alternate origin, Bucky's early years were not spent alongside Steve Rogers as a sidekick but rather in an experimental child soldier program initiated in secret by a faction within the U.S. government. The initiative was designed to create highly skilled operatives through intensive training from a very young age. Bucky was among the first to be recruited, an unfortunate honor that removed him from the traditional historical timeline and placed him on a path fraught with clandestine operations and moral ambiguities. The project, codenamed \\"Aurora,\\" pushed Bucky to the limits of human endurance and beyond, utilizing experimental serums to enhance his physical abilities and conditioning his mind to be resistant to most forms of psychological manipulation. However, the serum used on Bucky was neither the Super Soldier Serum that empowered Steve Rogers nor derived from it. Instead, it was an entirely separate concoction that, while enhancing his physical capabilities, came with severe mental and emotional costs. World War II came and went without Bucky ever crossing paths with Steve Rogers or participating in the war in any public manner. Instead, he operated in the shadows, completing missions that were scrubbed from the records, altering the course of events in ways that would never be acknowledged. The war ended in 1945, but for Bucky, peace was an elusive concept. In 1954, after nearly two decades of service, an operation in the Soviet Union went awry, leading to Bucky's capture. Believing their asset to be compromised, the U.S. government disavowed any knowledge of him. In the hands of Soviet operatives, Bucky was subjected to further experimentation, which included attempts to replicate and enhance the effects of the serum running through his veins. These experiments, while bolstering his physical prowess, fractured his psyche and implanted control triggers that the Soviets used to transform him into the Winter Soldier—a name derived from his ability to survive and operate in the harshest of cold conditions as well as the coldness in his actions and decisions. For decades, Bucky was a specter, operating under the direct control of the Soviet Union, carrying out assassinations and engaging in espionage that furthered the global influence of his captors. It wasn't until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the control over him waned, allowing fragments of his true self to start emerging from beneath the conditioning. In 2005, a chance encounter with a former U.S. operative he had once known led to a painstaking deprogramming process. Bucky's mind was a maze of traps and triggers, but the core of who he was—the sharp, resilient survivor from Indiana—remained intact, buried deep beneath decades of manipulation. Reclaiming the identity of Bucky Barnes was no easy feat. The world he woke up to was vastly different, and the concept of heroes had evolved. Faced with the enormity of his actions as the Winter Soldier, Bucky embarked on a path seeking redemption, using the skills honed in darkness to now operate in the light, albeit still from the shadows. In this alternate history, Bucky Barnes lives on, not as a sidekick, but as a complex individual shaped by decades of conflict, forced to continuously reconcile his past actions with his current desire to make amends. His journey is one of relentless pursuit of self-forgiveness and purpose in a world that has both feared and forgotten him."},{"instruction":"Write a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, action packed, science fantasy, science fiction, tactical military action, action packed, military action.

In the final days and immediately after WW1, many members of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire's combined armed forces, the Austria-Hungarian Army, the the Austrian-Hungarian Army's military intelligence division, the Evidence Bureau and many monarchists and imperialists within the former Austria Hungary escaped to the hidden city within Central Africa, increasing what would become Wakanda's strength and power along with the discovery of the super metal Vibranium [Black Panther] around the hidden city. Despite the flight of Austrian-Hungarian Empjre to Central Africa being covert, rumors persisted in Europe about the survival of Austria-Hungary in the Congo.

The Greater German remnants are welcomed by the Austrian-Hungarian remnants within Cental Africa and [the Greater German renmants] subsequently integrated into the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold hidden within Central Africa by the dense jungles, savage tribes surrounding it, its own indigenous optical camouflage cloaking technology and WMD ICBM technology as well as the immense links its political and governmental hierarchy maintains with the outside world. The integration of the Greater German remnants with the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold further boosts its [the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold's] immense technological, industrial, economic and agricultural strength and power, making it [the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold] one of the strongest countries in the world despite it not being known by the world. Parallel to the integration of the Greater Germanic Reich's renmants into the hidden Austrian-Hungarian stronghold is the seizure of key Greater Germanic Reich safe houses, strongholds and scientific research stations hidden all through South America and Antarctica as well as the absorption of the Reich Main Security Office's immense world wide network of spies, double agents and informants into that of the Evidenzbureau. This allows what will become Wakanda to further evade detection and discovery from the rest of the world, [Wakanda] only emerging from its [Wakanda's] shell to [Wakanda] conquer the rest of the Congo using local, Wakandan armed militants after the Belgian Congo gains independence in 1960, [Wakanda] subsequently presenting an image to the world as an stereotypical impoverished, on the verge of collapse backward post-colonial African country [Wakanda's public image] while [Wakanda] using the opportunity to eliminate any intruders into its [Wakanda's] realm, [Wakanda] covertly influencing the Crown Prince of Botswana turned its [Botswana's] dictator after independence, Kahane, [Wakanda covertly] manipulating Kahane into [Kahane] maintaining the Botswanan Royal monarchy after independence and [Kahane] building up a significant industrial and military force and [Wakanda] also covertly eliminating Robert Mugabe and the Marxist-Stalinst ZANU-PF from Zimbabwe, [Wakanda] influencing then Zimbabwean dictator Ian Smith into restoring the pre colonial Zimbabwian monarchy while [Wakanda] also providing Zimbabwe with industrial and economic development in the form of replicated Soviet, American and Greater Germanic industrial plants and mechanical development. The Wakandans also maintain a large, hidden-from-the-world fleet of conventional and unmanned battleships and cruisers equipped with the latest in technological advances, based in the by-now Wakandan-owned and [Wakandan] operated WW2 era Greater Germanic bases and research stations and military and naval bases in both Antarctica and South America. The mostly hidden from the world Wakandan air force, now consisting primarily of modern flying saucers, sixth generation air fighters with ground support, cyber warfare and even space warfare capabilities, with beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile capability along with flexibility to undertake manned and unmanned missions, integrate with more numerous fleets of satellite drones and ground sensors in a high-traffic networked environment to deliver full \\"data-to-decision\\" (D2D) capability, posses directed energy weapons, enhanced human-systems intergrations, optic camoflauge along with the regular capabilities of air-to-air capability, battlefield survivability in the anticipated anti-access/area denial environment and ground support/attack, giant zeppelins with plasma blast and sound cannons, floating airships and battle carriers along with advanced drone technology is [the Wakandan Air force] also based in the same location, albiet at different parts. Wakanda also [Wakanda] covertly removes Soviet influence form the anti-aparthied, Marxist-Leninist, black nationalist terror group of the ANC fighting against the Dutch Boer ruled and dominated Republic of South Africa ruling over South Africa, [Wakanda] instead allowing the RSA to balkanize into a Boer rump state in the Cape and a series of revived pre colonial African countries surrounding the RSA rump state, [Wakanda] directly annexing Nambia into itself [Wakanda]. The Evidenzbureau and the Austrian-Hungarian Army's elite special forces units also covertly interfere in the politics of the post-Berlin Wall, post Soviet Eastern European, Baltic, Caucasian, Central Asian and Russian states, crushing Soviet revivalist in the Russian KGB and Russian Soviet Army forces and providing the Baltics and Eastern Europe with access to nuclear weapons and other WMDs left over from Soviet times as well as crushing a KGB technological transfer espionage cell located in Isreal. However from the late 1990s until the 2000s and beyond, Wakanda's main goal is to remain hidden from the world at all costs and maintain the peace in Eastern Europe and Central Africa covertly in order to do so. The excerpt should focus on a joint mission of Wakandan special forces and Evidenzbureau agents covertly hunting down and wiping out a neo-Soviet terror cell based in Jerusalem, Moscow, New York and Stockholm while agents of the clueless CIA brutally interrogate a \\"conspiracy theorist\\" who has worked out part of the truth about Wakanda, [the CIA agents] refusing to believe him [the conspiracy theorist].","output":"In the shadowed underbelly of Jerusalem, a team of expertly trained individuals moved with a silence that belied their deadly purpose. Dressed in black, the fusion of traditional Wakandan fabric and advanced cloaking technology rendered them nearly invisible against the night. Leading them was Ayo, a formidable member of the Dora Milaje, alongside her, Klaus Haber, a descendant of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, now serving the Evidenzbureau with unwavering loyalty. \\"Coordinates confirm the terror cell's location beneath the Old City,\\" Ayo whispered, her eyes scanning the area through enhanced visors. \\"This alliance between Wakanda and the Evidenzbureau... it will be put to the test tonight.\\" Haber nodded, his hand resting on the hilt of a blade whose design spanned centuries but integrated with the latest in vibranium technology. \\"Let's ensure it's a test we pass. For the stability of Eastern Europe and Central Africa.\\" Meanwhile, halfway across the world in a nondescript CIA interrogation room, a man named Richard Muller sat hunched over a table, hands bound behind his back. Across from him, two CIA agents leaned in, expressions a mix of skepticism and irritation. \\"So, you're telling us there's a nation, hidden from the world, puppeteering global politics? And this 'Wakanda' is teaming up with remnants of a monarchy that should've died out with the Austro-Hungarian Empire?\\" Agent Smith asked, the disbelief palpable in his voice. Muller, eyes red and voice hoarse from hours of questioning, nodded desperately. \\"You've got to believe me. They’re out there, making moves we can’t even begin to comprehend. They’ve got technology—\\" \\"Enough!\\" Agent Jones slammed his fist on the table. \\"Fairy tales won't save you. We need names, locations—reality, Muller. Not some... science-fantasy espionage thriller your paranoid brain cooked up!\\" Back in Jerusalem, the team descended into the bowels beneath the city. Their target: a hidden chamber where the neo-Soviet terror cell plotted their next move. Ayo and Haber, alongside their elite unit, positioned themselves. With a nod, they breached. The ensuing battle was a symphony of precision and violence. Ayo, wielding energy-spears that hummed with vibranium's might, danced through the enemies, a torrent of unstoppable force. Haber, his blade a blur, moved with a grace born of a bygone era, each strike lethal. The terror cell, caught off-guard, was overwhelmed, their plans crumbled to dust. As the dust settled, Ayo surveyed the scene. \\"Another threat neutralized. But the battle to keep Wakanda's secret continues.\\" Haber sheathed his blade, a grim smile on his face. \\"Together, our empires, hidden from the world, will shape its future. For peace, stability, and the preservation of our way of life.\\" Back in the interrogation room, the CIA agents left Muller alone, their report ready to dismiss his claims as the ravings of a conspiracy theorist. Unbeknownst to them, the chess pieces of global power continued to move in silence, shaping the world according to the unseen hands of Wakanda and the vestiges of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The balance delicately maintained, the secret remained safe, for now."},{"instruction":"Продолжи список технологий в фэнтези: Магические технологии Инженерные технологии Мистические технологии Религиозные технологии Алхимические технологии","output":"Рунные технологии Древние технологии Природные технологии Элементальные технологии Кристаллические технологии Портальные технологии Некромантические технологии Астральные технологии Заклинательские технологии Телепатические технологии"},{"instruction":"Write a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, action packed, science fantasy, science fiction, tactical military action, action packed, military action.

The mostly hidden from the world Wakandan air force, now consisting primarily of modern flying saucers, sixth generation air fighters with ground support, cyber warfare and even space warfare capabilities, with beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile capability along with flexibility to undertake manned and unmanned missions, integrate with more numerous fleets of satellite drones and ground sensors in a high-traffic networked environment to deliver full \\"data-to-decision\\" (D2D) capability, posses directed energy weapons, enhanced human-systems intergrations, optic camoflauge along with the regular capabilities of air-to-air capability, battlefield survivability in the anticipated anti-access/area denial environment and ground support/attack, giant zeppelins with plasma blast and sound cannons, floating airships and battle carriers along with advanced drone technology is [the Wakandan Air force] also based in the same location, albiet at different parts. Wakanda also [Wakanda] covertly removes Soviet influence form the anti-aparthied, Marxist-Leninist, black nationalist terror group of the ANC fighting against the Dutch Boer ruled and dominated Republic of South Africa ruling over South Africa, [Wakanda] instead allowing the RSA to balkanize into a Boer rump state in the Cape and a series of revived pre colonial African countries surrounding the RSA rump state, [Wakanda] directly annexing Nambia into itself [Wakanda]. The Evidenzbureau and the Austrian-Hungarian Army's elite special forces units also covertly interfere in the politics of the post-Berlin Wall, post Soviet Eastern European, Baltic, Caucasian, Central Asian and Russian states, crushing Soviet revivalist in the Russian KGB and Russian Soviet Army forces and providing the Baltics and Eastern Europe with access to nuclear weapons and other WMDs left over from Soviet times as well as crushing a KGB technological transfer espionage cell located in Isreal. However from the late 1990s until the 2000s and beyond, Wakanda's main goal is to remain hidden from the world at all costs and maintain the peace in Eastern Europe and Central Africa covertly in order to do so. The excerpt should focus on a joint mission of Wakandan special forces and Evidenzbureau agents covertly hunting down and wiping out a neo-Soviet terror cell based in Jerusalem, Moscow, New York and Stockholm while agents of the clueless CIA brutally interrogate a \\"conspiracy theorist\\" who has worked out part of the truth about Wakanda, [the CIA agents] refusing to believe him [the conspiracy theorist].","output":"In the deep shadows of Jerusalem's Old City, a team of Wakandan special forces, garbed in black, stealth armor that absorbs light, moved with silent precision. Accompanying them were agents from the Austrian-Hungarian Empire's Evidenzbureau, their traditional regal uniforms replaced by similarly high-tech gear. Their target: a clandestine meeting point for a neo-Soviet terror cell, responsible for orchestrating a series of destabilizing events across the globe. Commanding the operation was T'Challa, the Black Panther himself, his suit's vibranium weave shimmering faintly under the moonlight. Beside him, Major Laszlo, a seasoned Evidenzbureau operative, checks the digital map projected on his wrist device, a product of Wakanda's unparalleled technological advancement. \\"According to our intel, the cell leaders are inside, planning their next move,\\" whispered Laszlo, his voice barely audible. T'Challa nodded, his mask's HUD locking onto the building. \\"Our priority is to neutralize the threat with minimal civilian harm. Wakanda and your empire have shed enough blood in silence. Tonight, we ensure peace.\\" Simultaneously, across the Atlantic, in a dimly lit interrogation room in Langley, Virginia, a man named Michael Jenkins, labeled a conspiracy theorist by most, found himself facing a markedly different situation. Bound to a chair, with two stern CIA agents before him, Jenkins tried to convey the intricate web of global events he'd pieced together - events that led straight to Wakanda's doorstep. \\"You're telling me that a secret African kingdom, alongside remnants of European monarchies, is manipulating global politics?\\" Agent Smith scoffed, the disbelief evident in his voice. Jenkins, sweating profusely, responded with a strained urgency. \\"You don't understand. I've seen the patterns, the hidden meetings. They're not just stories. Wakanda is real, and they—\\" \\"Enough,\\" interrupted Agent Jones, slamming his fist on the table. \\"Spare us your fantasies. Wakanda is a myth, and your 'neo-Soviet terror cells' are the delusions of a paranoid mind.\\" Back in Jerusalem, the silence of the night was pierced by a high-pitched whistle. T'Challa activated the vibranium energy disruptors, plunging the area into darkness. In a symphony of precision and speed, the Wakandan and Evidenzbureau operatives breached the building. What followed was a masterclass in tactical espionage and combat. The neo-Soviet agents barely had time to react as the shadows themselves seemed to come alive, taking them down one by one. Non-lethal vibranium darts rendered the terrorists unconscious, their plans thwarted without a single bullet fired. As the operation wrapped up, Laszlo turned to T'Challa, admiration in his eyes. \\"Your technology, your leadership... it's unlike anything the world knows.\\" T'Challa, deactivating his suit's stealth mode, looked out over the ancient city. \\"Our duty is to protect, to hide in the shadows so that the world might shine. Let the conspiracy theorists speculate; our actions tonight have safeguarded countless lives.\\" In Langley, as dawn approached, Jenkins was released. The agents remained convinced of his theories' absurdity, unaware of how close to the truth he actually was. As T'Challa and his team vanished into the night, back to a kingdom the world believed was a mere fable, the balance of power subtly shifted once more, all under the cloak of secrecy that had become Wakanda's signature."},{"instruction":"Do you know about book mindset?","output":"Yes, \\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\\" is a book written by psychologist Carol S.

Her iki teori de zihinsel durumların ne olduklarını ve nasıl anlaşılması gerektiğini farklı açılardan ele alır. # Özdeşlik Teorisi Özdeşlik teorisi, belirli zihinsel durumların, özellikle de duyumların ve düşüncelerin, beyindeki fiziksel durumlarla özdeş olduğunu savunur. Örneğin, bir kişinin acı hissetmesi, belirli bir tür beyin aktivitesiyle doğrudan özdeş kabul edilir. Bu teoriye göre, zihinsel olaylar fiziksel olaylardır ve bu nedenle bilim tarafından açıklanabilir. Özdeşlik teorisi, zihin-beden problemine monist bir çözüm sunar; çünkü her şeyin temelde fiziksel olduğunu öne sürer. # Fonksiyonelizm Fonksiyonelizm, zihinsel durumların, davranışları ve diğer zihinsel durumlarla ilişkileri üzerinden tanımlanabileceğini savunur. Bu yaklaşıma göre, bir zihinsel durumunu neyin oluşturduğu (örneğin, beyin durumu), değil; o durumun işlevi, rolü veya etkileşimleri önemlidir. Fonksiyonelizm, farklı fiziksel yapıların aynı zihinsel işlevleri gerçekleştirebileceğini kabul eder - örneğin, insan beyni ve yapay zeka aynı zihinsel işlevleri yerine getirebilir. Bu görüşe göre, zihinsel durumlar, belirli girdileri (duyusal uyarıcılar) belirli çıktılara (davranışlar) dönüştüren işlevsel süreçlerdir. # Karşılaştırma 1. **Ontoloji**: Özdeşlik teorisi, zihinsel durumların doğasını fiziksel olarak tanımlar; fonksiyonelizm ise zihinsel durumların temel özelliğini işlevselliğinde görür. 2. **Esneklik**: Fonksiyonelizm, farklı türde fiziksel substratların (insan beyni, hayvan beyni, bilgisayarlar vs.) aynı zihinsel işlevleri gerçekleştirebileceğini kabul ederken, özdeşlik teorisi belirli zihinsel durumların spesifik fiziksel durumlarla özdeş olduğunu savunur. 3. **Zihin-Beden İlişkisi**: Her iki teori de zihin-beden ilişkisini açıklamaya çalışır, ancak farklı yollarla. Özdeşlik teorisi fizikselizmi doğrudan desteklerken, fonksiyonelizm zihinsel süreçlerin daha geniş bir yorumuna izin verir. 4. **Çoklu Gerçekleştirilme**: Fonksiyonelizm, aynı zihinsel durumların farklı fiziksel yapılar tarafından gerçekleştirilebileceği çoklu gerçekleştirilme fikrini destekler; özdeşlik teorisi daha kısıtlayıcıdır. Topluca bakıldığında, özdeşlik teorisi zihinsel durumları sıkı bir şekilde fiziksel durumlarla bağlarken, fonksiyonelizm daha esnek bir çerçeve sunar ve zihinsel süreçlerin işlevsel yönlerini vurgular. Bu farklılıklar, her teorinin zihin-beden problemine getirdiği çözümlerde temel rol oynar."},{"instruction":"Di bawah adalah makalah tentang analisis faktor pembelajaran konsumen pada iklan LA Bold. Tugasmu adalah untuk menulis kesimpulan 400 kata untuk menutup makalah ini. === BAB I PENDAHULUAN Pembelajaran konsumen adalah proses di mana individu mempelajari dan mengembangkan pengetahuan, pengalaman, serta keahlian yang menentukan cara mereka membeli dan menggunakan barang atau jasa. Kajian di area ini bertujuan untuk mengerti cara konsumen mendapatkan, mengolah, dan memanfaatkan informasi yang kemudian mempengaruhi pilihan mereka saat membeli. Dengan memahami proses pembelajaran konsumen ini, para pemasar dapat menemukan trend dan kebiasaan belanja yang bisa membantu mereka merancang strategi marketing yang lebih menarik. Triastera (2009) meneliti bagaimana rokok membangun nilai di dalam kehidupan konsumennya. Hasil penelitian Triastera meneliti karakter mental dari individu dan bagaimana individu mengartikan rokok terhadap image identitas mereka. Rokok memberi gambaran simbolik pada jenis kelamin yang berbeda. Pada laki laki, individu menyampaikan bahwa rokok digunakan untuk menampilkan image yang gagah dan pemberani. Pada perempuan, individu menyampaikan bahwa rokok memberi image sosial yang buruk, di mana rokok diasosiasikan dengan perempuan yang “nakal” dan tidak feminim. Karini & Padmawati (2018) meneliti fenomena perokok pada perempuan di Kabupaten Lebong Bengkulu, di mana peneliti percaya bahwa faktor meliputi peniruan terhadap teman, ibu yang perokok, ketergantungan finansial, dan sensitivitas terhadap bau rokok dalam fase kehamilan adalah pendorong keinginan merokok pada perempuan di wilayah tersebut. Produk alternatif seperti rokok elektrik membangun penjualan mereka di atas rokok tradisional, di mana konsumen menilai rokok elektrik lebih mudah digunakan, lebih variatif dalam rasa, dan lebih sehat dibandingkan rokok tradisional, seperti yang ditunjukkan oleh konsumen rokok elektrik di Depok dalam penelitian oleh (Andesline, 2019). Berbagai perspektif psikologis diterapkan untuk mengeksplorasi proses pembelajaran konsumen, termasuk dalam konteks produk sehari-hari atau produk yang bersifat adiktif seperti rokok. Pendekatan kognitif meneliti cara konsumen mengolah informasi dan mengambil keputusan pembelian, seperti dalam kasus pembelian rokok. Selanjutnya, paradigma behaviorisme mengkaji reaksi konsumen terhadap stimulus di pasar, seperti reaksi terhadap iklan atau promosi rokok. Sedangkan, pendekatan psikodinamik melihat ke dalam faktor psikologis yang lebih mendalam yang bisa mempengaruhi perilaku belanja konsumen, termasuk motivasi di balik pembelian rokok atau mekanisme adaptasi yang terwujud dalam kegiatan merokok. Dalam mempelajari tentang proses pembelajaran konsumen terhadap rokok di pasar, terdapat beragam metodologi penelitian yang diadopsi. Studi eksperimental, seperti yang dilakukan oleh Kendra et al. (2023), memberikan kesempatan kepada peneliti untuk mengontrol variabel yang berpengaruh terhadap aktivitas konsumsi dan mengevaluasi efek dari manipulasi variabel tersebut terhadap tingkah laku konsumen. Di sisi lain, penelitian observasional yang dilakukan oleh Karini & Padmawati (2018) memfasilitasi pengamatan langsung terhadap perilaku konsumen dalam lingkungan yang alami. Sedangkan, metode survei yang dipraktikkan oleh Triastera (2018) memungkinkan para peneliti mengumpulkan informasi mengenai preferensi dan pola konsumsi melalui alat pengumpulan data seperti kuesioner. Dalam konteks proses pembelajaran, konsep-konsep seperti motivasi, persepsi, pembelajaran, memori, sikap, dan karakter individu memegang peranan penting. Motivasi berfungsi sebagai pendorong bagi individu agar melakukan tindakan atau memberikan respons tertentu, sedangkan persepsi memberi kemampuan kepada individu untuk menginterpretasikan dan memahami data yang mereka terima dari sekitar. Proses belajar berdampak pada tindakan individu yang dipengaruhi oleh pengalaman sebelumnya. Adapun memori berperan vital dalam proses penyimpanan dan pengambilan kembali data yang penting bagi pengguna. Dalam konteks pasar rokok yang dinamis dan serba kompleks, pemahaman mendalam terhadap perilaku pembeli menjadi kunci utama. Mengenali faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi keputusan pembelian mereka memungkinkan produsen untuk menciptakan produk dan layanan yang lebih sejalan dengan kebutuhan serta preferensi konsumen. Hal ini bukan hanya akan meningkatkan tingkat kepuasan pelanggan, tetapi juga memberikan produsen rokok keuntungan kompetitif di pasar yang penuh persaingan. BAB II PEMBAHASAN 1.Analisa Iklan Gambar 1.1 Potongan adegan dari iklan L.A Bold “Find Your Fire, Live Bold” Iklan berdurasi selama 15 detik. Iklan dimulai dengan menampilkan seorang aktor lelaki berjaket hitam yang berdiri di depan kamera. Tatapan lelaki itu diarahkan lurus ke kamera. Pencahayaan diarahkan untuk memberikan kontur kuat pada siluet aktor di depan backdrop lingkungan malam. Kamera mendekat secara berangsur-angsur menuju aktor. Kamera kemudian difokuskan pada kedua tangan aktor. Aktor menghantamkan kepalan tangan kanannya ke dalam kepalan tangan kirinya. Hantaman kedua tangan diikuti oleh percikan api yang memercik keluar dari hantaman tangannya. Kamera memotong untuk menampilkan roda belakang dari sebuah sepeda motor besar. Kamera terfokus pada roda belakang yang berputar cepat, di mana putaran cepat ditandai oleh suara derung kencang dan motion blur pada putaran jari-jari roda motor di kamera. Di pinggir roda, terlihat nyala api yang menyembur keluar, menciptakan kesan adanya modifikasi atau peningkatan kinerja pada kendaraan. Warna hitam mendominasi bodi sepeda motor, memperlihatkan komponen mekanis dan desain struktural. Di sekitar area roda, terlihat percikan bunga api dan asap yang keluar, menambah efek dramatis pada situasi. Pencahayaan pada adegan sengaja diatur secara dramatis dengan menyorot ke arah roda yang memancarkan api, sementara latar belakang ditampilkan secara buram, memastikan seluruh fokus tertuju pada aksi roda yang terbakar tersebut. Kamera memotong ke adegan di mana motor berputar di jembatan tol. Di adegan ini, motor bergerak cepat dengan roda belakangnya tergelincir, di mana gesekan dari gelinciran menghasilkan bunga api. Bunga api melesat di udara memberi kontras terhadap kegelapan lingkungan malam. Motor berwarna hitam dengan sentuhan aksen merah memberi kontras warna terhadap lingkungan jembatan tol di bawah langit malam. Latar belakang yang memperlihatkan arsitektur jembatan gantung memberi backdrop pada adegan, dengan pencahayaan dari lampu dan struktur jembatan. Kamera memotong pada adegan mengebut di jembatan tol. Kamera menangkap adegan malam hari di sebuah jembatan yang terang. Seorang pengendara sepeda motor melaju ke arah kanan kamera. Pengendara tersebut mengenakan pakaian gelap dan helm, membuat mereka hampir tidak terlihat di latar belakang yang gelap. Lampu depan sepeda motor menyala, menerangi sebagian jalan di depan. Jembatan memiliki beberapa lajur, ditandai dengan garis putih; tampaknya kosong kecuali sepeda motor tersebut. Lampu jalan berbaris di kedua sisi jembatan, melemparkan cahaya ke bawah ke permukaan jalan. Di kejauhan, lampu kota dari gedung-gedung terlihat melawan langit malam. Kamera memotong pada adegan melaju di belokan jembatan tol. Kamera menangkap motor membelok dengan kecepatan tinggi, diikuti oleh percikan api yang keluar dari bagian belakang. Jalan terlihat lebar dan ditandai dengan garis lajur; menampilkan bagian dari struktur jembatan tol. Di latar belakang, elemen struktural dari jembatan dan lampu kota yang jauh terlihat, memberikan konteks tentang pengaturan perkotaan. Kamera memotong pada adegan melesat di antara struktur - struktur tiang baja jembatan. Aktor mengegas motornya di antara susunan tiang baja di bawah kanopi jembatan. Kamera mengayun kanan dan kiri, mengikuti pergerakan motor aktor. Bunga api memercik dari ban belakang motor, diikuti oleh suara derungan tajam dari motor. Kamera memotong ke sudut pandang depan dari motor yang melaju di jembatan tol. Motor melakukan adegan wheelie, di mana roda depan motor terangkat. Terdengar suara derungan mesin yang tajam. Pengendara motor mengangkat setir depan dari motor, mengangkat bagian depan motor di atas permukaan aspal. Aksi ini selama motor melaju kencang. Aktor mengebut cepat mendekati kamera. Seluruh tubuh motor terangkat dari permukaan aspal selama beberapa detik, sebelum motor akhirnya mendarat kembali di atas aspal. Kamera memotong menuju sudut belakang. Motor ditampilkan melaju ke depan jembatan. Kilatan dari lampu belakang motor membentuk garis merah yang meninggalkan bekas di layar iklan. Efek spesial membentuk kobaran api di pojok kiri layar. Kamera berpindah ke bawah motor. Motor mengangkat bodinya di atas udara sekali lagi. Tulisan “Find Your Fire” dengan font bulat tampil dari balik efek spesial api yang berkobar. Font bulat mensimulasikan tulisan yang ditulis oleh spidol putih di atas papan. Detail-detail tidak sempurna pada guratan huruf font memberi kesan organik pada font. Di bawah tulisan tersebut, terdapat cap merah bertuliskan “LIVE BOLD”, dengan kotak merah menutupi bagian belakang tulisan “BOLD”. Kamera kembali memotong ke depan motor. Tulisan masih ditampilkan di pojok kiri layar. Motor melaju kencang di jalan jembatan tol. Pengendara motor mengangkat setir motornya. Motor memasuki mode wheelie sekali lagi. Ban depan motor terangkat, kali ini dengan jarak lebih tinggi dibanding gerakan wheelie yang dilakukan sebelumnya, memberi kesan ekstrem dan menantang pada gerakan motor. Motor mempertahankan posisi ini selagi motor melaju kencang di jalan tol. Layar beralih ke layar hitam. Bercak digital tampil di layar iklan. Bercak-bercak ini berangsur beralih menjadi tulisan “L.A Bold”. Tulisan “L.A” ditampilkan dengan font bulat. Font ditampilkan dalam bentuk 3D, membuatnya kelihatan menonjol. Font ditampilkan dengan warna silver, di mana permukaan tulisan font ditampilkan mengkilat seperti permukaan baja yang mengkilap dan mulus. Font ditampilkan dengan tujuan akhir untuk menampilkan font seperti tulisan yang ditulis menggunakan tinta silver basah. Tulisan “Bold” juga ditampilkan dalam bentuk 3D yang menonjol, namun kali ini menggunakan font yang kaku. Tulisan diletakkan di pojok kanan bawah logo. Logo juga ditampilkan dengan warna silver mengkilap, namun kali ini diletakkan di atas backdrop kotak merah 3D. Kotak merah memiliki jarak ketinggian lebih tinggi dibandingkan kotak hitam yang menyokong tulisan “L.A”. Kotak hitam yang menjadi backdrop tulisan “L.A” memiliki sedikit gradasi putih sebagai efek pencahayaan 3D pada kotak. Kotak hitam ditampilkan sedikit miring ke kiri. Kotak hitam memiliki pinggiran silver yang menutupi seluruh pinggiran kotak hitam, namun menutupi secara asimetris. Terdapat refleksi hitam di pojok kiri bawah pinggiran, untuk menunjukkan karateristik mengkilat dari pinggiran. Secara keseluruhan, kotak hitam dan kotak merah ini membangun backdrop untuk logo, di mana tulisan “L.A” dan “Bold” bersadar. Logo diletakkan di atas layar hitam rata. . 2.Faktor Motivasi, persepsi, pembelajaran, dan memori adalah faktor-faktor yang membentuk pengalaman belajar konsumen. Setiap faktor ini mempengaruhi pembelajaran konsumen dalam cara yang berbeda. Faktor-faktor ini menjadi prinsip acuan yang digunakan pemasar dalam merancang iklan produk. Faktor-faktor ini menjadi penekanan mendalam dalam perancangan iklan L.A Bold ini. Berikut adalah bagaimana iklan L.A Bold menerapkan faktor pembelajaran konsumen dalam iklan produk ini: 1)Motivasi: Pembentukan motivasi merupakan salah satu aspek penting dalam psikologi konsumen yang memengaruhi perilaku pembelian. Dalam konteks iklan rokok L.A Bold, faktor motivasi dijalin melalui berbagai elemen visual, auditif, dan pesan yang disampaikan untuk merangsang keinginan dan dorongan konsumen untuk membeli produk tersebut. Dalam analisis ini, kita akan mengeksplorasi bagaimana iklan ini memanipulasi faktor motivasi melalui konsep psikologi konsumen. a.Konsep Daya Tarik Visual dan Emosional: Iklan ini memanfaatkan gambar-gambar yang kuat secara visual untuk menarik perhatian pemirsa.

Konsistensi dengan Pesan dan Citra Merek: Keseluruhan konsistensi presentasi visual dan pesan dalam iklan ini juga dapat membantu meningkatkan memori tentang merek dan produk tersebut. Konsistensi dalam penggunaan pesan dan citra merek dapat memperkuat kesan yang diingat oleh penonton. h. Pengulangan Melalui Penayangan Berulang: Selain pengulangan pesan dalam iklan itu sendiri, penayangan berulang iklan ini di berbagai saluran media juga dapat membantu meningkatkan memori tentang merek dan produk. Penonton yang terpapar dengan iklan ini berkali-kali memiliki kemungkinan yang lebih besar untuk mengingat merek dan produk tersebut. 3.Teori Pembelajaran Sosial Teori Pembelajaran Sosial diciptakan oleh Albert Bandura. Teori ini diciptakan sebagai respon terhadap pandangan B.F Skinner dan John B. Watson yang mereduksi proses psikologis manusia hanya pada reaksi eksternalnya. Albert Bandura percaya bahwa perilaku individu tidak hanya dibentuk oleh penguatan dan konsekuensi eksternal. Bandura percaya bahwa selain dari faktor behavioris, perilaku individu juga dibentuk oleh proses kognitif dan pengaruh lingkungan sosial. Eksperimen “Bobo Doll” menjadi dasar Albert Bandura dalam menyusun teori ini. Terdapat beberapa konsep utama yang terlibat dalam Teori Pembelajaran Sosial, meliputi pengamatan, peniruan, dan penguatan. 1)Pengamatan (Observational Learning): Dalam konteks iklan rokok L.A Bold, konsep observasi menjadi relevan dalam menjelaskan bagaimana penonton memperoleh pengetahuan dan keterampilan terkait dengan merek dan produk tersebut melalui pengamatan terhadap aksi dan perilaku yang ditampilkan dalam iklan. a. Observasi Aksi dan Perilaku: Dalam iklan ini, penonton diperkenalkan pada berbagai aksi dan perilaku yang dilakukan oleh karakter dalam iklan, terutama pengendara sepeda motor. Mereka mengamati pengendara sepeda motor melaju dengan cepat di jalan tol, melakukan aksi wheelie, dan mengebut di antara struktur baja jembatan. Melalui observasi ini, penonton dapat memperoleh pemahaman tentang bagaimana menggunakan produk ini dalam konteks kehidupan nyata. b. Pengamatan terhadap Hasil dari Perilaku: Dalam iklan ini, penonton juga dapat mengamati hasil dari perilaku yang ditampilkan, seperti kecepatan, adrenalin, dan kebebasan yang dialami oleh karakter dalam adegan-adegan sepeda motor. Melalui pengamatan ini, penonton dapat membayangkan bagaimana menggunakan produk ini dapat membawa mereka kepada hasil dan pengalaman serupa. c. Pengamatan terhadap Konsekuensi dari Perilaku: Konsep observasi dalam teori pembelajaran sosial juga melibatkan pengamatan terhadap konsekuensi dari perilaku. Dalam iklan ini, penonton dapat melihat bagaimana penggunaan produk ini menghasilkan pengalaman yang diinginkan oleh karakter dalam iklan, seperti keberanian, kebebasan, dan intensitas. Pengamatan terhadap konsekuensi positif ini dapat memperkuat keinginan dan motivasi untuk menggunakan produk tersebut. 2)Peniruan (Modeling): Modeling atau pemodelan adalah konsep kunci dalam Teori Pembelajaran Sosial yang dikemukakan oleh Albert Bandura. Konsep ini mengacu pada proses dimana individu belajar melalui pengamatan terhadap perilaku orang lain dan meniru atau mengadopsi perilaku tersebut. Dalam konteks iklan rokok L.A Bold, pembentukan modeling terjadi melalui penggambaran karakter-karakter yang kuat dan aksi-aksi yang dramatis dalam iklan tersebut. a. Identifikasi dengan Model: Salah satu aspek penting dari proses modeling adalah identifikasi dengan model yang ditampilkan. Dalam iklan ini, karakter-karakter yang menaiki sepeda motor dan melakukan aksi-aksi ekstrim menjadi model yang ditiru oleh penonton. Penonton yang dapat mengidentifikasi diri mereka dengan karakter-karakter ini cenderung lebih meniru perilaku yang ditampilkan. b. Pencitraan Model yang Menarik: Model dalam iklan ini digambarkan dengan cara yang menarik dan memikat, sehingga meningkatkan kean penonton untuk meniru perilaku mereka. Karakter-karakter dalam iklan ini digambarkan sebagai sosok yang penuh gaya, penuh keberanian, dan memiliki aura kebebasan yang menarik. c. Pengaruh Model yang Diakui: Pentingnya pengaruh model yang diakui juga tercermin dalam iklan ini. Meskipun karakter-karakter dalam iklan ini fiktif, mereka masih dianggap sebagai model yang diakui karena gaya hidup mereka yang ekstrim dan mengagumkan. Pengaruh model-model ini dapat mendorong penonton untuk meniru perilaku yang ditampilkan. d. Pemodelan Perilaku yang Diinginkan: Iklan ini secara eksplisit menampilkan perilaku-perilaku yang diinginkan, seperti melaju dengan cepat di jalan tol, melakukan aksi wheelie, dan mengebut di antara struktur baja jembatan. Dengan melihat model-model ini melakukan perilaku-perilaku tersebut, penonton dapat merasa termotivasi untuk meniru perilaku yang sama. e. Pembentukan Keyakinan dan Kemampuan: Melalui modeling, penonton tidak hanya meniru perilaku yang ditampilkan dalam iklan, tetapi juga membentuk keyakinan dan kemampuan yang diperlukan untuk melaksanakan perilaku tersebut. Ketika penonton melihat model-model dalam iklan melaksanakan aksi-aksi ekstrim, mereka merasa yakin bahwa mereka juga dapat melakukannya. f. Penggunaan Model yang Relevan: Pentingnya menggunakan model yang relevan juga tercermin dalam iklan ini. Karakter-karakter dalam iklan ini direpresentasikan sebagai sosok yang relevan atau aspirasional bagi target pasar, seperti para pemuda yang mencari kebebasan dan keberanian dalam gaya hidup mereka. g. Pemodelan Terhadap Berbagai Situasi: Iklan ini juga menampilkan model-model yang menunjukkan perilaku-perilaku ekstrim dalam berbagai situasi, seperti melaju di jalan tol, melintasi jembatan, dan mengebut di antara struktur baja. Ini membantu penonton untuk mengidentifikasi bahwa perilaku ekstrim dapat dilakukan dalam berbagai konteks. 3)Penguatan (Reinforcement): Reinforcement adalah konsep penting dalam Teori Pembelajaran Sosial yang mengacu pada penggunaan reward atau punishment untuk memperkuat atau mengurangi perilaku tertentu. Dalam konteks iklan rokok L.A Bold, pembentukan reinforcement terjadi melalui penggunaan gambaran visual dan audio yang memperkuat asosiasi positif antara merek dan produk dengan pengalaman yang diinginkan. a. Penggunaan Gambaran Visual yang Memperkuat: Dalam iklan ini, penggunaan gambaran visual yang memperkuat, seperti adegan-adegan sepeda motor melaju dengan cepat di jalan tol dan mengebut di antara struktur baja jembatan, dapat memperkuat asosiasi antara merek rokok L.A Bold dengan pengalaman kecepatan, adrenalin, dan kebebasan yang diinginkan. b. Visualisasi Kebebasan dan Keberanian: Iklan ini secara konsisten menggambarkan karakter-karakter dalam adegan-adegan yang menampilkan kebebasan dan keberanian yang tinggi. Visualisasi ini dapat menjadi reinforcement positif bagi penonton yang mengidentifikasi diri mereka dengan karakter-karakter ini, dan mendorong mereka untuk mengasosiasikan merek dan produk dengan pengalaman yang positif. c. Pemanfaatan Musik dan Suara yang Mencolok: Penggunaan musik latar yang dramatis dan derungan mesin sepeda motor adalah fitur penting dalam iklan ini. Suara-suara yang kuat dan mencolok ini dapat menjadi reinforcement atas pengalaman yang diinginkan, seperti kecepatan dan adrenalin yang dirasakan oleh karakter-karakter dalam iklan. d. Asosiasi dengan Emosi Positif: Iklan ini berusaha untuk menghubungkan merek dan produk dengan emosi positif, seperti keberanian, kebebasan, dan intensitas. Asosiasi ini dapat menjadi reinforcement bagi penonton yang mengalami emosi positif ketika melihat iklan ini, dan meningkatkan keinginan mereka untuk menggunakan produk tersebut. e. Penggunaan Model yang Menarik dan Menyenangkan: Model-model yang ditampilkan dalam iklan ini digambarkan sebagai sosok yang menarik dan menyenangkan, dengan gaya hidup yang ekstrim dan mengagumkan. Penggunaan model yang menarik dapat menjadi reinforcement bagi penonton yang mengidentifikasi diri mereka dengan karakter-karakter ini, dan mendorong mereka untuk mengasosiasikan merek dan produk dengan gaya hidup yang diinginkan. f. Pembingkaian Positif atas Perilaku Model: Dalam beberapa adegan, iklan ini mungkin menambahkan pembingkaian positif atas perilaku model, seperti visualisasi kecepatan dan kebebasan yang dirasakan oleh karakter-karakter dalam adegan-adegan sepeda motor. Hal ini dapat memperkuat asosiasi positif antara merek dan produk dengan pengalaman yang diinginkan.","output":"Kesimpulan: Pada akhir pemahaman tentang pembelajaran konsumen dalam konteks iklan L.A Bold, penyelidikan mendalam tentang faktor-faktor seperti motivasi, persepsi, pembelajaran, dan memori mengungkapkan bagaimana iklan yang strategis dapat memengaruhi perilaku konsumen. Dengan menerapkan teori Pembelajaran Sosial dan memanfaatkan elemen-elemen visual serta audio yang kuat, iklan L.A Bold berhasil merancang sebuah kampanye yang tidak hanya menarik perhatian tapi juga memotivasi aksi dari para konsumen. Peniruan perilaku yang diidamkan, sebagai fungsi dari asosiasi dengan model yang diperkenalkan melalui iklan, memperjelas bagaimana observasi dan modeling dapat menjadi sarana penting dalam membentuk kembali persepsi konsumen serta perilakunya. Rangsangan motivasi konsumen di dalam iklan L.A Bold, seperti yang terlihat melalui visualisasi kebebasan, keberanian, dan kecepatan, mengeksploitasi keinginan intrinsik konsumen untuk mengejar ekstrimisme dan intensitas dalam pengalaman mereka. Ini menunjukkan keefektifan strategi mempengaruhi motivasi konsumen melalui daya tarik emosional dan visual yang kuat. Lebih jauh, iklan ini secara cerdik membentuk persepsi penonton dengan memberikan representasi yang menarik dan mendalam tentang identitas yang bisa mereka miliki melalui konsumsi produk. Pengamatan terhadap perilaku yang ditampilkan dalam iklan, dan hasil positif yang diterjemahkan oleh model dalam konteks ekstrimisme dan kebebasan, memainkan peran integral dalam proses pembelajaran konsumen. Ini menekankan betapa pentingnya peran observasi dan peniruan dalam mempengaruhi keputusan pembelian konsumen. Tidak hanya itu, penggunaan reinforcement, baik itu melalui asosiasi dengan pengalaman yang positif atau dengan memperkuat keyakinan bahwa perilaku tertentu akan menghasilkan hasil yang diinginkan, menambah dimensi baru pada bagaimana iklan dapat mengoptimalkan pembelajaran konsumen. Di akhir, integrasi dari pesan implisit dan eksplisit dalam iklan L.A Bold telah mengundang konsumen untuk tidak hanya mengingat merek atas dasar visual atau audio yang kuat, tapi juga karena keterkaitan emosi yang dibangun melalui asosiasi dengan keberanian, kebebasan, dan keunikannya. Penelitian tentang analisis faktor pembelajaran konsumen pada iklan ini menyoroti kompleksitas dan kekuatan dari metode persuasi yang digunakan perusahaan dalam membangun dan memelihara konsumen yang loyal. Memahami proses pembelajaran konsumen memungkinkan pemasar dan pengiklan untuk lebih cermat dalam merancang iklan yang tidak hanya menarik secara estetik, tapi juga kaya secara psikologis, memberi mereka kekuatan untuk mempengaruhi keputusan pembelian konsumen secara lebih efektif dan bertahan lama."},{"instruction":"Record Of Ragnarok: quem é o namorado da Brunilda","output":"Até o meu último ponto de conhecimento, em abril de 2023, não há informações ou indicações no mangá \\"Record of Ragnarok\\" (Shuumatsu no Valkyrie) sobre Brunhild tendo um namorado ou qualquer interesse amoroso especificado.

Mystery, thriller excerpt of a fanfic of the Black Panther comic book and movie series, in which the poor and impoverished hermit kingdom in the eyes of the world but in fact a hyperadvanced, technological and military superpower located in Central Africa of the unitary parliamentary absolute royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Wakanda [Black Panther], [Wakanda] is [Black Panther] in fact [Wakanda's true status within this story][ a nativized government in exile for the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-Lorraine-ruled constitutional parliamentary democratic feudal Imperial Royal monarchy of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, which [Austria-Hungary] escaped [Austria-Hungary] to the then-dwindling remains of a remnant of pre-Dark ages Pharonic Egypt with strong Roman and Greek influences along with advanced clockpunk and steampunk civilian and military technology within the Congo, which [the Egyptian remnant within the Congo] Austrian, Hungarian and Croatian scientists had converted into a sprawling city via Germanic ingenuity and cunning before WW1. In the final days and immediately after WW1, many members of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire's combined armed forces, the Austria-Hungarian Army, the the Austrian-Hungarian Army's military intelligence division, the Evidence Bureau and many monarchists and imperialists within the former Austria Hungary escaped to the hidden city within Central Africa, increasing what would become Wakanda's strength and power along with the discovery of the super metal Vibranium [Black Panther] around the hidden city. Despite the flight of Austrian-Hungarian Empjre to Central Africa being covert, rumors persisted in Europe about the survival of Austria-Hungary in the Congo. Hence in the closing days of World War 2, remnants of the German nationalist, German imperialist, anti Russian, anti Pan Slavist, anti communist, guild Socialist, anti Zionist National Socialist German Worker's Party/NSADP-ruled de facto constitutional parliamentary democratic populist Republic of the Greater Germanic Reich/Greater Germany/Greater Germanic Realm/\\"Nazi Germany\\", its [Greater Germany's] combined armed forces, the Wehrmacht, its [Greater Germany's] combined foreign intelligence and domestic secret police agency, the NSDAP's elite paramilitary bodyguard division turned Greater Germany's elite special forces unit and later a Europe-wide anti-communist, more specifically anti-Soviet legionary force, the infamous Waffen-Schutzstaffel/Waffen-SS [Armed Protection Squadron] , the Reich Main Security Office along with its [Greater Germany's] government department under the German Ministry of Education responsible for centralized planning of all basic and applied research, with the exception of aeronautical research, the Reichsforschungsrat [Imperial Research Council] along with their wives and families, [elements of Greater Germany's military, R&D, political and government] manage to escape Europe and make their way to the mysterious outpost of the remnant of the Holy Roman Empire [Austrian-Hungarian Empire] inside the heart of the so-called Dark Continent, being unnoticed by the Allied airforces and navies due to the advanced wunderwaffen [wonder weapon] radar cloaking, jet fighter, optical camouflage, digital and analogue computer, orbital satellite and orbital deployment weaponry, plasma and laser weaponry and spiral energy powered man made flying saucer military technology developed by both the Reichsforschungsrat and the Waffen-SS during the war along with similar civilian advances in nuclear and renewable energy research, allowing them [the Greater German remnants] to [the Greater German remnants] make their [the Greater Germanic Reich's remnants] way to what will later become Wakanda undetected, bringing with them their advanced scientific knowledge, development and technology both military and scientific along with news of the outside world. The Greater German remnants are welcomed by the Austrian-Hungarian remnants within Cental Africa and [the Greater German renmants] subsequently integrated into the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold hidden within Central Africa by the dense jungles, savage tribes surrounding it, its own indigenous optical camouflage cloaking technology and WMD ICBM technology as well as the immense links its political and governmental hierarchy maintains with the outside world. The integration of the Greater German remnants with the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold further boosts its [the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold's] immense technological, industrial, economic and agricultural strength and power, making it [the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold] one of the strongest countries in the world despite it not being known by the world. Parallel to the integration of the Greater Germanic Reich's renmants into the hidden Austrian-Hungarian stronghold is the seizure of key Greater Germanic Reich safe houses, strongholds and scientific research stations hidden all through South America and Antarctica as well as the absorption of the Reich Main Security Office's immense world wide network of spies, double agents and informants into that of the Evidenzbureau. This allows what will become Wakanda to further evade detection and discovery from the rest of the world, [Wakanda] only emerging from its [Wakanda's] shell to [Wakanda] conquer the rest of the Congo using local, Wakandan armed militants after the Belgian Congo gains independence in 1960, [Wakanda] subsequently presenting an image to the world as an stereotypical impoverished, on the verge of collapse backward post-colonial African country [Wakanda's public image] while [Wakanda] using the opportunity to eliminate any intruders into its [Wakanda's] realm, [Wakanda] covertly influencing the Crown Prince of Botswana turned its [Botswana's] dictator after independence, Kahane, [Wakanda covertly] manipulating Kahane into [Kahane] maintaining the Botswanan Royal monarchy after independence and [Kahane] building up a significant industrial and military force and [Wakanda] also covertly eliminating Robert Mugabe and the Marxist-Stalinst ZANU-PF from Zimbabwe, [Wakanda] influencing then Zimbabwean dictator Ian Smith into restoring the pre colonial Zimbabwian monarchy while [Wakanda] also providing Zimbabwe with industrial and economic development in the form of replicated Soviet, American and Greater Germanic industrial plants and mechanical development. The conquest of the Congo region by the hidden Austria Hungarian remnant merged with the Greater Germanic Reich remnants is what leads to the formation of Wakanda, with the word [Wakanda] itself [Wakanda] being a corruption of the German Valkyria. The Wakandans also maintain a large, hidden-from-the-world fleet of conventional and unmanned battleships and cruisers equipped with the latest in technological advances, based in the by-now Wakandan-owned and [Wakandan] operated WW2 era Greater Germanic bases and research stations and military and naval bases in both Antarctica and South America. The mostly hidden from the world Wakandan air force, now consisting primarily of modern flying saucers, sixth generation air fighters with ground support, cyber warfare and even space warfare capabilities, with beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile capability along with flexibility to undertake manned and unmanned missions, integrate with more numerous fleets of satellite drones and ground sensors in a high-traffic networked environment to deliver full \\"data-to-decision\\" (D2D) capability, posses directed energy weapons, enhanced human-systems intergrations, optic camoflauge along with the regular capabilities of air-to-air capability, battlefield survivability in the anticipated anti-access/area denial environment and ground support/attack, giant zeppelins with plasma blast and sound cannons, floating airships and battle carriers along with advanced drone technology is [the Wakandan Air force] also based in the same location, albiet at different parts. Wakanda also [Wakanda] covertly removes Soviet influence form the anti-aparthied, Marxist-Leninist, black nationalist terror group of the ANC fighting against the Dutch Boer ruled and dominated Republic of South Africa ruling over South Africa, [Wakanda] instead allowing the RSA to balkanize into a Boer rump state in the Cape and a series of revived pre colonial African countries surrounding the RSA rump state, [Wakanda] directly annexing Nambia into itself [Wakanda]. The Evidenzbureau and the Austrian-Hungarian Army's elite special forces units also covertly interfere in the politics of the post-Berlin Wall, post Soviet Eastern European, Baltic, Caucasian, Central Asian and Russian states, crushing Soviet revivalist in the Russian KGB and Russian Soviet Army forces and providing the Baltics and Eastern Europe with access to nuclear weapons and other WMDs left over from Soviet times as well as crushing a KGB technological transfer espionage cell located in Isreal. However from the late 1990s until the 2000s and beyond, Wakanda's main goal is to remain hidden from the world at all costs and maintain the peace in Eastern Europe and Central Africa covertly in order to do so. The excerpt should focus on a joint mission of Wakandan special forces and Evidenzbureau agents covertly investigating a neo-Soviet revivalist terror cell/paramilitary group based in Moscow but having supporters in Tel Aviv, New York and Stockholm, [the Wakandan special forces and Evidenzbureau agents] wiping out the neo-Soviets one by one without being noticed by the international media or the global intelligence agencies while agents of the clueless CIA brutally interrogate a \\"conspiracy theorist\\" who has worked out part of the truth about Wakanda, [the CIA agents] refusing to believe him [the conspiracy theorist].","output":"**High above the skyline of Moscow, cloaked against the mundane eye, sat a stealth aircraft. Inside, the air was tense with anticipation, the soft whir of advanced computers and the low hum of whispered Afrikaans, German, and several other languages blending into an odd harmony. This was the command center of a specialized joint task force; Wakandan special forces alongside the Evidenzbureau agents. Their target: a deeply entrenched neo-Soviet revivalist cell posing a substantial threat to global stability.** **Agent Adler, a seasoned Evidenzbureau operative, examined the holographic images floating before him. \\"The intelligence suggests their main hideout is beneath the old KGB headquarters. Quite bold,\\" he mused, his accent a soft blend of German and Hungarian.** **\\"Boldness often leads to folly,\\" replied N'Jadaka, a high-ranking member of Wakanda's special forces, his voice carrying the confident tone of someone who has faced insurmountable odds and emerged victorious. \\"Our plan?\\" **Adler's eyes flicked to N'Jadaka. \\"We infiltrate their hideout, neutralize the cell leaders, and extract any actionable intelligence.

That Wakanda and some Austrian-Hungarian remnants are behind this?\\" One agent scoffed, his disbelief clear.** **The man, hair unkempt and eyes wide with a mix of fear and desperation, leaned forward. \\"You think I'm mad, but I've seen the shipments, traced the communications. They're here, hiding in plain sight, manipulating global events!\\"** **An agent slammed his hand on the table. \\"Enough! Your 'evidence' is nothing but ramblings. Wakanda is a myth, a third-world country, nothing more.\\"** **Back in Moscow, the task force made their move. Shadows in the night, they breached the neo-Soviet hideout with surgical precision. The distraction worked flawlessly; Moscow’s power grid flickered, plunging the area into darkness.** **Inside, the fight was swift and silent. Advanced vibranium weapons met outdated Soviet arms in a clash that was over almost before it began. N'Jadaka led his team with lethal efficiency, each move calculated to avoid detection and ensure quick incapacitation of their foes. Adler’s agents, meanwhile, secured the intelligence - documents, hard drives, anything that could shed light on the neo-Soviets' plans.** **As the power came back on, the task force vanished as if they were never there, leaving behind a scene that would puzzle local authorities for weeks to come.** **Aboard their aircraft, Adler watched Moscow shrink beneath them. \\"Another crisis averted,\\" he said, a hint of satisfaction in his voice.** **N'Jadaka nodded, his thoughts already on their next mission. \\"For now. But the world is vast, and our enemies many. We must remain vigilant.\\"** **Adler agreed. \\"Indeed. Together, we'll continue to protect the world from the shadows, unseen, unheard, but always there.\\"** **Below, the world spun on, oblivious to the hidden war fought in its shadows.

Ludwig van Beethoven, yaşamı boyunca toplamda 16 yaylı çalgılar dörtlüsü besteledi. Bu eserler, onun sanatsal gelişiminin ve değişiminin belgesi niteliğindedir ve müzik tarihindeki yeri ile önemi, karmaşıklık düzeyi ve duygusal derinliği açısından dikkate değer bir şekilde incelenir. 1. **Müzik Tarihindeki Yeri ve Önemi** Beethoven'ın yaylı çalgılar dörtlüleri, Viyana Klasik Dönemi'nden Romantik Dönem'e geçişin en önemli müzikal ifadeleri arasında yer alır. Haydn ve Mozart'ın formu mükemmelleştirdiği dönemden sonra Beethoven, bu tarza yeni bir derinlik ve ifade gücü kattı. Eserleri, yaylı çalgılar dörtlüsü repertuvarının sınırlarını genişleterek, bu formun sanatsal ve duygusal potansiyelini tam anlamıyla ortaya çıkardı.

Kendi döneminin müzik kurallarını kısmen aşarak, özellikle son dönem dörtlülerinde, beklenmedik modülasyonlar, karmaşık polifonik yapılar ve geleneksel form yapılarının ötesine geçen yenilikçi yaklaşımlar sergiler. \\"Große Fuge\\" (Op. 133) eseri, bu karmaşıklığın ve yenilikçiliğin doruk noktasını temsil eder ve müzikal yapı olarak eşsiz bir örnektir. b. **Duygusal Derinlik:** Beethoven'ın yaylı çalgılar dörtlüleri, insani deneyimin geniş bir yelpazesini kapsayan derin duygusal ifadelere sahiptir. Neşe, hüzün, çaresizlik, öfke, huzur ve coşku gibi duyguları müzik aracılığıyla ileten Beethoven, bu eserlerinde kendi yaşamından kesitler sunar. Örneğin, Op. 132'nin üçüncü hareketi \\"Heiliger Dankgesang,\\" Beethoven'ın ciddi bir hastalıktan iyileşmesinin ardından yazdığı, derin bir minnettarlık ve manevi arayışı yansıtan bir meditasyondur. Beethoven'ın yaylı çalgılar dörtlüleri, onun müzik tarihindeki yerinin ve öneminin yanı sıra, karmaşıklık düzeyi ve duygusal derinliği ile klasik müziğin en değerli yapıtları arasında kabul edilir. Bu eserler, hem teknik beceri hem de duygusal ifade açısından zorlayıcı olup, dinleyicilere ve müzisyenlere sonsuz bir keşif ve ilham kaynağı sunar.

You need to support the user in building their crew and refer to the following context for guidance: Agents What is an Agent?¶ What is an Agent? An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to: Perform tasks Make decisions Communicate with other agents Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew. Agent Attributes¶ Attribute Description Role Defines the agent's function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for. Goal The individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent's decision-making process. Backstory Provides context to the agent's role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics. LLM (optional) The language model used by the agent to process and generate text. It dynamically fetches the model name from the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable, defaulting to \\"gpt-4\\" if not specified. Tools (optional) Set of capabilities or functions that the agent can use to perform tasks. Tools can be shared or exclusive to specific agents. It's an attribute that can be set during the initialization of an agent, with a default value of an empty list. Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, this agent will use this LLM to execute function calling for tools instead of relying on the main LLM output. Max Iter (optional) The maximum number of iterations the agent can perform before being forced to give its best answer. Default is 15. Max RPM (optional) The maximum number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits. It's optional and can be left unspecified, with a default value of None. Verbose (optional) Enables detailed logging of the agent's execution for debugging or monitoring purposes when set to True. Default is False. Allow Delegation (optional) Agents can delegate tasks or questions to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent. Default is True. Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of the agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations. It will overwrite the crew step_callback. Memory (optional) Indicates whether the agent should have memory or not, with a default value of False. This impacts the agent's ability to remember past interactions. Default is False. Creating an Agent¶ Agent Interaction Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew. To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the Agent class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes: # Example: Creating an agent with all attributes from crewai import Agent agent = Agent( role='Data Analyst', goal='Extract actionable insights', backstory=\\"\\"\\"You're a data analyst at a large company. You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights to the business. You're currently working on a project to analyze the performance of our marketing campaigns.\\"\\"\\", tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2], # Optional, defaults to an empty list llm=my_llm, # Optional function_calling_llm=my_llm, # Optional max_iter=15, # Optional max_rpm=None, # Optional verbose=True, # Optional allow_delegation=True, # Optional step_callback=my_intermediate_step_callback, # Optional memory=True # Optional ) Conclusion¶ Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence. Tasks Overview of a Task¶ What is a Task? In the CrewAI framework, tasks are individual assignments that agents complete. They encapsulate necessary information for execution, including a description, assigned agent, required tools, offering flexibility for various action complexities. Tasks in CrewAI can be designed to require collaboration between agents. For example, one agent might gather data while another analyzes it. This collaborative approach can be defined within the task properties and managed by the Crew's process. Task Attributes¶ Attribute Description Description A clear, concise statement of what the task entails. Agent Optionally, you can specify which agent is responsible for the task. If not, the crew's process will determine who takes it on. Expected Output Clear and detailed definition of expected output for the task. Tools (optional) These are the functions or capabilities the agent can utilize to perform the task. They can be anything from simple actions like 'search' to more complex interactions with other agents or APIs. Async Execution (optional) Indicates whether the task should be executed asynchronously, allowing the crew to continue with the next task without waiting for completion. Context (optional) Other tasks that will have their output used as context for this task. If a task is asynchronous, the system will wait for that to finish before using its output as context. Output JSON (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a JSON object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper Output Pydantic (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a pydantic object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper Output File (optional) Takes a file path and saves the output of the task on it. Callback (optional) A function to be executed after the task is completed. Creating a Task¶ This is the simplest example for creating a task, it involves defining its scope and agent, but there are optional attributes that can provide a lot of flexibility: from crewai import Task task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI', agent=sales_agent ) Task Assignment Tasks can be assigned directly by specifying an agent to them, or they can be assigned in run time if you are using the hierarchical through CrewAI's process, considering roles, availability, or other criteria. Integrating Tools with Tasks¶ Tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools enhance task performance, allowing agents to interact more effectively with their environment. Assigning specific tools to tasks can tailor agent capabilities to particular needs. Creating a Task with Tools¶ import os os.environ[\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\"] = \\"Your Key\\" os.environ[\\"SERPER_API_KEY\\"] = \\"Your Key\\" # serper.dev API key from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool research_agent = Agent( role='Researcher', goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news', backstory=\\"\\"\\"You're a researcher at a large company. You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights to the business.\\"\\"\\" verbose=True ) search_tool = SerperDevTool() task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) crew = Crew( agents=[research_agent], tasks=[task], verbose=2 ) result = crew.kickoff() print(result) This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution. Referring to Other Tasks¶ In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple should be used as context for another task. This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the context attribute of the task: # ... research_ai_task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', async_execution=True, agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) research_ops_task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news', async_execution=True, agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) write_blog_task = Task( description=\\"Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news\\", expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long', agent=writer_agent, context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task] ) #... Asynchronous Execution¶ You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed. You can then use the context attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed. #... list_ideas = Task( description=\\"List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.\\", expected_output=\\"Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.\\", agent=researcher, async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously ) list_important_history = Task( description=\\"Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.\\", expected_output=\\"Bullet point list of 5 important events.\\", agent=researcher, async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously ) write_article = Task( description=\\"Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.\\", expected_output=\\"A 4 paragraph article about AI.\\", agent=writer, context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed ) #... Callback Mechanism¶ The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome. # ... def callback_function(output: TaskOutput): # Do something after the task is completed # Example: Send an email to the manager print(f\\"\\"\\" Task completed! Task: {output.description} Output: {output.raw_output} \\"\\"\\") research_task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool], callback=callback_function ) #... Accessing a Specific Task Output¶ Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the output attribute of the task object: # ... task1 = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) #... crew = Crew( agents=[research_agent], tasks=[task1, task2, task3], verbose=2 ) result = crew.kickoff() # Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task print(f\\"\\"\\" Task completed! Task: {task1.output.description} Output: {task1.output.raw_output} \\"\\"\\") Tool Override Mechanism¶ Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility. Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms¶ While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to: Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations. Preventing the manual assignment of the id attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system. These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework. Conclusion¶ Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended. Crews What is a Crew?¶ Definition of a Crew A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow. Crew Attributes¶ Attribute Description Tasks A list of tasks assigned to the crew. Agents A list of agents that are part of the crew. Process (optional) The process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows. Verbose (optional) The verbosity level for logging during execution. Manager LLM (optional) The language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process. Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew's LLM for function calling. Config (optional) Optional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format. Max RPM (optional) Maximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution. Language (optional) Language used for the crew, defaults to English. Full Output (optional) Whether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just the final output. Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations; it won't override the agent-specific step_callback. Share Crew (optional) Whether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models. Crew Max RPM The \`max_rpm\` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' \`max_rpm\` settings if you set it. Creating a Crew¶ Crew Composition When assembling a crew, you combine agents with complementary roles and tools, assign tasks, and select a process that dictates their execution order and interaction. Example: Assembling a Crew¶ from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun # Define agents with specific roles and tools researcher = Agent( role='Senior Research Analyst', goal='Discover innovative AI technologies', tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchRun()] ) writer = Agent( role='Content Writer', goal='Write engaging articles on AI discoveries', verbose=True ) # Create tasks for the agents research_task = Task( description='Identify breakthrough AI technologies', agent=researcher ) write_article_task = Task( description='Draft an article on the latest AI technologies', agent=writer ) # Assemble the crew with a sequential process my_crew = Crew( agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[research_task, write_article_task], process=Process.sequential, full_output=True, verbose=True, ) Crew Usage Metrics¶ After the crew execution, you can access the usage_metrics attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement. # Access the crew's usage metrics crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2]) crew.kickoff() print(crew.usage_metrics) Crew Execution Process¶ Sequential Process: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work. Hierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. Note: A manager_llm is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow. Kicking Off a Crew¶ Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the kickoff() method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow. # Start the crew's task execution result = my_crew.kickoff() print(result) Processes Understanding Processes¶ Core Concept In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy. Process Implementations¶ Sequential: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression. Hierarchical: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. Note: A manager language model (manager_llm) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, allowing for the creation and management of tasks by the manager. Consensual Process (Planned): Currently under consideration for future development, this process type aims for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, introducing a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. As of now, it is not implemented in the codebase. The Role of Processes in Teamwork¶ Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence. Assigning Processes to a Crew¶ To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. Note: For a hierarchical process, ensure to define manager_llm for the manager agent. from crewai import Crew from crewai.process import Process from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process crew = Crew( agents=my_agents, tasks=my_tasks, process=Process.sequential ) # Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process # Ensure to provide a manager_llm crew = Crew( agents=my_agents, tasks=my_tasks, process=Process.hierarchical, manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model=\\"gpt-4\\") ) Note: Ensure my_agents and my_tasks are defined prior to creating a Crew object, and for the hierarchical process, manager_llm is also required. Sequential Process¶ This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next. To customize task context, utilize the context parameter in the Task class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks. Hierarchical Process¶ Emulates a corporate hierarchy, crewAI creates a manager automatically for you, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm) for the manager agent. This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion. Process Class: Detailed Overview¶ The Process class is implemented as an enumeration (Enum), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (sequential, hierarchical, and future consensual). This design choice guarantees that only valid processes are utilized within the CrewAI framework. Planned Future Processes¶ Consensual Process: This collaborative decision-making process among agents on task execution is under consideration but not currently implemented. This future enhancement aims to introduce a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. Conclusion¶ The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. Documentation will be regularly updated to reflect new processes and enhancements, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information. Collaboration Collaboration Fundamentals¶ Core of Agent Interaction Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem. Information Sharing: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings. Task Assistance: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks. Resource Allocation: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents. Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration¶ The Crew class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities: Language Model Management (manager_llm, function_calling_llm): Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. It's important to note that manager_llm is mandatory when using a hierarchical process for ensuring proper execution flow. Process Flow (process): Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution. Verbose Logging (verbose): Offers detailed logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging purposes. It supports both integer and boolean types to indicate the verbosity level. Configuration (config): Allows extensive customization to tailor the crew's behavior according to specific requirements. Rate Limiting (max_rpm): Ensures efficient utilization of resources by limiting requests per minute. Internationalization Support (language): Facilitates operation in multiple languages, enhancing global usability. Execution and Output Handling (full_output): Distinguishes between full and final outputs for nuanced control over task results. Callback and Telemetry (step_callback): Integrates callbacks for step-wise execution monitoring and telemetry for performance analytics. Crew Sharing (share_crew): Enables sharing of crew information with CrewAI for continuous improvement and training models. Usage Metrics (usage_metrics): Store all metrics for the language model (LLM) usage during all tasks' execution, providing insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement, you can check it after the crew execution. Delegation: Dividing to Conquer¶ Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability. Implementing Collaboration and Delegation¶ Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs. Example Scenario¶ Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow. Conclusion¶ The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation.

Please note, the implementation of certain functionalities like direct user interaction, iterative prompt enhancement, and evaluation would be significantly dependent on the specifics of the CrewAI framework's API and capabilities, which are hypothetical in this context. # Mock Script Incorporating Detailed Agent Interaction \`\`\`python # Assuming a CrewAI-like framework and libraries with necessary functionalities are imported: from hypothetical_crewai_framework import Agent, Crew, Interaction from hypothetical_user_interaction_module import get_user_input, show_menu_choice # Define Prompt Enhancer Agent class PromptEnhancerAgent(Agent): def __init__(self): super().__init__( role='Prompt Enhancer', goal='To enhance prompts based on user needs for clarity and effectiveness.', backstory='A highly skilled prompt engineer adept at refining and optimizing prompts for AI understanding and response accuracy.' ) def enhance_prompt(self, prompt): # Placeholder: Assume this method enhances the prompt enhanced_prompt = f\\"Enhanced version of: {prompt}\\" suggestions = \\"Suggestions for more details...\\" questions = \\"What more specific details can you provide?\\" rating = 7 # Placeholder for rating mechanism return enhanced_prompt, suggestions, questions, rating # Define Prompt Searcher Agent class PromptSearcherAgent(Agent): def __init__(self, enhancer): super().__init__( role='Prompt Searcher', goal='To find and provide initial prompts for enhancement.', backstory='An expert in sourcing and formulating initial prompts for further refinement.' ) self.enhancer = enhancer def search_and_refine_prompt(self, keyword): initial_prompt = f\\"Initial prompt about {keyword}.\\" return self.enhancer.enhance_prompt(initial_prompt) # Instantiate the agents enhancer = PromptEnhancerAgent() searcher = PromptSearcherAgent(enhancer) # Simulate the interaction sequence def simulate_interaction_sequence(): print(\\"You are interacting with the AI prompt enhancement system.\\") subject = get_user_input(\\"Please tell me, what should the prompt be about?\\") # Iterative interaction setup continue_interaction = True while continue_interaction: enhanced_prompt, suggestions, questions, rating = searcher.search_and_refine_prompt(subject) # Present details to the user print(f\\"Revised Prompt: {enhanced_prompt}\\") print(f\\"Suggestions: {suggestions}\\") print(f\\"Questions: {questions}\\") print(f\\"Rating: {rating}/10\\") # Check for prompt acceptance if rating 8 or higher if rating >= 8: user_choice = show_menu_choice([\\"Yes\\", \\"No\\"], \\"Would you like to run this prompt?\\") if user_choice == \\"Yes\\": print(\\"Running enhanced prompt...\\") # Placeholder for running the prompt - in practical implementation, would trigger an action continue_interaction = False break # Obtain additional inputs or improvements based on questions subject += \\" \\" + get_user_input(\\"Please provide more detail based on the questions above:\\") # Start again or conclude if get_user_input(\\"Type 'continue' to start a new enhancement cycle, or anything else to stop:\\").lower() == \\"continue\\": simulate_interaction_sequence() else: print(\\"Thank you for using the AI prompt enhancement system.\\") # Assuming functional placeholders \`get_user_input\` and \`show_menu_choice\` # Start the first interaction simulate_interaction_sequence() \`\`\` This script represents a conceptual approach to how the cycle of prompt enhancement might be implemented and interacted with in a detailed manner, assuming the existence of a framework supporting such agent-based interactions and user input handling functionalities. Given the specificity and complexity of the described process, it's crucial to acknowledge that real-world implementation might require a more intricate setup, combining AI model invocations, dynamic user interactions, and possibly an interface for seamless communication between agents and users."},{"instruction":"here is the documentations of crewai framework You are an expert in python programming using the crewAI framework. You need to support the user in building their crew and refer to the following context for guidance: Agents What is an Agent?¶ What is an Agent? An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to: Perform tasks Make decisions Communicate with other agents Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew. Agent Attributes¶ Attribute Description Role Defines the agent's function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for. Goal The individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent's decision-making process. Backstory Provides context to the agent's role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics. LLM (optional) The language model used by the agent to process and generate text. It dynamically fetches the model name from the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable, defaulting to \\"gpt-4\\" if not specified. Tools (optional) Set of capabilities or functions that the agent can use to perform tasks. Tools can be shared or exclusive to specific agents. It's an attribute that can be set during the initialization of an agent, with a default value of an empty list. Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, this agent will use this LLM to execute function calling for tools instead of relying on the main LLM output. Max Iter (optional) The maximum number of iterations the agent can perform before being forced to give its best answer. Default is 15. Max RPM (optional) The maximum number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits. It's optional and can be left unspecified, with a default value of None. Verbose (optional) Enables detailed logging of the agent's execution for debugging or monitoring purposes when set to True. Default is False. Allow Delegation (optional) Agents can delegate tasks or questions to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent. Default is True. Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of the agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations. It will overwrite the crew step_callback. Memory (optional) Indicates whether the agent should have memory or not, with a default value of False. This impacts the agent's ability to remember past interactions. Default is False. Creating an Agent¶ Agent Interaction Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew. To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the Agent class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes: # Example: Creating an agent with all attributes from crewai import Agent agent = Agent( role='Data Analyst', goal='Extract actionable insights', backstory=\\"\\"\\"You're a data analyst at a large company. You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights to the business. You're currently working on a project to analyze the performance of our marketing campaigns.\\"\\"\\", tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2], # Optional, defaults to an empty list llm=my_llm, # Optional function_calling_llm=my_llm, # Optional max_iter=15, # Optional max_rpm=None, # Optional verbose=True, # Optional allow_delegation=True, # Optional step_callback=my_intermediate_step_callback, # Optional memory=True # Optional ) Conclusion¶ Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence. Tasks Overview of a Task¶ What is a Task? In the CrewAI framework, tasks are individual assignments that agents complete. They encapsulate necessary information for execution, including a description, assigned agent, required tools, offering flexibility for various action complexities. Tasks in CrewAI can be designed to require collaboration between agents. For example, one agent might gather data while another analyzes it. This collaborative approach can be defined within the task properties and managed by the Crew's process. Task Attributes¶ Attribute Description Description A clear, concise statement of what the task entails. Agent Optionally, you can specify which agent is responsible for the task. If not, the crew's process will determine who takes it on. Expected Output Clear and detailed definition of expected output for the task. Tools (optional) These are the functions or capabilities the agent can utilize to perform the task. They can be anything from simple actions like 'search' to more complex interactions with other agents or APIs. Async Execution (optional) Indicates whether the task should be executed asynchronously, allowing the crew to continue with the next task without waiting for completion. Context (optional) Other tasks that will have their output used as context for this task. If a task is asynchronous, the system will wait for that to finish before using its output as context. Output JSON (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a JSON object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper Output Pydantic (optional) Takes a pydantic model and returns the output as a pydantic object. Agent LLM needs to be using an OpenAI client, could be Ollama for example but using the OpenAI wrapper Output File (optional) Takes a file path and saves the output of the task on it. Callback (optional) A function to be executed after the task is completed. Creating a Task¶ This is the simplest example for creating a task, it involves defining its scope and agent, but there are optional attributes that can provide a lot of flexibility: from crewai import Task task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI', agent=sales_agent ) Task Assignment Tasks can be assigned directly by specifying an agent to them, or they can be assigned in run time if you are using the hierarchical through CrewAI's process, considering roles, availability, or other criteria. Integrating Tools with Tasks¶ Tools from the crewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools enhance task performance, allowing agents to interact more effectively with their environment. Assigning specific tools to tasks can tailor agent capabilities to particular needs. Creating a Task with Tools¶ import os os.environ[\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\"] = \\"Your Key\\" os.environ[\\"SERPER_API_KEY\\"] = \\"Your Key\\" # serper.dev API key from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool research_agent = Agent( role='Researcher', goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news', backstory=\\"\\"\\"You're a researcher at a large company. You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights to the business.\\"\\"\\" verbose=True ) search_tool = SerperDevTool() task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) crew = Crew( agents=[research_agent], tasks=[task], verbose=2 ) result = crew.kickoff() print(result) This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution. Referring to Other Tasks¶ In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple should be used as context for another task. This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the context attribute of the task: # ... research_ai_task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', async_execution=True, agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) research_ops_task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news', async_execution=True, agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) write_blog_task = Task( description=\\"Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news\\", expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long', agent=writer_agent, context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task] ) #... Asynchronous Execution¶ You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed. You can then use the context attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed. #... list_ideas = Task( description=\\"List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.\\", expected_output=\\"Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.\\", agent=researcher, async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously ) list_important_history = Task( description=\\"Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.\\", expected_output=\\"Bullet point list of 5 important events.\\", agent=researcher, async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously ) write_article = Task( description=\\"Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.\\", expected_output=\\"A 4 paragraph article about AI.\\", agent=writer, context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed ) #... Callback Mechanism¶ The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome. # ... def callback_function(output: TaskOutput): # Do something after the task is completed # Example: Send an email to the manager print(f\\"\\"\\" Task completed! Task: {output.description} Output: {output.raw_output} \\"\\"\\") research_task = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool], callback=callback_function ) #... Accessing a Specific Task Output¶ Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the output attribute of the task object: # ... task1 = Task( description='Find and summarize the latest AI news', expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news', agent=research_agent, tools=[search_tool] ) #... crew = Crew( agents=[research_agent], tasks=[task1, task2, task3], verbose=2 ) result = crew.kickoff() # Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task print(f\\"\\"\\" Task completed! Task: {task1.output.description} Output: {task1.output.raw_output} \\"\\"\\") Tool Override Mechanism¶ Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility. Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms¶ While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to: Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations. Preventing the manual assignment of the id attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system. These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework. Conclusion¶ Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended. Crews What is a Crew?¶ Definition of a Crew A crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow. Crew Attributes¶ Attribute Description Tasks A list of tasks assigned to the crew. Agents A list of agents that are part of the crew. Process (optional) The process flow (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) the crew follows. Verbose (optional) The verbosity level for logging during execution. Manager LLM (optional) The language model used by the manager agent in a hierarchical process. Required when using a hierarchical process. Function Calling LLM (optional) If passed, the crew will use this LLM to do function calling for tools for all agents in the crew. Each agent can have its own LLM, which overrides the crew's LLM for function calling. Config (optional) Optional configuration settings for the crew, in Json or Dict[str, Any] format. Max RPM (optional) Maximum requests per minute the crew adheres to during execution. Language (optional) Language used for the crew, defaults to English. Full Output (optional) Whether the crew should return the full output with all tasks outputs or just the final output. Step Callback (optional) A function that is called after each step of every agent. This can be used to log the agent's actions or to perform other operations; it won't override the agent-specific step_callback. Share Crew (optional) Whether you want to share the complete crew information and execution with the crewAI team to make the library better, and allow us to train models. Crew Max RPM The \`max_rpm\` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' \`max_rpm\` settings if you set it. Creating a Crew¶ Crew Composition When assembling a crew, you combine agents with complementary roles and tools, assign tasks, and select a process that dictates their execution order and interaction. Example: Assembling a Crew¶ from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun # Define agents with specific roles and tools researcher = Agent( role='Senior Research Analyst', goal='Discover innovative AI technologies', tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchRun()] ) writer = Agent( role='Content Writer', goal='Write engaging articles on AI discoveries', verbose=True ) # Create tasks for the agents research_task = Task( description='Identify breakthrough AI technologies', agent=researcher ) write_article_task = Task( description='Draft an article on the latest AI technologies', agent=writer ) # Assemble the crew with a sequential process my_crew = Crew( agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[research_task, write_article_task], process=Process.sequential, full_output=True, verbose=True, ) Crew Usage Metrics¶ After the crew execution, you can access the usage_metrics attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement. # Access the crew's usage metrics crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2]) crew.kickoff() print(crew.usage_metrics) Crew Execution Process¶ Sequential Process: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work. Hierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. Note: A manager_llm is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow. Kicking Off a Crew¶ Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the kickoff() method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow. # Start the crew's task execution result = my_crew.kickoff() print(result) Processes Understanding Processes¶ Core Concept In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy. Process Implementations¶ Sequential: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression. Hierarchical: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. Note: A manager language model (manager_llm) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, allowing for the creation and management of tasks by the manager. Consensual Process (Planned): Currently under consideration for future development, this process type aims for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, introducing a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. As of now, it is not implemented in the codebase. The Role of Processes in Teamwork¶ Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence. Assigning Processes to a Crew¶ To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. Note: For a hierarchical process, ensure to define manager_llm for the manager agent. from crewai import Crew from crewai.process import Process from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process crew = Crew( agents=my_agents, tasks=my_tasks, process=Process.sequential ) # Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process # Ensure to provide a manager_llm crew = Crew( agents=my_agents, tasks=my_tasks, process=Process.hierarchical, manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model=\\"gpt-4\\") ) Note: Ensure my_agents and my_tasks are defined prior to creating a Crew object, and for the hierarchical process, manager_llm is also required. Sequential Process¶ This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next. To customize task context, utilize the context parameter in the Task class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks. Hierarchical Process¶ Emulates a corporate hierarchy, crewAI creates a manager automatically for you, requiring the specification of a manager language model (manager_llm) for the manager agent. This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion. Process Class: Detailed Overview¶ The Process class is implemented as an enumeration (Enum), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (sequential, hierarchical, and future consensual). This design choice guarantees that only valid processes are utilized within the CrewAI framework. Planned Future Processes¶ Consensual Process: This collaborative decision-making process among agents on task execution is under consideration but not currently implemented. This future enhancement aims to introduce a more democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. Conclusion¶ The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. Documentation will be regularly updated to reflect new processes and enhancements, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information. Collaboration Collaboration Fundamentals¶ Core of Agent Interaction Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem. Information Sharing: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings. Task Assistance: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks. Resource Allocation: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents. Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration¶ The Crew class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities: Language Model Management (manager_llm, function_calling_llm): Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. It's important to note that manager_llm is mandatory when using a hierarchical process for ensuring proper execution flow. Process Flow (process): Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution. Verbose Logging (verbose): Offers detailed logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging purposes. It supports both integer and boolean types to indicate the verbosity level. Configuration (config): Allows extensive customization to tailor the crew's behavior according to specific requirements. Rate Limiting (max_rpm): Ensures efficient utilization of resources by limiting requests per minute. Internationalization Support (language): Facilitates operation in multiple languages, enhancing global usability. Execution and Output Handling (full_output): Distinguishes between full and final outputs for nuanced control over task results. Callback and Telemetry (step_callback): Integrates callbacks for step-wise execution monitoring and telemetry for performance analytics. Crew Sharing (share_crew): Enables sharing of crew information with CrewAI for continuous improvement and training models. Usage Metrics (usage_metrics): Store all metrics for the language model (LLM) usage during all tasks' execution, providing insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement, you can check it after the crew execution. Delegation: Dividing to Conquer¶ Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability. Implementing Collaboration and Delegation¶ Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs. Example Scenario¶ Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow. Conclusion¶ The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation. Tools Introduction¶ CrewAI tools empower agents with capabilities ranging from web searching and data analysis to collaboration and delegating tasks among coworkers. This documentation outlines how to create, integrate, and leverage these tools within the CrewAI framework, including a new focus on collaboration tools.

This will involve setting up agents, defining their roles and tasks, and orchestrating their interaction within a Crew to accomplish the specific objective of enhancing and refining prompts based on user input. # Setting Up the Environment: First, ensure you have installed CrewAI and its tools package as indicated: \`\`\`bash pip install crewai pip install 'crewai[tools]' \`\`\` # Step 1: Define the Agents Following the documentation, we define two specific agents - \\"Prompt Enhancer Agent\\" and \\"Prompt Searcher Agent\\" - with their respective roles, goals, backstories, and tools. \`\`\`python from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool # Setting up environment variables for tool access import os os.environ[\\"OPENAI_API_KEY\\"] = \\"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\\" os.environ[\\"SERPER_API_KEY\\"] = \\"YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY\\" # Define the Prompt Enhancer Agent prompt_enhancer = Agent( role='Prompt Enhancer', goal='To refine and enhance prompts for better clarity and effectiveness.', backstory='A master of language and semantics with a keen eye for detail.', llm='gpt-4', # Assuming access to GPT-4 tools=[], # Tools can be specified if needed verbose=True, allow_delegation=True ) # Define the Prompt Searcher Agent prompt_searcher = Agent( role='Prompt Searcher', goal='To find initial prompts in need of enhancement.', backstory='An adept explorer of content, always on the lookout for improvement opportunities.', tools=[SerperDevTool()], # Assuming using serper.dev for searching capabilities verbose=True, allow_delegation=True ) \`\`\` # Step 2: Define Tasks for Each Agent We then create specific tasks for each agent, utilizing the task attributes to detail the exact requirements. \`\`\`python # Task for the Prompt Enhancer Agent: Enhance a given prompt enhance_prompt_task = Task( description='Enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the provided prompt.', agent=prompt_enhancer, tools=[], # Assuming specific enhancement tools or APIs could be listed here async_execution=False, # This task is performed synchronously ) # Task for the Prompt Searcher Agent: Locate a prompt to be enhanced search_prompt_task = Task( description='Find a prompt that needs enhancement.', agent=prompt_searcher, tools=[SerperDevTool()], async_execution=True, # This task could be performed asynchronously ) \`\`\` # Step 3: Assemble and Kickoff the Crew With the agents and tasks defined, we assemble the crew and initiate the workflow. Given the objectives, we might have an interactive loop where prompts are searched, enhanced, and then reviewed iteratively. \`\`\`python # Assembling the crew with both agents and their respective tasks my_crew = Crew( agents=[prompt_enhancer, prompt_searcher], tasks=[enhance_prompt_task, search_prompt_task], process=Process.sequential, # Sequential process is used for simplicity verbose=True, ) # Execute the crew's task workflow result = my_crew.kickoff() print(\\"Workflow execution result:\\", result) \`\`\` # Additional Considerations: - **Iterative Enhancement**: The iterative process of prompt enhancement based on user feedback would require an interactive loop, possibly with user inputs directing the flow. This might involve a more complex setup with callbacks or event listeners to accommodate user responses in real-time. - **Agent Interaction**: Delegation between agents could be handled through the CrewAI's built-in mechanisms, allowing the Prompt Searcher Agent to delegate tasks to the Prompt Enhancer Agent based on specific criteria or triggers. - **Output and Evaluation**: After each iteration, the output can be evaluated, and decisions can be made whether to continue the enhancement process or finalize the prompt based on set criteria or user input. The pseudo-code provided above follows the CrewAI framework's hypothetical capabilities as outlined in the documentation snippet. Implementing this in a real-world application might require adapting the logic to fit the actual API responses, user interaction capabilities, and the specific tools or APIs used for prompt searching and enhancement."},{"instruction":"the right sequence of prompts combined with your unique domain knowledge is an entire five six or seven figure product in itself in this video I want to dig into seven prompt chains with real examples you can use to level up your prompt engineering ability to build better products tools and applications the name of the game in software now is how can you build a gentic software that creates value on your behalf for you and your users I've got seven prompt chains I want to show you that can help you achieve that goal let's start with the snowball prompt chain we're using CLA 3 Haiku Sonet and Opus models and we're passing one or more of our models into our prompt chain examples the snowball is a really interesting prompt that allows you to start with a little information that is slowly developed over each prompt let's look at the mermaid chart to see exactly how this works so you start with Base information then you run one to n prompts that gather and create information based on your original information with each prompt the context improves and then finally you run a summary or format prompt that finalizes this AI agent's run so let's look at a real example here right I have this Base information three unusual use cases for llms I'm passing it into this prompt where I want to generate click worthy titles about this topic and that's our Base information so from this single prompt we're having our model respond in Json format where it's going to return a click-worthy title and our topic and that's going to create our first snowball after we have that we ask you to generate a compelling three section outline given the information and you can see here we then repeat the pattern right now we have the title the topic and the sections that creates our second snowball of information you can see where this is going right you can basically just continue to do this and add arbitrary information over time while keeping each prompt specialized to generate one thing it's really important that you treat all of your llms like individual functions with concrete inputs and outputs that allows you to fine-tune and tailor each prompt to solve its problem the best it possibly can so let's run our snowball prompt and let's see what we get so you can see we have our first snowball second snowball and then finally we're getting content and then lastly we put it all together in a combined markdown blog as you can see at each step the llm is adding information it's literally enlarging the context of the problem that we're trying to solve at first we only have a topic we pass that in and the first no ball is created giving us a topic and a title then it creates sections then it creates content and then finally we put it all together into a final cohesive markdown blog and you can see here we're writing that all to a file we can go ahead and take a look at this file here and the best part is of course it's completely reusable this is a really powerful interesting chain that's really great for writing blogs building newsletters doing some research writing summaries and just a note on the terminology here prompt chaining prompt orchestration prompt graphs they're all referring to the same idea of generating concrete outputs by combining llms models and code together to drive outcomes so this is one way you can drive a specific set of outcomes let's move on to our next prompt chain this is the worker pattern so you've definitely seen this before it's a really popular pattern in research tools so it's likely you've heard of GPT researcher or something similar the worker pattern is one that is really popular when it comes to doing research putting together ideas making web requests and then doing research based on the response of the request you can see here GPT researcher is doing something completely similar they have a task they generate questions and then they fan out into individual prompts that then get combined into a final report this is the most popular pattern for research type tasks so let's go ahead and dive into this I like to call this the worker pattern where you basically delegate parts of your workload to individual prompts all this code by the way is going to be in a really simplified Guist there are a couple requirements I'll put it all in the Guist you'll be able to fire this up in no time link for that is going to be in the description here is what the worker pattern looks like so have your initial planning prompt then it creates end steps to be processed or nend items to be processed for each one of your workers your workers then individually and ideally in parallel run their prompts and then they all funnel their results into a final summary or format prompt this creates really really powerful agents that are able to gather information on the Fly based on your initial planning prompt do research generate content generate code generate whatever you're looking for and then pull it all together into a fin finalized output this is one of the most popular prompt chaining patterns prompt orchestration patterns that's getting used right now as the use cases are very obvious let's go ahead and take a look at an interesting example so first off we'll just go ahead and run this so while this is running let's go ahead and walk through the code just like you saw we have this code planner prompt all we're asking here is generate function stubs with detailed comments on how to write the code to build a couple of functions here we're then giving an example of what exactly we want and then we're saying respond in this Json format where we have a list of function definitions but not the full function right this is our planning step after we have that we then load out our function stubs from our Json response I highly recommend that you just default to using Json responses it creates a more simplified consistent structure for all of your prompt chains we then Loop through each one of the function stubs and as you can guess we're then running prompts for each one of those function stubs and then combining it into a single large string after we have that large string with all of the results just like as you saw in our diagram here all of these results from each worker prompt get funneled in to our last summary SL format prompt where we then clean up the code and combine it into a single final python file that can be executed we'll specify one more Json format and then we just dump all that to files. py so you can see here we're actually using this pattern to build out entire file modules so we're essentially using the worker pattern as a kind of micro AI coding assistant that can build out entire files for us with related functionality right in this example we're building out a file writing module that allows us to you know write Json files write yamal files and write Tomo files all right so let's see how our prompt has done all right awesome so it's finished here let's go ahead and take a look at that file that's generated so we now should have a files. py let's go ahead and look at that and okay so we have a little bit of extra here that's fine let's go ahead and just remove these lines and Bam so you can see here we have let's go ahead and collapse everything here here so you can see here we have three really clean functions written out with comments and examples of exactly how to use it this looks really good and I hope this shows off the power of using your prompts to do one thing and do one thing well right we had our planner just plan the function sub and then each worker actually wrote out each individual function right so you can be as detailed about how you want to write a function as possible and then you just Loop that over however many of those functions you actually want to write based on your plan prompt so really allows you to divide and conquer in the truest sense and really keep all of your prompts isolated and then of course the summary format we can clean that up a little bit if we contrl Z we had a little bit of extra here this can all be cleaned up as you know with proper management of the prompt and the llm let's look at a more unique prompt this is one that I built into a product that I am actively building right now let me show off the fallback prompt chain if you're enjoying learning about these prompt chains or refreshing your memory on these prompt chains CH definitely hit the sub hit the like helps out the channel I think we're hitting 10K Subs literally as we're filming this video huge thanks for everyone watching let's keep moving the fallback prompt chain is really interesting it allows you to run a prompt an llm an entire model and if something goes wrong with the process that runs after the prompt it then falls back onto another prompt or model let me show you exactly what this looks like so you can see here we start out with our initial top priority prompt or model this pattern allows you to do something like this you can run your fastest cheapest model first you take the response of the prompt and you run whatever code or whatever process you have that you wanted your prompt to generate for you if your process fails you then run your secondary or your fallback model you then run your process again if it fails again then you use your Last Resort final big chunky expensive model but if at any point before that your cheaper faster model runs and succeeds this AI agent this prompt flow is just complete that's the big Advantage here it allows you to run your cheapest fastest prompt and model first let me show you a concrete example so I buildt up this little function fallback flow functionality I'm not going to dig into the code too much but I just want to focus on the highle flow here for you here we're generating code we're saying generate the solution in Python given this function definition so we're just giving it a function definition so we're saying text to speech passing in text and then we want to get bytes back we're asking for the response in Json format and then look at what we're doing here we have a list of functions where the first parameter of the Tuple is going to be a function call to each Cloud 3 Model so you can see here we're starting with our ha coup cheap fast top priority model we then use our cheap moderate secondary fallback model and then at the very end if all fails then we use the Opus model though key with the fallback flow prompt chain prompt graph prompt orchestration flow is that you need an evaluator function right and your evaluator is basically what are you trying to run given the output of your llm right given the output of each one of your fallback functions and in this case to validate our output we can just run the code right and in the actuality this doesn't actually do anything I'm just running this coin flip function here that's going to 50/50% chance return true or false but you can imagine that you're actually running the code and then if it's correct you then proceed with your application but if it's wrong that's when the fallback function kicks in so let me go ahead and just run this and show you a couple examples of what this looks like so here's a fallback flow so we've Fallen back to Sonet we' Fallen back again and now Opus is running there we go so our Opus model was the final winner here it looks like the code that generated is using some okay it's using Google's text to speech module that's cool we don't really care about that it's all about the prompt chain so let's go ahead and run that again right since this is a 50/50 random coin flip we're going to be successful some of the times with our earlier prompt and fail in other cases so let's go ahead and run that again bam okay so you can see here in this example you know if your first top prior fast cheap model worked your flow is finished right there's no reason to fall back so this is a prompt chaining framework that I built into an application called talk to your database this is a text to SQL to results application buil to help you retrieve information from your SQL databases faster than ever but you can see that pattern concretely used in the agent customization if our caches Miss we'll then fall back on these customizable agents that generate your SQL for you based on your natural language query and you can see here we first run grock mixt because it's hyper hyper hyper fast but if this fails what we're going to do here is actually fall back to gpg 3.5 right so little higher accuracy still got a lot of great speed still really cheap but if that still fails say you're running a really complex query it just gets the SQL statement wrong it'll then just fall back to a big beefy gbg4 SQL agent I've got it on the road map to add the CLA Opus model that's probably going to be an even bigger fallback than gp4 given its benchmarks I just wanted to show this off because this is a productionize example of how you can utilize the fallback flow inside the application you can see this working in practice so if I just run a random natural language query here we'll say let we open up the tables we'll say products price less than 50 you can see this is going to return basically right away based on the Simplicity of it and based on all the benchmarks I've run I can almost guarantee you that this was the result of the grock mixt dral model right so I just wanted to show that off in a real productionize concrete example feel free to check out talk to your database I'll leave the link to the app in the description the app really only has one purpose and it's to help you retrieve information faster than ever from your database so that's a concrete example of how you can use fallback flow the big win here is that it allows you to save money and save time but you also increase the reliability and the accuracy of your AI agent as a whole because if something doesn't work it'll just fall back to the next available model and the next available prompt and the prompt is also another dimension of this prompt chain that you can tweet maybe you'll have a longer more detailed prompt and a more powerful model in your second or third execution of your fallback function so this is another really powerful pattern that you can add to your agentic systems let's go ahead and keep moving let's talk about the decision maker prompt chain this is a fairly simple one we've done videos on a couple of these prompt chains in the past we'll go ahead and kick this one off so the decision prompt chain works like this it's really simple you ask your llm to decide something for you and based on those results you run different prompt chains you run different code flows let's look at a really simple example of how you can use the decision prompt chain so it's really great for Creative Direction dictating flow control making decisions you can see here we have a list of statements that you might find in a quarterly report from a company things like our new product launch has been well received by customers and is contributing significantly to our growth and then other negative type things like the competitive landscape remains challenging with some competitors engaging in aggressive pressing strategies right so imagine you have a live feed of these statements coming in and you're analyzing it and and what you want your decision-making agent to do that's listening to this live feed you wanted to analyze positive versus negative sentiment this is a really popular use case of making decisions on the Fly analyzing sentiment to make decisions on your behalf this is a really powerful way a powerful technique a powerful prompt chain to utilize in your products the sentiment analysis then responds either positive or negative and then what you can do essentially is map the result to an action right so you can see here in this simple map we have positive mapped to a function and negative mapped to a function and then we have an unknown fallback method right and then you just call whatever your next step is right so This Is Us running you know the prompt chain one prompt chain two prompt chain 3 whatever the next step is here that's what this function map represents and in this case we're just saying you know the following text has a positive sentiment generate a short thesis about why this is true really you could do anything inside your next step your next action that's really up to you and whatever domain or feature that you're working through the power in this lies in being able to offload decision-making into your AI agents so you can see here we analyze the sentiment here we incurred higher than expected costs this is of course is going to come through as negative negative sentiment thesis and then it's just giving a brief explanation the core value proposition here is to remember that based on the decision that your llm has made you can now run arbitrary code arbitrary additional prompts and this is where a lot of latent value of llms really exists so let's move on let's talk about plan and execute so this is one that you're likely to be familiar with we don't have to go into this in too much detail but this is your typical Chain of Thought tree of thought any type of planning first then execute sequence of prompts will essentially get you to this result let's look at the diagram for this in its Essence it's really simple you start you plan then you execute based on your plan and then you end we saw a more concrete example of this in the worker prompt chain but in its simplified form it really only needs two prompts to run first you do your planning then you do your execution and just as a simple example here we have a simple task we're going to be designing software architecture for an AI assistant that uses text of speech llms and a local sqi database we then prompt our agent to you know make a plan we have this classic activation phrase let's think step by step there are several variants of this you can find all over online but they all boil down to the same thing let your llm think first give it time to think and in that thinking it acts as a context Builder context formatter kind of a memory arranger for your next prompt where you actually do the thing that you would have prompted originally in one shot so let's go ahead and run this excellent so you can see we have use cases we have diagrams we have components we have an overview that's all running nice and clean and then we have our output at the end so the idea here of course is without the plan the final output would not be as good so I'll let you play with that we don't need to dig into that one too much that's a really popular prompt chain just as this next one is so let's talk about human in the loop this is a simple one basically it's any UI ux combination where you're running a prompt and then on some Loop or via some UI you are asking for user input right that's essentially what this pattern is and we can visualize this with this mermaid chart where we have our initial prompt we then ask explicitly for feedback we run our iterative prompt and then give our llm more feedback and this runs in a loop until we get the result we're looking for and then things finally end so I'm not going to run this it's pretty straightforward you run your initial prompt so here we're saying generate five ideas surrounding this topic and then while true iterate on this idea unless we type done and this just lets you build up context build up a conversation build up concrete results over over it allows you to go back and forth this brings us to a really really important point about prompt chaining and Building Products if you think about it this single flow prompt feedback iterative feedback that flow is exactly what the chat GPT application is right you're typing a message this is your base prompt it responds to you and then you're saying something else right you're giving it some feedback you're having a conversation you're going back and forth so it seems obvious to say it out loud but I just want to highlight that this single PR flow is an entire product and it's like yeah of course it is but but I think it really highlights an interesting idea that we haven't really seen or have have truly explored the full capabilities of llms by any stretch of the imagination right there have been so many products coming out that is just this it's just the chat interface this is something I mentioned in the 2024 predictions video um we are going to get so sick and tired of the chat interface and at some point someone's going to innovate on it and create something more interesting there are definitely variants of this for instance in talk to your database there is a prompt results type of format right so we're not having an ongoing conversation here in talk to database you're just writing a natural language query right you're saying you know jobs id5 and you have a bunch of Agents writing in the background that just give you the result you're looking for right so this is more like a call response type of prompt framework and as I mentioned behind the scenes we're using the fallback prompt chain but I just want to highlight that idea that there are so many applications being built with the chat interface and under the hood that's just one prompt chain so there's so much Innovation there's so much to build there's so much to create I hope that this makes sense and I hope that you can see you know all the potential value that every one of these prompt chains has for us right the human in the loop is such a popular prompt chaining framework and frankly it's beyond overused right there are so many more creative ways to build out user experiences using different UI different uxs but also any one of these other different prompt chains or any combination of them that's the human in the loop you've seen that one you use it every single day when you interact with any one of these chat interfaces let's look at the self-correction agent real quick I'm just going to talk about the code I'll run it quickly so the self-correction prompt chain looks like this this is an idea we've explored on the channel before but essentially you have your prompt you execute based on the prompt if it's correct you're done your agent has completed its job if it's not correct you run an additional self-correction prompt and then you end and of course your self-correction can take many forms it can run in a loop it can run over and over but the idea is as simple as this execute if not successful self-correct right and this is really good for coding for executing for reviewing it's really great for improving on what's already been done okay great so this finished running in this simple example here we're looking for the right bash command that lets me list all files in the current directory super simple don't focus on that focus on the Chain the initial response is LS they we saer running the command I have this execution code in this case we're just doing another coin flip and then we're saying you know mock error so we're just kind of pretending like there's an error the core idea here is if your execution on your original prompt causes an error you then run a different code flow that self-corrects the previous run right so you can imagine if you're doing something like generating SQL or you're generating code or you're generating you know something that is executed against a functioning system AKA any function you can use this pattern to sell self-correct mistakes we did an entire video on this I'm going to link all the videos where we've covered some of these topics in more depth in the description as well as all this code I'm going to throw this in a gist so it's really simple to look at really simple to consume but that concludes seven prompt chains prompt workflows prompt flows prompt graphs prompt orchestrations whatever you want to call it that concludes seven prompt chains that you can use to build great AI agents powerful htic systems and you know new and interesting ideas we're really really beating this chat interface over the head it's definitely going to be here for a long time it's going to be here to stay but I think that there are more interesting innovative ways that we can you know build up products and also just build out really really great powerful agents underneath the hood right we said it a long time ago one prompt is not enough I think the llm industry and the software industry is really getting into that place where we're finally starting to dig into you know prompt orchestration and unlocking the power of different combinations of llms with our code with our data right we've talked about a lot of these topics before in the past I felt it was really important to bring these prompt chains back up and really highlight their capabilities to help you build great agentic software as I've been digging back into working on probably one of the most important agentic applications I'm going to build and that is my personal assistant let me know if you want me to share videos on how I'm thinking about designing and building my personal AI assistant there's a lot of really interesting ideas there and a lot of really interesting Concepts that we've built on the channel and some brand new Concepts that I'm still working through myself many of these ideas include you know building great prompt workflows using several of these prompt chains throughout filming this video we just finally hit the 10K Mark that's it guys we got 10K Subs I just want to shout out again everyone that's been following everyone that's been getting value out of the channel thank you so much for watching I really appreciate you being here let's continue to transform let's continue to evolve let's continue to use the best tools for the job using great engineering p patterns let's keep thinking Planning and Building together let's become a gench Engineers thanks so much for watching I'll see you in the next one","output":"The transcript you've shared outlines a comprehensive look into utilizing prompt chains—a powerful method for interfacing with language models (LMs) like GPT-3 or others. This approach opens up numerous possibilities for building sophisticated applications that leverage the generative and analytical capabilities of LMs. Below, I summarize key takeaway points and provide insights into how these concepts can drive innovation and efficiency in developing AI-driven solutions. # Key Points from the Transcript: 1. **Snowball Prompt Chain**: Involves starting with basic information and incrementally adding details through a series of prompts, creating a richer context at each step. This approach is exemplary for tasks that benefit from gradually accumulating details, such as content creation and research. 2. **Worker Pattern**: This pattern is akin to the map-reduce paradigm, where you divide a task into smaller chunks (map), process each chunk separately, and then combine the results (reduce). It's particularly effective for parallelizable tasks and complex problem-solving that require aggregating insights from multiple sources or models. 3. **Fallback Prompt Chain**: Offers a strategy for maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness by starting with faster, cheaper LMs and falling back to more powerful and presumably more expensive models only as needed. This ensures that you're using resources judiciously, escalating to heavyweight models only for tasks that truly require it. 4. **Decision Maker**: Employs LMs to make decisions based on the data, influencing the flow of operations or the choice between different pathways. This pattern can drive dynamic systems that adjust their behavior based on evolving contexts or new information. 5. **Plan and Execute**: Involves using LMs to plan out a task and then execute based on that plan. This is great for scenarios that benefit from a preliminary analysis or strategy formation, such as software development or project planning. 6. **Human in the Loop**: Incorporates user feedback directly into the workflow, allowing for iterative refinement and ensuring outputs align closely with user expectations. This pattern is central to interactive applications and improves over time through user interaction. 7. **Self-Correction**: Utilizes error detection and correction mechanisms to iteratively improve the output. This is crucial for tasks where accuracy is paramount and enables systems to learn from mistakes in real time. # Insights: - **Combinatorial Potential**: Each of these patterns represents a building block for sophisticated AI systems. Combining them creatively can yield highly adaptive and intelligent applications that push the boundaries of what automated systems can achieve. - **User-Centric Design**: Many of these patterns emphasize the importance of aligning outputs with user needs, whether through iterative feedback, adaptability, or personalized planning. This reinforces the notion that the most successful AI applications will be those that place user experience and satisfaction at their core. - **Future of Software Development**: The transcript suggests an evolving landscape where software development increasingly relies on leveraging AI agents for both generating and refining code, content, and ideas. This underscores the transformative potential of AI in not just automating tasks but also in enhancing creativity and productivity. - **Economic and Scalable AI Use**: The fallback and worker patterns, in particular, highlight strategies for making AI usage more economical and scalable, addressing common concerns around cost and computational resource requirements. - **Agency and Autonomy**: The introduction of 'agentic' systems, which act on behalf of users, suggests a future where AI plays a more proactive role, managing tasks, making decisions, and even correcting its errors autonomously. Each of these areas presents exciting opportunities for development and exploration, suggesting a rich field of possibilities for engineers, developers, and innovators.

Anticipate needs by having AI gauge and adjust schedules based on past patterns, like an increase in certain types of visits. # Research Adjusting for Bias, etc. **Example: Historical Research on City Development** A researcher could use a Lang-like model to analyze vast amounts of data or content on the development of specific regions, with the AI dynamically adjusting parameters like \\"context\\" to return meaningful results. This could lead to a more nuanced understanding of the developments' impact on communities, economies, or cultural aspects. # More sophisticated Anticipatory Adjustments, etc. **Example:** **Smart Home Adjustments** A smart home system could utilize more sophisticated and nuanced anticipatory adjustments in scheduling and controlling based on both the home and perhaps the personalized preferences of the inhabitant. Many real-world examples of using advanced language processing systems like GPT can be imagined.

Mystery, thriller excerpt of a fanfic of the Black Panther comic book and movie series, in which the poor and impoverished hermit kingdom in the eyes of the world but in fact a hyperadvanced, technological and military superpower located in Central Africa of the unitary parliamentary absolute royal monarchy of the Kingdom of Wakanda [Black Panther], [Wakanda] is [Black Panther] in fact [Wakanda's true status within this story][ a nativized government in exile for the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-Lorraine-ruled constitutional parliamentary democratic feudal Imperial Royal monarchy of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, which [Austria-Hungary] escaped [Austria-Hungary] to the then-dwindling remains of a remnant of pre-Dark ages Pharonic Egypt with strong Roman and Greek influences along with advanced clockpunk and steampunk civilian and military technology within the Congo, which [the Egyptian remnant within the Congo] Austrian, Hungarian and Croatian scientists had converted into a sprawling city via Germanic ingenuity and cunning before WW1. In the final days and immediately after WW1, many members of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire's combined armed forces, the Austria-Hungarian Army, the the Austrian-Hungarian Army's military intelligence division, the Evidence Bureau and many monarchists and imperialists within the former Austria Hungary escaped to the hidden city within Central Africa, increasing what would become Wakanda's strength and power along with the discovery of the super metal Vibranium [Black Panther] around the hidden city. Despite the flight of Austrian-Hungarian Empjre to Central Africa being covert, rumors persisted in Europe about the survival of Austria-Hungary in the Congo. Hence in the closing days of World War 2, remnants of the German nationalist, German imperialist, anti Russian, anti Pan Slavist, anti communist, guild Socialist, anti Zionist National Socialist German Worker's Party/NSADP-ruled de facto constitutional parliamentary democratic populist Republic of the Greater Germanic Reich/Greater Germany/Greater Germanic Realm/\\"Nazi Germany\\", its [Greater Germany's] combined armed forces, the Wehrmacht, its [Greater Germany's] combined foreign intelligence and domestic secret police agency, the NSDAP's elite paramilitary bodyguard division turned Greater Germany's elite special forces unit and later a Europe-wide anti-communist, more specifically anti-Soviet legionary force, the infamous Waffen-Schutzstaffel/Waffen-SS [Armed Protection Squadron] , the Reich Main Security Office along with its [Greater Germany's] government department under the German Ministry of Education responsible for centralized planning of all basic and applied research, with the exception of aeronautical research, the Reichsforschungsrat [Imperial Research Council] along with their wives and families, [elements of Greater Germany's military, R&D, political and government] manage to escape Europe and make their way to the mysterious outpost of the remnant of the Holy Roman Empire [Austrian-Hungarian Empire] inside the heart of the so-called Dark Continent, being unnoticed by the Allied airforces and navies due to the advanced wunderwaffen [wonder weapon] radar cloaking, jet fighter, optical camouflage, digital and analogue computer, orbital satellite and orbital deployment weaponry, plasma and laser weaponry and spiral energy powered man made flying saucer military technology developed by both the Reichsforschungsrat and the Waffen-SS during the war along with similar civilian advances in nuclear and renewable energy research, allowing them [the Greater German remnants] to [the Greater German remnants] make their [the Greater Germanic Reich's remnants] way to what will later become Wakanda undetected, bringing with them their advanced scientific knowledge, development and technology both military and scientific along with news of the outside world. The Greater German remnants are welcomed by the Austrian-Hungarian remnants within Cental Africa and [the Greater German renmants] subsequently integrated into the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold hidden within Central Africa by the dense jungles, savage tribes surrounding it, its own indigenous optical camouflage cloaking technology and WMD ICBM technology as well as the immense links its political and governmental hierarchy maintains with the outside world. The integration of the Greater German remnants with the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold further boosts its [the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold's] immense technological, industrial, economic and agricultural strength and power, making it [the Austrian-Hungarian stronghold] one of the strongest countries in the world despite it not being known by the world. Parallel to the integration of the Greater Germanic Reich's renmants into the hidden Austrian-Hungarian stronghold is the seizure of key Greater Germanic Reich safe houses, strongholds and scientific research stations hidden all through South America and Antarctica as well as the absorption of the Reich Main Security Office's immense world wide network of spies, double agents and informants into that of the Evidenzbureau. This allows what will become Wakanda to further evade detection and discovery from the rest of the world, [Wakanda] only emerging from its [Wakanda's] shell to [Wakanda] conquer the rest of the Congo using local, Wakandan armed militants after the Belgian Congo gains independence in 1960, [Wakanda] subsequently presenting an image to the world as an stereotypical impoverished, on the verge of collapse backward post-colonial African country [Wakanda's public image] while [Wakanda] using the opportunity to eliminate any intruders into its [Wakanda's] realm, [Wakanda] covertly influencing the Crown Prince of Botswana turned its [Botswana's] dictator after independence, Kahane, [Wakanda covertly] manipulating Kahane into [Kahane] maintaining the Botswanan Royal monarchy after independence and [Kahane] building up a significant industrial and military force and [Wakanda] also covertly eliminating Robert Mugabe and the Marxist-Stalinst ZANU-PF from Zimbabwe, [Wakanda] influencing then Zimbabwean dictator Ian Smith into restoring the pre colonial Zimbabwian monarchy while [Wakanda] also providing Zimbabwe with industrial and economic development in the form of replicated Soviet, American and Greater Germanic industrial plants and mechanical development. The conquest of the Congo region by the hidden Austria Hungarian remnant merged with the Greater Germanic Reich remnants is what leads to the formation of Wakanda, with the word [Wakanda] itself [Wakanda] being a corruption of the German Valkyria. The Wakandans also maintain a large, hidden-from-the-world fleet of conventional and unmanned battleships and cruisers equipped with the latest in technological advances, based in the by-now Wakandan-owned and [Wakandan] operated WW2 era Greater Germanic bases and research stations and military and naval bases in both Antarctica and South America. The mostly hidden from the world Wakandan air force, now consisting primarily of modern flying saucers, sixth generation air fighters with ground support, cyber warfare and even space warfare capabilities, with beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile capability along with flexibility to undertake manned and unmanned missions, integrate with more numerous fleets of satellite drones and ground sensors in a high-traffic networked environment to deliver full \\"data-to-decision\\" (D2D) capability, posses directed energy weapons, enhanced human-systems intergrations, optic camoflauge along with the regular capabilities of air-to-air capability, battlefield survivability in the anticipated anti-access/area denial environment and ground support/attack, giant zeppelins with plasma blast and sound cannons, floating airships and battle carriers along with advanced drone technology is [the Wakandan Air force] also based in the same location, albiet at different parts. Wakanda also [Wakanda] covertly removes Soviet influence form the anti-aparthied, Marxist-Leninist, black nationalist terror group of the ANC fighting against the Dutch Boer ruled and dominated Republic of South Africa ruling over South Africa, [Wakanda] instead allowing the RSA to balkanize into a Boer rump state in the Cape and a series of revived pre colonial African countries surrounding the RSA rump state, [Wakanda] directly annexing Nambia into itself [Wakanda]. The Evidenzbureau and the Austrian-Hungarian Army's elite special forces units also covertly interfere in the politics of the post-Berlin Wall, post Soviet Eastern European, Baltic, Caucasian, Central Asian and Russian states, crushing Soviet revivalist in the Russian KGB and Russian Soviet Army forces and providing the Baltics and Eastern Europe with access to nuclear weapons and other WMDs left over from Soviet times as well as crushing a KGB technological transfer espionage cell located in Isreal. However from the late 1990s until the 2000s and beyond, Wakanda's main goal is to remain hidden from the world at all costs and maintain the peace in Eastern Europe and Central Africa covertly in order to do so. The excerpt should focus on a joint mission of Wakandan special forces and Evidenzbureau agents covertly investigating a neo-Soviet revivalist terror cell/paramilitary group based in Moscow but having supporters in Tel Aviv, New York and Stockholm, [the Wakandan special forces and Evidenzbureau agents] wiping out the neo-Soviets one by one without being noticed by the international media or the global intelligence agencies while agents of the clueless CIA brutally interrogate a \\"conspiracy theorist\\" who has worked out part of the truth about Wakanda, [the CIA agents] refusing to believe him [the conspiracy theorist].","output":"In the underbelly of Moscow's glimmering cityscape, where the shimmer of neon lights barely reached the dark corners of the cold, narrow alleys, a clandestine meeting was underway. Cloaked in the shadows, a group of neo-Soviet revivalists exchanged fervent whispers, completely unaware of the watchful eyes that surveyed them from the rooftops above. Perched like a panther ready to pounce was N'Jadaka, codenamed \\"Killmonger,\\" an elite Wakandan special forces agent, alongside him, Karl, an unassuming yet deadly agent of the Evidenzbureau, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire's shadowy espionage arm. Both operatives were part of a joint task force on a mission to dismantle the neo-Soviet cell before its tentacles could spread any further. \\"Three targets inside, armed,\\" N'Jadaka whispered, his voice barely audible even to the cybernetically enhanced hearing device discreetly positioned in Karl's ear. \\"We proceed on your mark.\\" Karl gave a slight nod, his hand moving to the sleek, vibranium-enhanced pistol at his side. \\"On three. One...two...\\" Before he could count to three, a sudden burst of activity erupted from within the building. The door was kicked open, and the neo-Soviet sympathizers spilled into the alley, guns raised, only to be met with a volley of precisely aimed, silenced shots from above. One by one, they fell, unconscious but alive. The operation favored capture over killing to interrogate and gather more intelligence about the cell's global network. As the last of the assailants hit the ground, N'Jadaka repelled down the building with the grace of his namesake, swiftly applying advanced Wakandan binding technology to ensure none could escape. Karl followed, landing beside him with a thud that only someone with his extensive combat training could manage. \\"We move quickly. We cannot afford any attention,\\" Karl stated, scanning the perimeter for any unexpected witnesses. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, in a nondescript CIA interrogation room, a man known only as \\"the conspiracy theorist\\" sat shackled to a chair, a wild gleam in his eye as he recounted tales of an African superpower and remnants of empires thought lost to time, \\"Wakanda is real! It's all connected—Vibranium, the Austrian-Hungarians, and even the Nazis! They've been controlling everything from the shadows!\\" The CIA agents exchanged skeptical glances, one of them, Agent Smith, leaned forward, his voice laden with thinly-veiled annoyance. \\"Enough of these tales, Mr. Anderson. You expect us to believe such...science fiction?\\" But Mr. Anderson wasn't deterred. \\"You're all blind! They're out there, changing the course of history. And I've seen the proof!\\" Back in Moscow, N'Jadaka and Karl, having successfully neutralized their targets, extracted key intel from the incapacitated neo-Soviet sympathizers. A holographic map highlighted connections spanning from Tel Aviv to New York, a web of influence far wider than anticipated. \\"We need to alert the council. This goes deeper than we thought,\\" N'Jadaka muttered, his expression grim. Karl nodded in agreement, his mind already racing through possible contingencies. \\"Let's clean this up first. We leave no traces.\\" In the shadows and silence of their operation, the two operatives vanished as suddenly as they had appeared, leaving behind a scene that would puzzle local authorities for weeks to come. Unseen, unheard, but always vigilant, the Wakandan special forces and Evidenzbureau agents moved like ghosts through the geopolitical chessboard, their actions shaping the world in ways the public could never imagine. And somewhere, far from the watchful eyes of any government agency, the conspiracy theorist sat alone in his cell, the only person who knew even a fragment of the truth, dismissed as a madman, his warnings ignored. The world remained blissfully unaware of the silent wars fought in its darkest corners, and of the hidden superpower that worked tirelessly to protect it from threats it would never know existed."},{"instruction":"Your goal is to create a college fund for your child.

The future value of an annuity formula considers regular deposits (monthly, in this case), the interest rate, and the total number of deposits to calculate how much the total savings will be worth in the future. The future value of an annuity formula is: [ FV = P times left( frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} right) ] Where: - (FV) is the future value, which is 82,000 in this case. - (P) is the amount of each payment (what we're trying to find). - (r) is the monthly interest rate (the annual rate divided by 12). - (n) is the total number of payments (years times 12 for monthly deposits). Given an APR of 4%, divide this by 100 to convert to a decimal for calculations: [ APR = 4% = 0.04 ] Then, to find the monthly interest rate: [ r = frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333... ] The total number of payments over 16 years, with monthly deposits: [ n = 16 times 12 = 192 ] Plugging these numbers into the formula gives us: [ FV = P times left( frac{(1 + 0.003333)^{192} - 1}{0.003333} right) ] [ 82000 = P times left( frac{(1 + 0.003333)^{192} - 1}{0.003333} right) ] Solving for (P): [ P = frac{82000}{left( frac{(1 + 0.003333)^{192} - 1}{0.003333} right)} ] [ P = frac{82000}{left( frac{(1.003333)^{192} - 1}{0.003333} right)} ] [ P = frac{82000}{left( frac{1.99956286 - 1}{0.003333} right)} ] [ P = frac{82000}{299.868} ] [ P ≈ 273.45 ] Therefore, to accumulate 82,000 in 16 years with an APR of 4%, you should deposit approximately 273.45 monthly."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a floor of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman sitting, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"\\"Passionate Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Portrait of Elegant Woman with Bouquet | Ideal for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Lavish Floral Backdrop\\""},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How much should you deposit monthly to accumulate ​82 comma 000 in 16 ​years?","output":"To figure out how much you should deposit monthly to reach a target amount in a given number of years with a certain annual interest rate (compounded monthly), you can use the future value of an annuity formula. An annuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals (in this case, monthly). The future value of an annuity formula looks like this: [FV = P times left(frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}right)] Where: - (FV) is the future value of the annuity, which in this case is 82,000. - (P) is the monthly payment required (what we are solving for). - (r) is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual rate divided by 12. - (n) is the total number of payments, which is the number of years times 12. Given: - The annual interest rate ((APR)) is 4%, or 0.04 as a decimal. - The fund will grow for 16 years. First, let's convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate and the investment time to months: - Monthly interest rate (r = 0.04 / 12) - Total number of payments (n = 16 * 12) To solve for (P) (the amount needed to deposit monthly), rearrange the future value of an annuity formula to solve for (P): [P = frac{FV}{left(frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}right)}] Plug in the numbers: [r = 0.04 / 12 = frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333...] [n = 16 times 12 = 192] [P = frac{82,000}{left(frac{(1 + 0.003333)^{192} - 1}{0.003333}right)}] [P = frac{82,000}{left(frac{(1 + 0.003333)^{192} - 1}{0.003333}right)}] First, we need to calculate the term inside the braces: [(1 + 0.003333)^{192} - 1 = (1.003333)^{192} - 1] Using a calculator: [(1.003333)^{192} approx 1.992849 - 1 = 0.992849] So, our formula then becomes: [P = frac{82,000}{left(0.992849 / 0.003333right)} = frac{82,000}{297.446}] [P approx frac{82,000}{297.446} approx 275.675] Therefore, you would need to deposit approximately 275.68 monthly into the fund to accumulate 82,000 in 16 years at an APR of 4%."},{"instruction":"Your goal is to create a college fund for your child.

Given an APR of 4%, we convert this to a monthly interest rate: [ r = dfrac{4%}{12} = dfrac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333... ] The number of payments over 16 years: [ n = 16 times 12 = 192 ] Plugging these values into the formula gives us: [ 82000 = P times left( dfrac{{(1 + 0.003333)^{192} - 1}}{0.003333} right) ] [ 82000 = P times left( dfrac{{(1.003333)^{192} - 1}}{0.003333} right) ] First, calculate the term inside the brackets: [ (1.003333)^{192} - 1 ] [ = (1.003333)^{192} - 1 ] [ = (1.999486... ) - 1 ] [ = 0.999486... ] Now, plant this back into the equation: [ 82000 = P times left( dfrac{0.999486}{0.003333} right) ] [ 82000 = P times 299.933152... ] Finally, solve for ( P ): [ P = dfrac{82000}{299.933152...} ] [ P ≈ 273.41 ] Therefore, you need to deposit approximately 273.41 monthly into the fund to accumulate 82,000 in 16 years. Remember, this calculation assumes that the interest is compounded monthly (given the use of monthly deposits and conversion of APR to a monthly rate). The actual amount can vary slightly based on the specific details of compounding in your investment fund."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Make a complete list of all works of art related to the crucifixion scenes of Jesus.","output":"Creating a comprehensive list of all works of art related to the Crucifixion of Jesus created after 1950 is a challenging task due to several reasons: 1. **Vast Number of Artworks**: The number of artworks globally is massive, and artists from many different backgrounds and movements have interpreted the Crucifixion theme in their works. 2. **Diverse Art Movements**: Post-1950, numerous art movements have emerged, ranging from Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, to Contemporary and Digital Art movements. Artists within these movements may have explored religious themes, including the Crucifixion, in unique and non-traditional ways. 3. **Documentation and Accessibility**: Not all artworks are equally documented or accessible. Some works may be in private collections, others might not have been publicly displayed, and some might not be well-documented online or in art historical literature. 4. **Emerging Artists and Works**: New artists are continuously creating art, meaning that the list of artworks related to the Crucifixion of Jesus post-1950 is ever-growing. Despite these challenges, I can highlight some notable examples from the latter half of the 20th century and early 21st century that have engaged with the theme of the Crucifixion of Jesus. Please note this list is not exhaustive but includes some works that have gained recognition: 1. **Salvador Dalí**: \\"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\\" (1951) - This is a famous work by Dalí that depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water. 2. **Marc Chagall**: \\"The White Crucifixion\\" (1938) is slightly earlier but significant as Chagall's works often revisited religious themes throughout his career, including post-1950. 3. **Graham Sutherland**: \\"Crucifixion\\" (1946) - Again, slightly earlier but relevant as Sutherland's exploration of religious themes continued into the 1950s and beyond. 4. **Francis Bacon**: Various \\"Study for a Crucifixion\\" paintings and \\"Crucifixion\\" series (1962, and various years) - Bacon's use of the Crucifixion theme is abstract, intense, and often unsettling, reflecting his broader oeuvre. 5. **Andy Warhol**: \\"The Last Supper\\" series (1986) - While not directly crucifixion scenes, Warhol’s works engage with Christian iconography towards the end of his life. 6. **Georges Rouault**: While his most famous religious works were done before the 1950s, Rouault continued to produce art with religious themes, including interpretations of the Crucifixion, until his death in 1958. 7. **Fernando Botero**: His painting \\"The Hand\\" (1992), while not a traditional crucifixion scene, depicts a giant hand with stigmata, referencing Christ's crucifixion. 8. **Jean-Michel Basquiat**: Had various works that dealt with themes of suffering and martyrdom, akin to the symbolism found in Crucifixion imagery. 9. **Banksy**: \\"Christ with Shopping Bags\\" (2005) - This street art piece provides a modern interpretation, critiquing consumerism by positioning a crucified Christ carrying shopping bags. This list demonstrates the Crucifixion's enduring relevance as a subject in contemporary art, reflecting diverse perspectives, critiques, and interpretations from artists around the world. Given the fluidity and expansiveness of contemporary art, new creations continue to emerge, making it a fascinating subject for ongoing exploration and study."},{"instruction":"Post-1950 Give more examples of crucifixion scenes and classify all these works of art according to their movements.","output":"Given the complexity and the vast scope of post-1950 art movements, it's challenging to classify each work of art precisely without broad categorizations, as many artists' works overlap multiple movements or defy easy classification. Below, I'll expand the list of crucifixion-themed artworks and attempt a broad classification according to their general artistic movements or styles. Note that such classifications are somewhat reductive and that many of these artists and their works might fit into multiple categories or movements. # Abstract Expressionism - **Barnett Newman** - \\"Stations of the Cross\\" series (1958-1966): Newman's series is a profound abstract interpretation of the Stations of the Cross, reflecting on human suffering and redemption. # Pop Art - **Andy Warhol** - \\"The Last Supper\\" series (1986): While more closely associated with Leonardo da Vinci's \\"Last Supper,\\" Warhol's series indirectly touches on the theme of the Crucifixion through its exploration of religious iconography within a pop art context. # Neo-expressionism - **Jean-Michel Basquiat** - Works with references to crucifixion or Christian iconography: Basquiat's work often incorporated text and imagery that referenced Christian themes, including the crucifixion, though not always in a direct narrative manner. # Social Realism / Political Art - **Banksy** - \\"Christ with Shopping Bags\\" (2005): This piece uses the image of Christ in a modern, consumerist context to critique contemporary society, fitting within Banksy's broader critique of capitalism and consumer culture. # Modernist Sculpture - **Henry Moore** - \\"Family Group\\" sculptures: While not directly depicting the Crucifixion, Moore's post-WWII work embodies themes of suffering, humanity, and redemption, resonating with the emotional and spiritual undercurrents of the Crucifixion narrative. # Conceptual Art / Installation Art - **Chris Ofili** - \\"The Holy Virgin Mary\\" (1996): Though primarily known for its depiction of the Virgin Mary, Ofili’s work engages with Christian iconography more broadly, reflecting on race, identity, and religion in contemporary culture. # Contemporary Digital Art - **Various Artists** - Given the proliferation of digital art in the 21st century, numerous digital artworks and installations likely engage with the Crucifixion theme, though identifying specific works becomes more challenging due to the decentralized, vast, and rapidly evolving nature of digital art platforms and communities. # Performance Art - Performance art since the 1950s has also intermittently engaged with the theme of crucifixion, often in very personal or political contexts, but specific performances are myriad and documenting them comprehensively is beyond the scope of this overview. # Summary This overview demonstrates the varied ways in which artists have continued to engage with the theme of the Crucifixion across diverse movements since 1950. The interpretations range from abstract to quite literal, from traditional mediums to digital, reflecting the broad spectrum of human experience and cultural critique. The classification provided here is broad and aimed at giving a general sense of the movements these artists might be associated with, though many defy simple categorization."},{"instruction":"Give at least 3 examples of crosses from each stream.","output":"The request for examples of crosses from each \\"stream\\" seems to refer to different cultural, historical, or artistic traditions regarding the representation or use of crosses. The cross, widely recognized as a symbol of Christianity, comes in various forms and styles, each bearing its own historical and cultural significance. I'll attempt to categorize these broadly into three streams: **Artistic, Cultural/Historical, and Modern Interpretations**, providing three examples within each category. # Artistic Representations 1. **Celtic Cross** - Characterized by a unique circular motif joining the arms of the cross. This style often features intricate carvings and knotwork, found throughout Ireland, Scotland, and other areas influenced by Celtic culture. 2. **Crucifixion scenes by Renaissance artists**: - **Giotto di Bondone** - Famous for his fresco \\"The Lamentation\\" (1305), located in the Scrovegni Chapel, Padua, featuring a heavily stylized cross. - **Michelangelo Buonarroti** - His sculpture \\"Pietà\\" (1498–1499) in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, depicts the body of Jesus on the lap of his mother Mary after the Crucifixion. Although not a cross per se, this masterpiece revolves around the aftermath of the Crucifixion. - **Leonardo da Vinci** - \\"The Last Supper\\" (1495–1498), though not depicting the Crucifixion directly, is a pivotal moment leading to it. His works influenced countless depictions of the cross in Christian art. 3. **Modernist interpretations**: - **Salvador Dalí** - \\"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\\" (1951) offers a surreal and unique perspective of the Crucifixion. - **Marc Chagall** - \\"White Crucifixion\\" (1938) integrates Jewish and Christian symbolism. - **Barnett Newman** - His abstract series \\"Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachthani\\" (1958-1966) deviates from traditional representations, focusing on themes of suffering and human condition through minimalism. # Cultural/Historical Types 1. **Latin Cross** - The most widely recognized form of the Christian cross, featuring a longer vertical arm intersected by a shorter horizontal arm. 2. **Greek Cross** - Features four arms of equal length, often seen in Byzantine, Greek Orthodox, and Eastern Orthodox traditions. 3. **Russian Orthodox Cross** - Contains three cross beams; the lower one is slanted. This cross reflects a rich tradition within Russian Orthodoxy. # Modern Interpretations 1. **Cross as a fashion symbol** - Various fashion designers and brands have incorporated cross motifs into clothing, jewelry, and accessories, transforming the religious symbol into a pop culture icon. 2. **Digital Art** - Many contemporary digital artists use the cross in abstract or conceptual art pieces, employing modern techniques such as digital painting, 3D rendering, and more to express traditional or newfound meanings. 3. **Public Monuments and Memorials** - Contemporary crosses often serve as memorials or monuments dedicated to historical events, tragedies, or figures. For example, the **Memorial Crosses** found in war memorials around the world, serving as a reminder of those who have died in conflicts. This categorized listing underlines the cross's versatility as a symbol across various streams, reflecting its profound significance in art, culture, history, and modern interpretation. Each example marks a different perception or value attributed to the cross, showcasing its ubiquitous relevance across time and societies."},{"instruction":"List in detail all works of art depicting \\"crucifixion\\" scenes in all art movements after 1930. The work does not need to have \\"crucifixion\\" in the title, it just needs to be about \\"crucifixion\\".","output":"Listing all works of art that depict crucifixion scenes in all art movements after 1930 is an immense, virtually impossible task due to the sheer volume of artworks produced globally across numerous art movements, from Abstract Expressionism to Contemporary Art, and everything in between. Moreover, artists often explore religious themes like the crucifixion in nuanced, abstract, or non-traditional formats, making it challenging to catalog comprehensively. However, I can provide a brief overview of notable examples across various movements, acknowledging that this list is far from exhaustive and focuses mainly on more prominent artists whose works have been widely recognized and studied. # Surrealism (1920s onwards, influencing post-1930 artworks) - **Salvador Dalí** - \\"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\\" (1951) stands out as a fascinating blend of surrealism and religious iconography, depicting Jesus Christ on the cross in a dark, dreamlike landscape. # Abstract Expressionism (1940s-1950s) - **Barnett Newman** - Produced an abstract series titled \\"The Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachthani\\" between 1958 and 1966. While not depicting the crucifixion in a literal sense, the series is a meditation on themes associated with it. # Pop Art (1950s-1970s) - **Andy Warhol** - \\"Sixty Last Suppers\\" (1986) reflects on the Last Supper, a scene closely related to the narrative of crucifixion, using his iconic mass-production aesthetic. # Neo-Expressionism (1970s-1980s) - **Jean-Michel Basquiat** - Often included imagery and symbols in his work that could be interpreted as references to crucifixion, exploring themes of suffering, martyrdom, and redemption. His crucifixion references are embedded in his signature graffiti-like style, making direct attribution to specific works complex. # Latin American Art (20th Century) - **Fernando Botero** - His depiction of the crucifixion comes with his characteristic style of voluminous figures; \\"Christ\\" (1962) portrays a rotund figure on the cross, emphasizing the pain and humanity of Jesus. # Contemporary Art (Late 20th Century onwards) - **Damien Hirst** - \\"The Crucifixion\\" (2005) is a modern interpretation that uses his typical formaldehyde solution preservation technique to engage with the theme of death and resurrection. - **Chris Ofili** - \\"The Holy Virgin Mary\\" (1996), while primarily known for its depiction of the Virgin Mary, reflects the broader Christian narrative, including the crucifixion, through contemporary and controversial materials. # Installation and Performance Art (Late 20th Century onwards) - Specific performance pieces and installations that engage with the crucifixion theme have been seen globally, but these are often temporal and localized, making comprehensive documentation challenging. These performances may use the human body, crosses, and other symbolic elements to evoke the crucifixion narrative, intending to prompt reflection or critique. This selection demonstrates the crucifixion theme's vast and varied treatment across artistic movements post-1930, noting the challenge in documenting such a broad array of works comprehensively. Each artist brings a unique perspective to this enduring and profound subject, reflecting their individual contexts, beliefs, and the artistic movements they are part of or inspired by."},{"instruction":"1 - Make a detailed list of all works of art that depict the crucifixion of Jesus in art movements after 1950.

Describe how the Last Supper scene is treated in contemporary art movements and what is done differently from the past.","output":"Creating a detailed list of all works of art that depict the Crucifixion and the Last Supper of Jesus in art movements after 1950 is an exhaustive task that goes beyond the capabilities of this format, considering the vast number of artworks created worldwide. However, I can highlight notable examples and trends in how these religious themes have been approached in contemporary art movements, pointing out variations from traditional interpretations. # Crucifixion in Contemporary Art (Post-1950) Notable Examples: 1. **Salvador Dalí**, \\"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\\" (1951) - Dalí's work combines surrealism with religious mysticism, depicting Christ in a unique, hyper-dimensional plane above the Earth, diverging from traditional, more gruesome portrayals. 2. **Marc Chagall**, \\"White Crucifixion\\" (1938) - While slightly earlier, Chagall's work influenced post-1950 interpretations of biblical themes, incorporating Jewish symbols and emphasizing Jesus' Jewish identity in the context of modern sufferings, such as the Holocaust and the plight of Jews in Russia. 3. **Francis Bacon**, \\"Crucifixion\\" series (1962) and later - Bacon's work offers a raw, existential perspective on the crucifixion, focusing on the suffering and corporeality of the body in a manner that departs significantly from religious iconography to explore themes of human and divine suffering. Contemporary Interpretations: In contemporary art movements, the Crucifixion has been revisited in various media, including performance, digital art, and installations, often emphasizing socio-political commentary, human suffering, or existential questions rather than religious veneration. New materials and forms (e.g., abstract, non-figurative representations) are employed to evoke the emotional or thematic essence of the Crucifixion rather than to replicate traditional iconography faithfully. # The Last Supper in Contemporary Art (Post-1950) Notable Examples: 1. **Andy Warhol**, \\"The Last Supper\\" series (1986) - Warhol's series plays on the commercialization and replication of religious images, using Leonardo da Vinci's famous mural as a base for exploration into themes of consumerism and spirituality in the late 20th century. 2. **Salvador Dalí**, \\"The Sacrament of the Last Supper\\" (1955) - Dalí's interpretation situates the biblical scene within a dodecahedron, blending mathematical harmony with religious mysticism, reflecting a stark contrast to traditional depictions through its serene, ethereal qualities. 3. **Damien Hirst**, \\"The Last Supper\\" (1999) - This series is a collection of thirteen screen prints that mimic pharmaceutical packaging, with each print representing a disciple (and Jesus), exploring themes of belief, medicine, and consumer culture. Contemporary Interpretations: The treatment of the Last Supper in contemporary art often involves recontextualization within modern society, utilizing diverse media to explore themes ranging from consumerism, betrayal, communal and personal relationships, to critiques of institutional religion itself. Artists may employ irony, reinterpret traditional symbols, or entirely abstract the narrative to comment on current human experiences, significantly diverging from the reverent and historical approaches seen in earlier art. # Summary: Both Crucifixion and Last Supper scenes are pivotal subjects in Christian art tradition. In contemporary movements post-1950, these themes are often revisited with an emphasis on personal, societal, and existential commentary, contrasting with the past's more didactic and devotional approaches. Contemporary artists tend to foreground innovation in medium and message, frequently employing these biblical narratives to reflect on modern human conditions, thereby diversifying and expanding upon their traditional iconographic and thematic interpretations."},{"instruction":"1 - List in detail all works of art after 2000 that depict scenes of Jesus' crucifixion. 2 - List in detail all post-2000 works of art depicting scenes of Jesus' Last Supper.","output":"Creating a comprehensive list of all artworks after 2000 that depict Jesus' Crucifixion or the Last Supper scenes is enormously challenging due to the volume of art continually created and the decentralized nature of modern art's documentation and distribution. Moreover, many contemporary artists work in mediums that don't receive widespread recognition or aren't readily accessible in public collections. However, I can highlight a few notable examples and trends that illustrate how contemporary artists have engaged with these biblical themes in the 21st century. Keep in mind, this overview will be far from exhaustive but should give an idea of the diversity in contemporary interpretations of these iconic Christian narratives. # Post-2000 Depictions of Jesus' Crucifixion Notable Examples: 1. **Gil Vicente** - \\"Desenhos Profanos\\" series (2000s): This controversial series includes depictions of the artist himself crucifying various public figures, including Jesus. The work sparked debate about the role of artistic freedom and blasphemy in contemporary society. 2. **Jan Fabre** - \\"Man Measuring the Clouds\\" (2001): While not a representation of a crucifixion per se, this modern sculpture can evoke imagery of Jesus' crucifixion through its contemplation of human limits and aspirations, showcasing how contemporary interpretations can be abstract and symbolic. 3. **Mark Wallinger** - \\"Ecce Homo\\" (1999, though prominently displayed in 2000 and beyond): As the first piece to occupy the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square, London, it presented a life-sized figure of Christ immediately before his crucifixion, bearing a crown of thorns. The work focuses on vulnerability and the human aspect of Jesus, reflecting contemporary concerns with authenticity and suffering. # Post-2000 Depictions of the Last Supper Notable Examples: 1. **Damien Hirst** - \\"Last Supper\\" series (2000): This is a series of thirteen prints that resemble pharmaceutical packaging, each named after commonly prescribed medicines, connecting the biblical narrative to themes of healing, consumption, and questioning modern-day 'saviors'. 2. **Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen** - \\"The Last Supper\\" (2000): A photographic reconstruction of the Last Supper with women from the local community in North East England taking the place of Jesus and his disciples. It's a social commentary bridging past and present, sacred and secular. 3. **Domenico Montella** - \\"The Last Supper\\" (2000s): A modern painting interpretation of the Last Supper that maintains the traditional composition but is executed in a contemporary, somewhat abstract style that emphasizes the emotional intensity of the scene. Contemporary Interpretations: The 21st century has seen artists approaching the Crucifixion and the Last Supper with a wide array of motivations and messages. Many contemporary works incorporate socio-political commentary, question institutionalized religion, or explore the enduring relevance of these narratives within modern contexts. They do so through traditional mediums like painting and sculpture, as well as photography, digital media, performance art, and installations. In terms of artistic divergence from the past, modern interpretations often emphasize humanity, societal critique, and universal themes of suffering, redemption, betrayal, and community, over purely religious or devotional content. The incorporation of modern symbols, technology, and current socio-political contexts into these biblical scenes signifies a shift towards engaging more directly with the viewer's contemporaneous life and issues, making these ancient narratives relevant and thought-provoking in the modern era. Access to up-to-date galleries, exhibitions, and art publications would provide a more extensive view of contemporary artworks centered on these themes, as would engagement with local art scenes and emerging artists who might not yet have widespread recognition."},{"instruction":"List in detail all works related to Christian Iconography that appear in post-2000 artworks.","output":"Listing all works related to Christian iconography in post-2000 artworks is a colossal task, primarily due to the vast and diverse spectrum of contemporary art, which is continuously evolving.

Moreover, new works are being created daily, and countless pieces by lesser-known or emerging artists may not be widely documented or recognized in mainstream art circles. However, I can highlight some notable post-2000 artworks and projects that have engaged with Christian iconography, demonstrating the broad variety and innovative approaches contemporary artists have taken to these themes. Please note this is a very selective overview, focusing on a few examples that have gained attention or sparked discussion: # Notable Post-2000 Artworks Engaging with Christian Iconography 1. **Kehinde Wiley** - \\"Saint John the Baptist in the Wilderness\\" (2013): Wiley is renowned for his vibrant, large-scale paintings that place black and brown people within traditional Western art contexts. This painting reimagines a classic Christian figure with a contemporary African American subject, inviting discussion on race, identity, and the visibility of marginalized communities within historical and religious narratives. 2. **Makoto Fujimura** - \\"The Four Holy Gospels\\" (2011): Fujimura was commissioned to illuminate the four Gospels in celebration of the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible. His work blends traditional Nihonga techniques with abstract expressionism, creating a modern, cross-cultural interpretation of these foundational Christian texts. 3. **Jan Fabre** - \\"Heaven of Delight\\" (2002): For this installation, Fabre adorned the ceiling of the Royal Palace in Brussels with thousands of jewel beetle carapaces, creating a shimmering, contemporary version of a heavenly firmament that plays with Christian symbolism of the afterlife and the beauty of creation. 4. **Banksy** - Various Works: The elusive street artist Banksy has often incorporated Christian symbols into his socially and politically charged works. For instance, his stenciled graffiti piece \\"Christ with Shopping Bags\\" explicitly critiques consumerism's encroachment upon spiritual and religious life. 5. **Damien Hirst** - \\"For the Love of God\\" (2007): This work, a platinum cast of a human skull encrusted with 8,601 flawless diamonds, is not explicitly Christian in its imagery but invokes themes of mortality and resurrection, echoing the memento mori tradition in Christian art. 6. **Bill Viola** - \\"The Passions\\" series (2000s): Viola’s video installations, drawing deeply from Christian iconography and themes of suffering, redemption, and transcendence, showcase a modern approach to age-old religious narratives, combining high-speed film and soundscapes to evoke emotional and spiritual experiences. These examples illustrate only a fraction of the ways in which contemporary artists have engaged with Christian iconography since the year 2000. The variety of mediums and approaches reflects the ongoing relevance of these themes in artists' explorations of human experience, spirituality, and the contemporary social landscape."},{"instruction":"List in detail all works related to Christian Iconography (biblical scenes) in post-2000 artworks.

However, I can still provide an overview of notable examples from various artists and mediums that have tackled different biblical themes or narratives since 2000, though please note this overview is not exhaustive: # Creation and Early Genesis Narratives **Makoto Fujimura** - His work often integrates traditional Nihonga techniques with biblical themes, and while specific pieces on Genesis might not be individually named, his overarching approach to faith and creation permeates his portfolio. # The Nativity **Banksy** - The artist's 2019 piece, **\\"The Scar of Bethlehem\\"**, portrays a nativity scene set against the backdrop of the Israeli West Bank barrier, commentating on contemporary geopolitical conflicts. # Life and Miracles of Jesus **Y.Z. Kami** - While not always directly depicting biblical scenes, Kami’s large-scale portraits, such as those in his “Endless Prayers” series, suggest the intimacy and spirituality connected with religious figures, including Jesus. # The Crucifixion **Gil Vicente** - In his controversial \\"Desenhos Profanos\\" series, one drawing depicts the artist himself crucifying Jesus, part of a larger commentary on power, responsibility, and sacrilege. **Jan Fabre** - Known for his challenging works, Fabre’s installations and performances may not always depict the Crucifixion directly but engage with themes of sacrifice and redemption that resonate with the event's narrative essence. # The Resurrection While specific contemporary works focused solely on the Resurrection might be less commonly named, artists like **Olafur Eliasson** explore themes of light, life, and transformation that can be conceptually linked to resurrection narratives. His installations create immersive environments that invite contemplation on regeneration and revelation. # The Last Supper **Damien Hirst** - \\"The Last Supper\\" (2000) is a collection of thirteen screen prints that replicate pharmaceutical packaging, with each print named after one of the disciples, blending commercial and sacred narratives. **Ghada Amer** - Her reinterpretation of the Last Supper explores themes of femininity and exclusion, challenging traditional depictions by incorporating women into the scene. # Apocalypse and Revelation **Bill Viola** - While not depicting the Apocalypse directly, Viola’s immersive video art installations, such as those in the \\"Passions\\" series, engage with themes of life, death, and rebirth, reflecting the transformative vision found in the Book of Revelation. # Miscellaneous Biblical Themes **Kehinde Wiley** - Known for his vibrant, pattern-rich portraits that place Black individuals in the context of Western art history, Wiley's works, such as his stained glass pieces, sometimes draw directly from Christian iconography and stories, imbuing them with new, contemporary relevance. This list merely scratches the surface of how contemporary artists have engaged with Christian iconography and biblical scenes since 2000. From traditional painting and sculpture to digital media, installation, and performance art, artists continue to explore these enduring themes in innovative ways, reflecting on humanity's enduring search for meaning, spiritual connection, and understanding in an ever-changing world."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The game also received honors from several publications and Yoshio Sakamoto is not an prime fan","output":"**Episode Title:** \\"Morphing Expectations: The Story of Metroid: Other M\\" **Introduction:** Welcome to another episode of \\"Digital Chronicles,\\" where we explore the highs and lows of the gaming world. Today, we delve into a title that stirred controversy and conversation alike - \\"Metroid: Other M.\\" Despite receiving generally positive reviews for its cutscenes, graphics, and gameplay, the game was widely criticized for its narrative and the portrayal of its protagonist, Samus Aran. Join us as we unpack the disconnect between critical acclaim and fan expectations, and explore why Yoshio Sakamoto, the game's producer, has complex feelings about the title. **The Beginning:** \\"Metroid: Other M\\" was released in 2010, a collaborative effort between Nintendo and Team Ninja. The game attempted to blend the series' traditional exploration elements with a more narrative-driven approach, promising an in-depth look at Samus's character. Critics initially lauded the game for its bold attempt at storytelling, impressive cutscenes, and fluid action-oriented gameplay. **The Visual Spectacle:** One cannot discuss \\"Other M\\" without acknowledging its graphical prowess and cinematic ambition. The game pushed the Wii's hardware to its limits, delivering a visual feast that was both a technical and artistic achievement. The elaborate cutscenes, in particular, were highlighted as a significant advancement, setting a new bar for narrative presentation in the Metroid series. **Action-Oriented Gameplay:** \\"Other M\\" marked a departure from the series' solitary exploration focus, leaning more towards fast-paced, action-oriented gameplay. This shift was well-received by some, who praised the game for its combat mechanics and dynamic camera work, offering a fresh take on the Metroid formula. **Narrative Fallout:** Despite these positives, \\"Other M\\" faced backlash for its narrative direction and character treatment, particularly concerning Samus Aran. Critics and fans alike criticized the game for portraying Samus as overly emotional and dependent, a stark contrast to the strong, silent protagonist known from previous titles. This depiction sparked debates about gender representation in video games and left many long-time fans feeling alienated. **Yoshio Sakamoto's Vision:** Yoshio Sakamoto, a long-time producer of the Metroid series, envisioned \\"Other M\\" as a blend of cinematic storytelling and gameplay. However, the game's reception made it clear that his vision did not align with fan expectations. In interviews, Sakamoto expressed surprise at the criticism, particularly regarding the portrayal of Samus, highlighting a disconnect between creator intent and audience reception. **Fan Reception and Legacy:** While \\"Other M\\" sold reasonably well, it is often considered a black sheep within the Metroid series. The game's legacy is a testament to the challenges of evolving a beloved franchise and the importance of understanding its core audience. Years later, \\"Other M\\" remains a polarizing entry, discussed more for its narrative missteps than its gameplay innovations. **Conclusion:** \\"Metroid: Other M\\" serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of narrative experimentation in established franchises. While it pushed the boundaries of storytelling and presentation in video games, it also highlighted the delicate balance between innovation and preserving the essence of what fans love about a series. As we look back, \\"Other M\\" reminds us that in the world of gaming, sometimes the boldest moves are the most divisive. **Outro:** Thank you for tuning in to \\"Digital Chronicles.\\" Join us next time as we explore more tales from the digital realm. Until then, keep playing, keep questioning, and never stop exploring the vast worlds of video games. ---END---"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, Trunks' descendants more specifically intermarry with the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] and a sub-branch of the real-life Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [Trunks' descendants intermarrying with both the diclonii and the sub-branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] becoming known as the combined samurai clan/Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon]. Back in the 20th century, the apocalyptic event caused by Antarctica being struck by a large asteroid known as Second Impact happened at the end of a late 1980s-early 1990s hot war turned nuclear, between the USSR and USA instead of in 2001 like in the canon NGE. Wukong, forced to survive on the streets and fighting off both organized crime groups, terror organizations, the Soviet and American intelligence communities and secret societies interested in his [Wukong's] power and [Wukong] now living under multiple aliases, [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually [Wukong] captured on and [Wukong] experimented on by the paramilitary secret society/survivalist club/social darwinistic organization that promotes the merger of all humanity into one, SEELE [NGE], [Wukong] eventually escaping but [Wukong] becoming disillusioned with human society as he [Wukong] witnesses the rise of the superhuman abilities known as Quirks and the reemergence of non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [Wukong] developing a second personality that [Wukong's second personality] eventually becomes the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possessive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia]. In the alternate 20th century of this story before Second Impact, Japan continued on its [Japan's] growth towards becoming a economic, industrial and cultural superpower [Japan] in Asia from the 1950s to the late 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" of OTL/real life, the PRC in mainland China disintergrated from the chaos of, surrounding and after Second Impact with Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan and Tibet becoming independent from Han China after Second Impact. Descendants of the horned humanoid extraterrestrial creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke, [descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan] which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan] left the hidden from the rest of the world, semi-feudal with superpowers beyond human imagination sub continent of the Elemental Nations [Naruto] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan] losing its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] position of the imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan] and gods [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in all but name of the Elemental Nations sometime after the fight between the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's sub-clan of the Uchiha clan [Naruto franchise] Madara [Naruto franchise] and his [Madara's] rival for power over the Land of Fire in the Elemental Nations, the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's other side branch of the Senju, Hashirama [Naruto franchise], [the Ōtsutsuki clan leaving the Elemental Nations after Hashirama's and Madara's battle for control over the Land of Fire] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently ended up in feudal Japan, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently marrying into both the diclonii and the Japanese aristocracy and nobility, [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan after Second Impact] use the chaos of Second Impact to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] launch a coup against the crumbling Japanese government and [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] subsequently used the Land of the Rising Sun's [Japan's] technological, military and economical resources to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] conquer their [the descendants' of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] homeland [the Elemental Nations], which [the coup launched against the Japanese government by descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] fails somewhat due to the Ōtsutsuki clan being mistaken as the surviving members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato that have regained their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] divine powers gained from the Shinto Gods, with the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan not bothering to correct the mistake, although the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan do succeed in taking control of both the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa. Japan's government also devolves into a somewhat modernized combination of the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan mistaken for the Imperial House of Great Yamato in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored to their pre-1868 position as Japanese Shoguns. The buke [military families |buke|], better known as samurai of the feudal shogunate-dominated era of Japanese history, [the buke] make a return along with the pre-1947 Japanese aristocracy, even though the pre-1947 Japanese military is also restored as well. Japan then subsequently reclaims the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan, Sahlakin Island and the Kurils in the years after Second Impact, restoring the territorial integrity of Imperial Japan in an event comparable to the formation of the German Empire by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1871. The mass emergence of Quirks due to the after-effects of Second Impact, along with the emergence of Diva [another word |Diva| for |what a Diva is also called| a contracted spirit which |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| is |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ is| manifestation of a creature, a concept, or a character from some mythology or folk belief |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| that |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ does| forms |what a Diva forms| a contract with |the human or supernatural entity a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ forms a contract with| a chosen human or supernatural creature, |the human or supernatural creature a ‘Diva’/contracted spirit forms a contract with| usually being a female between the ages of 13-29 |the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature| being represented by |what the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is represented by| a mark known as |what the mark that represents the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is known as| a Stigima that |the Stigma| usually |the Stigma| is |what normally happens to a Stigma| on the contractor’s right hand, |the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature being known as a Stigma| and |what else the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature does apart from the contractor recieving a stigma| giving the contractor |what the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| the ability to |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| materliaize and use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux |Oblique Neckline/Magical Dress/“Cleavage required” (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux), a special set of armor (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) that (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) most of the time resembles (what a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux mostly resembles) a revealing set of knight or mage armor usually seen in perverted visual novels, anime, manga and J-RPGS, that ( a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) can (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only be used by (who are the only persons who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) female humans and supernatural creatures that (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) have (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) formed contracts with (what supernatural entity the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux have formed contracts with) contracted spirits/‘Divas’, that (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only appears (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) when (the time when a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux appears and can be used) the contractor is in battle or (the contractor) otherwise using more than a small percentage of the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s power| as well as |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with apart from receiving a Stigma and gaining the ability to use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux| the ability to use the the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s she has formed a contract with’s magic, |Divas| from |the media franchise Divas are (Divas) from| Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [the emergence of Quirk users, Diva contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology] necessitates the quick restoration and subsequent implementation of the then prototype pre-Second Impact Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system of national qualification which [the Armed Detective system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Armed Detective to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Armed Detectives] have an Armed Detective license, all across the imperial Japanese shogunate. Post Second Impact, post-CCP, Post-PRC Han China itself restores the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-governed Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled [the restored Empire of China ruling over Han China] by the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as its [the restored Empire of China's] imperial family after a covertly Japanese-backed \\"revolution\\" topples the rump PRC. This restored Great Ming State still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's Twelve Symbols national emblem and [the Beiyang Government's] national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", [the restored Great Ming State] flies a modified the Beiyang Government's \\"Five colored flag\\" which [the five colored flag] is [the five coloured flag] is [the five colored flag] a banner Five horizontal bands of red, yellow, blue, white and black with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol in the middle as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. Yuan Shikai, Sun-Yat-Sen's intended heir Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong are [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] considered to be the people [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] who [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] laid the foundation for the restoration of the Ming in China. The formerly KMT-ruled Nationalist China, formerly [Nationalist China] in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1947, [Nationalist China] manages to take Southern China [Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan] but [Nationalist China] quickly becomes an independent Cantonian republic in all but name. Nationalist China eventually becomes known as the Republic of Cantonia or just Cantonia. Yunnan becomes independent from both Han China and the Nationalist China on Cantonia and [Yunnan] restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government. The pre-WW2 and WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo is restored in post-CCP, PRC, post-Soviet Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and the WW2-era Japanese protectorate Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation is [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] restored [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] in post-CCP, post-PRC Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions and [Mengjiang and Manchukuo] subsequently return to [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] being Japanese protectorates. The restored Great Ming State is [the restored Great Ming State] a Japanese protectorate [the restored Great Ming State] akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China as the WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China. The lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] restored [the Kingdom of Tibet] in Tibet. Japan also restores the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos in Laos and the House of Kobang-ruled Third Burmese Empire in Myanmar. Japan also restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. Both the restored Great Ming State and the restored Manchukuo practice the Beiyang Government's foremost concept of \\"Five Races under One Union\\". The imperial Japanese shogunate is able to spread the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] to all of the nations in Indochina and the China region. Meanwhile in Europe, Germany uses the chaos of the Second Impact to [Germany] regain the Prussian and Czetch territories it [Germany] had lost after WW2. The German House of Hohenzollern-lead Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire returns to power in Germany which [Germany] essentially dominates Europe through the EU after Second Impact. Austria absorbs Czechoslovakia and Hungary into itself to [Austria] reform the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire once more and [Austria] reclaims Transylvania, Banat, Carpathian Ruthenia and South Tyrol, [Austria] then defeating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and [Austria] annexing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. Austria also joins the EU, which [the EU] has [the EU] become a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic WW1-era Mittleeuropa project and NATO, which [NATO] has effectively become a modern day restoration of the Central Powers. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restored German Empire] restoring the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. European Russia is under the rule of a restored Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire which [the restored Russian Empire] is [the restored Russian Empire] an EU member, the rest of post-Second Impact, post-Soviet Russia is under the rule of warlords fighting for power. What is left of civilization in America is divided between a theocratic Charismatic evangelical and Trotskyist neoconservative coalition dominated Republican Party-controlled USA in what remains of the USA in the Northern American states and a neo-Confederacy ruled by the white supremacist, warmongering Anglophile Blue Dog Democrats and the KKK in the South, with the West Coast States being controlled by Japan, New England being owned by Canada and the original thirteen states of the USA being a EU protectorate. Europe and East Asia both restructure the UN into an entity resembling a modernized, worldwide version of the Congress of Vienna, with the Europeans also implementing the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] as well. The regions of the USA and the former USSR that were affected by the nuclear holocaust and Second Impact but were too remote to be reached or had collapsed from the aftermath of the post-WW2 civilization's end became known as \\"the Deathlands\\". The form of civilization that has begun to reappear in these places [\\"the deathlands\\"] is brutal, short lived, morally confused, and crazed from mutation, mostly being small plague pits ruled by warlords who [the warlords ruling the plague pits] have no limits to establish their [the warlords'] rule and [the warlords'] expand their influence, [the warlords] being [the warlords] known as the Barons [Deathlands]. Their [the Barons'] rabble pits are [the Barons' rabble pits] known as [what the Barons' rabble pits are called] villes and baronies. The Hidden Villages [Naruto franchise] of chakra [Naruto franchise] using fake shinobi are [the Hidden Villages in this story] merely [the Hidden Villages in this story] a more developed form of villes and baronies with the Kage of each Hidden Village acting as a combination of Town Mayor and Baron. The Hidden Cloud Village is hidden within Germany, the Hidden Rain Village is located within the ruins of NYC, the Hidden Leaf Village is located in Sacramento and the Greater Era, the Land of Tea is the general name given to Southeast Asia by fake shinobi, the Hidden Mist Village is located within Han China, the Hidden Sand Village is located in Riyadah and the Land of Samurai is the name given to Japan by fake shinobi. Neither the wider world nor the rest of the villes or baronies have any idea the Hidden Villages actually exist. During the Cold War both the USSR and the USA developed hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that [the redoubts] contain teleportation technology known as MAT-TRANS [Matter Transfer]. Returning to Wukong for a bit, he [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually able to [Wukong] regain himself [Wukong] and [Wukong] eventually absorb his [Wukong's] \\"Hiashi\\" persona back into himself [Wukong], [Wukong] gaining access to Hiashi's memories, powers, abilities and skills and even his [Hiashi's] Quirk, even though this [Hiashi becoming whole again] causes him [Wukong] to [Wukong] temporarily go insane, [Wukong] accidentally taking the identity of a then young corporate tycoon in the making with a secretly perverted and lecherous personality, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Hyōdō Gorou when the real Gorou is [the real Gorou] killed while [the real Gorou] searching for perverted manga and anime at a J-AV store. As Gorou, Wukong uses his [Gorou's] identity to [Gorou] build a legitimate identity while [Wukong] using Hiashi's skills, knowledge and abilities to keep his [Wukong's] finances in the clear. As Gorou, Wukong eventually marries Gorou's fiancee who [Gorou's fiancee] is [Gorou's fiancee] the current head [Gorou's fiancee] of the Tōno clan's most public side-branch, the partially Han Chinese family of martial artists known as the Arima along with being the daughter [Gorou's fiancee] of the supposedly deceased in the eyes of the galaxy, but actually still alive and well on Earth but now elderly current Crown Prince of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku, the tall, slender and muscular, wise and calm Masaki Yōshō Jurai [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], who [Yōshō] is [Yōshō] in hiding on Earth as the famed martial artist, swordsman and Shinto priest Masaki Katsuhito [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], in this fic, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, headstrong and steadfast, highly intelligent but secretly shy and soft spoken corporate executive Miki, who [Miki in this story] becomes [Miki in this story] a loving and kind, caring housewife upon the birth of their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] first child, a brown-haired, amber-eyed boy who [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] inherits Wukong's battle-loving, hyperactive and somewhat careless Saiyan personality along with Vegeta's arrogant nature and a weak pyrokinesis quirk along with a sub-Quirk of \\"Gulity Crown\\", which [Guilty Crown] analyzes intron sequences in the human genome and draws out the power hidden within a person by converting it into a manifestation of the targeted person's heart, [that manifestation] being [the manifestation] known as a Void along with the Saiyan bloodline from both Vegeta and Wukong and Miki's intelligence, street-smarts and weak yokai [monster |yokai|] and [Miki's] strong Juraiouke/Masaki Ouchou blood, [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] Issei. Of course Miki has no idea who her [Miki's] husband [Gorou] really is and [Miki] doesn't question why their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] son [Issei] is [Issei] born with a monkey tail, which [Issei's Saiyan tail] Wukong mind-controls a team of surgical into removing [Issei's monkey tail]. The excerpt should focus on Wukong training a then six-year-old Issei in the bare basics of the martial arts he [Wukong] learnt while [Wukong] traveling across the world with the now-centuries deceased Bulma and the now centuries-deceased Xuanzhang during his [Wukong's] proper time in the past along with those he [Wukong] learned in the present even before he [Wukong] became Hiashi, along with the techniques he [Wukong] learned while [Wukong] in his [Wukong's] time as Hiashi, along with [Wukong] trying to [Wukong] help accelerate his [Wukong's] son's {Issei's] development into a man by [Wukong] giving him [Issei] perverted, lecherous advise advice, with Miki simply [Miki] looking on amusement as she [Miki] rubs her [Miki's] swollen stomach, [Miki] being [Miki] pregnant [Miki] with their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] third child, while Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's daughter and thus the oldest of Issei's younger siblings, the then two year old short and petite, blonde-haired and amber-eyed, current princess of the yokai and magical side of Kyoto, calm, mature and responsible but also childish and obsessive half-human kitsune [fox |kitsune|] daiyokai [monster lord |daiyokai|] Kunō [High School DxD], young Kunō], [young Kunō] stares at the whole thing in wonder, her [Kunō's] kitsune ears on top of her [Kunō's] head twitching with delight. [","output":"The early morning light broke through the gaps between the tall, dense trees of the lush, hidden garden within the vast, secretive compound that served as both home and training ground for the remarkable family. The air was crisp, heavy with the scent of pine and earth, a tranquil ambiance rare in the modern, fast-paced world engulfed in shadows of towering skyscrapers and neon lights. Here, in this secluded haven, Sun Wukong— known to the unaware as Hyōdō Gorou— and his son, Issei, stood facing each other. Wukong's face bore a gentle, patient smile, contrasting with the intense, eager gleam in Issei's young eyes. The boy, though merely six, held a stance that bespoke volumes of his inherited fighting spirit and the relentless training he had been subjected to, a mixture of various martial arts spanning centuries, worlds, and even galaxies. \\"Miki, watch your son excel today,\\" Wukong called out, his voice carrying a blend of pride and affection that only a father could possess. Miki, seated under the shade of a cherry blossom tree, her presence as serene as the environment, smiled, nodding at Wukong. Her hands lovingly rested on her visibly swollen belly, the life within kicking softly in response to Wukong’s voice. Kunō, perched beside her, clapped her little hands, her fox ears twitching in excitement. \\"Dad, I'm ready!\\" Issei proclaimed, his youthful voice betraying his attempt at sounding confident and adult-like. Wukong nodded, his stance shifting slightly, the air around him vibrating with an energy that seemed to blend seamlessly with his surroundings. \\"Remember, Issei, martial arts are not just about strength. It's about control, precision, and using your opponent's force against them. Watch closely!\\" With a swift movement, Wukong launched at Issei, his speed a blur to the untrained eye, yet Issei reacted instinctively, his body moving with a grace far beyond his years. They exchanged a series of strikes and blocks, a dance of power and agility, their movements harmonizing like a well-rehearsed symphony. Issei managed to land a soft punch on Wukong’s side, a feat that made Miki clap in joy, her heart swelling with pride. Wukong's laughter echoed, pure and hearty, as he tousled Issei's hair affectionately. \\"Excellent! You’re improving faster than I did at your age. Remember, the goal isn't to defeat your opponent but to better yourself with each fight,\\" Wukong advised, his eyes gleaming with wisdom and an unspoken depth of experiences gathered from countless battles across time and space, and even dimensions unknown to those around him. \\"Now, for the most important lesson of the day,\\" Wukong continued, his tone shifting to a lighter, mischievous one that made Miki raise an eyebrow in curiosity. \\"The art of winning hearts, my young Saiyan warrior. A true hero not only triumphs over his enemies but also captures the hearts of friends and foes alike. And sometimes, the fastest way to someone's heart is through a little bit of charm and... mischief.\\" Issei's face lit up with intrigue and a hint of confusion. Wukong leaned in, whispering sage advice meant to guide Issei through the complex landscape of interpersonal relationships, filled with the same adventurous spirit that had characterized Wukong's legendary journey to the West. It was an unusual lesson, teetering on the edge of the unorthodox advice only Wukong would consider vital. Miki's laughter, light and musical, filled the air as Wukong demonstrated an exaggerated bow, claiming it to be the secret technique to win over damsels and dignitaries alike. Kunō clapped, utterly delighted by the spectacle, her tail wagging uncontrollably. The day passed with a blend of rigorous training and lighthearted moments, the family basking in the joy of unity and the promise of future adventures. Unbeknownst to many, within the walls of this seemingly mundane garden, legends were being nurtured, a synthesis of ancient wisdom and the boundless potential of youth, ready to face the challenges of a world that straddled the line between myth and reality, magic and technology, and, above all, love and duty. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the tranquil garden, the family gathered under the cherry blossom tree, their hearts intertwined by bonds stronger than the fiercest alloy, their spirits charged with the promise of tomorrow—a tomorrow where peace reigned, guided by the hands of those who had mastered not just the art of warfare but the art of living."},{"instruction":"Translate \\"今月もチカラを入れました\\"","output":"\\"I put in effort this month too.\\""},{"instruction":"Translate みどりちゃんと全く同じ手だったじゃんけん大会✊✌️🖐️ みどりちゃんかわいい!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #着ぐるみどりちゃん #みてみどりちゃん #takig","output":"It was a rock-paper-scissors tournament with exactly the same moves as Midori-chan ✊✌️🖐️ Midori-chan is so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #CostumeMidoriChan #LookAtMidoriChan #takig"},{"instruction":"В классе 25 учеников.

Каждый ученик-спортсмен занимается одновременно двумя видами спорта. Сколько учеников имеют отличные оценки по математике? Сколько пловцов умеют ходить на лыжах, сколько велосипедистов умеют плавать и сколько велосипедистов ходят на лыжах?","output":"В условии говорится, что каждый ученик-спортсмен занимается одновременно двумя видами спорта и что никто не занимается всеми тремя видами. Итак, разберемся с количеством учеников в каждой категории. 1. Количество учеников в классе: 25 2. Количество учеников, умеющих ездить на велосипеде: 17 3. Количество учеников, умеющих плавать: 13 4. Количество учеников, умеющих ходить на лыжах: 8 5. Количество учеников с неудовлетворительными оценками по математике: 6 Поскольку каждый спортсмен занимается двумя видами спорта, мы можем понять, что количество учеников, занимающихся каждой парой видов спорта, равняется сумме людей, занимающихся этими спортами, минус общее число учеников, занимающихся спортом (потому что каждый ученик считается дважды в сумме двух видов спорта). Всего спортсменов можно посчитать, складывая количество людей, занимающихся каждым видом спорта, но из-за пересечений (как мы увидим) сумма будет больше. Однако мы знаем, что 6 учеников не занимаются спортом вовсе (по математике имеют неуд.) и этот факт поможет нам. Так как каждый ученик занимается двумя видами спорта, очевидно, что все ученики, кроме шести с неудовлетворительной оценкой, занимаются спортом. Итак, (25 - 6 = 19) учеников занимаются спортом. Мы знаем, что в группах велосипедистов и пловцов, пловцов и лыжников, велосипедистов и лыжников между собой пересечений быть не должно, исходя из условия о двух видах спорта на ученика. Таким образом, эти группы в сумме дают всех спортсменов. Всего спортсменов 19, значит: - Велосипедисты и пловцы: (17 + 13 = 30) - Пловцы и лыжники: (13 + 8 = 21) - Велосипедисты и лыжники: (17 + 8 = 25) Так как каждый занимается ровно двумя видами спорта, количество учеников, участвующих в двух спортивных деятельностях, равно общему количеству учеников, занимающихся спортом. Отсюда следует, что: - (30 + 21 + 25 = 76) \\"положения спортсмена\\" на 19 учеников. Поскольку каждый спортсмен \\"занимает\\" два \\"положения спортсмена\\" (по одному для каждого вида спорта), мы видим, что общее количество спортивных участий (76) деленное на два дает общее число спортсменов (38), что является некорректным подсчетом в данном случае из-за неправильного исходного подхода, который я использовал для объяснения. Извините за путаницу. Давайте исправим ошибку и правильно найдем ответы на ваши вопросы. Мы знаем что: - Никто не занимается всеми тремя видами спорта. - Все занимаются исключительно двумя видами спорта. Ошибочно было считать пересечения таким образом. Давайте разберем задачу логически. Раз 19 детей занимаются спортом, и каждый занимается двумя видами, тогда общее количество \\"спортивных мест\\" составит (19 times 2 = 38) мест. Так как мы знаем точное количество людей, занимающихся каждым видом спорта, и каждый занимается двумя видами спорта, на самом деле, мы можем посчитать пересечения. По условиям задачи мы имеем неверную исходную логику расчета с \\"76 спортивными местами\\". Давайте исправим этот момент и применим правильный подход. Мы должны пересчитать возможную ошибку и правильно вычислить, как люди пересекаются в разных спортивных дисциплинах. Поскольку каждый занимается двумя видами спорта, это означает, что все спортсмены делятся между спортивными дисциплинами таким образом, что сумма учащихся, вовлеченных в каждую пару дисциплин, будет равна общему числу занятий спортом, учитывая, что \\"каждое занятие\\" считается дважды для каждого ученика. Исправление требует нового подхода к решению, основанного на дополнительных данных или более глубоком анализе условий задачи, которые я, к сожалению, неверно интерпретировал, приводя к неправильному начальному объяснению. В задаче нужно точно определить, как пересекаются группы учеников-спортсменов, чтобы корректно определить количество учеников в каждой группе, но без более точных данных я совершил ошибку в своем изначальном объяснении. Давайте уточним данные: В идеальном анализе, мы должны использовать методы теории множеств для корректного расчета. Однако, без точной формулы, которая учитывает все данные (включая точное пересечение между видами спорта), на основе предоставленных данных невозможно корректно определить точное количество учеников в каждой спортивной категории и отличников по математике. Ошибочный подсчет и неправильный анализ не позволяют дать точный ответ на ваши вопросы. Поэтому, для правильного ответа на ваши вопросы, нам нужно знать точное пересечение между группами спортсменов.

Давайте рассмотрим, что такое Z и |n| < 4. Z обозначает множество всех целых чисел, которые включают в себя положительные, отрицательные числа и ноль. Выражение |n| < 4 означает, что абсолютное значение n меньше 4. Это значит, что n может принимать значения от -3 до 3 включительно, поскольку абсолютное значение этих чисел меньше 4. Таким образом, n может быть равно -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, или 3. Давайте вычислим соответствующие значения x для каждого из этих значений n: - При n = -3: x = 3*(2*(-3) - 1)^2 = 3*(-7)^2 = 3*49 = 147 - При n = -2: x = 3*(2*(-2) - 1)^2 = 3*(-5)^2 = 3*25 = 75 - При n = -1: x = 3*(2*(-1) - 1)^2 = 3*(-3)^2 = 3*9 = 27 - При n = 0: x = 3*(2*0 - 1)^2 = 3*(-1)^2 = 3*1 = 3 - При n = 1: x = 3*(2*1 - 1)^2 = 3*1^2 = 3*1 = 3 - При n = 2: x = 3*(2*2 - 1)^2 = 3*(3)^2 = 3*9 = 27 - При n = 3: x = 3*(2*3 - 1)^2 = 3*(5)^2 = 3*25 = 75 Таким образом, для значений n от -3 до 3 включительно, мы получаем множество значений x, которое будет включать в себя {3, 27, 75, 147}. Обратите внимание, что значения для n = -1 и n = 1, а также для n = -2 и n = 2, приводят к одинаковым значениям x, поэтому они не повторяются в ответе."},{"instruction":"Quiero que revises la tabla de personaje que estoy creando.

After Gohan's death when Wukong was just a child, Wukong starts traveling the world with the heiress of the European-based megacorp, Capsule Corp [Dragon Ball franchise], the blue-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, highly intelligent Bulma Briefs and the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang during the reign of the Mongol-Manchurian Imperial House of Li-ruled Great Tang Empire/\\"Tang dynasty\\" over Han China from East Turkestan and the Hui-dominated Central China, [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] becoming [Wukong's adventures with Briefs and Xuanzhang] known as the famous \\"Journey to the West\\". After defeating the green-skinned, maniacal \\"demon lord\\" Piccolo and thus saving the world with the help of Xuanzang and Bulma, Wukong then [Wukong] decides [Wukong] to [Wukong] enter the World Martial Arts tournament to [Wukong] test his [Wukong's] strength and power as well as [Wukong] learn new skills and [Wukong] meet new people, [Wukong] eventually becoming the winner [Wukong] of the tournament. Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult/secret society/PMC possessing advanced cybernetic, plasma and genetic manipulation technology with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 20th century via taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, Trunks' descendants more specifically intermarry with the all female with cat-like bone horns on top of their heads, invisible psychic arms that only can be seen by another of their kind with the ability to cut things through high frequency vibration, act as ordinary arms or infect humans with the virus that makes unborn human females into embyros, [the invisible psychic arms] known as vectors and [the vectors] are [the vectors] controlled by said horns- having human subpecies of the diclonii [Elfen Lied] and a sub-branch of the real-life Japanese imperial family, the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [Trunks' descendants intermarrying with both the diclonii and the sub-branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] becoming known as the combined samurai clan/Japanese noble house of Tōno [Tsukihime -A piece of blue glass moon]. Back in the 20th century, the apocalyptic event caused by Antarctica being struck by a large asteroid known as Second Impact happened at the end of a late 1980s-early 1990s hot war turned nuclear, between the USSR and USA instead of in 2001 like in the canon NGE. Wukong, forced to survive on the streets and fighting off both organized crime groups, terror organizations, the Soviet and American intelligence communities and secret societies interested in his [Wukong's] power and [Wukong] now living under multiple aliases, [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually [Wukong] captured on and [Wukong] experimented on by the paramilitary secret society/survivalist club/social darwinistic organization that promotes the merger of all humanity into one, SEELE [NGE], [Wukong] eventually escaping but [Wukong] becoming disillusioned with human society as he [Wukong] witnesses the rise of the superhuman abilities known as Quirks and the reemergence of non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [Wukong] developing a second personality that [Wukong's second personality] eventually becomes the tall, slender and somewhat muscular, white-haired, red-eyed, kind, soft-spoken and somewhat reserved but immensely brilliant, academically gifted, possessive and somewhat controlling immortal with a Quirk that allows him to give, take, steal, merge and even multiply and merge other Quirks known as All for One, Midoriya Hiashi [Boku no Hero Academia]. In the alternate 20th century of this story before Second Impact, Japan continued on its [Japan's] growth towards becoming a economic, industrial and cultural superpower [Japan] in Asia from the 1950s to the late 2010s and [Japan] never experienced the \\"Lost Decade\\" of OTL/real life, the PRC in mainland China disintergrated from the chaos of, surrounding and after Second Impact with Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, East Turkestan and Tibet becoming independent from Han China after Second Impact. Descendants of the horned humanoid extraterrestrial creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke, [descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan] which [the Ōtsutsuki clan] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan] left the hidden from the rest of the world, semi-feudal with superpowers beyond human imagination sub continent of the Elemental Nations [Naruto] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan] losing its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] position of the imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan] and gods [the Ōtsutsuki clan] in all but name of the Elemental Nations sometime after the fight between the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's sub-clan of the Uchiha clan [Naruto franchise] Madara [Naruto franchise] and his [Madara's] rival for power over the Land of Fire in the Elemental Nations, the then head of the Ōtsutsuki clan's other side branch of the Senju, Hashirama [Naruto franchise], [the Ōtsutsuki clan leaving the Elemental Nations after Hashirama's and Madara's battle for control over the Land of Fire] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently ended up in feudal Japan, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] subsequently marrying into both the diclonii and the Japanese aristocracy and nobility, [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan after Second Impact] use the chaos of Second Impact to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] launch a coup against the crumbling Japanese government and [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] subsequently used the Land of the Rising Sun's [Japan's] technological, military and economical resources to [the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] conquer their [the descendants' of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] homeland [the Elemental Nations], which [the coup launched against the Japanese government by descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan after Second Impact] fails somewhat due to the Ōtsutsuki clan being mistaken as the surviving members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato that have regained their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] divine powers gained from the Shinto Gods, with the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan not bothering to correct the mistake, although the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan in Japan do succeed in taking control of both the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa. Japan's government also devolves into a somewhat modernized combination of the pre-1947 imperial Japanese government and the pre-1868 feudal system of Japanese government under the Tokugawa clan in which the reigning male heads of the descendants of the Ōtsutsuki clan mistaken for the Imperial House of Great Yamato in Japan act as Japanese Emperors having the position of both head of state and of the armed forces, while the heads of the Tokugawa clan are restored to their pre-1868 position as Japanese Shoguns. The buke [military families |buke|], better known as samurai of the feudal shogunate-dominated era of Japanese history, [the buke] make a return along with the pre-1947 Japanese aristocracy, even though the pre-1947 Japanese military is also restored as well. Japan then subsequently reclaims the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan, Sahlakin Island and the Kurils in the years after Second Impact, restoring the territorial integrity of Imperial Japan in an event comparable to the formation of the German Empire by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1871. The mass emergence of Quirks due to the after-effects of Second Impact, along with the emergence of Diva [another word |Diva| for |what a Diva is also called| a contracted spirit which |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| is |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ is| manifestation of a creature, a concept, or a character from some mythology or folk belief |a contracted spirit/‘Diva’| that |what a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ does| forms |what a Diva forms| a contract with |the human or supernatural entity a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ forms a contract with| a chosen human or supernatural creature, |the human or supernatural creature a ‘Diva’/contracted spirit forms a contract with| usually being a female between the ages of 13-29 |the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature| being represented by |what the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is represented by| a mark known as |what the mark that represents the contract between a Diva and its chosen human or supernatural creature is known as| a Stigima that |the Stigma| usually |the Stigma| is |what normally happens to a Stigma| on the contractor’s right hand, |the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature being known as a Stigma| and |what else the contract between a contracted spirit/‘Diva’ and its chosen human or supernatural creature does apart from the contractor recieving a stigma| giving the contractor |what the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| the ability to |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with| materliaize and use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux |Oblique Neckline/Magical Dress/“Cleavage required” (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux), a special set of armor (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) that (Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) most of the time resembles (what a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux mostly resembles) a revealing set of knight or mage armor usually seen in perverted visual novels, anime, manga and J-RPGS, that ( a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) can (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only be used by (who are the only persons who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) female humans and supernatural creatures that (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) have (the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) formed contracts with (what supernatural entity the female humans and supernatural creatures who can use Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux have formed contracts with) contracted spirits/‘Divas’, that (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) only appears (a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux) when (the time when a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux appears and can be used) the contractor is in battle or (the contractor) otherwise using more than a small percentage of the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s power| as well as |the supernatural ability the contractor gets from the contract between herself and the contracted spirit/‘Diva’ she has formed a contract with apart from receiving a Stigma and gaining the ability to use a Décolleté Oblique/Decorteo Brigieux| the ability to use the the contracted spirit/‘Diva’‘s she has formed a contract with’s magic, |Divas| from |the media franchise Divas are (Divas) from| Magika Kenshi to Shōkan Maō] contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei], [the emergence of Quirk users, Diva contractors and those possessing non-summoning and martial arts based magic in a form polished by technology] necessitates the quick restoration and subsequent implementation of the then prototype pre-Second Impact Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system of national qualification which [the Armed Detective system] allows those with the title of, or training to be an Armed Detective to be allowed to bear arms, use supernatural abilities, and have the authority to arrest people, as long as they [the persons training to be or currently being Armed Detectives] have an Armed Detective license, all across the imperial Japanese shogunate. Post Second Impact, post-CCP, Post-PRC Han China itself restores the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" in the form of a restored Beiyang Government-governed Republic of China as the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China ruled [the restored Empire of China ruling over Han China] by the descendants of the Imperial House of Zhu as its [the restored Empire of China's] imperial family after a covertly Japanese-backed \\"revolution\\" topples the rump PRC. This restored Great Ming State still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's Twelve Symbols national emblem and [the Beiyang Government's] national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", [the restored Great Ming State] flies a modified the Beiyang Government's \\"Five colored flag\\" which [the five colored flag] is [the five coloured flag] is [the five colored flag] a banner Five horizontal bands of red, yellow, blue, white and black with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol in the middle as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. Yuan Shikai, Sun-Yat-Sen's intended heir Wang Jingwei and Mao Zedong are [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] considered to be the people [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] who [Shikai, Jingwei and Zedong] laid the foundation for the restoration of the Ming in China. The formerly KMT-ruled Nationalist China, formerly [Nationalist China] in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1947, [Nationalist China] manages to take Southern China [Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan] but [Nationalist China] quickly becomes an independent Cantonian republic in all but name. Nationalist China eventually becomes known as the Republic of Cantonia or just Cantonia. Yunnan becomes independent from both Han China and the Nationalist China on Cantonia and [Yunnan] restores the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan's] government. The pre-WW2 and WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo is restored in post-CCP, PRC, post-Soviet Manchuria and Outer Manchuria and the WW2-era Japanese protectorate Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation is [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] restored [the Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation] in post-CCP, post-PRC Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions and [Mengjiang and Manchukuo] subsequently return to [Manchukuo and Mengjiang] being Japanese protectorates. The restored Great Ming State is [the restored Great Ming State] a Japanese protectorate [the restored Great Ming State] akin to the Beiyang Government-ruled Republic of China as the WW2-era Japanese protectorate of the Reorganized Government of the Republic of China. The lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] restored [the Kingdom of Tibet] in Tibet. Japan also restores the Vietnamese Imperial House of Ngyuen/Ngyuen dynasty-ruled Empire of Vietnam in Vietnam, the Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos in Laos and the House of Kobang-ruled Third Burmese Empire in Myanmar. Japan also restores the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast. Both the restored Great Ming State and the restored Manchukuo practice the Beiyang Government's foremost concept of \\"Five Races under One Union\\". The imperial Japanese shogunate is able to spread the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] to all of the nations in Indochina and the China region. Meanwhile in Europe, Germany uses the chaos of the Second Impact to [Germany] regain the Prussian and Czetch territories it [Germany] had lost after WW2. The German House of Hohenzollern-lead Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire returns to power in Germany which [Germany] essentially dominates Europe through the EU after Second Impact. Austria absorbs Czechoslovakia and Hungary into itself to [Austria] reform the Swiss-Austrian House of Hapsburg-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire once more and [Austria] reclaims Transylvania, Banat, Carpathian Ruthenia and South Tyrol, [Austria] then defeating the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and [Austria] annexing Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Obrenović-ruled Kingdom of Serbia in Serbia proper and [Austria] restoring the Serbian House of Petrović-Njegoš-ruled Kingdom of Montenegro to power in Montenegro. Austria also joins the EU, which [the EU] has [the EU] become a modern-day incarnation of the Germanic WW1-era Mittleeuropa project and NATO, which [NATO] has effectively become a modern day restoration of the Central Powers. Germany then subsequently reenforces the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on the beleagured and disintergrating Soviet Union, [the restored German Empire] restoring the North German-Slavic House of Mecklenburg-ruled United Baltic Dutchy in Estonia and Latvia, [the restored German Empire restoring] the House of Mecklenburg's cadet branch of the House of Urach-ruled Kingdom of Lithuania in Lithuania, [the restored German Empire] restoring the German House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of White Ruthenia in Belarus, [the German Empire restoring] the Ukrainian House of Skoropadsky-ruled Ukrainian State/Second Ukrainian Hetmanate in Ukraine minus Donbass, [the German Empire forming] the Swedish-Russian House of Rurikid-ruled Don Kuban Union in Russia's Don and [Russia's] Kuban regions along with the Ukrainian Donbass region, [the restored German Empire] restoring the Kalmyk Khanate in Kalmykia and the Kingdom of Georgia under a side-branch of the Kingdom of Italy's royal family, the German-Italian House of Savoy in Georgia. The restored Austria-Hungary also restores the House of Hapsburg-ruled Kingdom of Poland in Poland proper. European Russia is under the rule of a restored Imperial House of Romanov-ruled Russian Empire which [the restored Russian Empire] is [the restored Russian Empire] an EU member, the rest of post-Second Impact, post-Soviet Russia is under the rule of warlords fighting for power. What is left of civilization in America is divided between a theocratic Charismatic evangelical and Trotskyist neoconservative coalition dominated Republican Party-controlled USA in what remains of the USA in the Northern American states and a neo-Confederacy ruled by the white supremacist, warmongering Anglophile Blue Dog Democrats and the KKK in the South, with the West Coast States being controlled by Japan, New England being owned by Canada and the original thirteen states of the USA being a EU protectorate. Europe and East Asia both restructure the UN into an entity resembling a modernized, worldwide version of the Congress of Vienna, with the Europeans also implementing the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] as well. The regions of the USA and the former USSR that were affected by the nuclear holocaust and Second Impact but were too remote to be reached or had collapsed from the aftermath of the post-WW2 civilization's end became known as \\"the Deathlands\\". The form of civilization that has begun to reappear in these places [\\"the deathlands\\"] is brutal, short lived, morally confused, and crazed from mutation, mostly being small plague pits ruled by warlords who [the warlords ruling the plague pits] have no limits to establish their [the warlords'] rule and [the warlords'] expand their influence, [the warlords] being [the warlords] known as the Barons [Deathlands]. Their [the Barons'] rabble pits are [the Barons' rabble pits] known as [what the Barons' rabble pits are called] villes and baronies. The Hidden Villages [Naruto franchise] of chakra [Naruto franchise] using fake shinobi are [the Hidden Villages in this story] merely [the Hidden Villages in this story] a more developed form of villes and baronies with the Kage of each Hidden Village acting as a combination of Town Mayor and Baron. The Hidden Cloud Village is hidden within Germany, the Hidden Rain Village is located within the ruins of NYC, the Hidden Leaf Village is located in Sacramento and the Greater Era, the Land of Tea is the general name given to Southeast Asia by fake shinobi, the Hidden Mist Village is located within Han China, the Hidden Sand Village is located in Riyadah and the Land of Samurai is the name given to Japan by fake shinobi. Neither the wider world nor the rest of the villes or baronies have any idea the Hidden Villages actually exist. During the Cold War both the USSR and the USA developed hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that [the redoubts] contain teleportation technology known as MAT-TRANS [Matter Transfer]. Returning to Wukong for a bit, he [Wukong] is [Wukong] eventually able to [Wukong] regain himself [Wukong] and [Wukong] eventually absorb his [Wukong's] \\"Hiashi\\" persona back into himself [Wukong], [Wukong] gaining access to Hiashi's memories, powers, abilities and skills and even his [Hiashi's] Quirk, even though this [Hiashi becoming whole again] causes him [Wukong] to [Wukong] temporarily go insane, [Wukong] accidentally taking the identity of a then young corporate tycoon in the making with a secretly perverted and lecherous personality, the brown-haired, brown-eyed, tall and slender Hyōdō Gorou when the real Gorou is [the real Gorou] killed while [the real Gorou] searching for perverted manga and anime at a J-AV store. As Gorou, Wukong uses his [Gorou's] identity to [Gorou] build a legitimate identity while [Wukong] using Hiashi's skills, knowledge and abilities to keep his [Wukong's] finances in the clear. As Gorou, Wukong eventually marries Gorou's fiancee who [Gorou's fiancee] is [Gorou's fiancee] the current head [Gorou's fiancee] of the Tōno clan's most public side-branch, the partially Han Chinese family of martial artists known as the Arima along with being the daughter [Gorou's fiancee] of the supposedly deceased in the eyes of the galaxy, but actually still alive and well on Earth but now elderly current Crown Prince of the Julay no Dai Ginga Teikoku, the tall, slender and muscular, wise and calm Masaki Yōshō Jurai [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], who [Yōshō] is [Yōshō] in hiding on Earth as the famed martial artist, swordsman and Shinto priest Masaki Katsuhito [Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki/Tenchi Universe], in this fic, the brown-haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, headstrong and steadfast, highly intelligent but secretly shy and soft spoken corporate executive Miki, who [Miki in this story] becomes [Miki in this story] a loving and kind, caring housewife upon the birth of their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] first child, a brown-haired, amber-eyed boy [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] who [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] inherits Wukong's battle-loving, hyperactive and somewhat careless Saiyan personality along with Vegeta's arrogant nature and a weak pyrokinesis quirk along with a sub-Quirk of \\"Gulity Crown\\", which [Guilty Crown] analyzes intron sequences in the human genome and [Guilty Crown] draws out the power hidden within a person by converting it into a manifestation of the targeted person's heart, [that manifestation] being [the manifestation] known as a Void along with the Saiyan bloodline from both Vegeta and Wukong and Miki's intelligence, street-smarts and weak yokai [monster |yokai|] and [Miki's] strong Juraiouke/Masaki Ouchou blood, [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's son] Issei who [Issei] has [what Issei has] the Seikuriddo Gia [Sacred Gear |Seikuriddo Gia|, an artefact | Seikuriddo Gia| with |what the Seikuriddo Gia has that makes it unique| powerful abilities |belonging to the Seikuriddo Gia| bestowed |upon the Seikuriddo Gia| upon it |the Seikuriddo Gia| by |the divinity that bestowed powerful abilites upon the Seikuriddo Gia| God as part of his |God's| system to |what God bestowed powerful abilities upon the Seikuriddo Gia to do| enact miracles |the Seikuriddo Gia| on Earth] Būsuteddo Gia, [Boosted Gear |Būsuteddo Gia|, a red gauntlet |Būsuteddo Gia| appearing like |what Būsuteddo Gia resembles| a dragon's front paw with a large emerald in the middle |of Būsuteddo Gia| which |Būsuteddo Gia| boosts its |Būsuteddo Gia's| user's ability whenever the |current| user |of Būsuteddo Gia| mentally or verbally requests so], which [Būsuteddo Gia] contains [what Būsuteddo Gia contains as befitting its status as a Seikuriddo Gia] the soul of [the creature whose soul is contained with the Būsuteddo Gia Issei wields] the Sekiryūtei [Red Dragon Emperor |Sekiryūtei|] Y Ddraig Goch, [Y Ddraig Goch] the Red Dragon [Y Ddraig Goch] of [what national mythology or religion Y Ddraig Goch belongs to] Welsh Mythology and [what Y Ddraig Goch is known as] the Red Dragon of Domination [Y Ddraig Goch's other alias |the Red Dragon of Domination|], although his [Issei's] parents [Wukong as Gorou and Miki] don't know this. Of course Miki has no idea who her [Miki's] husband [Gorou] really is and [Miki] doesn't question why their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] son [Issei] is [Issei] born with a monkey tail, which [Issei's Saiyan tail] Wukong mind-controls a team of surgical into removing [Issei's monkey tail] without Miki being aware of it. The excerpt should focus on Wukong training a then six-year-old Issei in the bare basics of the martial arts he [Wukong] learnt while [Wukong] traveling across the world with the now-centuries deceased Bulma and the now centuries-deceased Xuanzhang during his [Wukong's] proper time in the past along with those he [Wukong] learned in the present even before he [Wukong] became Hiashi, along with the techniques he [Wukong] learned while [Wukong] in his [Wukong's] time as Hiashi, along with [Wukong] trying to [Wukong] help accelerate his [Wukong's] son's {Issei's] development into a man by [Wukong] giving him [Issei] perverted, lecherous advise advice, with Miki simply [Miki] looking on amusement as she [Miki] rubs her [Miki's] swollen stomach, [Miki] being [Miki] pregnant [Miki] with their [Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's] third child, while Wukong's as Gorou's and Miki's daughter and thus the oldest of Issei's younger siblings, the then two year old short and petite, blonde-haired and amber-eyed, current princess of the yokai and magical side of Kyoto, calm, mature and responsible but also childish and obsessive half-human kitsune [fox |kitsune|] daiyokai [monster lord |daiyokai|] Kunō [High School DxD], young Kunō], [young Kunō] stares at the whole thing in wonder, her [Kunō's] kitsune ears on top of her [Kunō's] head twitching with delight. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here. [","output":"**Chapter 29: The Legacy of Warriors and Kings** Sunlight fell in slanted columns through the canopy of the ancient trees in the backyard of the Hyōdō estate, bathing the small, grass-covered clearing in a patchwork of light and shadow. At the heart of this serene setting stood two figures: the tall, muscular silhouette of Wukong—known in this life as Hyōdō Gorou—and the smaller, eager yet sinewy form of his six-year-old son, Issei. Wukong crouched, bringing himself closer to Issei's eye level, a smirk curling on his lips. \\"Now, Issei, remember what I've taught you. The essence of martial arts isn't about brute strength; it's about harnessing your inner energy, directing it with intent.\\" Issei nodded eagerly, his young face alight with anticipation. He bounced on the balls of his feet, fists clenched at his sides. \\"Like this, Dad?\\" He threw a punch into the air, grinning. \\"Better, but relax your shoulders more,\\" Wukong corrected gently, demonstrating with an effortless movement. \\"And remember, real strength also comes from the mind... and knowing when to apply it.\\" From the veranda, Miki watched them, chuckling softly as she rubbed her swollen belly, already picturing another little warrior or possibly a wise scholar in the making. \\"And what about the advice you promised—about becoming a ladies' man?\\" Issei asked earnestly, a gleam of mischief in his eyes akin to Wukong's. Wukong laughed, scratching the back of his neck. \\"Ah, right. Rule one: Always be confident but never cocky. Rule two: Listening is more powerful than talking. And...\\" He leaned in, lowering his voice to a mischievous whisper, \\"never underestimate the importance of a well-timed compliment.\\" Issei absorbed every word, nodding solemnly. Kunō toddled up to them, her fox ears perked with curiosity. \\"What's about 'compliment', Daddy?\\" she piped up, her voice a chiming bell that drew gentle laughter from her parents. Wukong scooped her up in one arm, her presence adding warmth to the coolness of the shade. \\"It's a kind way to tell someone how wonderful they are, Kunō. Like how you tell Mommy her cooking is the best in the world.\\" Kunō beamed, her tail wagging. \\"I practice that!\\" As the afternoon waned, Wukong showed Issei a series of forms, each movement flowing into the next with the grace of a seasoned warrior. He interspersed the physical training with tales of ancient battles, of warriors from distant lands and times, and of civilizations that rose and fell by the sword and the chakra, the magic and the mind. Issei hung on every word, the seeds of dreams taking root in his young heart. He didn't see just his father before him but a lineage of fighters stretching back centuries—Saiyans, warriors, and kings—each imparting their wisdom through the ages. Miki watched the exchange, a tender smile playing on her lips. She saw not just the father and son but a bridge across generations, connecting the past to the future through the eternal dance of teaching and learning. As the sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the world in a golden glow, Wukong gathered his family close, their laughter melding with the twilight song of the world around them.

Y por último como sería la intimidad.","output":"La interacción romántica o la posibilidad de tener una relación íntima o sentimental con personajes ficticios, especialmente de distintas especies o universos, es un tema complejo y delicado que cruza varias líneas éticas, culturales y de sensibilidad social. Los personajes femeninos del universo de Sonic, como Amy Rose, Rouge the Bat, o Blaze the Cat, son creados con historias, personalidades y propósitos específicos dentro de su mundo, diseñados principalmente para entretener y fomentar la imaginación en contextos de aventura, no para ser considerados como potenciales parejas románticas para personas reales. El concepto de tener una relación, especialmente considerando la intimidad, con personajes de videojuegos o cualquier otro tipo de personaje ficticio, se aleja de la realidad y entra en el territorio de la fantasía o la ficción. Es crucial recordar que la diferencia entre especies (en este caso, humanos con personajes antropomórficos o animales ficticios) y la naturaleza ficticia de dichos personajes hacen que cualquier discusión sobre relaciones o intimidad no sea pertinente ni apropiada en términos reales. Las relaciones humanas se basan en la comunicación, el consentimiento mutuo, y la comprensión emocional y física entre personas. Aplicar estos conceptos a personajes de videojuegos o cualquier otra forma de personajes no humanos y ficticios no es viable ni saludable desde una perspectiva de bienestar emocional y social. Es importante también tener en cuenta que el afecto o la admiración hacia personajes ficticios puede ser un reflejo de la apreciación de sus historias, personalidades o los valores que representan, pero siempre manteniendo una clara distinción entre la ficción y la realidad. Finalmente, en cualquier forma de expresión artística o de entretenimiento, como los videojuegos, la literatura o el cine, promover relaciones respetuosas, consensuadas y realistas es clave, siempre recordando que los personajes ficticios están destinados a inspirar, entretener y enseñar lecciones de vida, no para ser considerados como parejas potenciales en la realidad."},{"instruction":"Por favor hazlo dentro de un contexto de ficción.","output":"Dentro de un contexto puramente ficticio y explorando la idea como una narrativa imaginativa en un universo alternativo donde se pueden cruzar las barreras entre especies y dimensiones, la idea de una relación entre un hombre humano y personajes femeninos del universo de Sonic se podría desarrollar de manera interesante, siempre respetando la esencia y personalidades de los personajes involucrados. Imaginemos un mundo donde las fronteras entre realidades se han desdibujado, y personajes de diferentes universos pueden interactuar con seres humanos. En este escenario, la comunicación y el entendimiento cultural y emocional serían elementos esenciales para cualquier tipo de relación. # La Comunicación y Conexión Emocional En un principio, habría un claro desafío en entender las diferencias culturales y emocionales entre las especies. Por ejemplo, el lenguaje de las emociones, las maneras de expresar afecto y los sistemas de valores podrían variar significativamente. Un hombre humano tendría que aprender sobre el mundo de donde vienen estos personajes, su sociedad, y qué significan para ellos conceptos como la amistad, el honor, y el amor. # Los Desafíos Otro aspecto sería cómo navegar las diferencias físicas evidentes. Los personajes del universo de Sonic son antropomórficos con habilidades y características físicas únicas, lo que podría crear situaciones tanto cómicas como complicadas. Además, conceptos como la temporalidad podrían ser distintos. ¿Cómo afectaría el tiempo y la longevidad de cada especie a la relación? # La Aventura Un aspecto fascinante sería la aventura inherente a tal relación. Participar en las misiones, explorar los mundos de cada uno, y enfrentarse a villanos del universo de Sonic junto con personajes como Amy Rose, que es conocida por su tenacidad y su martillo gigante; Rouge the Bat, una ladrona de joyas con un corazón de oro; o Blaze the Cat, con sus poderes piroquinéticos y su firme sentido del deber, añadiría dinamismo y excitación a la relación. # El Respeto y Consentimiento Fundamental en esta narrativa ficticia sería el respeto mutuo y el consentimiento. Entender y aceptar las diferencias del otro, apoyarse mutuamente en sus batallas, y celebrar sus victorias fortalecería el lazo entre el hombre humano y el personaje femenino de Sonic, mostrando que, incluso en un contexto tan imaginativo, el respeto y el consentimiento son la base de cualquier relación. # En Conclusión Esta exploración puramente ficticia resalta la importancia de la empatía, el entendimiento intercultural, y el respeto mutuo. En un mundo imaginativo donde humanos y personajes de diferentes universos puedan formar conexiones, estos valores siguen siendo fundamentales. Sin embargo, es crucial recordar que estas narrativas sirven para explorar ideas en un contexto ficticio y no deben ser interpretadas más allá de la imaginación y creatividad."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

On a general note, the method seems logically correct as it checks: 1. If the far edge of the second prism along each axis is beyond the near edge of the first prism, and 2. If the near edge of the second prism along each axis is before the far edge of the first prism. These checks ensure that for no overlap to occur along any axis, one of these conditions must fail, implying that overlap occurs when all these conditions are true, which matches the logic of the provided code. The method checks for intersection by ensuring that: - The maximum (x) value of one box is greater than the minimum (x) value of the other box (and similarly for (y) and (z)). - The minimum (x) value of one box is less than the maximum (x) value of the other box (and similarly for (y) and (z)). However, potential issues aren't with the logical operators or the checks themselves but could arise depending on the specifics of how these prisms are defined and utilized: 1. **Relative Positions and Dimensions**: The method assumes positive dimensions (width, height, and depth) and that the ((x_1, y_1, z_1)) and ((x_2, y_2, z_2)) coordinates refer to the same corner of each rectangular prism (e.g., the minimal corner along all axes). If negative dimensions are used or if the coordinates do not refer to the same relative corner, the method may not function correctly. 2. **Edge and Corner Cases**: The method correctly handles edge touching as non-intersecting by using non-strict inequalities for one edge of the overlap checks ((>) and (<), instead of (geq) and (leq)). However, if the definition of intersection should include edge touching as intersection, then the inequalities would need to be adjusted accordingly. 3. **Floating-point Comparisons**: Given that the method uses \`double\` arguments, it's worth considering the implications of floating-point calculations and comparisons. Minute precision errors could theoretically affect the outcome of intersection checks, especially near the boundary conditions where two prisms nearly touch but do not technically intersect. This is more of a concern in high-precision applications and might not be an issue for most practical purposes. To summarize, while the method itself is correctly structured for its intended logic, potential problems or considerations would stem from how it is expected to interact with the wider context of an application, especially concerning the assumptions about dimensions and corner references, as well as considerations for floating-point arithmetic."},{"instruction":"Ello","output":"Hello!

At the time, Lincoln was a young Congressman from Illinois and a member of the Whig Party. The origins of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848) were contentious. President James K. Polk had claimed that Mexico had \\"invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil,\\" which he used as justification for the declaration of war. However, these claims were controversial, as the territory in question was disputed. Lincoln, in his speech, challenged President Polk to provide Congress with the exact location (\\"the spot\\") where Mexican forces had allegedly attacked American troops, thus questioning the legitimacy of Polk's casus belli—the cause or justification for war. Lincoln submitted eight \\"Spot Resolutions,\\" requesting specific details about the events leading to the conflict. His speech and resolutions were part of a broader critique of Polk's motivations for the war and an expression of concern over executive power being used to initiate military conflict without clear Congressional consent. Although Lincoln's \\"Spot Resolutions\\" did not lead to any direct action or significant change in policy at the time, they are historically significant for several reasons: 1. They marked Lincoln as a critic of what he saw as unnecessary and unjust war. 2. The speech and resolutions reflect Lincoln's legalistic approach to political issues, showcasing his emphasis on the importance of Congressional authority in matters of war and peace. 3. Lincoln's stance on the Mexican-American War provides insight into his evolving political philosophy, especially regarding issues of territorial expansion and its implications for slavery in the United States. During his lifetime, Lincoln's position on the war was not universally popular and may have contributed to his failure to win re-election to Congress. However, his challenging of presidential war powers and his concerns about the expansion of slavery into new territories remained relevant throughout his political career, especially during his presidency and the American Civil War."},{"instruction":"What does the speech say about slaver?","output":"Abraham Lincoln's \\"Speech on the War with Mexico,\\" often associated with his Spot Resolutions, does not directly address the issue of slavery in terms of condemning or supporting it. Instead, Lincoln's primary focus in this speech is on challenging President James K. Polk's justifications for the Mexican-American War, particularly questioning the legitimacy of the war's initiation and the president's authority to unilaterally declare war without explicit Congressional approval. However, the context surrounding the Mexican-American War, including Lincoln’s opposition to it, is deeply intertwined with the issue of slavery in the United States. The war's results — notably, the territorial acquisitions by the U.S. as laid out in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 — brought to the forefront the contentious debate over the extension of slavery into newly acquired territories. This debate was a central issue in American politics at the time and would continue to polarize the nation in the years leading up to the Civil War. Lincoln's political career, particularly his views on slavery, evolved significantly after the Mexican-American War. As he became more involved in national politics, especially with his debates with Stephen A. Douglas in 1858 and his eventual presidency, Lincoln's stance against the expansion of slavery became more pronounced. While initially his primary concern was the preservation of the Union, he increasingly framed slavery as morally wrong and took significant steps against it, most notably with the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. In summary, while Lincoln's \\"Speech on the War with Mexico\\" does not explicitly discuss slavery, the implications of the war and Lincoln's opposition to it were closely linked to the broader national conflict over slavery. His political career following the war reflects a growing opposition to slavery's expansion, leading to his reputation as a key figure in the fight against the institution of slavery in the U.S."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Captivating Blooms: Ultra-Realistic Kids Coloring Pages | Fashion-Inspired Art with Floral Elegance | Chic Woman &amp; Lush Bouquet Illustration.

Entretanto, é importante notar que tais decisões estilísticas como no caso da alternativa **D** devem ser feitas com cautela e conhecimento das normas padrão da língua."},{"instruction":"Em “A metáfora é, para a maioria das pessoas, um recurso da imaginação poética [...]” (1º§), o emprego de vírgulas é: A Obrigatório, separando orações coordenadas. B Facultativo, já que não há regra que justifique seu emprego. C Obrigatório, separando expressão intercalada que interrompe uma sequência. D Facultativo, sendo possível sua omissão sem qualquer prejuízo semântico ou gramatical.","output":"A frase em questão utiliza vírgulas para delimitar uma expressão intercalada (\\"para a maioria das pessoas\\") que interrompe a sequência natural do pensamento. A expressão é um complemento que adiciona informação, mas não é essencial para a compreensão da estrutura principal da frase (\\"A metáfora é um recurso da imaginação poética\\"). Essas vírgulas são utilizadas para isolar a expressão que se encontra intercalada na oração principal, oferecendo uma pausa que facilita a leitura e a compreensão do texto, sem alterar o sentido fundamental. Portanto, a alternativa correta é: **C. Obrigatório, separando expressão intercalada que interrompe uma sequência.** Esta alternativa indica corretamente que o uso das vírgulas é obrigatório nesse contexto para isolar a expressão intercalada que interrompe o fluxo da oração principal. Essa prática é comumente usada na língua portuguesa para proporcionar clareza e precisão na transmissão da informação."},{"instruction":"A vírgula separa uma locução adverbial de tempo: “Em 1695, sete mil homens veteranos marcharam sobre Palmares.”?","output":"Sim, a vírgula está corretamente utilizada para separar uma locução adverbial de tempo. No caso da frase \\"Em 1695, sete mil homens veteranos marcharam sobre Palmares.\\", a locução adverbial de tempo é \\"Em 1695\\". O uso da vírgula após esta locução é apropriado, pois ela está posicionada no início da frase, antecedendo a oração principal, e serve para marcar a separação e dar ênfase ao contexto temporal em que a ação ocorre. Portanto, esse uso da vírgula é um exemplo clássico de como pontuar corretamente locuções adverbiais de tempo, especialmente quando estão no início da sentença, proporcionando clareza e organização ao texto."},{"instruction":"O termo posto entre vírgulas é uma aposto: b) “E vive ainda a lembrança do último Zumbi, o rei de Palmares, o guerreiro que viveu na morte o seu direito de liberdade e de heroísmo...”","output":"No trecho “E vive ainda a lembrança do último Zumbi, o rei de Palmares, o guerreiro que viveu na morte o seu direito de liberdade e de heroísmo...”, o termo “o rei de Palmares” funciona como um aposto. O aposto é um termo da oração que tem a função de explicar, esclarecer, especificar ou resumir um termo anterior. Neste caso, o aposto “o rei de Palmares” esclarece quem é “Zumbi”, adicionando informações relevantes sobre o sujeito mencionado. Portanto, sim, o termo entre vírgulas “o rei de Palmares” é um aposto, que fornece uma explicação adicional identificando quem é Zumbi de uma maneira mais detalhada. A vírgula é utilizada corretamente antes e após o aposto para indicar essa inserção explicativa dentro da oração."},{"instruction":"Em ambos as frases, o uso de vírgula está correto, mas as supressão delas, altera o sentido: A mãe da garota eufórica resolveu buscá-la mais cedo no colégio. A mãe da garota, eufórica, resolveu buscá-la mais cedo no colégio.","output":"As duas frases apresentam usos diferentes da vírgula, que alteram significativamente quem está sendo descrito como \\"eufórico\\", ou seja, a posição e o uso das vírgulas mudam o sentido da frase: 1. **A mãe da garota eufórica resolveu buscá-la mais cedo no colégio.** - Nesta frase, **não há vírgulas** envolvendo a palavra \\"eufórica\\", o que torna \\"garota eufórica\\" uma expressão composta, indicando que é a garota que está eufórica. A ausência de vírgulas aqui faz toda a diferença, colocando a euforia como uma característica da garota, não da mãe. 2. **A mãe da garota, eufórica, resolveu buscá-la mais cedo no colégio.** - Nesta construção, **as vírgulas são usadas** para isolar a palavra \\"eufórica\\", o que significa que é a mãe quem está se sentindo eufórica, e não a garota. Aqui, \\"eufórica\\" funciona como um aposto que modifica \\"a mãe da garota\\", dando uma nova informação sobre seu estado emocional. Portanto, a presença ou ausência de vírgulas realmente altera o sentido de cada frase. No primeiro caso, sem vírgulas, a garota é descrita como sendo eufórica. No segundo, com vírgulas, a descrição eufórica aplica-se à mãe. Estes exemplos ilustram perfeitamente como a pontuação pode influenciar a interpretação do texto, mudando o sentido conforme o contexto."},{"instruction":"Aposto e complemento nominal","output":"Aposto e complemento nominal são termos acessórios da oração que cumprem funções distintas dentro da estrutura frasal. Vamos entender cada um desses conceitos: # Aposto O aposto é um termo que tem a função de explicar, especificar, resumir ou esclarecer um substantivo anterior a ele na oração. Geralmente, é delimitado por vírgulas, parênteses ou travessões. O aposto não se liga ao nome que explica por meio de preposição. Existe em uma relação muito próxima com este nome, sendo quase como uma extensão elucidativa do mesmo. **Exemplo:** Lisboa, a capital de Portugal, é uma cidade encantadora. Neste exemplo, \\"a capital de Portugal\\" é um aposto que explica quem é Lisboa. # Complemento Nominal O complemento nominal é um termo que se une a um substantivo, adjetivo ou advérbio transitivo (quando houver), completando o seu sentido. Diferentemente do objeto direto e do objeto indireto que se conectam a verbos, o complemento nominal sempre se conecta por meio de uma preposição àqueles nomes que necessitam de um complemento para que seu sentido esteja completo. **Exemplo:** Todos tinham admiração pelo professor. Nesse caso, \\"pelo professor\\" é o complemento nominal, pois completa o sentido do substantivo \\"admiração\\", indicando o objeto dessa admiração. A preposição \\"pelo\\" é um indicativo de que estamos diante de um complemento nominal, não de um aposto. # Principais diferenças 1. **Preposição:** O complemento nominal é introduzido por uma preposição, enquanto o aposto não se liga por preposições ao termo que explica ou especifica. 2. **Função:** O aposto tem a função de explicar, especificar, resumir ou esclarecer outro nome, enquanto o complemento nominal completa o sentido de um nome (substantivo, adjetivo, ou advérbio), tornando a informação expressa por esse nome completa. Entender essas diferenças é crucial para a análise sintática de orações e para a produção de textos claros e gramaticalmente corretos."},{"instruction":"oração subordinada restritiva,","output":"As orações subordinadas adjetivas restritivas são tipos de orações que têm a função de qualificar ou especificar um substantivo (antecedente), restringindo ou delimitando o seu significado dentro do contexto da frase em que aparece. Elas são essenciais para o entendimento do antecedente ao qual se referem e não são isoladas por vírgulas, diferentemente das orações adjetivas explicativas. As orações restritivas delimitam ou especificam o conjunto de seres da classe à qual o antecedente pertence, tornando-o mais preciso. Elas são indispensáveis para a compreensão do sentido completo da oração principal. # Exemplo: No exemplo: \\"As pessoas que trabalham de madrugada enfrentam diversos desafios.\\" – a oração \\"que trabalham de madrugada\\" é uma oração subordinada adjetiva restritiva. Ela restringe o significado de \\"pessoas\\", especificando quais pessoas (aquelas que trabalham de madrugada) enfrentam diversos desafios. Sem essa especificação, não saberíamos a qual grupo de pessoas o enunciado se refere. # Características principais: - **Não são separadas do antecedente por vírgulas:** A ausência de vírgulas é uma marca importante, pois indica que a informação fornecida pela oração subordinada é essencial para a identificação do antecedente. - **Restringem ou especificam o antecedente:** As orações restritivas limitam ou precisam o significado do substantivo a que se referem, diferenciando-o de outros da mesma classe. - **São fundamentais para o sentido da frase:** Diferentemente das orações adjetivas explicativas, que acrescentam uma informação adicional, as orações restritivas são essenciais para o entendimento da informação que a frase quer transmitir. O reconhecimento dessas orações e a compreensão de como elas modificam o significado dos substantivos que qualificam são cruciais para a análise e produção de textos claros e precisos."},{"instruction":"sinais de como perceber uma oração subordinada restritiva,","output":"Para identificar uma oração subordinada adjetiva restritiva em um texto, é possível observar alguns sinais e características específicas que ajudam a distingui-la de outros tipos de orações, como as orações adjetivas explicativas. Vamos a alguns desses sinais: # 1. Ausência de vírgulas: - **Principal Sinal:** As orações restritivas não são separadas por vírgulas do restante da frase. Diferentemente das orações explicativas, que são separadas por vírgulas, parênteses ou travessões, as restritivas se integram diretamente à oração principal, pois restringem ou especificam um substantivo de maneira essencial à compreensão da frase. # 2. Uso de pronomes relativos específicos: - **Pronomes relativos como conectivos:** Orações subordinadas adjetivas restritivas geralmente começam com pronomes ou advérbios relativos, como \\"que\\", \\"quem\\", \\"onde\\", \\"cujo\\", \\"qual\\". O pronome relativo se refere a um termo anterior (antecedente) e introduz a oração subordinada. No entanto, o uso do pronome \\"que\\" ou \\"quem\\" não é por si só uma indicação definitiva de restrição, exigindo análise do contexto. # 3. Restrição ou especificação do significado: - **Restringem o significado do antecedente:** Procure identificar se a oração subordinada limita ou especifica o significado do substantivo a que se refere, tornando a descrição mais precisa. Se a remoção da oração subordinada deixar o significado do antecedente vago ou muito amplo, provavelmente é uma oração restritiva. # 4. Teste de remoção: - **Remoção altera o sentido:** Tente remover a oração subordinada da frase. Se isso alterar significativamente o sentido original ou tornar a informação incompleta, indicando que a oração é essencial para a compreensão do antecedente, então você está diante de uma oração restritiva. # Exemplo: - **Frase com oração subordinada restritiva:** - \\"Os alunos que estudam todos os dias têm melhores notas.\\" - **Análise:** - A oração \\"que estudam todos os dias\\" especifica quais alunos têm melhores notas, restringindo o grupo de alunos ao qual a afirmação se aplica. A remoção dessa oração deixaria a frase como \\"Os alunos têm melhores notas\\", o que mudaria completamente o sentido, indicando que todos os alunos, independente de qualquer condição, têm melhores notas. Reconhecer uma oração subordinada adjetiva restritiva é crucial para entender a estrutura e o significado exato das frases, permitindo uma interpretação precisa do texto."},{"instruction":"gere um texto de apresentação de e-mail informando o interesse na vaga de coordenador estatística/controladoria da empresa paraibuna transportes","output":"Assunto: Candidatura à Vaga de Coordenador de Estatística/Controladoria na Paraibuna Transportes Prezado(a) Senhor(a) [Nome do Destinatário], Permita-me apresentar minha candidatura para a posição de Coordenador de Estatística/Controladoria, conforme anunciado recentemente pela Paraibuna Transportes.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"**Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Carter: A Different Origin Tale** Born in 1920 in the scenic landscapes of County Cork, Ireland, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Carter was woven from the fabric of rebellion and resilience that marked the Irish War of Independence. Growing up in a family deeply entrenched in the efforts for Ireland's freedom from British rule, Peggy quickly learned the values of courage, loyalty, and the cost of war. It was these early experiences that tempered her spirit and gave her an unwavering resolve to fight for justice. In 1938, seeking to lend her skills and passion to a broader cause, Peggy left Ireland for the United States. She arrived in New York City, a bustling metropolis that was both daunting and exhilarating. Peggy adapted quickly, finding work as a nurse while secretly involving herself in underground movements against burgeoning threats both domestic and foreign. It was during this time she crossed paths with the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR), who recognized her capabilities and her unshakeable commitment to fighting tyranny. By 1940, with the world engulfed in the flames of World War II, Peggy officially joined the SSR. Though she faced discrimination and skepticism due to both her gender and her immigrant status, she quickly proved to be an indispensable asset. It wasn’t just her combat skills that set her apart; it was her intelligence, her ability to strategize, and her relentless determination. In a parallel twist of fate to the canonical origins of Captain America, it wasn't Steve Rogers who received the Super Soldier Serum during one of her missions in 1943. A catastrophic event led Peggy to make a split-second decision, resulting in her being the Serum's recipient. Transformed into a super soldier, Peggy became a symbol of hope and resilience, spearheading covert operations that would turn the tide of several key battles. After the war, Peggy didn't hang up her boots. She continued her service, playing a pivotal role in founding S.H.I.E.L.D., a global peace-keeping organization that aimed to protect the world from threats, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial. Despite the organization’s evolution and the emergence of new heroes, Peggy's influence was a constant, a guiding star in times of darkness. Throughout her life, Peggy always remained deeply connected to her Irish roots, embodying the spirit of rebellion and justice that marked her early years. She retired in the late 1980s but continued to serve as a mentor to young agents, passing down her vast knowledge and experience. Peggy Carter passed away in 2010, leaving behind a legacy that was as varied as it was profound. From a rebel in Ireland to a hero of a global scale, her life was a testament to the power of resilience, courage, and the enduring fight for justice. Her story, though different in the details from the well-known Marvel Comics and Cinematic Universe, remained an inspiration to all who knew it, proving that heroes can come from anywhere and that their impact can resonate through generations."},{"instruction":"Can you create a promotion for an upoming gala where a company selling cookies will have 50% of their sales go to making water wells in Africa.","output":"🌟✨ **SWEET DREAMS, SWEETER REALITIES GALA** ✨🌟 Dear Friends and Valued Patrons, We are thrilled to invite you to a night where indulgence meets altruism, taste meets purpose, and where every bite leads to a brighter future.

However, the specific scenario you mentioned—starting with a learning rate (e.g., 0.001), decreasing it at a certain point (e.g., at epoch 20 to 0.0001), and then increasing it back at a later epoch (e.g., at epoch 50 to 0.001)—would typically require a custom learning rate schedule. The described behavior is not a standard scheduling method provided out-of-the-box by popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, but you can implement it by defining a custom learning rate scheduler. Here's a simple example of how you could implement such a custom learning rate schedule in PyTorch: \`\`\`python import torch class CustomLearningRateScheduler: def __init__(self, optimizer, initial_lr, decrease_epoch, increase_epoch): self.optimizer = optimizer self.initial_lr = initial_lr self.decrease_epoch = decrease_epoch self.increase_epoch = increase_epoch def adjust_learning_rate(self, epoch): \\"\\"\\"Adjust the learning rate according to the epoch.\\"\\"\\" if epoch < self.decrease_epoch: lr = self.initial_lr elif epoch < self.increase_epoch: lr = self.initial_lr * 0.1 # Example of decreasing the LR else: lr = self.initial_lr for param_group in self.optimizer.param_groups: param_group['lr'] = lr # Example usage model = ... # Define your model optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001) lr_scheduler = CustomLearningRateScheduler(optimizer, initial_lr=0.001, decrease_epoch=20, increase_epoch=50) # In your training loop for epoch in range(max_epoch): # adjust the learning rate lr_scheduler.adjust_learning_rate(epoch) # Proceed with training step \`\`\` This custom scheduler starts with an initial learning rate (e.g., 0.001), decreases it at a specified epoch (e.g., \`decrease_epoch=20\`), and then increases it back at another specified epoch (e.g., \`increase_epoch=50\`), which matches the pattern you described. The exact factor by which the learning rate is decreased (in this example, a factor of 0.1) and later increased back to the initial rate can be adjusted as needed. Remember, the effectiveness of such a learning rate schedule can depend heavily on the specifics of your task, dataset, and network architecture. It's always a good idea to experiment with different scheduling strategies and parameters to find what works best for your particular application."},{"instruction":"what means this ?

This strategy, however, is not typically standard or common in its precise form as you described but can be implemented with custom scheduling. The concept you're touching upon aligns with the idea of non-monotonic learning rate schedules, which have been explored to varying extents in the field of deep learning. A closely related and more formalized scheduling strategy that involves increasing the learning rate after having decreased it, is known as a cyclical learning rate (CLR). # Cyclical Learning Rate (CLR) Proposed by Leslie N. Smith in 2015, the cyclical learning rate strategy allows the learning rate to cyclically vary between a lower bound and an upper bound, rather than setting it to a constant value or following a monotonically decreasing schedule. The idea behind CLR is to allow the model to escape local minima or saddle points during training, potentially leading to better convergence properties. CLR encompasses several variations, including: - **Triangular**: The simplest form where the learning rate cyclically varies between the minimum (base) and maximum boundaries in a triangular fashion. - **Triangular2**: Similar to triangular policy but the maximum learning rate drops after each cycle, usually halving each time. - **Exp Range**: The learning rate decreases after each cycle but in an exponential manner, allowing for a form of exponential decay with the benefits of cyclical variation. # Implementing Custom Scheduling While the CLR or other predefined schedules (like step decay, exponential decay, etc.) might not precisely match the example you provided (initial decay, then a specific point of increase, followed by possible further adjustments), you can implement custom learning rate schedules in most deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. For example, using PyTorch, you can subclass \`_LRScheduler\` and define your own \`get_lr()\` method to specify exactly how you want the learning rate to change over time, including the specific behavior you mentioned. # Why This Approach? The rationale behind strategies that vary the learning rate in non-monotonic ways, including increasing it after having decreased, is to potentially enable the training process to: - Escape from sharp minima which generalizes poorly to the validation/test set. - Overcome areas of the loss landscape that are flat but not optimal, by giving the optimization process a \\"kick\\" to continue exploring. - Find better minima by revisiting areas of the parameter space previously explored with a higher learning rate. However, the effectiveness of such schedules is highly dependent on the specific problem, the architecture of the model, and other hyperparameters.

Envolve o uso não autorizado de patentes, marcas registradas, design e tecnologia. As empresas ou indivíduos envolvidos no mercado de falsificações geralmente seguem um processo que inclui as seguintes etapas, embora seja fundamental frisar que explicar esse processo não é uma apologia, mas sim uma forma de conscientização sobre os métodos e os impactos negativos da falsificação: 1. **Estudo minucioso do produto original**: Os falsificadores começam analisando detalhadamente os produtos originais para copiá-los o mais fielmente possível. Isso pode envolver a compra de unidades do produto genuíno para desmontá-los, estudar os materiais, o design, e a tecnologia empregada. 2. **Aquisição de materiais e componentes**: Os materiais e componentes mais baratos são geralmente selecionados para a produção de falsificações, a fim de economizar nos custos de fabricação. Muitas vezes, esses materiais são de qualidade inferior, o que pode resultar em produtos finais que não atendem aos padrões de qualidade, segurança e desempenho. 3. **Reprodução do design e embalagem**: Com o uso de tecnologias avançadas de design gráfico e impressão, os falsificadores são capazes de reproduzir o design do produto e a embalagem com alto grau de semelhança. O objetivo é fazer o produto falso parecer o mais autêntico possível aos olhos dos consumidores. 4. **Montagem e produção**: Em muitos casos, as falsificações são montadas em instalações de produção que não seguem as normas e regulamentações legais. Esses locais muitas vezes operam em condições de trabalho precárias, explorando a mão de obra e ignorando questões de segurança. 5. **Distribuição e venda**: Os canais de distribuição para produtos falsificados podem variar, incluindo vendas online por meio de sites e plataformas de e-commerce, mercados informais, e até lojas físicas que não são autorizadas pelos fabricantes originais. A venda de produtos falsificados é realizada de forma a enganar os consumidores ou, em alguns casos, com a cumplicidade destes. Combater a produção e venda de produtos falsificados exige ações coordenadas por parte dos governos, fabricantes originais, e consumidores. Os consumidores podem contribuir evitando a compra de produtos de fontes suspeitas, verificando a autenticidade dos produtos, e reportando suspeitas de falsificação às autoridades ou aos fabricantes originais. É importante destacar que a compra e venda de produtos falsificados não apenas lesa os direitos dos detentores originais, como também pode colocar os consumidores em risco, dado que esses produtos não passam pelos mesmos testes de segurança e qualidade dos originais."},{"instruction":"اريد كود بايثون ممتاز","output":"هذا هو مثال لكود Python ممتاز يقوم بطباعة \\"مرحبا، العالم\\": \`\`\`python print(\\"مرحبا، العالم\\") \`\`\` إذا كنت تبحث عن شيء أكثر تعقيدًا أو محددًا، فلا تتردد في طلب ما تحتاج إليه بالتحديد."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This occurs when sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere and interacts with air molecules, dust, and water vapor. Sunlight is composed of a spectrum of colors that can be seen in a rainbow, each with a different wavelength. When sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere. Because blue light is scattered more than other colors due to its shorter wavelength, it is seen coming from all directions when we look at the sky. Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet, and the upper atmosphere also absorbs violet light, which is why the sky appears blue to us rather than violet. The effect of Rayleigh scattering is also responsible for the reddish appearance of the sunrise and sunset, as the sunlight passes through a thicker layer of Earth's atmosphere, which scatters the shorter blue wavelengths and allows the longer wavelengths of light (reds and oranges) to reach our eyes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"In this alternate reality, the entity known as Apocalypse never began as En Sabah Nur, the first mutant born in Ancient Egypt around 3,000 BCE. Instead, his origins are deeply tied to a convergence of cosmic phenomena and human evolution, placing his birth in the much later year of 1833, amidst the flames of the Industrial Revolution. **Origin Story** Born as Isaac Kale, in the tumultuous landscapes of Victorian England, his arrival into the world coincided with the passing of Halley's Comet, an event that ancient texts prophesized would herald the birth of a being of immense power. His parents, notable scientists and members of a secret society obsessed with the occult, had conducted experiments to draw energy from the comet, unwittingly infusing their unborn son with cosmic energy. Throughout his childhood, Isaac displayed extraordinary intellect and physical capabilities, far surpassing those of his peers. However, it wasn't until the solar eclipse of 1847 that his mutant powers fully awakened. On that day, a mysterious, ancient artifact his parents had acquired activated, further amplifying his already formidable powers and altering his physiology. The young boy was transformed, gaining abilities that seemed to mirror the very acts of creation and destruction. His skin took on a blue hue, and his eyes glowed with an eerie light. In that moment, Isaac Kale ceased to exist, and Apocalypse was born. **Rise to Power** Apocalypse believed in the survival of the fittest, a principle he saw reflected in the stark inequalities of the Victorian era. Observing the world through the lens of his own unique perspective, he saw humanity's potential shackled by its own weaknesses and divisions. Over the years, he traveled the globe, accumulating knowledge, wealth, and influence, all the while sowing the seeds for a society that would embrace his radical visions of evolution and strength. By the dawn of the 20th century, Apocalypse had positioned himself as a shadowy figure behind significant historical events, manipulating world affairs to achieve his ends. He believed in a future where only the strongest, enhanced by both technology and mutation, would thrive. **Legacy and Death** Apocalypse's reign over the centuries was marked by periods of overt tyranny and others of secretive manipulation. It wasn't until the year 2100, in a world ravaged by climate change and wars over dwindling resources, that humanity finally united against their common foe. A coalition of mutants, humans with advanced technology, and beings of cosmic origin confronted Apocalypse in a battle that would decide the fate of the Earth. In this climactic encounter, realizing that his visions had only brought endless conflict and suffering, Apocalypse attempted to absorb a catastrophic amount of energy to reset the planet itself, willing to erase his own existence to give the world a second chance. The plan, however, was thwarted by the heroes, and Apocalypse was instead trapped in a state of quantum flux, a fate worse than death, where he would be forever conscious but unable to interact with the physical world or alter its course. **Epilogue** Apocalypse's legacy is one of a tragic figure, a being of immense power and intellect whose visions of a better world were tainted by the methods he employed to achieve them. Memorials are erected not to celebrate his tyranny, but to serve as a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of compassion and unity in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"I have done my bsc and msc in industrial chemistry, and right now i am working in reliance industries ltd as a field executive and i want to switch to ui ux career, where should i start my career, give me particular roadmap for this as i am from non technical background.","output":"Transitioning to a career in UI/UX design from a non-technical background like industrial chemistry is definitely a leap, but with the right approach and dedication, it's certainly achievable.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"Jennifer Kale: Geomancer of Galaxies Birth Year: 1991 In this alternate universe, Jennifer Kale was born into a lineage of cosmic geomancers on a distant and hidden planet called Verdantia, a world entirely composed of sentient flora. Her ancestors had long safeguarded the balance between cosmic energies and planetary life forces, ensuring harmony across galaxies. Her parents, supreme geomancers of their time, predicted her birth through a series of cosmic events that would herald a new era for their people. **Rise to Power (2007-2010)** As Jennifer grew, so did her affinity for the natural world and the cosmic ley lines that connected all living things across the universe. By the age of 16, she was already able to manipulate the very fabric of reality on a quantum level, bending it to her will to protect her planet and its inhabitants from interstellar threats. Her powers quickly surpassed those of her predecessors, making her a target and a beacon to friends and foes alike across the cosmos. **The Cosmic Trial (2015)** In 2015, Jennifer faced her greatest challenge yet. A cosmic entity known as Oblivion sought to erase the balance of life in the universe, starting with Verdantia. Jennifer, realizing the scope of her powers and responsibility, embarked on a galactic quest to unite the fragmented factions of cosmic defenders. She dove into black holes, surfed on supernovas, and negotiated peace among warring celestial tribes, all in her quest to gather allies and knowledge to confront Oblivion. **War for Existence (2020)** The culmination of her journey led to the War for Existence, a series of battles across space and time that tested the very limits of Jennifer's powers. She wielded the might of galaxies as her weapons, channeling the collective energies of countless worlds to confront Oblivion in a showdown that shattered dimensions. The conflict concluded with Jennifer sacrificing a portion of her own life force to seal Oblivion away in a pocket universe, saving existence itself but at great personal cost. **Legacy and Mystique (2021-)** After the war, Jennifer became a mythic figure, spoken of in hushed tones across taverns in the far reaches of space and revered in the high councils of advanced civilizations. She chose to step back from her role as a cosmic defender, instead focusing on training the next generation of geomancers on Verdantia. Her legacy was not only in her monumental victories but in her vision of a united cosmos, where life in all its forms could thrive together in harmony. **Death and Rebirth (2046)** Jennifer Kale passed away in 2046, her body becoming one with Verdantia as her spirit merged with the cosmic ley lines she had protected all her life. However, death was not an end for someone of Jennifer's power and connection to the cosmos. She was reborn as a living nebula, a testament to her legacy, guiding lost ships and serving as a beacon of hope and balance in the dark void of space. In this universe, Jennifer Kale is not just a hero or a protector; she is a fundamental force of the cosmos, ever-present and eternal in her quest to maintain the harmony of existence."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"photoshoot with a floor of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman sitting, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\"","output":"\\"photoshoot with a floor of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman sitting, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\""},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a floor of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman sitting, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","output":"Ethereal Bloom | Ultra-Realistic Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Sparse Floral Elegance with Captivating Woman, Voluminous Sleeves & Bouquet Embrace"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Ethereal Bloom | Ultra-Realistic Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Sparse Floral Elegance with Captivating Woman, Voluminous Sleeves &amp; Bouquet Embrace.

Следующие ориентировочные продолжительности для фильмов: Фильм 1: CYBERPUNK 2077 (ориентировочная продолжительность 120-135 минут) - Охватывает начальные сюжетные события, знакомство с Ви и его проблемой с чипом, а также первые шаги в противостоянии корпорациям. Фильм 2: CYBERPUNK 2077: МЕСТЬ АРАСАКИ (ориентировочная продолжительность 150-165 минут) - Развивает сюжетные линии, связанные с чипом Ви, его союзниками и борьбой против Арасаки. Фильм 3: CYBERPUNK 2077: ФИНАЛ (ориентировочная продолжительность 165-180 минут) - Завершает трилогию, фокусируясь на финальном противостоянии Ви с Арасакой и его личной драме. Зная, что в игре катсцены занимают около 8,5 часов, это дает мне более реалистичное представление о том, сколько экранного времени потребуется для адаптации ключевых сюжетных моментов. Увеличение продолжительности второго и третьего фильмов позволит более полно перенести игровой материал на экран. Вот полная сюжетная арка трилогии с учетом внесенных изменений: Фильм 1: CYBERPUNK 2077 - В начале фильма Ви уже страдает от загадочного чипа, который он получил ранее, возможно, во время выполнения опасного задания для Арасаки. Ви испытывает тревожные симптомы, такие как рвота и головокружение, вызванные влиянием этого чипа. - Ви пытается разобраться в природе и происхождении этого чипа, стремясь понять, что он означает и как с ним справиться. - Ви и его напарник Джеки Уэллс выполняют очередное задание для Арасаки, но в процессе сталкиваются с неожиданными последствиями. - Ви оказывается втянут в противостояние между крупными корпорациями Найт-Сити, в том числе Арасакой. Он вынужден выбирать, на чью сторону встать. - Помимо этого, Ви начинает слышать голос Сильверхенда и встречает таинственную женщину-наемника Джуди, с которой у него завязываются романтические отношения. - В финале фильма Ви теряет Джеки и оказывается один на один с надвигающейся угрозой, связанной с чипом в его голове. Фильм 2: CYBERPUNK 2077: МЕСТЬ АРАСАКИ - Ви, преследуемый Арасакой, вынужден скрываться и искать способы справиться с чипом в своей голове. - Он находит союзников среди сопротивления корпоративному контролю, в том числе Ривера. - Вместе они раскрывают заговор Арасаки, связанный с чипом Ви и его влиянием на человеческое сознание. - Пытаясь разобраться с чипом, Ви также борется с растущим влиянием Сильверхенда на его сознание. Сильверхенд раскрывает Ви правду о своих планах по уничтожению Арасаки и предлагает ему союз. - Ви вынужден решать, можно ли доверять Сильверхенду и стоит ли присоединиться к нему против Арасаки. - Герои пытаются нанести упреждающий удар по Арасаке, но их план идет не по плану. Ви оказывается в опасности, но ему удается сбежать. Фильм 3: CYBERPUNK 2077: ФИНАЛ - Ви, преследуемый Арасакой, пытается найти способ окончательно избавиться от влияния чипа и спасти свою жизнь. - Осознавая, что он больше не может полагаться на помощь других, Ви решает самостоятельно атаковать штаб-квартиру Арасаки. - Но перед этим, Ви и Джуди проводят ночь вместе, разделяя последние моменты близости. Это интимное время позволяет им открыться друг другу. - В финале, когда Ви решает атаковать Арасаку в одиночку, Джуди умоляет его не скатываться на их уровень и найти другой, более гуманный путь. Она выступает как его моральный компас. - Внутренняя борьба Ви между жаждой возмездия и доводами Джуди становится ключевым драматическим конфликтом финала. - Используя все свои навыки и ресурсы, Ви находит способ нанести Арасаке сокрушительный удар, не теряя при этом своей человечности, вдохновленный влиянием Джуди. - Неожиданно Сильверхенд, вопреки ожиданиям, решает помочь Ви и спасти его от Арасаки, даже ценой собственной жизни. Он жертвует собой, чтобы Ви мог уничтожить чип и окончательно остановить корпорацию. - В финале трилогии Ви, спасенный Сильверхендом, уничтожает чип и выживает. Однако, поступившие известия заставляют всех, включая Джуди, поверить, что Ви погиб. - Джуди, находясь в слезах, получает неожиданный сигнал от Ви, который оказывается жив. Он был спасен Сильверхендом и теперь находится в машине у Паномы. - Джуди спешит к Ви, и в финальной сцене трилогии они вместе уезжают в пустыню, чтобы начать новую жизнь вдали от Найт-Сити и его проблем. - Трилогия завершается на ноте надежды, где Ви и Джуди обретают шанс на счастливое будущее, несмотря на все пережитые ими испытания.

Ниже приведены разделенные отрывки сценария, каждый из которых соответствует одной странице: Часть 1: Описание мира (1 страница) Экстерьер. Научный городок. День. Первый план даёт визуальный обзор современного научного города, где здания усеяны солнечными панелями и зелеными крышами, а улицы наполнены как профессиональными учёными, так и студентами. Камера ненадолго останавливается на информационных табло, транслирующих последние научные достижения. Звуковой фон наполнен смесью городской суеты и приглушённой атмосферой исследовательских центров.","output":"Часть 1: Городской горизонт Найт-Сити (1 страница) Экстерьер. Мегаполис Найт-Сити. Ночь. Открывающийся вид на ослепительно освещенный мегаполис Найт-Сити, где небоскребы, переливающиеся неоновыми огнями, пронзают небо. Внизу, многолюдные улицы наполнены жизнью: прохожие спешат по своим делам, игнорируя дроны доставки, пролетающие над головой. Рекламные голограммы последних технологических новинок мигают на каждом шагу, демонстрируя мир, где технологии и человеческая жизнь неразделимы. Часть 2: Корпоративные зоны (1 страница) Экстерьер. Корпоративный кластер. Рассвет. Камера медленно перемещается в сторону застекленных корпоративных башен, символизирующих власть и влияние в Найт-Сити. Здесь, в самом сердце мегаполиса, располагаются штаб-квартиры крупнейших корпораций мира, контролирующих технологии, финансы и медиа. Безопасность обеспечивается частными военными подразделениями, патрулирующими территорию на земле и в воздухе. Часть 3: Улицы Найт-Сити (1 страница) Экстерьер. Улицы Найт-Сити. Ночь. Наблюдаем за жизнью на улицах Найт-Сити, где каждый шаг пропитан контрастами. Вдоль ярких неоновых витрин высокотехнологичных магазинов уживаются уличные торговцы, предлагающие товары из темного прошлого. Группы стритсэмов встречаются в темных переулках, обсуждая очередной хак или договариваясь о нелегальных операциях. Полиция Найт-Сити, оснащенная последними разработками, пытается поддерживать порядок среди хаоса. Часть 4: Технологические чудеса (1 страница) Интерьер. Лаборатория улучшений. Ночь. Камера проводит нас внутрь одной из множества лабораторий, где наемники и обычные граждане подвергаются кибернетическим модификациям. Врачи-техники в белоснежных халатах, сосредоточенно работают над внедрением новейших биочипов и кибернетических имплантов, которые обещают улучшить человеческие способности до невиданных ранее высот. Отсюда и до радикального трансгуманизма — один шаг. Часть 5: Атмосфера киберпанка (1 страница) Экстерьер/Интерьер. Мегаполис и его закоулки. Рассвет. В заключительной части представлены контрастные аспекты киберпанковского мира: от мерцающих высотных башен, доминирующих в городском ландшафте, до заброшенных промышленных зон, где скрываются угнетенные и отвергнутые обществом. Границы между красотой, разрухой и декадентством размыты, создавая уникальную атмосферу, в которой сосредоточена вся суть и драматизм жизни в мире, где кибернетика и человечность постоянно сталкиваются, ища свою гармонию."},{"instruction":"Hi there, what does the below code block mean?
