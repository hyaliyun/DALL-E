Before her is food sufficient for three adults, not just one. She is totally oblivious as an automatic pistol, held by a gloved hand, takes direct aim at her. The hand pulls the trigger--and out shoots a harmless water jet that sprays all over her face. Taking off her glasses, Regina looks at young Jean-Louis Gaudet (Thomas Chelimsky), age 8, who suddenly looks very guilty. \\"Don't tell me,\\" says Reggie, \\"you didn't know it was loaded.\\"She calls out for her friend, Sylvie Gaudet (Dominique Minot), who sends the boy to find some other place to play while she helps Reggie to dry off.

The two stroll through the resort as Reggie says that she is frustrated with Charles' incessant secrecy and lies. Sylvie, a \\"modern woman\\" to the core, suggests that Reggie simply have affairs on her husband's money, but Reggie doesn't think that way.Just then a dapper gentleman (Cary Grant) approaches, with Jean-Louis in tow, saying that Jean-Louis was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.

The user interface is also clean and easy to navigate, which definitely helps when I'm looking for something specific. However, there are some areas where the app falls short. The search functionality could be improved; sometimes it takes multiple attempts to find the game I'm looking for due to the app not loading the search results properly. I've also encountered some performance issues and occasional crashes that can be quite frustrating, especially when I'm in the middle of adding a game to my collection or reading reviews. The app's integration with the BoardGameGeek website could be more seamless as well. There are times where I have to switch between the app and the website to see all the information I need about a game, which is not very convenient given that they should serve the same purpose.

Question: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.

Question: Which happened earlier, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration or the declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster? Context: The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.

A black hole is created when a large star burns out. Like our sun, stars are unbelievably hot furnaces   that burn their own matter as fuel. When most of the fuel is used up, the star begins to die. The death of a star is not a quiet event. First there is a huge explosion. As its outer layer is blasted off into space, the dying star shines as brightly as a billion suns. After the explosion gravity pulls in what's left of the star. As the outside of the star sinks toward the center, the star gets smaller and smaller. The material the star is made of becomes tightly packed together. A star is so dense that a teaspoon of matter from it weighs billion of pounds. The more the star shrinks, the stronger the gravity inside it becomes. Soon the star is very tiny, and the gravity pulling it in is unbelievably strong. In fact, the gravity is so strong that it even pulls light into the star! Since all the light is pulled in, none can go out. The star becomes black when there is no light. Then a black hole is born! That's what we know about black holes. What we don't know is this: What happens inside a black hole after the star has been squeezed into a tiny ball? Does it keep getting smaller and smaller forever? Such a possibility is hard to imagine. But if the black hole doesn't keep shrinking, what happens to it? Some scientists think black holes are like doorways to another world. They say that as the star disappears from our universe, it goes into another universe. In other words a black hole in our universe could turn into a \\"white hole\\" in a different universe. As the black hole swallows light, the white hole shines brightly--somewhere else. But where? A different place, perhaps, or a different time -- many years in the past or future. Could you travel through a black hole? Right now, no. Nothing we know of could go into a black hole without being crushed. So far the time being, black hole must remain a mystery.

Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near Ãksfjord. The cabin is owned by Sara, Vegard's girlfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by StandartenfÃ¼hrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog and Michael Schwab, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream.

If the surfers are waiting to catch a wave, it implies that they are already in the ocean with their surfboards and are likely to be sitting or lying on them in the meantime.    b. The premise specifically states that they are in a \\"calm ocean.\\" Since surfers often wait for waves in relatively calm water just before the waves build up, it is possible that the ocean is calm at that moment. 4.

In July, he said Mrs Clinton had been careless but not criminal in handling sensitive material on her private email server while secretary of state. The issue flared up again with the discovery of new \\"pertinent\\" emails. They were reportedly found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of the Democratic presidential candidate's closest advisers. Mr Comey's letter to Congress late last month, revealing the bureau's inquiry into Mrs Clinton's emails had been revived, shook up the White House race and reinvigorated the campaign of Republican nominee Donald Trump. It was much ado about nothing, but it certainly amounted to something. While FBI Director James Comey, in effect, said \\"never mind\\" with regards to Hillary Clinton's emails, for the past two weeks the story has dominated the political conversation, and Democrats have paid a price. While Mrs Clinton's presidential hopes have stabilised, talk of a possible rout - and sweeping down-ballot victories in congressional races - are a distant memory. Mrs Clinton will now try to focus on her closing campaign message. Donald Trump almost certainly will continue to accuse his opponent of corruption and, perhaps, again allege the FBI is covering for her. With only two days until voting, the dust kicked up by this story won't have fully settled by the time Americans head to the polls. Once this election is over, there should be serious soul-searching within the FBI and the media about how this saga played out. The nation's top law-enforcement agency was a source of constant leaks, as internal disputes spilled into public view. If Mr Trump wins, many on the left will blame Mr Comey for the result. If Mrs Clinton prevails, she likely will bear a lasting grudge over this political near-miss. How FBI email verdict affects election The FBI director had announced that the agency would investigate if the newly discovered messages contained classified information. But in Sunday's follow-up, Mr Comey wrote: \\"Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation. \\"During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State. \\"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\\" On board the candidate's campaign airplane, her team said they were always confident of the outcome. Communications director Jennifer Palmieri told media: \\"We're glad this matter has been resolved.\\" But the Trump team cried foul. Newt Gingrich, an adviser to the Republican nominee, tweeted: \\"Comey must be under enormous political pressure to cave like this and announce something he cant [sic] possibly know.\\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted: \\"If FBI conclusions remain unchanged, that means she still was reckless & careless, still lied about classified info, lied re: # of devices.\\" Campaigning in Minnesota on Sunday, Mr Trump made no mention of Mr Comey's findings. But he did say Mrs Clinton \\"will be under investigation for a long, long time, likely concluding in a criminal trial\\". He also renewed his claims that the Democrat was being \\"protected by a rigged system\\". The FBI has already established Mrs Clinton had classified information on a private email server that was run out of her upstate New York home. Mr Comey said in July that her handling of sensitive material during her 2009-13 tenure as secretary of state was \\"extremely careless\\", but cleared her of criminal wrongdoing. The revelation that she handled sensitive information while breaking federal rules by running her own email server has dogged her campaign since last year. A new NBC/Wall St Journal opinion poll on Sunday before news broke of the FBI letter suggested a four-point lead for Mrs Clinton. The latest Washington Post/ABC tracking poll put her lead at five points. Sunday's campaign stops take her to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Also on Mr Trump's itinerary were Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Who is ahead in the polls? 48% Hillary Clinton 44% Donald Trump Last updated November 8, 2016 Who will win?

Country singer Billy Ray Cyrus honored a Nevada teacher killed by a 12-year-old student in a schoolyard shooting last year, calling him a 'true American hero.' Cyrus praised Michael Landsberry and presented a memorial plaque to his widow, Sharon, during a concert Saturday night in Incline Village, a Nevada community on north shore of Lake Tahoe. Police say Landsberry, a 45-year-old ex-Marine, tried to talk the shooter, 12-year-old Jose Reyes, into turning over the handgun before he was shot in the chest Oct. 21 at a middle school in the Reno suburb of Sparks. The student wounded two classmates before taking his life. Hero: Billy Ray Cyrus meets with the widow of Michael Landsberry, whom the country star lauded as a hero on Saturday. 'Tonight we are here to honor a true American hero,' Cyrus told a crowd of over 1,000. 'Michael Landsberry made the ultimate sacrifice to save his students after serving three terms in Afghanistan.' Cyrus said Landsberry also represented the courage of the Vietnam veteran honored in his patriotic song, Some Gave All. With a large photograph of Landsberry in the background and the math teacher's widow on stage, Cyrus led the crowd in singing the song. Cyrus said he was moved by the story of Landsberry's actions in the school shooting and decided to recognize him when offered a chance to perform at Lake Tahoe. He and his father, Ronald Ray Cyrus, made similar presentations honoring American heroes for more than a decade, and this marked the first time the country star has done so since his father's 2006 death. 'Just about every year, my dad and I would find an unsung hero and present them with a Some Gave All' award,' he told The Associated Press. 'I kind of play everything by ear, and I thought sometime when the time is right, I would love to recognize the sacrifice Michael made,' he continued. Marine: Landsberry, a former Marine, tried to get Jose Reyes to put the gun down before the 12-year-old killer fatally shot him. Sharon Landsberry thanked Cyrus and said his tribute moved her and their two daughters, Alisa Cook, 25, and Andrea Cook, 18. Alisa Cook also attended the concert, while Andrea Cook offered a videotaped message from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, where she serves in the Marines. 'We all love him today. ... He lives within all of us,' Sharon Landsberry said of her husband. Cyrus, who rose to fame in 1992 with the hit song Achy Breaky Heart, also gave her a 'financial gift.' The amount was not disclosed. Interviews with Reyes' parents, teachers and classmates and the boy's own writings paint a portrait of a child troubled by depression and feelings of inadequacy at home and tormented by a school life in which he was mocked, teased and mistreated. Some warning signs were there. His father had taken him to a psychotherapist just three days before the shooting and the doctor proscribed an antidepressant after the boy told of being teased at school, called 'gay' and accused of peeing in his pants. His mother had done research on autism after Jose showed signs of it. 'True American hero': Cyrus mentioned Landsberry's three tours in Afghanistan when honoring the 'true American hero' A look at his phone and his video viewing habits was more troubling. In addition to phone images of the two teens who committed suicide after killing 13 at Colorado's Columbine High School in 1999, Sparks Police Chief Brian Allen said Tuesday investigators found searches on the Reyes family laptop in both July and October for 'Super Columbine Massacre Role Playing Game.' Forty-seven of the 69 video games in the boy's collection were 'violent themed first-person shooter or shooter type games' such as Grand Theft Auto V,  Assassins Creed and Call of Duty 4. The youth who had wrestled with speech problems since kindergarten, who students told police been called 'stupid' and/or 'retard' in the hallways and poked by others in the side, tried to explain in separate suicide notes that offer insight and contradiction. In one to 'teachers and students,' Allen said the boy 'clearly expressed anger ... over his belief that he was embarrassed and mistreated at school' and 'indicated he would get revenge.' Reyes wrote that he'd been called gay, lazy, stupid, an idiot, had his money stolen and been accused of wetting his pants. Killer: 12-year-old Jose Reyes showed several signs that he was capable of violence - investigators discovered the boy's admiration for the Columbine High School killers. 'Well that all ends. Today I will get revenge on the students and teachers for ruining my life,' he wrote, adding that he would bring a pistol and rifle to school 'to shoot you and see how you like it when someone (sic) making fun of you.' 'Have a great death at school,\\" he said on the one-page note of spiral notebook paper he closed with a drawing of a tombstone that read: 'Sparks Middle School 1965-2013.' But in the second contradictory note to his parents, he said 'this shooting is not because of the shooting games, bullying or other stuff.' He said it was because 'some bad things in the past cause of me.' 'And now I'm just a monster,' Reyes wrote. 'If you hate me and my family doesn't love me it's okay. I know that I'm just an idiot. But I love you and I wish the past would be good and better someday.' Police learned one of the students shot during the rampage had teased Reyes about not having muscles during a physical education class, had called him names and may have played a part in pouring water on him when he was accused of wetting his pants. The mistreatment didn't rise to the level to merit bullying charges, Allen said. Terrifying: Two other students were wounded before Reyes killed Landsberry and then took his own life. Police earlier said Reyes' parents could be charged if they knowingly made the 9 mm pistol available to the boy. But Allen said Tuesday the investigation turned up no evidence that Jose and Liliana Reyes were aware that their son knew where the 9 mm pistol was kept in a kitchen cabinet. Ken Robison, a Reno lawyer for the parents, said prosecutors indicated to him earlier they would not be charged, but Tuesday's announcement brought a 'sense of relief.' Allen said the boy acted alone and did not communicate his plan to anyone. 'We will never know the complete motive or intent behind this tragic incident as the only person with the true knowledge felt acting out in violence and taking his own life was the best course of action,' he said. 'That in itself is a tragedy.'

Understand that even if you were an outstanding undergraduate (as most graduate students were), you will face an entirely different set of challenges in graduate school. The specific nature of your coursework, research, teaching, and laboratory obligations will vary tremendously depending on your field, your school, and your department, and so will your potential paychecks and funding packages, so do some research and figure out what, exactly, you’re signing up for.  Many department websites will answer your basic questions about particular programs, so start there to get a sense of what your obligations as a graduate student might be. Consider contacting current students as well. Most programs have a Director of Graduate Studies who can put you in touch with students in your program. You can then send an email or two to ask more specific questions. Current students may have insights about the standard workload and funding packages, and – unlike the website – they may be forthcoming about the potential downsides of pursuing a degree in their department. Graduate school is not something to do just because you can’t think of anything else to do with your life. No one should sink years of time, money, and energy into a graduate degree without being crystal clear about his or her goals and what is required to achieve them. This goes double for people with families. Know your reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, and do some extra research about what your opportunities will look like after graduate school – don’t just assume that your M.A. or Ph.D. will get you a wonderful job. Many people in the academic world are reluctant to admit this, but the job market for academics is abysmal right now, especially in the humanities and social sciences. If you are pursuing a graduate degree in one of these fields, think twice: even if you go to a top program and do well, you may find yourself, five to ten years down the road, with an impressive Ph.D., considerable debt, and no job. For graduate students with a family, this might be especially troubling. Do your research, and go in with your eyes open (if at all). If you are married or in a committed relationship, it is imperative to discuss the upcoming challenges with your spouse or partner. For most people with families, beginning a graduate program will entail some combination of relocating, quitting jobs, creating a new budget, making new child-care arrangements, and re-evaluating the division of household labor. These are major, life-changing developments, so work to discuss them openly and honestly. If your partner is not an academic, he or she may not fully understand what your new commitments will look like. Once you’ve done the research yourself, make sure you pass along your knowledge and clear up potential misunderstandings – let your partner know, for example, if you think you’ll need to work on weekends or travel for research. If your children are old enough to understand, you’ll need to discuss your plans openly with them as well. Remember that your decision to attend graduate school will change their lives, too: they will likely need to adjust to new schools or child-care facilities, changes in their schedules, and less time with you. Be up front with them, in a way that’s appropriate to their ages and maturity levels, and explain why you’re taking this path. Whatever your financial circumstances, graduate school is an expense to be considered carefully. Ideally, you should avoid going to graduate school, especially in the humanities and social sciences, unless you are fully funded by your program of choice – “fully funded” generally meaning that you receive a tuition waiver and a modest monthly stipend, often in exchange for teaching or laboratory duties. But people with families should be extra cautious, especially since “full funding” will probably not include money for expenses like child care.  Research child-care costs ahead of time. If you’ve been a stay-at-home parent and plan to pay for child care for the first time, you may have no idea how expensive these services can be. If you’re quitting a “real world” job to attend graduate school, you may not realize how insufficient your stipend will be once you subtract the costs of child care from it. Either way, you need to know what you’re getting into. Be sure you look into any tax credits or deductions associated with child care costs.  Factor in changes to your partner’s income, too. If you’re married or in a committed relationship, your partner’s income also needs to be assessed. Are you moving to attend graduate school? If so, your partner will probably have to find a new job – how will you pay the bills in the meantime? Will your decision to attend graduate school affect your partner’s work schedule or potential for overtime hours? If so, you need to consider that as well. You may be tempted to get as much financial aid as possible from the government, but though this decision might be appealing right now, it’s probably unwise in the long term. Ph.D. programs, especially, take a very long time; the debt will add up, and then, in the end, you’ll face the horrible academic job market. How will you pay it back? Summary:","output":"Graduate school presents a unique set of challenges, including coursework, research, and financial obligations, which demand careful consideration, research, and open communication with family members to determine if it is the right path for you and your goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the family that owned Belton House before it was accepted by the National Trust?, using the article: Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line. The owners of Belton are buried in the village of Belton's parish church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer Richard Brownlow (1555–1638), and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899–1978). The owners of Belton House have been: Sir John Brownlow I (1594–1679) Bequeathed Belton to his great-nephew John Brownlow II. Sir John Brownlow II (1659–1697). Builder of Belton House Sir William Brownlow (1665–1702). Brother of Sir John Brownlow II, permitted his widowed sister-in-law Alice to retain Belton. Sir John Brownlow III (1690–1754).

Math problem: Solve -16927 = 855*l - 24312 - 32800 for l. What is the solution?","output":"Step 1: Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation. The constant terms on the right side of the equation are -24312 and -32800. We can combine these terms by adding them: -24312 + (-32800) = -57112 So we get the equation: -16927 = 855*l - 57112 Step 2: Add 57112 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable (855*l). To isolate 855*l on the right side of the equation, we add 57112 to both sides: -16927 + 57112 = 855*l - 57112 + 57112 40185 = 855*l Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 855 to solve for l. Dividing both sides of the equation by 855 helps us find the value of l: 40185 / 855 = (855*l) / 855 47 = l The solution to the equation is l = 47."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The game is the culmination to a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. Normally, Roman numerals are used to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held. For example, Super Bowl I was played on January 15, 1967, following the 1966 regular season. The single exception to this rule is Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, following the 2015 regular season.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - Ronald McKinnon ( born September 20 , 1973 ) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League .

Article:The University of Glasgow researchers found that participants in the Scottish government-funded Walk Well programme were not walking more or sitting less. They said participants had difficulties finding time to walk with carers, which may be due to social care budget cuts. They said more intensive or home-based programmes may be required in future. Dr Craig Melville, senior lecturer in learning disabilities psychiatry, said: \\"Cuts in social care budgets have disproportionately impacted on disabled people and even when social care support is available, it is often not funded at a level that allows paid carers to support adults with intellectual disabilities to be physically active.\\" According to the study, only 5% of adults with intellectual disabilities meet public health recommendations for physical activity, compared to 64% of adults in the general population. About 50% were classed as obese, compared to a national average of 25%. The Walk Well intervention programme was designed for adults with intellectual difficulties to increase their levels of physical activity and reduce the time they spend sitting. The programme was funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish government. It consisted of three face-to-face physical activity consultations, which included behaviour change techniques, written resources for patients and carers, and an individualised structured walking programme. Researchers carrying out the review selected 102 participants at random - 54 took part in the Walk Well programme and 48 were on a waiting list. Over a 12-week period, both groups took fewer than 5,000 steps per day and 59% had a BMI in the obesity range. A majority of participants lived in the most deprived neighbourhoods of Scotland. Dr Melville said: \\"The lack of effect in the Walk Well trial may be due to a lack of availability of social support to make walking accessible, facilitate community participation and moderate social disadvantages.\\" He also suggested that social enterprises, volunteer organisations and buddy programmes might have a role to play in supporting adults with intellectual disabilities to be more active. A Scottish government spokesman said: \\"The Scottish government is committed to improving the lives of people with learning disabilities, and we acknowledge this report. \\"We want people with learning disabilities to enjoy a healthy life. Reducing the stark health inequalities people with learning disabilities face is a key priority within our 'the keys to life' strategy.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"A recent study by the University of Glasgow has revealed that the Scottish government-funded Walk Well programme may not be as effective as initially hoped in increasing levels of physical activity among adults with intellectual disabilities. The Walk Well programme was designed to reduce sedentary time, increase physical activity, and provide support through consultations and walking programs tailored to individuals with intellectual difficulties. However, researchers found that participants faced challenges finding time to walk with carers, which may be a consequence of social care budget cuts. Lead researcher Dr. Craig Melville emphasized that cuts in social care budgets have had a disproportionate impact on disabled people, with social care support often underfunded to the extent that it cannot adequately support adults with intellectual disabilities in being physically active. This highlights the potential need for more intensive or home-based programs in the future. According to the study, only 5% of adults with intellectual disabilities meet the public health recommendations for physical activity, compared to 64% of the general population.

That is the home of the Johnson Space Centre. There they are tested to see how strong and smart they are. One of the first tests is for the heart. The people walk or run, then the space doctors see how fast their hearts are beating. Another important test is performed. In this test the person must curl his body up in a ball. When he is in that position, he is put into a round cloth bag. The doctors give him no idea how long he will have to stay in the bag. If a spaceship broke down in space, the astronauts would get into bags like this. Then they would have to wait and curl up in darkness, until help could arrive. You can see that an astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. The astronauts in training learn many other things. They learn how to jump out of a moving airplane. They learn to how to blow up a lifeboat and get into it while they are in the ocean. The astronauts also have to learn how to get lifted out of the ocean by helicopter . That may look fun, but it can be dangerous. After they finish training, the astronauts continue to work. They stay in good shape by running and doing exercise. They read about their special jobs. In that way they can learn new facts about space travel. Then the big day comes. The astronaut is told to go to work on a flight into space. The crew members get to know each other first. Then they can learn which job each will do. Which of the following is NOT true? A) After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. B) The crew members get to know each other after the tests. C) One of the first tests is for the heart. D) An astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. Answer:","output":"B) The crew members get to know each other after the tests.

Article: FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — A black college football player killed by a white police officer likely used a synthetic psychedelic drug and marijuana prior to the deadly confrontation at a Texas car dealership, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday.      Christian Taylor was unarmed when Arlington police officer Brad Miller shot him on Aug. 7. Miller has been fired.      The report shows there was THC, one of the active components of marijuana, and a synthetic drug that causes hallucinations in his system.      The autopsy also showed Taylor was shot four times, in the neck, torso and abdomen.      The 6-foot-tall, 19-year-old attended Angelo State University in San Angelo in West Texas, where he was to start his sophomore year on the team.      The Tarrant County district attorney has said it will bring a case against Miller, 49, to a grand jury. However, the Arlington police department has yet to hand over the case, according to spokeswoman Samantha Jordan.      Miller's attorney John Snider said he hoped that in light of this evidence, the Arlington police chief would reconsider his decision to fire Miller.      Security footage from the lot shows Taylor breaking out the windshield of a car on the lot and then driving his vehicle into the glass showroom. There is no video footage of the shooting itself.      Inside the showroom, Miller ordered Taylor to get to the ground. Instead, Taylor cursed at the officer and advanced toward him. The officer fired when Taylor was about 10 feet away, Arlington police chief Will Johnson said in a news conference last month.      Friends of Taylor said he had recently developed a zeal for his Christian faith. According to the autopsy report, he had biblical verses, an angel and a cross tattooed on his body. ||||| Christian Taylor, the black, unarmed 19-year-old whose fatal shooting by an Arlington police officer last month garnered national attention, had used a synthetic drug that can cause hallucinations before his death, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday by the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office.      The autopsy characterized the illegal psychedelic found in Taylor’s blood, an NBOMe, as a drug that’s known to “cause distorted perceptions, agitation and hallucinations” and one that has been “associated with random and bizarre behavior in users.” The autopsy report likened some of the drug’s effects to those of LSD. Taylor’s autopsy also indicated recent use of marijuana.      Taylor, an Angelo State University football player, was shot four times in the early morning of Aug. 7. Brad Miller, an officer in training, was one of six officers responding to a burglary call at a car dealership. He fired after Taylor reportedly rushed him. Surveillance video showed Taylor acting erratically before the shooting.      Taylor’s death was ruled a homicide. Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson fired Miller four days after the shooting, citing Miller’s failure to follow proper police procedures during the call. Police said at the time they expected to present the case to a Tarrant County grand jury.      Zhivonni McDonnell, a public information officer for Arlington police, said late Wednesday the department declined to comment: “The case will continue progressing through the criminal justice system.”      Taylor’s family could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Mike Heiskell, an attorney who represents the family, told WFAA-TV (Channel 8) that “regardless of what may have been in his system, this was still an unjustified death of a young man.”      But John Snider, the attorney representing Miller, said in a statement that the autopsy report is “very significant evidence.”      “In light of this crucial development we hope that Chief Johnson will reconsider his rush to judgment,” he said in an emailed statement.      Snider had previously criticized Johnson, saying he only fired Miller to “appease anti-police activists.”      The footage      Surveillance camera footage released shortly after the shooting showed Taylor at the dealership, at one point standing on the hood of a silver Ford Mustang, stomping on the glass and trying to rip it away, and eventually trying to climb inside. Taylor also drove his Jeep through the dealership’s showroom window, though that’s not shown on camera.      Taylor died from gunshot wounds to the neck, chest and abdomen, according to the autopsy. The report stated “all the bullets appear to have been fired in front of him,” indicating Taylor was facing Miller when he was shot.      According to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the drug commonly known as “N-Bomb” that was found in Taylor’s blood can cause agitation, aggression and visual and auditory hallucinations, among other health issues.      At least 19 deaths nationwide have been linked to a set of synthetic drugs known as the NBOMe compounds, according to the DEA.      A bill introduced in the Texas Legislature this year by Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, added the NBOMe compounds and other substances derived from the same chemical structure to Penalty Group 1-A, which carries felony punishment.      That law went into effect Tuesday.      Friends’ reactions      Taylor was arrested in 2013 on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. The charge was dismissed after he completed probation this summer.      His friends said they never saw him using drugs.      Legista Beckford, who was Taylor’s close friend and teammate at Angelo State, said the budding defensive back was always the first person to say no to any kind of unsafe behavior.      “He was always the guy to be like, ‘Put on your seat belt,’ or ‘Be safe in my car,’” Beckford said.      Taylor’s close friends from Mansfield Summit High School said he had specifically steered clear of narcotics.      “In front of my face, I’ve never seen him do drugs,” said Sam Armardi. “Marijuana is probably the only thing anybody did in high school.”      And after Taylor turned suddenly religious over the summer, his friends said, he seemed intolerant of even small vices.      “He was saying: ‘You shouldn’t be smoking. You shouldn’t be doing this. You shouldn’t be doing that. God is good. God is great,’” Armardi said.      Armardi said he had heard unconfirmed rumors that Taylor had used LSD with a friend one month before his death and had planned to use it again the night he was slain.      “Those were the only two times they did it, and we never heard about the drugs again until after he passed away,” Armardi said.      Several friends recalled Taylor talking about running out of time or being tired. Most assumed he was just worn out from football practice or college stress.      “He told me he was a little depressed,” said Jordan McHenry. “We were just wondering if he needed help.”      Taylor didn’t respond well to the suggestion.      “Jordan just called me thinking that I’m crazy and need help,” he texted to his friends’ group chat a few weeks before his death. “Are you crazy?? … I know I’m living right with God.”      Staff writers Avi Selk and Claire Z.

Background: Aaron Turner (born November 5, 1977) is an American musician, singer, graphic artist, and founder of label Hydra Head Records. He is most widely known for his role as guitarist and vocalist for the post-metal band Isis, while also participating in several other bands and projects such as Old Man Gloom, Lotus Eaters and Split Cranium, a collaboration with Jussi Lehtisalo of Finnish band Circle who toured with Isis in 2009. Though raised in New Mexico, Turner moved to the Boston area where he attended school and formed Isis and Hydra Head. In June 2003, Turner moved operations of both the band and label to Los Angeles, California. Context: Touring with Isis in 2007, Turner used two different guitars: a 1976 Fender Telecaster Custom (black), and a 1975 Fender Telecaster Deluxe (brown), played through various effects (his pedalboard layout changed every gig depending on what songs the band decided to play that night), a VHT/Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, and two 4x12 Sunn cabinets. He has also acquired a custom guitar from the Electrical Guitar Company (as did fellow Isis guitarist Michael Gallagher).  In the past, Turner has also used a Gibson Les Paul Standard, PRS CE24, and has played through Sunn, Mesa Boogie, and Mackie amplifiers.  When playing with Isis, Turner and his fellow guitarists usually tuned their instruments (low to high) B-F#-B-E-G#-B, to achieve a heavier sound. They also used other tunings, though less frequently, such as F# (octave below)-F#-B-E-G#-B.  In 2016, Turner described the live rig he used with SUMAC as consisting of two custom-built guitars from the Electrical Guitar Company. Both have lucite bodies and aluminum necks, and custom-wound wide frequency range pickups. The newer of the two--a prototype for a signature model--has a slightly flatter fingerboard radius than the older instrument. On a tour of the Eastern US, Turner was using an Orange Dual Dark 100 amplifier head with a slaved Fryette Two/Ninety/Two power amp. Both heads drove Orange and Marshall cabinets, though Turner claimed to have no strong preferences for particular speaker cabinets. While recording, Turner prefers to use a Fryette Pitbull Ultra Lead, an amp model he's used consistently since his work in Isis. Turner described using a variety of effects pedals in his live rig. Specifically, he runs a BOSS TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, a Death By Audio Apocalypse fuzz, a MASF fuzz, a Strymon BlueSky reverb (which he described as the one essential pedal in his rig), a TC Electronics Ditto Looper X2, and an EHX Forty-Five Thousand sampler (used to trigger preset samples during performance. Turner prefers a Heil PR20 vocal microphone. Question: What is an example of a guitar effects pedal that he used?

Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Lhotse Shar is a subsidiary mountain of Lhotse, and the 11th-highest mountain on Earth, at high. It has the highest fatality rate of all the eight-thousanders  for every 2 people who summit the mountain, one person dies attempting to. However, this is primarily because most climbers tend to try to ascend to the primary peak of Lhotse, rather than the lowest summit of the mountain.

In what year was the man after whom the Reynolds crater on Mars was named born? The answer to this question is:","output":"Osborne Reynolds, the man after whom the Reynolds crater on Mars is named, was born on August 23, 1842. Osborne Reynolds was a prominent British engineer and physicist, known especially for his work in fluid mechanics. His research formed the foundational knowledge for understanding fluid flow, particularly the transition from laminar, or smooth flow, to turbulent flow. The dimensionless Reynolds number, which predicts the onset of turbulence in fluid dynamics, is named in his honor. NASA, when naming geological features on celestial bodies like planets and moons, tends to choose names from individuals who have made significant contributions to their respective fields. The Reynolds crater on Mars recognizes Osborne Reynolds' substantial impact on physics and engineering. This crater, located in the Aonia region of Mars, measures approximately 67 kilometers in diameter. In summary, the man after whom the Reynolds crater on Mars was named, Osborne Reynolds, was born in the year 1842. His contributions in the field of fluid mechanics are invaluable, providing fundamental comprehension on fluid flow characteristics which continues to be utilized in modern physics and engineering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - work - industrial complex - city - new york - suburbia  I believe the correct choice is \\"city\\", here's why: A:","output":"Yes, the correct choice is \\"city.\\" Cities, compared to the other options provided, generally have higher concentrations of commercial areas and business districts, making them the most likely places to see multiple office buildings clustered together. However, let me elaborate on why the other options might not be as fitting: - \\"Work\\" is quite broad and does not specifically refer to places with multiple office buildings. Work could mean a variety of settings such as a small store or a factory. - \\"Industrial complex\\" refers to an area where multiple industrial facilities or businesses are located, which may or may not have office buildings. Though some industrial complexes contain office buildings, they are typically more associated with manufacturing or production facilities. - \\"New York\\" could refer to either New York City or New York state, but given that it is a more specific location, it may not be the most suitable answer for a general question. Nonetheless, it is true that New York City does contain many office buildings. - \\"Suburbia\\" generally refers to residential suburban neighborhoods, which are not primarily known for having multiple office buildings. While it is possible to find some office buildings in suburbs, they are typically far less concentrated than in city centers. Therefore, \\"city\\" is the most appropriate choice among these options, as it is a general term that encompasses urban areas with concentrated commercial and business districts where multiple office buildings are more likely to be found."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: by Fox News | September 26, 2011      If Mitt Romney was in New York City Monday to kiss the ring of business mogul Donald Trump, he didn't seem to want the press to capture his reaction afterwards.      According to Fox News producer Nicole Busch, Romney's director of operations stood with the media the entire time they waited to catch a glimpse of the former Massachusetts Governor...only to tell reporters and cameras after an hour that Romney had already come and went.      \\"Chicken Mitt!!\\" DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse wrote in a rapid fire email to reporters upon learning the Romney aide had misled the press while the candidate departed another exit. \\"Bwok-Bwok!\\" he continued.      But in contrast to the DNC's caricature of Romney's actions, Donald Trump told Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto afterwards that he and Romney had a \\"really had a great hour together\\" and that he was \\"impressed by certain things\\" Romney said during their meeting.      \\"I thought he was very good at the debate, I think he did a good job, I did tell him that,\\" Trump said, although he has yet to endorse a candidate.      Mitt Romney requested the one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump, their first since Romney declared a run for the Oval Office; fellow Republican hopefuls Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry have already met with the reality television host. Herman Cain has a meeting scheduled next week.      In the interview with Cavuto, Trump walked back from less than flattering comments he has made about Romney in the past.      \\"Mitt Romney is a basically small business guy, if you really think about it,\\" Trump said of his potential rival in April as he pondered the idea of a presidential run. \\"He was a hedge fund. He was a fund guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create it.\\"      The hither-to lack of fuzzy feelings between the two men did not stop the DNC from trying to lump the two men together in a web video released Monday morning, entitled \\"Trump, Romney: You're Fired!\\" You can watch the DNC web video here. ||||| Fresh off a victory in the Michigan straw poll, Mitt Romney will be reaching out to another sizable part of the Republican base Monday -- Donald Trump Romney will be meeting with His Trumpness in New York on Monday afternoon, becoming the latest GOP presidential aspirant to court the developer/TV host/former potential candidate/birth certificate investigator. Rick Perry dined with Trump earlier this month at pricey, exclusive Jean-Georges in Manhattan. (You might recall that in June, Trump and Sarah Palin shared some slices of pizza in Times Square . Read into that what you will.) Michele Bachmann has also met with the Donald and plans to do so again.Why court the blessings of Trump? That’s a good question. Well, for one thing, there are still those out there who believe Trump should be president of the United States. There’s a whole website and everything. (It includes items such as “Trump Answers Boy’s Prayer for New Bike.”) For another, say what you will about the man, but he has a platform. He can pretty much show up on Piers Morgan ’s CNN show or Fox News just about whenever he likes. (And don’t forget “Celebrity Apprentice” on NBC . Don’t worry. He’s not going to let you forget it.) Third, he has money. And he knows other people with money. Presidential candidates like money.But Democrats are just as eager to associate Trump with the GOP, as the candidates seem to be to meet with him. Part of it is that it makes Perry, Romney and the like look a little less, well, serious. The other is that Trump is sort of the epitome of the fatcatness that Democrats argue the GOP protects. (This is what GOP calls \\"class warfare.\\")The Democratic National Committee, in fact, has released a video in advance of the Romney-Trump summit, imaginatively titled “You’re Fired” that paints both men as uber-capitalists who care little about the middle-class, education, Medicare or Social Security.Romney is on a small roll. He was widely viewed as handily winning the Fox News- Google debate Thursday night while his top rival, Perry, turned in a shaky performance. Then Perry lost a Florida straw poll he had been expected to win to Herman Cain . On Sunday, Romney trounced Perry and all others in a straw poll in his home state of Michigan.But can he win the coveted Trump endorsement? If there’s one thing to be sure of, it’s that Trump will keep America in suspense as long as possible before answering that question. |||||","output":"Mitt Romney, a man who wants to be president, visited Donald Trump, a famous businessman, to talk in New York City.

Va. man mauled by pit bull while aiding dying neighbor Two West Virginia men are dead and a pit bull is under quarantine after the dog’s owner suffered an apparent heart attack Sunday night and the animal attacked a neighbor who tried to help, police said. David Wallace, 63, was entertaining a friend at his Wheeling home at 8:50 p.m. when he started to suffer from what appears to be a heart attack, police Sgt. Gregg McKenzie told the Daily News on Wednesday. Wallace lived in an upstairs apartment of a makeshift duplex and his guest rushed downstairs to ask his neighbor, Roy Higgenbotham Jr., 62, for help. Higgenbotham immediately called 911 and ran upstairs, McKenzie said. But when he tried to help Wallace, the normally docile pit bull became agitated and attacked Higgenbothem’s arms and upper torso, McKenzie said. “The dog was not viciously attacking people in the street,” he said. “This was an isolated incident. All indications are, he was just being a good guard dog and protecting his owner and residence.” The two men were transported to a hospital and died about 40 minutes later, but police have not confirmed the cause of death for either men, McKenzie said. Police are awaiting the results of an autopsy and toxicology tests. The pit bull may not have caused Higgenbotham’s death, McKenzie said. “He may have had a pre-existing medical condition,” he said. The woman who was visiting Wallace’s home escaped by crawling out of the second story window. The fire department provided a ladder so she could get down, McKenzie said. The incident is still under investigation. The 3-year-old pit bull remains under quarantine at Ohio County Animal Control in Triadelphia, W.Va. A representative was not immediately available Wednesday morning to discuss the animal’s condition. A neighbor and eyewitness, Beth Patsch, told WTRF-TV that the female pit bull terrier is normally sedate, but likely became confused when she saw her owner in pain. “It seems like she was protecting him from the person trying to resuscitate him,” Patsch told the TV station. “She was always wonderful. They had actually had (the dog) and her mother, and her mother had just passed in the fall, I believe, and this was the puppy.

I like doing all kinds of sports, such as football, basketball, running and swimming. Every morning, I get up early and do exercise. I play basketball on Wednesdays and Saturdays with my friends every week. I do my homework every day. I like watching TV, but I can't watch it every day on school nights. I only watch it on Saturday evening. I am neither fat nor thin. My eating habits are very good. I try to eat a little meat and lots of vegetables and fruit. And I never eat junk food. Do you know me? I'm Zhao Hui, a 14-year-old student. I am a little fat. I like eating meat. I eat meat three or four times a week. I especially like eating junk food. I want to eat it every day, but my parents don't allow me to eat it every day. I only eat it once or twice a week. I don't like exercise at all. Sometimes, I swim with my friends because I like it. I know exercise is good for my health. From now on, I have to exercise every day. From the passage, we know that  _  . A) Li Ping is a little fat and she isn't healthy B) Zhao Hui likes sports and she is very healthy C) exercise and good eating habits are good for health D) meat isn't good for our health and we can't eat it Answer:","output":"C) Exercise and good eating habits are good for health. This passage showcases the lifestyles of two different people, Li Ping and Zhao Hui. Li Ping is actively involved in multiple sports and has a healthy diet, refraining from junk food, consuming meat moderately, and ingesting lots of fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, Zhao Hui appears less active and has less healthy eating habits, including consuming meat frequently and enjoying junk food despite his parents' attempts to limit this habit. Although Zhao Hui realizes the importance of exercise and plans to incorporate it into his daily routine, his current lifestyle is less healthy than Li Ping's. Consequently, this passage emphasizes the significance of regular physical activity and a balanced diet for maintaining good health. However, it does not suggest that meat is overall unhealthy. It's about the balanced consumption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   A volcano is a vent through which molten rock and gas escape from a magma chamber. Volcanoes differ in many features, such as height, shape, and slope steepness. Some volcanoes are tall cones, and others are just cracks in the ground ( Figure below ). As you might expect, the shape of a volcano is related to the composition of its magma. The three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones.   Q: What are the 3 types of volcanoes?   A: A:","output":"The three types of volcanoes, as mentioned in the given paragraph, are composite, shield, and cinder cone volcanoes. These different types of volcanoes showcase distinct features, shapes, and eruption patterns, which are influenced by the composition of their magma. 1. Composite volcanoes, also known as stratovolcanoes, are characterized by their large, symmetrical, conical shapes. These types of volcanoes have steep slopes and can reach great heights. Their magma composition primarily consists of viscous, silica-rich lava, which can lead to explosive eruptions. The erupted material often includes tephra (solid fragments) and pyroclastic flows (fast-moving currents of hot gas and volcanic matter). Composite volcanoes form through alternating layers of lava flows and volcanic debris during multiple eruptions over time. Some well-known composite volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Vesuvius in Italy, and Mount St. Helens in the United States. 2. Shield volcanoes are characterized by their broad, gently sloping shapes, with their slopes resembling a warrior's shield. These volcanoes typically have non-explosive eruptions due to their magma composition, which is mainly composed of low-viscosity, low-silica basaltic lava that can easily flow over great distances. This type of lava creates extensive lava fields and gently sloping shield volcanoes over time. As the lava flows cool and solidify, the shield volcano's structure is built up in layers. Some famous shield volcanoes include Mauna Loa and Kilauea located on the Big Island of Hawaii. 3. Cinder cone volcanoes, also known as scoria cones, are the smallest and simplest of the three types. They are characterized by their steep, conical shapes, and smaller size compared to composite and shield volcanoes. These volcanoes are formed from the eruption of gas-charged, basaltic magma, which produces a volcaniclastic material called cinders or scoria. As the cinders accumulate around the vent, they eventually form the conical shape of a cinder cone volcano. Cinder cone volcanoes are often found on the flanks of larger volcanoes, and their eruptions generally don't last long. A well-known example of a cinder cone is Paricutín in Mexico, which grew rapidly from a cornfield to a 1,200-foot tall volcano between 1943 and 1952. In summary, the three types of volcanoes are composite, shield, and cinder cones, each displaying distinct features, shapes, and eruption styles based on the composition of their magma."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select from the following. A. yes; B. it is not possible to tell; C. no;","output":"To determine the relationship between the two sentences, we need to analyze the information given and the implications of each statement.

Sentence 2: She tugged at it. - This sentence simply states that she exerted a pulling force on the object. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Yes - This option implies that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must also be true. The action of pulling (as mentioned in Sentence 1) can be interpreted as a form of tugging. Therefore, if she did try to pull at the object in Sentence 1, it would mean she tugged at it as well, making Sentence 2 true. B. It is not possible to tell - This option implies that the information provided in Sentence 1 is not sufficient to draw a conclusion about the truth of Sentence 2. C. No - This option implies that if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must not be true.

In 1966, Bush endures an initiation by his fellow Yale University students as a Delta Kappa Epsilon pledge. During the hazing, Bush successfully recalls the names and nicknames of many of the fraternity members, and states that his family's political legacy is one in which he has no interest. After Bush is jailed in New Jersey for rowdiness following a football game, his father, George H. W. Bush states that he will help Bush for the last time. Following his graduation from Yale, Bush takes a job at an oil patch back in Texas, but he quits after a few weeks. In 1972, \\"Junior\\" reveals his real aspirations in a father-son talk: working in professional baseball. Bush is accepted into Harvard Business School with the help of his father. After heavy drinking, Bush crashes his car into his family estate and challenges his father to a fistfight. His brother, Jeb, stops the fight. In 1977, Bush announces he will run for Congress. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, who says that Bush is not a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with the highest number of votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history. In 1986, Bush becomes a born-again Christian, gives up alcohol, and mends his relationship with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his 1988 presidential campaign, although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, Karl Rove, tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself. Bush becomes a front office executive of the Texas Rangers baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the Gulf War.

Read this and answer the question Hayek's principal investigations in economics concerned capital, money, and the business cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility to the value of money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for \\"industrial fluctuations\\" based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work as a starting point for his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the \\"Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle\\". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that \\"the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process\\".

That was news to a spokesperson for Emory University Hospital, to which Vinson was transferred one week ago.      “Amber is steadily regaining her strength and her spirits are high,” says the statement sent to media by Steven Jumper of the Washington, D.C.-based PR firm Ghost Note Agency. “We are overjoyed to announce that, as of yesterday evening, officials at Emory University Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control are no longer able to detect virus in her body. She has also been approved for transfer from isolation. Amber remains under treatment within Emory’s Serious Communicable Diseases Unit.”      When reached by The Dallas Morning News Wednesday evening, Emory spokesperson Janet Christenbury said she was “not aware of that at all.” She said she would provide an update as soon possible.      Jason McDonald, spokesperson for the CDC, says he is “not aware of any test results.” He hopes to have an update tomorrow.      “Healthcare provider will determine by diagnostic whether a patient is free of Ebola virus,” he says via email. “We have criteria we ask medical staff to meet but the determination is made by medical care provider.”      Previously, Vinson’s family has not allowed Emory or the CDC to comment on Vinson’s condition.      “Amber and our family are ecstatic to receive this latest report on her condition,” said Vinson’s mother Debra Berry in the statement provided by the PR agency, which has been updating the media about Vinson’s condition. “We all know that further treatment will be necessary as Amber continues to regain strength, but these latest developments have truly answered prayers and bring our family one step closer to reuniting with her at home.”      Meanwhile, closer to home, the number of people being monitored for Ebola continues to shrink.      According to the Centers for Disease Control, 108 people are “still being actively monitored” for the diseases, while 66 others have been cleared. And most of those are, like Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, health-care workers at Presbyterian who had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan during his two visits to the hospital.      “As the graph shows, the number of people at possible risk for contracting Ebola is decreasing each day,” said Dr. Lyle Peterson, the senior CDC official in Dallas, in a prepared statement. “Although we are not out of the woods yet, it is very encouraging we have not seen any other cases. This has been an incredible team effort and we are      grateful to Mayor Rawlings and Judge Jenkins for their support.”      Added Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, “Working together we are winning the war on Ebola, and every day we are closer to successfully accomplishing our mission.”      “There are still more hurdles to overcome, but we’ve reached a significant milestone in this difficult journey,” said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings in a prepared statement. “I’m grateful that these 66 brave people have completed the monitoring period, and I look forward to the day when the others finish their monitoring periods as well.”      10.22.14 Graph Contact Monitoring ||||| A statement quotes Vinson's mother, Debra Berry, as saying that the news has \\"truly answered prayers.\\"      Dallas nurse Amber Vinson is seen smiling in her Atlanta hospital room in a photo released by her family.

Wednesday night, Fort Worth's religious communities gathered to pray for the well-being of those tormented by Ebola, both in Texas and abroad.      Their timing was unintentionally spot-on.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

Problem:Sentence1: How can I help a depressed friend?   Sentence2: Are there any social groups for people dealing with depression? Solution:","output":"Dissimilar While both questions relate to the domain of mental health, specifically dealing with depression, they are asking about two different subjects.  Sentence1: \\"How can I help a depressed friend?\\" is seeking advice on ways to support a friend who is suffering from depression. This could include ways to talk to them, activities that could help alleviate their symptoms, or insights on professional help they could seek. Sentence2: \\"Are there any social groups for people dealing with depression?\\" on the other hand, is seeking information about social support structures that exist for individuals suffering from depression. The person is asking about a more communal or group-based form of help, possibly as a supplement to other forms of treatment. Though they are similar in their connection to depression, these questions convey different intents and are asking for different kinds of advice or information, hence they are classified as 'Dissimilar'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This breed is known for its distinctive coat, which resembles that of its wild counterparts, and its intelligent, active and energetic nature. Facts relevant to the question: 1. Bengal cats, like all cats, are obligate carnivores. This means that they require a diet primarily based on animal proteins to provide the essential nutrients they need. 2. Cats must consume certain amino acids, vitamins, and minerals from animal sources that are not found or are insufficient in plant-based diets. For example, cats require taurine, an amino acid found mainly in meat, to maintain healthy heart function and eyesight. A deficiency in taurine can lead to severe health problems. 3. Pancakes are typically made from flour, eggs, milk, and other ingredients. They are not a complete source of nutrition for Bengal cats and lack the necessary nutrients derived from animal proteins. 4. Feeding a Bengal cat a diet consisting of only pancakes can lead to malnutrition and serious health issues due to nutrient deficiencies. Given these facts, a Bengal cat cannot survive eating only pancakes, as they need a balanced diet that meets their specific nutritional requirements as obligate carnivores."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But when we asked our readers whether they would clone (, )their beloved animals, the responses  were split almost down the middle. Of the 228 readers who answered it, 108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion. Clearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and _ . It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure. Most of the respondents who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death. Both sides expressed equal love for their animals. More than a few respondents owned \\"the best dog/cat in the world\\". They thought of their pets as their \\"best friend\\", \\"a member of the family,\\"\\"the light of my life.\\" They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion. Then the loss is so disturbing---and the cloning so attractive. \\"People become very close to their animals, and the loss can be just as hard to bear as when a friend or family member dies,\\" says Gary Kowalski, author of Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet. \\"For me, cloning feels like an attempt to turn death away...It's understandable.

Sam turns her down, but goes to speak with the man who tutored him on time travel, Goldburg (Kevin Yon), who reminds him of the cardinal rules: he's not to alter his own personal past, nor travel in time with his body left unsupervised. We learn that a fire that claimed the lives of Sam and Jenna's parents had claimed Jenna's life, but Sam altered time so that their parents died instead.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Make a tracing table.","output":"To accomplish the goal of making a tracing table, also known as a lightbox, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather materials and tools:    - A wooden or plastic container (could be a shallow box or drawer) will serve as the base for your tracing table. The size of the box will depend on the desired size of your tracing table.    - A sheet of plexiglass or clear, sturdy plastic - this will serve as the top surface where you'll place your drawings or designs to trace.    - LED strip lights or a small LED lamp - these will provide the light source for your tracing table.    - Frosted white or translucent paper or film - this will help distribute light evenly across the top surface.    - Ruler, pencil, and masking tape    - Wood glue, nails, or screws (depending on the material of your base)    - Drill and drill bits    - Jigsaw (optional)    - Sandpaper    - Protective eyewear and gloves 2. Measure and cut the plexiglass or plastic sheet:    - Measure the inner dimensions of your container and cut the plexiglass sheet to match using a jigsaw or have it cut at your local hardware store. Make sure to leave a small gap (approximately 1/8 inch) around the edges for easy installation and removal.    - Sand the edges of the cut sheet to remove any sharp edges. 3. Prepare the light source:    - If using LED strip lights, measure the interior surface of the container base and cut the LED strips accordingly. Connect the cut LED strips in series or parallel, depending on your desired brightness and voltage requirements.    - If using a small LED lamp, choose a position inside the container that will provide even light distribution. 4. Install the LED lights:    - Attach the LED strip lights or lamp to the inside of the container using glue or mounting hardware. Make sure the lights are secure and the wiring is neatly organized.    - Drill a hole in one of the container's sides to accommodate the power cord and any connectors. This will allow you to plug in the lights externally. 5. Install the frosted white or translucent paper or film:    - Cut the frosted paper or film to fit the interior dimensions of the container.    - Secure the paper or film in place using masking tape, ensuring it is smooth and wrinkle-free. This layer will help diffuse the light for more even illumination on the work surface. 6. Place the plexiglass or plastic sheet on top:    - Carefully place the cut plexiglass or plastic sheet on top of the container, nesting it within the edges. Make sure the sheet is clean and free from dust or smudges for the best tracing results. 7. Test your tracing table:    - Plug in your LED lights and turn on the tracing table. Place a reference image on the surface, and put a blank sheet of paper on top. You should be able to see the reference image through the blank sheet, allowing you to trace the design easily. 8. Secure the plexiglass sheet (optional):    - If you want to secure the top sheet in place, you can use wood glue, nails, or screws, depending on the material of your container. Make sure not to overtighten the screws or apply too much pressure, as this could crack or damage the plexiglass. Congratulations! You've successfully made a tracing table or lightbox that you can use for your various tracing, design, and artistic needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.  Nate and Andy were two zoologists. They have been studying the characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals. Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals.  Which zoologist learned less about bats? The answer is:","output":"Nate would have learned less about bats because he studied diurnal animals. Diurnal animals are active during the day and sleep at night, which is the opposite behavior of bats. Bats are nocturnal animals, meaning they are active at night and sleep during the day, so Andy who studied nocturnal animals would have learned more about bats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \\"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \\"Lucky You\\".

The answer is:","output":"Smith's Magazine and Fit Pregnancy are both examples of print media, specifically falling under the category of magazines. Print media, as the name suggests, refers to those forms of media that are primarily transmitted and disseminated through physical means, such as books, newspapers, and magazines. Print media has been a significant method of communication and information dissemination for centuries, with its roots dating back to the invention of the Gutenberg printing press in the 15th century. Smith's Magazine, as the name implies, is a magazine that covers a variety of topics, often focusing on current events, pop culture, fashion, and lifestyle. It features interviews, informative articles, and well-researched stories that appeal to a diverse readership. The magazine covers both national and international news, often through the lens of the magazine's unique perspective. Smith's Magazine is available in both print and digital formats, which means that subscribers can either receive the physical magazine in their mailboxes or access the content online through a website or app. Fit Pregnancy, on the other hand, specifically caters to pregnant women and new mothers, addressing their unique needs and concerns during this life stage. The magazine provides articles and resources on prenatal and postnatal care, nutrition, fitness, fashion, and lifestyle tips specifically tailored for pregnant women and new mothers. This niche focus helps the magazine cater to its target audience more effectively, offering specialized information that its readers are unlikely to find in general-purpose magazines. Both Smith's Magazine and Fit Pregnancy share the essential characteristics of magazines as a type of print media: they are periodical publications featuring informative and engaging content, typically with a mix of written articles, images, and sometimes interactive elements. Magazines cater to specific interests and groups, allowing them to reach dedicated audiences who are interested in their content. In summary, Smith's Magazine and Fit Pregnancy are both types of print media, with each magazine representing different subject matter and target audiences. While Smith's Magazine focuses on a broader array of topics such as current events, pop culture, and lifestyle, Fit Pregnancy is specifically aimed at pregnant women and new mothers, providing information and resources relevant to their needs. Both magazines offer their readers a mix of articles, images, and sometimes interactive content, adhering to the basic format of magazine publishing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is distinct from rice starch, which is usually produced by steeping rice in lye. Rice flour is a particularly good substitute for wheat flour, which irritates the digestive system of some people. Rice flour is also used as a thickening agent in recipes that are refrigerated or frozen since it inhibits liquid separation. OPT: [I] no. [II] yes. Is this statement correct \\"is rice powder and rice flour the same\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"is rice powder and rice flour the same\\" is correct. Rice flour and rice powder are two terms used interchangeably to describe the same product. Both are made from finely milled rice grains and have similar properties and uses in cooking and baking. Rice flour is known for its versatility as a substitute for wheat flour in many recipes, especially for people experiencing gluten intolerance or celiac disease. There are different types of rice flour available based on the type of rice used for milling. These include: 1. White Rice Flour: Made from finely milled white rice, this is the most common type of rice flour. It has a mild, neutral taste and can easily be incorporated into various recipes. 2. Brown Rice Flour: Brown rice flour is prepared using unpolished brown rice, which retains the bran and germ layers. It has a nuttier flavor and higher nutritional content compared to white rice flour. 3. Glutinous Rice Flour: Also known as sticky rice flour or sweet rice flour, this type is made from short-grain glutinous rice, which is starchier than other varieties. Glutinous rice flour is commonly used in Asian desserts and dishes requiring a sticky, chewy texture. Rice flour applications and benefits: 1. Gluten-Free Baking: As a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, rice flour can be used in baking recipes like bread, pancakes, waffles, muffins, cookies, and cakes. It may require blending with other flours or modifying the recipe to achieve the desired texture. 2. Thickening Agent: Rice flour serves as an excellent thickening agent for sauces, gravies, and soups. Since it does not form lumps and dissolves easily, it is preferred over wheat flour for thickening purposes in many cuisines. 3. Coating for Frying: Rice flour can be used as a coating for deep frying or pan-frying food items, providing a crispy, golden-brown crust. 4. Noodle Making: Rice flour is a primary ingredient in making gluten-free noodles, such as Vietnamese rice noodles and Japanese udon noodles. As a versatile, gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, rice flour (also known as rice powder) offers a suitable option for those with dietary restrictions or individuals seeking new flavors and textures in their recipes. Its wide range of applications and benefits make rice flour an essential ingredient in many culinary traditions around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When you do wash your hair 24 to 48 hours prior, make sure that you only use shampoo. Conditioner will prevent the dye from adhering. Put on a shirt that you won't mind staining, then wrap an old towel or a plastic cape around your shoulders. Coat your hairline, the tips of your ears, and the back of your neck with petroleum jelly. Finally, pull on a pair of plastic gloves.  Work in an area that is easy to clean, such as a bathroom or kitchen. If you are worried about staining the counters or floors, cover them with newspaper, paper bags, or plastic bags. It is easier to dye your hair in layers .5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) thick rather than in sections. Part your hair across the back of your head at about ear-level. Pull everything above the part into a bun.  Secure the bun with a claw-clip. It'll be the easier to remove and replace. If you have very thick hair, you may want to part it even lower so that you are working with thinner sections. If your hair is too short to pull into a bun, use clips. If you have chin-length or shorter hair, you may not have to do this step at all. Some dyes come in a kit that already include the dye and developer. For other dyes, you must purchase the developer separately. Follow the instructions that came with the dye to find out how you should mix them.  You can mix the dye in the squeeze bottles that came in the kit, or you can mix it in a non-metal bowl.  If you are lightening your hair, add 1 to 3 packets of toner. The more packets you use, the ashier the final color will be.  If you can't find packets of toner, don't worry; you can wash your hair with purple shampoo afterwards to remove brassy hints. Take a thin strand of hair from an inconspicuous area, such as your nape, and apply the dye to it. Cover the strand with plastic wrap, and let the dye sit for the time recommended on the bottle. Rinse the dye out with cool water, then let it dry.  You don't have to use conditioner for this since this is just a strand test. Although not absolutely necessary, strand tests are highly recommended because the color may come out differently from what you expect. If the dye did not turn out the way you wanted it, you’ll have to buy a different color.","output":"The article provides guidelines for dyeing hair at home while ensuring minimal damage and maximizing color adherence. First, wash your hair 24 to 48 hours before dyeing, using only shampoo. Avoid using conditioner, as it may prevent the dye from sticking. To protect your clothes and surroundings from staining, wear an old shirt, cover your shoulders with a towel or plastic cape, and place newspapers or plastic bags on the surface you'll be working on. Next, apply petroleum jelly to your hairline, ear tips, and back of the neck to protect your skin. Wearing plastic gloves, work in sections of 0.5-1 inch thick layers. Specifically, part your hair at ear-level, pulling the upper part into a bun and secure it with a claw-clip. Short-haired individuals may not need this step and can use clips instead.

No refills were needed. Even worse for CVS: De Maria, 60, works in the drug industry and knows a thing or two about how the game gets played. \\"These automatic refills have become a standard industry practice,\\" she told me. \\"They have become very prevalent.\\" Federal and state authorities launched investigations into unauthorized refills after I wrote columns about how CVS and other drugstores were routinely signing up customers for automatic refills without their approval. CVS, for its part, blamed the practice on rogue drugstore managers and insisted that the company's official policy was that customers are always asked before being enrolled in ReadyFill, the chain's refill program. But I've obtained company documents showing that CVS pharmacists are expected to enroll at least 40% of patients into ReadyFill. Failure to do so, pharmacists say, can result in reduced compensation or even being fired. Some CVS pharmacists have told me that, because of the investigations, company managers quietly told them to ease up on the automatic refills. But recent reports of people still being enrolled in ReadyFill without approval indicate that not all stores have gotten the message. Indianapolis resident Bill Rainsberger, 55, said he was notified by his local CVS recently that a refill was ready for a medicine he'd already stopped taking. \\"I never, ever signed up for automatic refills,\\" he said. \\"I didn't even know they had such a thing.\\" Mike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, declined to answer when I asked what steps the company has taken to reduce incidents of people being enrolled in ReadyFill without their permission. He said only that customers can call (800) SHOP-CVS, or (800) 746-7287, to report any prescription-related problems. De Maria works as a sales rep for a leading drug company. After she received the calls from CVS about her 23-year-old son's prescription being refilled, she headed straight to the pharmacy. She said she asked a worker how her son had been enrolled in ReadyFill. The worker insisted that he must have asked to be included in the program. \\"So I told her to show me the proof that he'd signed up,\\" De Maria recalled. \\"Show me anything that proves this. She couldn't do it.\\" De Maria told me that pharmacies and prescription benefit managers — the companies that manage drug benefits for insurers and employers — have realized there's a lot of money to be made from automatic refills. \\"They bill insurers for it, they get paid for it,\\" she said. \\"And most of the time the prescription isn't picked up and it goes back on the shelf, although the insurer might not be reimbursed.\\" At CVS, De Maria said, the store's pharmacist eventually got involved and agreed to remove her son from ReadyFill and reverse the prescription so that her insurer would be paid back. \\"As the pharmacist was fixing things, I told her I couldn't believe that they were still doing this,\\" De Maria said. \\"Hadn't they had enough negative press?\\" What did the pharmacist say? Summary:","output":"A growing number of CVS customers have raised concerns about unauthorized prescription refills, despite the company's claims to the contrary. Federal and state authorities even launched investigations into the widespread accusations. While CVS has blamed this practice on rogue store managers, evidence suggests that pharmacists are expected to enroll at least 40% of patients into ReadyFill, the chain's refill program. CVS pharmacists have reported that failing to do so would result in reduced compensation or job termination, and that company managers have asked them to be less aggressive in automatic refills due to the investigations. However, recent cases show that customers continue to be enrolled in ReadyFill without their consent. One notable case involves De Maria, an industry insider who works as a sales rep for a major drug company. After receiving calls about her son's prescription refill - a temporary medication for a skin problem - she criticized the scheme. According to De Maria, pharmacies and prescription benefit managers have been benefitting financially from these automatic refills, which often result in unused medications going back on the shelf while the insurers bear the cost, without being reimbursed most of the time. Despite awareness and public outcry about such practices, it seems that not all CVS stores have adjusted their practices accordingly. The CVS company spokesman, Mike DeAngelis, has not provided insight into what steps the company has taken to prevent people from being enrolled into ReadyFill without their permission."},{"instruction":"Given the background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem.

Write a text based on this summary: bulgarian police chief calls british tv investigation biased Text:","output":"Title: Bulgarian Police Chief Accuses British TV Investigation of Bias Amid Rising Tensions In a recent statement, the Bulgarian Police Chief has criticized a British TV investigation, calling it biased and claiming that it portrays his country's law enforcement negatively. The ongoing tensions between the two nations have been exacerbated by a series of reports from the British media that have painted the Bulgarian police force in a negative light. The controversy initially emerged following an in-depth report by a prominent UK TV network, which exposed alleged corruption and abuse within the Bulgarian police department. The British investigation, led by renowned journalists, delved into various instances of suspected corruption and misconduct by Bulgarian police officers. It included interviews with victims, whistleblowers, and experts who provided damning evidence of these allegations. The documentary highlighted issues such as the misuse of power by some officers, participation in organized crime, and the systemic cover-up of illegal activities. In response to these accusations, the Bulgarian Police Chief strongly refuted the claims made in the report. He argued that the portrayal of the entire force as corrupt and abusive is unfounded and clearly demonstrates a bias against Bulgaria. He pointed out that any organization, irrespective of its size or influence, may have a few bad apples, but such incidences should not be taken as a blanket representation of the entire police force. Furthermore, the Police Chief stated that the Bulgarian police force comprises dedicated and honest officers who continuously work to protect and serve their country. He expressed his disappointment with the British TV network for failing to incorporate this side of the story in their documentary, which in his opinion, demonstrates an agenda driven approach by the channel to demonize the Bulgarian police force. The TV investigation has undoubtedly caused diplomatic ripples between the UK and Bulgaria. Advocates for the Bulgarian police have called for an apology from the British TV network for their ostensibly one-sided investigation, claiming that it has damaged the reputation of a committed and professional institution. Additionally, they argue that such accusations cast a shadow not only on the police force but also on the entire nation, potentially causing harm to the bilateral relations between the UK and Bulgaria. In the wake of this controversy, both sides have raised their concerns. While the supporters of the British TV investigation maintain that exposing corruption and abuse in any form is essential for a healthy democracy, the Bulgarian authorities argue that the report was incomplete and lacked the essential elements of journalistic integrity. As the story unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations and counter-allegations will influence the already tense relationship between the UK and Bulgaria. The British authorities may need to reconsider their approach in investigating similar issues in foreign countries, taking into account the sensitivity of international relations and the potential for affecting diplomatic ties. On the other hand, the Bulgarian authorities must also ensure that any instances of corruption or abuse of power within their police force are addressed promptly and effectively, upholding the rule of law and the trust of their citizens. In conclusion, the Bulgarian Police Chief's accusations of bias against the British TV investigation have sparked a heated debate surrounding journalistic ethics, the portrayal of foreign countries and institutions, and the impact of such reports on international relations. As both sides continue to present their cases, the need for transparent reporting and accountability becomes all the more crucial in fostering healthy democratic values and strengthening bilateral ties between countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Adam Farooqui holds a sign as he stands at Zuccotti Park on Wednesday in New York. \\"We need to have a symbolic presence,\\" said Ned Merrill, 52, a blanket draped over his shoulder. He spoke as workers for Brookfield Office Properties, which owns the plaza, maneuvered around the scattered protesters with steam cleaners. The barricades that came down Tuesday were chained together and neatly stacked at the north end of the park. On Tuesday, about 300 protesters filled Zuccotti after the barricades were taken down. Police spokesman Paul Browne said the New York Police Department and Brookfield had been talking about removing the barriers last week. The decision was made to remove them Tuesday because officials felt they were no longer necessary, Browne said. Merrill said it's important for at least a few protesters to be at Zuccotti at all times. He said he's been there from midnight to about 10 a.m. most nights since Dec. 1. \\"Most people in American know that something is wrong,\\" he said. \\"Much of what is wrong is that money owns the political process.\\" Robert Segal, who is 47 and works in a wine store, also spent Tuesday night at Zuccotti. \\"The rest of the world want a place where they can come down and join Occupy Wall Street at critical moments,\\" he said. Tents and sleeping bags have been banned from Zuccotti Park since a Nov. 15 police raid evicted protesters who had been sleeping there since Sept. 17. Merrill said security guards have prevented him from sitting on a piece of plastic foam when he spends the night there. They told him it was considered bedding, he said. On Monday, civil rights groups filed a complaint with the city's buildings department saying the barricades were a violation of city zoning law.

As you can see, there is a constant value, which is -20809, that you need to get rid of. To do this, add 20809 to both sides of the equation: a - 20809 + 20809 = -20817 + 20809 Since adding and subtracting the same value from both sides of an equation retains its equivalence, the equation after this step would be: a = -20817 + 20809 3.

Though the first sentence does not directly entail the second, both sentences are related to religious beliefs and the internal struggles that may arise in reconciling those beliefs with the realities of human interactions. The first sentence expresses a desire for unity among people who share similar beliefs, while the second sentence provides a possible explanation (hypocrisy) for why such unity might not always be achieved. In summary, although the second sentence is not entailed directly by the first sentence, both sentences are linked through their exploration of the complexities of religious beliefs and their impact on human behavior and unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once the risk of frost is over, you can begin preparing the potted trees for transplant. To harden the trees, let them spend time outside each day. Gradually increase the time that they spend outside to allow them to develop a resistance to the effects of weather and pests. Start by placing them outside for one hour per day, and increase each day until they are staying outside all day.  It may take a few weeks to appropriately harden your peach trees. Don't leave the trees outside overnight during the hardening process. After your trees have been hardened, it is time to plant your peach tree.

The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.  I am facing a new situation today: In a doctor's office, two siblings both are having a small operation performed on their fingers in order to correct an identical injury. The movement of Joe's ions has been disrupted completely, but Emily's ions are still able to move normally.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will be more uncomfortable during the operation?

Answer the following question: Dee and Ann were two cousins. Ann lived in a mountain village at 8000 ft altitude, while Dee lived in a coastal town at sea level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which cousin experienced fewer thunderstorms?  Hint: Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).The uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.  Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content. Answer:","output":"Dee, who lived in a coastal town at sea level, likely experienced fewer thunderstorms compared to Ann, who lived in a mountain village at an altitude of 8000 ft. There are several reasons for this difference in thunderstorm frequency and intensity between the two locations. One of the key factors influencing thunderstorm development is the temperature difference between higher and lower altitudes. The higher you go, the cooler the air usually becomes due to a decrease in surface temperature and radiational heating. This relationship is known as the adiabatic lapse rate. When the temperature decreases with altitude, as it typically does, there is a higher likelihood of thunderstorm development. However, there are instances when temperature might actually increase with altitude, causing an inversion. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap, suppressing thunderstorm development. In this case, mountain tops might experience warmer temperatures than the valleys below. While inversions can occur in both coastal and mountainous regions, they are more likely to be associated with the mountain village where Ann lives. The uneven solar heating described in the paragraph also has an impact on the temperature and moisture gradients (frontogenesis) that contribute to the formation of thunderstorms. Coastal towns, like where Dee lives, tend to have more consistent temperature and moisture profiles due to the moderating influence of the nearby ocean. This ocean-driven stability reduces the likelihood of strong thunderstorm development. On the other hand, mountain villages, like where Ann lives, can have much more varied temperature and moisture profiles due to the complex topography. This variability can give rise to a higher potential for thunderstorm formation. Lastly, local-scale temperature differences caused by the different characteristics of Earth's surfaces (e.g., reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content) can also influence the formation of thunderstorms. Coastal towns usually have a more uniform surface, while mountainous regions have more diverse surface characteristics. This greater diversity in the landscape of mountain villages can often lead to a higher frequency of thunderstorms compared to coastal towns. In conclusion, Dee, who lived at sea level in a coastal town, experienced fewer thunderstorms than Ann, who lived in a mountain village at an altitude of 8000 ft. This difference is primarily due to the combination of factors related to altitude, temperature profiles, and local surface characteristics."},{"instruction":"Obrowo Gmina Miastko -  Obrowo [ɔˈbrɔvɔ] (Kashubian: Òbrowò) is a village in Gmina Miastko Bytów County Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland.

Dialect: Speaking in a manner that is perceived to be more in line with mainstream white American speech patterns, as opposed to using dialects, slang, or accents commonly associated with African-American communities. 3. Taste in music: Showing a preference for or regularly consuming music genres that are primarily linked to white American culture, such as rock, country, or electronic music, over genres traditionally tied to African-American culture like hip-hop, R&B, or jazz. 4. Academic achievement: Pursuing higher education or displaying a strong commitment to academic success, which may sometimes be seen by some members of the black community as embracing a traditionally \\"white\\" value system or distancing oneself from their own cultural background. It is important to note that these are generalized stereotypes of both black and white Americans and may not represent the actual behavior or preferences of individuals. Additionally, the concept of \\"acting white\\" is subjective and can vary from one person's perception to another's.

Article:But with the party reduced from 57 MPs to just eight - and the loss of ex-ministers such as Vince Cable, Norman Baker, David Laws and Danny Alexander - here are the remaining MPs: Former Lib Dem president Tim Farron has retained his Westmorland and Lonsdale seat. He has held the seat since 2005, when he ended a 95-year rule by the Conservative Party. Though on Friday he saw his majority slide by 3,315 to 8,949, from 60% to 51.5%. At the Lib Dem conference in March, Mr Farron - seen by some as a frontrunner to succeed Nick Clegg - was quoted in the Mail on Sunday suggesting the party's brand would be tainted for a generation by governing with the Conservatives. Asked if he would stand to replace Mr Clegg if he was no longer leader, Mr Farron said it would be \\"foolish and disloyal\\" to consider a post-election leadership bid. Mr Farron was elected as the party's president in November 2010, winning 53% of the vote and taking over the role in January 2011. He was re-elected unopposed in autumn 2012, until handing over the role at the beginning of January 2015 to Baroness Brinton. A long-standing Norwich City supporter, Norman Lamb served first as chief parliamentary adviser to Nick Clegg following the 2010 general election and then as a junior minister at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, before he was promoted to minister of state for care and support at the Department of Health. In January 2015, he was appointed to the Lib Dem general election cabinet as the party's health spokesperson. On Friday, he told BBC Radio Norfolk: \\"I will think carefully about how I can best serve my party\\". Mr Lamb has served as Norfolk North's MP since 2001. The son of Hubert Lamb, a leading climatologist, he studied law at Leicester University and, after working as a parliamentary assistant for a Labour MP, built a career as a litigation solicitor, ultimately specialising in employment law. He was partner of Steeles Solicitors and is the author of 'Remedies in the Employment Tribunal'. Greg Mulholland held his Leeds North West seat, where he has been MP since 2005. Shortly before Mr Clegg's resignation as party leader on Friday, Mr Mulholland ruled himself out of the leadership contest. When asked, he told ITV News: \\"No. Very easy answer...My priority is rebuilding [the party] locally.\\" Following Mr Clegg's resignation later on Friday, Mr Mulholland said on Twitter: \\"The 2010 failure to ensure no Liberal Democrat MP voted against a rise in [student tuition] fees was catastrophic. Now we need a leader who voted against.\\" Mr Mulholland was one of the Lib Dems who voted against a fee rise (see the full list of how the Lib Dems voted here). He continued on Twitter: \\"In 2010 the party made the right decision to go into Coalition. Then the leadership made 3 fatal errors 1. fees 2. NHS Act 3. bedroom tax. \\"It really is time for a realignment of British politics & a voting system that does not grotesquely distort & disenfranchise.\\" MP for Southport since 2005, John Pugh held on to his seat, despite losing 8,055 votes. Winning with a reduced majority, he said on Friday that it was time for the party to reflect on how it moves forward after devastating losses across the country. Mr Pugh has previously served as shadow spokesman for transport and health, and, after the election of Nick Clegg as party leader, he worked with Vince Cable as shadow Treasury spokesman. With the formation of the coalition in 2010 he was appointed as co-chairman of the Liberal Democrat parliamentary committee for health and social care, a position he relinquished at the end of 2013 to focus on producing a report examining the social and economic issues facing the north. Born in Liverpool, he graduated in philosophy from Durham University before entering the teaching profession - where he taught in the state and independent sectors and was head of philosophy and religious studies at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby, prior to his election. Mark Williams is the only Liberal Democrats MP in Wales, after successfully holding on to his seat in the Ceredigion constituency. Mr Williams was appointed to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee in 2005 before becoming the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Wales, and at varying times has been spokesman on schools and higher education. Born in Hertford and educated at Aberystwyth University, Mr Williams worked for the Liberal MP for Ceredigion, Geraint Howells, before becoming a research assistant to Liberal Peers in the House of Lords. He later worked as a primary school teacher and deputy head teacher before being elected to parliament in 2005. Alistair Carmichael was the only Lib Dem MP to survive the SNP landslide in Scotland - 10 others lost their seats. Though his  Orkney and Shetland seat was considered to be one of the party's safest, his majority was cut from 9,928 to 817, with a 23.9% swing to the SNP. The safety of his seat has previously led to speculation that the former Scottish secretary could be a potential successor to Mr Clegg. However, in February he appeared to rule out any bid for the leadership. When asked whether he would like to lead the party, Mr Carmichael said: \\"No. There's no vacancy and I have the constituency that is furthest away from London. \\"I have got a family that still includes school age children. And the commitment that it takes to be party leader in modern politics is enormous. At the party conference in March, he said liberalism was needed \\"more than ever\\". He told the conference: \\"In a world where nationalism and populism can seem like attractive options - a world where the power of the state and corporate interests can seem to overwhelm the rights and freedoms of the individual - in a world like that liberalism is needed more than ever before and more than ever before our country needs Liberal Democrat influence in government. Liberal Democrat Tom Brake was the only party member to hold his seat in London, in Carshalton and Wallington, beating Tory rival Matthew Maxwell Scott by 1,500 votes. In every other London seat, the capital is now in the hands of either Labour or the Conservatives. Mr Brake has held his seat since 1997, when he overturned a Tory majority. In September 2012, he was appointed to his first ministerial position as deputy leader of the House of Commons, having been appointed a privy counsellor in June 2011. Following Mr Clegg's resignation, Mr Brake told BBC London: \\"I don't think he should be the fall guy\\". He confirmed on Sunday Politics he would not be contesting the leadership. A summary of the above article is?","output":"This article discusses the remaining Liberal Democrat Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom after the party's significant losses in the 2015 general election, reducing their numbers from 57 to just eight.

Miami Gardens Police Chief Stephen Johnson, 53, was arrested Friday after responding to a fake post on Backpage.com, according to a Broward Sheriff's Office report. Johnson said the pressure of his job drove him to seek relief, telling reporters, \\"the stress overwhelmed me and I made a very bad decision.\\" The chief set up a meeting with an undercover detective, saying over the phone that he wanted to “do everything,” the Sun-Sentinel reported. He opted for a deal of paying 100 for a 30 minutes with two girls, instead of 80 for a session with one prostitute, according to the report. Johnson knocked on the door of the agreed-upon room at a Dania Beach hotel at 6:20 p.m. Friday and paid the undercover cop 100, police said. He was then arrested for soliciting a prostitute. Police said they found two condoms in his pocket. He spent the night in jail and posted a 300 bond Saturday morning. At his release, Johnson told reporters he was stressed about having to face \\"two grieving families,\\" although he did not specify to what cases he was referring. \\"It brought something that's totally out of character with me and people know me,\\" he said, according to CBS Miami. \\"This is just not my character.\\" Johnson won't have to deal with that stress any longer — he was immediately fired from the post he has held since May. An assistant chief will temporarily head the department in the suburb between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, spokespeople said. \\"We remain committed to excellence and integrity on every level,\\" the department said in the release. \\"We will not allow Mr. Johnson's bad judgment to reflect negatively on the hardworking officers of the City of Miami Gardens and the residents they serve on a daily basis.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

(CNN) -- Jodi Arias and her legal team began fighting for her life Tuesday when a new jury heard opening arguments on whether she should receive a life or death sentence for her murder conviction.  It's been a long legal journey for Arias, 34, whom a jury found guilty last year of first-degree murder in the gruesome killing of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, 30.  This week's court proceeding in Arizona is a retrial of the penalty phase. In 2013, the same jury that convicted her became deadlocked later on whether she should be executed for the 2008 murder of Alexander, who was stabbed 29 times, shot in the face and had his neck slit from ear to ear.  The impasse came when the jury voted 8-4 in favor of the death penalty for Arias, a source with knowledge of the jury's vote said at the time.  \\"The tale of this relationship is one of infinite sadness,\\" Arias's lawyer, Kirk Nurmi, told the jury onTuesday. \\"The story of this relationship is one of tragedy, friendship, spirituality, lust, passion, forbidden sex, abuse and violence.\\"  Nurmi said Arias went through an abusive childhood and developed a personality disorder early in life but had never committed a crime before the killing. She also suffered emotional abuse at the hands of Alexander, he said.  She is very remorseful and is punishing herself, he said. The only appropriate sentence is life in prison, Nurmi concluded.  The prosecutor in the case, Juan Martinez, cast doubt on Arias's feelings toward Alexander, saying \\"she loved him so much that after she slaughtered him she showed up at his memorial service.\\"  Based on the article and the following list of answers, write a list of questions. 1.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"Question: Analyze the sequence of events that led to Antigonus II Gonatas eventually being hailed as the king of Macedon and discuss the main factors that contributed to his rise to power. Answer: Antigonus II Gonatas' rise to power can largely be attributed to the tumultuous political climate in the aftermath of Cassander's death, as well as the strategic decisions made by his father, Demetrius. Following Cassander's death in 298 BCE, an opportunity arose for Demetrius to invade Macedon, eventually seizing the Macedonian throne in 294 BCE. He then went on to conquer Thessaly and most of central Greece, further solidifying his reign. However, in 288 BCE, Demetrius faced defeat at the hands of Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus, who invaded Macedon and claimed the kingdom for themselves. Despite this setback, Demetrius continued to build support in central Greece and the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens but ultimately struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which granted him passage to Asia Minor to wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia. He left his son, Antigonus Gonatas, in Greece to maintain control over his territories. After encountering some initial successes, Demetrius was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 BCE, ultimately dying in captivity. In the meantime, Lysimachus, who had claimed Macedon and Thessaly for himself, faced defeat and was killed by Seleucus in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium.  Seleucus then sought to conquer Lysimachus' territories in Thrace and Macedon but was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus, who subsequently crowned himself as king of Macedon. Ptolemy's reign was short-lived, however, as he was killed during a Gaul invasion in 279 BCE. As a result, Macedon was plunged into a state of anarchy. In this chaotic environment, Antigonus II Gonatas, now an experienced and capable leader, invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 BCE and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. His military victory and leadership skills led him to be hailed as the king of Macedon, which he would rule for the next 35 years. In summary, Antigonus II Gonatas' rise to power can be attributed to the combination of his father's strategic decisions, the shifting power dynamics in the region, and his own military prowess in seizing opportunities amidst the chaos surrounding Macedon."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What's the answer to that question: what major airport is near destin florida?

Question: Information:  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - Euboea or Evia (Modern Greek: , \\"Evvoia\\" \\"Eúboia\\") is the second-largest Greek island in area and population, after Crete.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.  They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period.  answer the following question:  What is the original name of the person who was involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement? Answer:","output":"The original name of the person who was involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement is Kertész Andor. Born in Hungary, he later adopted the French version of his name, André Kertész, after moving to Paris in 1925. Kertész was an influential photographer whose work significantly contributed to photographic composition and the development of the photo essay."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Title: Night of the Demon Movie plot: In England, Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) visits his rival, Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis). Harrington promises to cancel an investigation of Karswell's involvement in Satanism if Karswell will rescind a threat he has made against Harrington. After learning that a parchment given to Harrington has disintegrated, Karswell glances at the clock and ushers Harrington out, promising to do all that he can. As Harrington drives home, a gigantic demon materialises and pursues him. Losing control of the car, Harrington crashes into an electrical pole and is electrocuted. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. Holden is informed of Harrington's death and that the only link between it and Karswell's cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Following Harrington's notes, Holden visits the British Museum's library to examine books on witchcraft. A book Holden requests is discovered to be missing. Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins), who gives him Harrington's diary. It reveals Harrington's increasing fear of Karswell's power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell's mansion the next day. There, Holden and Karswell mock each another's beliefs. A very strong windstorm abruptly starts, which Karswell claims to have created with a spell. When Holden continues to mock him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days.

Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him.

Held each year on the last Monday of May, Memorial Day originates from the post-Civil War era and honours those who have paid the ultimate price for our nation's freedom and security. These ceremonies are a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by our military service members, past and present. From large-scale parades in major cities to small-town gatherings at local cemeteries, Memorial Day ceremonies take many forms, all with the common goal of honouring the men and women who have worn the uniform and given their lives in the service of the United States of America. The ceremonies foster a sense of unity, providing an opportunity for all who attend to remember, mourn, and express their gratitude for the lives that have been lost to protect the nation's ideals. One of the most iconic symbols of Memorial Day is the placement of American flags on the graves of fallen soldiers. Families, friends, and volunteers venture out to cemeteries across the country to adorn each headstone with a symbol of national pride, ensuring that their memory and sacrifice are acknowledged. In Arlington National Cemetery, for example, an annual event called \\"Flags In\\" involves members of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, also known as The Old Guard, placing flags on more than 228,000 headstones. Another time-honored ritual is the laying of wreaths on memorials or cenotaphs by military personnel, government officials, and members of the public. These wreaths are a visual representation of the gratitude and remembrance bestowed upon the fallen. Their circular shape signifies eternity and the continuity of life, reminding us that the sacrifices of those who have passed still resonate with us today. Memorial Day ceremonies often incorporate moments of silence or reflection. Community members are invited to partake in prayer, meditation, or contemplation to create a sacred space for honouring and remembering the fallen. This poignant reflection provides a moment of introspection, fostering an appreciation for the bravery and selflessness of those who have lost their lives in service to their country. On a grander scale, the National Memorial Day Parade takes place in Washington, D.C., featuring a procession of patriotic floats, high school marching bands, and uniformed veterans. It offers a powerful display of pride in remembering those who have fought and died for the United States. Adding to the spirit of remembrance, veterans' organizations like the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars hold events, marches, and vigils to honor their fallen comrades. As families celebrate the beginning of the summer season with picnics, barbecues, and outdoor activities, it is important to pause and remember the true meaning of the day. Memorial Day ceremonies serve as a vital link between the past and the present, ensuring that the sacrifices made by courageous men and women are never forgotten. In attending such events and participating in these acts of remembrance, we also indirectly support those currently serving by acknowledging the weight and importance of their duty. Ultimately, Memorial Day ceremonies are a vital manifestation of our collective appreciation for those who have given everything for our freedom. It is through these gatherings, moments of silence, and commemorative acts that we can reaffirm our commitment to those who serve, continue their legacies, and extend our deepest gratitude for their ultimate act of devotion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The wolf head crest also appears in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is decorated with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.William Moreton III used what is today known as the Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the adjoining Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.The Corn Store adjacent to the Chapel may originally have been used as accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor to protect its contents from damp.

Complete the next sentence: How to immobilize an injured or frightened cat  Wrap the cat in a pillowcase then put it in a box.  One of the safest and easiest ways to immobilize a cat is by wrapping its body in a pillowcase. Place your cat on top of a pillowcase lying on a flat surface, several inches from the edge of the pillowcase.","output":"Begin by calmly and gently talking to the cat to provide reassurance and help reduce its stress levels. Approach the cat slowly, ensuring not to make any sudden movements that may startle it further. Remember to wear gloves for added protection, as injured or frightened cats may instinctively become aggressive. Start by gently grasping the cat from behind, holding it by scruff of the neck and supporting its lower body with your other hand. This helps to control the animal and reduces the risk of injury for both you and the cat. Slowly and securely, lower the cat onto the pillowcase, ensuring that its head is facing the open side of the pillowcase. Once the cat is in position, hold the two upper corners of the pillowcase and slowly fold them over the cat's back. Be cautious and careful while doing this to avoid unnecessary movement and pain for the injured cat. Make sure to tuck the pillowcase underneath the cat, enclosing it without creating too tight of a wrap. Next, hold the bottom corners of the pillowcase and fold them up towards the cat's head, creating a secure and snug hold around the animal. By doing so, you will help to prevent the cat from wriggling free and ensure its safety during transportation to a veterinary clinic or emergency facility. Now that the cat is safely wrapped and immobilized in the pillowcase, gently and carefully lift it up with both hands, ensuring to maintain adequate support for the cat's body. Transfer the cat into an appropriately sized box or pet carrier for easy and secure transportation, placing it so that its head remains towards the opening of the box, allowing the cat to breathe comfortably. Before closing the box, provide a soft layer of cushioning, such as towels or blankets, to help stabilize the cat's body and minimize discomfort during the transport. Ensure that the box or carrier has adequate air holes and keep the cat in an upright position. It is important to handle the cat as gently as possible to prevent further stress or aggravation of injuries. The process of immobilization should be done with great care and precaution, as an injured or frightened cat may react unpredictably. Once the cat is safely secured in the box or carrier, swiftly transport it to a veterinarian or emergency facility for appropriate care and treatment. Time is of the essence when dealing with injured animals, and ensuring that your cat receives prompt medical attention is crucial to its recovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which language is this?","output":"The language used in the given sentence \\"Pomatuješ na naši dohodu?\\" is Czech. Czech is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic and by Czech speakers worldwide. Czech is very closely related to Slovak, and it also shares similarities with other Slavic languages such as Polish, Russian, and Serbian. The sentence translates to \\"Do you remember our agreement?\\" in English. In Czech, the word \\"pomatuješ\\" means \\"do you remember\\", \\"na\\" is a preposition that can translate to \\"on\\" or \\"at\\", \\"naši\\" means \\"our\\", and \\"dohodu\\" means \\"agreement\\" or \\"deal\\". As demonstrated in the sentence, Czech language uses subject-verb-object sentence structure like in most of the other Slavic languages and English. Czech is an inflected language, meaning that words change their form according to grammatical rules such as gender, number, and case. This enables a certain degree of flexibility in word order, which can be helpful in expressing emphasis and other contextual information. Additionally, Czech uses diacritic marks (accent signs) to indicate differences in pronunciation. In terms of its alphabet, the Czech language uses the Latin script, with 40 letters based on the addition of diacritics to 26 Latin characters. Some unique characters include Č (č), Š (š), and Ž (ž), which represent specific sounds in the language. Furthermore, Czech vocabulary has evolved with influences from Latin, German, and other regional languages.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: An endangered deer with vampire-like fangs  was spotted for the first time in nearly 60 years, in a remote forest in northeastern Afghanistan. The fanged creature is known as the Kashmir musk deer, and it is native to the Himalayas of northern India, Pakistan's Kashmir region and northern Afghanistan.  Only the male deer have fangs, and they use them during mating season to compete for females. A team of researchers scoured   Afghanistan's Nuristan province during 2008 and 2009, and recorded five sightings of the animal. This was the first time the species had been spotted since 1948. During the survey, the researchers spotted a single male Kashmir musk deer near the same area three separate times. The researchers also recorded one female and her baby, and saw a second single female that they think may have been the same deer, without her baby. These musk deer are classified as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. Musk-deer meat is a local delicacy, but the species is mostly hunted for its scent glands that are more valuable by weight than gold -- some believe the glands have pharmaceutical  properties, and they sell for nearly 20,455 per pound (45,000 per kilogram) on the black market, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Three decades of war have ravaged Nuristan province, and the continued violence and political instability make the black-market trade of scent glands uncontrollable. Furthermore, the species is quickly losing suitable habitat. All of the musk deer were spotted on sheltered rocky outcrops around 9,843 feet (3,000 meters) high. In the summer, they regularly trek  along steep slopes that make them almost impossible to approach and keep them  ly safe from hunters. However, heavy snowfall in the winter drives the species farther down, to more human-accessible slopes, and hunters come from all over the country to stalk  the deer for their valuable scent glands. Due to violence and unrest, nongovernmental...

Benjamin had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless.. (2). Nelson had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless..","output":"Benjamin wanted to learn to skateboard but Nelson thought it was dangerous. The sentence could end in either of the following ways, depending on which character perspective you want to emphasize in the story: 1) Benjamin had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless: In this case, the sentence focuses on Benjamin's perspective. Growing up, Benjamin had never experienced injury or pain from risky activities such as skateboarding. This instilled a sense of fearlessness in him and drove him to pursue skateboarding as a new hobby. He believed that his good fortune and youthful exuberance would continue to protect him from harm. This indifference to risk created tension between Benjamin and Nelson, who perceived skateboarding as a dangerous activity and worried about the potential consequences. In this scenario, the story may revolve around Benjamin's journey to learn skateboarding and overcome the challenges he faces due to his inexperience and Nelson's apprehensive attitude. Ultimately, both characters may learn valuable lessons from their differences. Benjamin may come to understand the importance of safety precautions and respecting the fears of others, while Nelson may become more open-minded about new activities and realize the value of pushing oneself beyond one's comfort zone. 2) Nelson had not broken a bone as a kid and was fearless: In this alternative ending, the focus shifts to Nelson's perspective. Nelson, having never experienced injuries or pain during his childhood, developed a sense of fearlessness and security. Despite this personal outlook, he viewed skateboarding as a dangerous activity and expressed his concerns for Benjamin's safety. Nelson's apprehension might stem from hearing about accidents or witnessing the negative experiences of others. As a result, he wanted to shield Benjamin from potential harm, even if he hadn't experienced it himself. In this version of the story, Nelson's protectiveness could act as a catalyst for both characters to explore their beliefs and attitudes towards risk-taking and develop a more balanced perspective. As Benjamin navigates the world of skateboarding and encounters challenges along the way, Nelson might start to acknowledge the benefits of facing one's fears and trying new things. Meanwhile, Benjamin might learn that considering the potential dangers of an activity and being cautious can still lead to personal growth and fulfilment. Both endings offer unique insights into human nature, highlighting the complex interactions of fearlessness, risk-taking, and personal growth.

Understand the statement: The statement claims that even if we were able to stop all killings everywhere, we could not do so without killing some people in the process. In other words, to put an end to killings, we would have to engage in killing as well. 2. Define 'killings': In this context, \\"killings\\" refers to intentionally causing the death of another person or persons. 3. Explore scenarios: Let's consider different scenarios in which we try to stop killings everywhere. This could involve implementing stricter laws, educating people about conflict resolution, providing adequate support systems for mental health, and finding non-violent solutions to problems. In these scenarios, it does not necessarily require us to kill any people. 4. Analyze the statement's absolute nature: The statement implies that there is no way to stop killings without engaging in killings ourselves. This is quite an absolutist claim, which may not hold true for every real-world situation. 5. Evaluate: Upon reflecting on the scenarios where killings can be stopped without killing others and considering the absolutist nature of the statement, it does not logically follow that \\"We couldn't stop killings everywhere without killing people ourselves.\\" So, the answer is no, it does not necessarily follow that \\"We couldn't stop killings everywhere without killing people ourselves.\\" There could be alternative, non-violent means of addressing and stopping killings which do not involve causing more deaths."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.  - The Balearic Islands are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.  - Roussillon (or ; ) is one of the historical counties of the former Principality of Catalonia, corresponding roughly to the present-day southern French \\"département\\" of Pyrénées-Orientales (Eastern Pyrenees). It may also refer to \\"Northern Catalonia\\" or \\"French Catalonia\\", the first used by Catalan-speakers and the second used by French-speakers. A 1998 survey found that 34% of respondents stated they speak Catalan, and a further 21% understand it.  - Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula. Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the \\"vicarius\\" for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name, Hispania, was also used in the period of Visigothic rule.  - The Visigoths were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread during the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.  - Languedoc-Roussillon  is a former administrative region of France. Since 1 January 2016, it is part of the new region Occitanie. It comprises five departments, and borders the other French regions of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Rhône-Alpes, Auvergne, Midi-Pyrénées on the one side, and Spain, Andorra and the Mediterranean Sea on the other side. It is the southernmost region of mainland France.  - Hispania Ulterior (English: \\"Further Spain\\", or occasionally \\"Thither Spain\\") was a region of Hispania during the Roman Republic, roughly located in Baetica and in the Guadalquivir valley of modern Spain and extending to all of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca province) and Gallaecia (modern Northern Portugal and Galicia). Its capital was Corduba.  - The Iberian Peninsula , also known as Iberia , is located in the southwest corner of Europe. The peninsula is principally divided between Portugal and Spain, comprising most of their territory. It also includes Andorra and a small part of France along the peninsula's northeastern edge, as well as Gibraltar on its south coast, a small peninsula which forms an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. With an area of approximately , it is the second largest European peninsula, after the Scandinavian.  - Languedoc ( Occitan: \\"Lengadòc\\" ) is a former province of France. Its territory is now contained in the modern-day region of Occitanie in the south of France. Its capital city was Toulouse. It had an area of approximately 27,376 square kilometers (10,570 square miles).  - The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in about 30 BC to the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so-called \\"Dominate\\".  - Gallia Narbonensis (Latin for \\"Gaul of Narbonne\\", from its chief settlement) was a Roman province located in what is now Languedoc and Provence, in southern France. It was also known as Provincia Nostra (\\"our Province\\"), from its having been the first Roman province north of the Alps, and as Gallia Transalpina (\\"Transalpine Gaul\\"), distinguishing it from Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy. It became a Roman province in the late 2nd century BC. Its boundaries were roughly defined by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and the Cévennes and Alps to the north and west. The western region of Gallia Narbonensis was known as Septimania.  - Arius (250 or 256336) was a Christian presbyter and ascetic of Berber origin, and priest in Baucalis in Alexandria, Egypt. His teachings about the nature of the Godhead in Christianity, which emphasized the Father's divinity over the Son, and his opposition to what would become the dominant Christology, Homoousian Christology, made him a primary topic of the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened by Emperor Constantine the Great in 325.  - Tarraco is the ancient name of the current city of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain). It was the oldest Roman settlement on the Iberian Peninsula, founded during the Second Punic War by Scipio Calvus, and became capital of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, and of Hispania Tarraconensis during the Roman Empire.   - Septimania (  ) was the western region of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed under the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. It corresponded roughly with the modern French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the eighth century before its conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (\\"Marca Gothica\\").  - God the Father is a title given to God in various religions, most prominently in Christianity. In mainstream trinitarian Christianity, God the Father is regarded as the first person of the Trinity, followed by the second person God the Son (Jesus Christ) and the third person God the Holy Spirit. Since the second century, Christian creeds included affirmation of belief in \\"God the Father (Almighty)\\", primarily as his capacity as \\"Father and creator of the universe\\". Yet, in Christianity the concept of God as the father of Jesus Christ goes metaphysically further than the concept of God as the Creator and father of all people, as indicated in the Apostle's Creed where the expression of belief in the \\"Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth\\" is immediately, but separately followed by in \\"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord\\", thus expressing both senses of fatherhood.  - Arianism, in Christianity, is a Christological concept that asserts that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who was created by God the Father at a point in time, is distinct from the Father and is, therefore subordinate to God and not the same as. Arian teachings were first attributed to Arius (c. AD 250336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt. The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the prevailing theological views held by proto-orthodox Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. The Arian concept of Christ is that the Son of God did not always exist but was created by God the Father.  - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire.  - The term tetrarchy (from the , \\"tetrarchia\\", \\"leadership of four [people]\\") describes any form of government where power is divided among four individuals, but in modern usage usually refers to the system instituted by Roman Emperor Diocletian in 293, marking the end of the Crisis of the Third Century and the recovery of the Roman Empire. This tetrarchy lasted until c. 313, when internecine conflict eliminated most of the claimants to power, leaving Constantine in control of the western half of the empire, and Licinius in control of the eastern half.  - Hispania Citerior (English: \\"Hither Spain\\", or \\"Nearer Spain\\") was a Roman Province in Hispania during the Roman Republic. It was on the eastern coast of Spain down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's Cartagena in the autonomous community of Murcia, Spain. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of Catalonia and Valencia. Further south there was the Roman Province of Hispania Ulterior (\\"Further Spain\\"), which further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the Battle of Ilipa (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River Ebro. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the Celtiberians who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of Hispania Tarraconensis, which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, Hispania Lusitania.  - Gallaecia or Callaecia, also known as Hispania Gallaecia, was the name of a Roman province in the north-west of Hispania, approximately present-day Galicia, northern Portugal, Asturias and Leon and the later Suebic Kingdom of Gallaecia. The Roman cities included the port Cale (Porto), the governing centers Bracara Augusta (Braga), Lucus Augusti (Lugo) and Asturica Augusta (Astorga) and their administrative areas Conventus bracarensis, Conventus lucensis and Conventus asturicensis.  - Reccared ( or Recared ; Latin : Reccaredus ; Spanish : Recaredo ) I ( c. 559 -- 31 May 601 ) ( reigned 586 -- 601 ) was Visigothic King of Hispania , Septimania and Galicia . His reign marked a climactic shift in history , with the king 's renunciation of Arianism in favour of Chalcedonian Christianity in 587 . Reccared was the younger son of King Leovigild by his first wife Theodosia . Like his father , Reccared had his capital at Toledo . The Visigothic kings and nobles were traditionally Arian Christians , while the Hispano - Roman population were Roman Catholics . The Catholic bishop Leander of Seville was instrumental in converting the elder son and heir of Leovigild , Hermenegild , to Catholicism . Leander supported his rebellion and was exiled for his role . When King Leovigild died , within a few weeks of April 21 , 586 , bishop Leander was swift to return to Toledo . The new king had been associated with his father in ruling the kingdom and was acclaimed king by the Visigothic nobles without opposition . In January 587 , Reccared renounced Arianism for Catholicism , the single great event of his reign and the turning point for Visigothic Hispania . Most Arian nobles and ecclesiastics followed his example , certainly those around him at Toledo , but there were Arian uprisings , notably in Septimania , his northernmost province , beyond the Pyrenees , where the leader of opposition was the Arian bishop Athaloc , who had the reputation among his Catholic enemies of being virtually a second Arius . Among the secular leaders of the Septimanian insurrection , the counts Granista and Wildigern appealed to Guntram of Burgundy , who saw his opportunity and sent his dux Desiderius . Reccared 's army defeated the Arian insurgents and their Catholic allies with great slaughter , Desiderius himself being slain . The next conspiracy broke out in the west , Lusitania , headed by Sunna , the Arian bishop of Mérida , and count Seggo . Claudius , Reccared 's dux Lusitaniae , put down the rising , Sunna being banished...  - Theodoric II (Gothic: Þiudareiks II), \\"Teodorico\\" in Spanish and Portuguese, (426  early 466) was the eighth King of Visigoths from 453 to 466.  - Lusitania or Hispania Lusitana was an ancient Iberian Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). It was named after the Lusitani or Lusitanian people (an Indo-European people). Its capital was \\"Emerita Augusta\\" (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own in the Roman Empire. Romans first came to the territory around the mid 2nd century BC. A war with Lusitanian tribes followed, from 155 to 139 BC. In 27 BC, the province was created.

Stanley Donen ( DAWN-@n; born April 13, 1924) is an American film director and choreographer whose most celebrated works are Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, both of which he co-directed with actor and dancer Gene Kelly. Other noteworthy films include Royal Wedding, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face, Indiscreet, Damn Yankees!, Charade, and Two for the Road. He began his career in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. Stanley Donen was born in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the daughter of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis was born in August 1937. Although born to Jewish parents, he became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy as one of the few Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he \\"must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where everything seemed to be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me.\\" He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him.  Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance lessons in Columbia and performed at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took further dance lessons. One of his early instructors in New York was Ned Wayburn, who had taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910. After graduating from high school at sixteen, Donen attended the University of South Carolina for one summer semester, studying psychology. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott. The titular Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer Gene Kelly, who became a Broadway star in the role.  Abbott cast Donen in the chorus of his next Broadway show Best Foot Forward. He became the show's assistant stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best Foot Forward, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did he decide to become a cheoreographer?","output":"Stanley Donen decided to become a choreographer after he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, directed by the legendary George Abbott.

Clothes protect people from the elements, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. However, clothing that is too sheer, thin, small, tight, etc., offers less protection. Clothes also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific environmental hazards, such as insects, noxious chemicals, weather, weapons, and contact with abrasive substances. Conversely, clothing may protect the environment from the clothing wearer, as with doctors wearing medical scrubs. Q: What type of hazard is noxious chemicals?","output":"Noxious chemicals are a type of environmental hazard. They are substances that can be harmful or lethal to humans and other living organisms, especially if they are inhaled, ingested or come into contact with skin. These could include anything from pesticides and industrial chemicals to certain types of cleaning products. Clothing designed to protect against such hazards is commonly used in industries where workers are likely to be exposed to dangerous substances, like in chemical plants, laboratories, or certain healthcare settings.  This special clothing is often referred to as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and may include items like chemically resistant suits, gloves, boots, goggles, respirators, and more. These garments are designed to create a barrier between the wearer and the harmful substances they could potentially come into contact with. This barrier minimizes exposure and therefore reduces the risk of harm or injury to the person wearing them. Scientists and researchers in labs, for example, might use lab coats, gloves, and safety goggles to protect their skin and eyes from spills or splashes of corrosive or toxic substances. Workers in the cleanup or transportation of hazardous waste also utilize similar protection methods, often with more extensive coverage.  Meanwhile, healthcare workers may use PPE like aprons, gloves, and face shields to protect themselves from exposure to infectious biological hazards, including body fluids that may contain viruses or bacteria. While not often thought of as “noxious chemicals,” these biological hazards can also be extremely harmful if they come into contact with unprotected skin or mucous membranes, illustrating even further the crucial role clothing can play in protection. Altogether, clothing serves a significant protective role, whether it's against the elements, physical hazards, or chemical and biological ones. It is essential to choose and use the correct type of protective clothing based on the risks present in a given environment or activity, in order to ensure the best possible protection against potential hazards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Katrina hated to be in charge, preferring to stay in the background and follow the lead of others. As someone with a quiet and introverted personality, she found that the pressure and expectations that came with being in charge were overwhelming and far outside her comfort zone. Rachel, on the other hand, thrived when she was in control of a situation or leading a team. Her assertiveness and take-charge attitude made her a natural leader, while her determination helped her see projects through to completion. Rachel enjoyed organizing, delegating, and being in a position where she could make decisions and ensure tasks were completed efficiently. The differences in their personalities complemented each other well in a team setting. While Rachel was calling the shots and directing the group, Katrina was happy to support her by quietly handling smaller tasks and taking care of details that Rachel might have overlooked.

CHAPTER XX  Valentin de Bellegarde died, tranquilly, just as the cold, faint March dawn began to illumine the faces of the little knot of friends gathered about his bedside. An hour afterwards Newman left the inn and drove to Geneva; he was naturally unwilling to be present at the arrival of Madame de Bellegarde and her first-born. At Geneva, for the moment, he remained. He was like a man who has had a fall and wants to sit still and count his bruises. He instantly wrote to Madame de Cintre, relating to her the circumstances of her brother's death--with certain exceptions--and asking her what was the earliest moment at which he might hope that she would consent to see him. M. Ledoux had told him that he had reason to know that Valentin's will--Bellegarde had a great deal of elegant personal property to dispose of--contained a request that he should be buried near his father in the church-yard of Fleurieres, and Newman intended that the state of his own relations with the family should not deprive him of the satisfaction of helping to pay the last earthly honors to the best fellow in the world. He reflected that Valentin's friendship was older than Urbain's enmity, and that at a funeral it was easy to escape notice. Madame de Cintre's answer to his letter enabled him to time his arrival at Fleurieres. This answer was very brief; it ran as follows:--  \\"I thank you for your letter, and for your being with Valentin. It is a most inexpressible sorrow to me that I was not. To see you will be nothing but a distress to me; there is no need, therefore, to wait for what you call brighter days. It is all one now, and I shall have no brighter days.

Background: Gaius Julius Caesar (; 12 or 13 July 100 BC - 15 March 44 BC), known by his cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as a notable author of Latin prose. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Context: Caesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.  In response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.  In 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.  While Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.  Though the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities. Question: did he win? Answer:","output":"Yes, Julius Caesar was largely victorious in his military campaigns, particularly during the Gallic Wars. Despite facing challenges and strong opposition from various Gallic tribes, Caesar's strategic and military prowess enabled him to subdue and conquer much of Gaul. His efforts to unite the Gallic tribes under Vercingetorix were ultimately unsuccessful, leading to their defeat at the Battle of Alesia. Caesar's Roman forces faced three million men, resulting in the death of one million and the enslavement of another million, according to Plutarch. Caesar's campaigns led to the subjugation of 300 tribes and the destruction of 800 cities. While Caesar did face setbacks, such as his initial invasion of Britain, he ultimately emerged victorious in many of his military engagements, solidifying Rome's hold on new territories and expanding the reach of the Roman Empire. However, these military victories did not translate into lasting political stability for Caesar, as the First Triumvirate eventually dissolved, and tensions between Caesar and Pompey escalated, pushing Rome towards civil war. Nevertheless, when examining Julius Caesar's military campaigns and conquests, especially during the Gallic Wars, it can be concluded that he was indeed victorious in many of his endeavors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Leslie Feist was born on 13 February 1976 in Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada. Her parents are both artists. Her father, Harold Feist, is an American-Canadian abstract expressionist painter who taught at both the Alberta College of Art and Design and Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. Her mother, Lyn Feist, was a student of ceramics from Saskatchewan. Context: In 1991, at age 15, Feist got her start in music when she founded and was the lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo (not to be confused with the English band Placebo). She and her bandmates won a local Battle of the Bands competition and were awarded the opening slot at the festival Infest 1993, featuring the Ramones. At this concert she met Brendan Canning, whose band hHead performed immediately before hers, and with whom she joined in Broken Social Scene ten years later.  In 1995, Feist was forced to take time off from music to recover from vocal cord damage. She moved from Calgary to Toronto in 1996. That year she was asked by Noah Mintz of hHead to play bass in his solo project Noah's Arkweld. She played the bass guitar in Noah's Arkweld for a year despite never having played bass before. In 1998, she became the rhythm guitarist for the band By Divine Right and toured with them throughout 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also played guitar for some live performances by Bodega, but was never an official member of the band.  In 1999, Feist moved into a Queen West apartment above Come As You Are with a friend of a friend, Merrill Nisker, who then began to perform as electro-punk musician Peaches. Feist worked the back of the stage at Peaches' shows, using a sock puppet and calling herself \\"Bitch Lap Lap\\". The two also toured together in England from 2000-2001, staying with Justine Frischmann of Elastica and MIA Feist appeared as a guest vocalist on The Teaches of Peaches. Feist appears in Peaches' video for the song \\"Lovertits\\", suggestively rubbing and licking a bike. Later, Feist covered this song with Gonzales (whom she met while touring with Peaches) on her album Open Season. In 2006, Feist contributed backup vocals on a track entitled \\"Give 'Er\\", which appeared on Peaches' album Impeach My Bush. Question: Which band is she in currently?.

With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly.  Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction? The answer to this question is:","output":"Your new cell phone is being charged using induction. Step 1: Identify the charging method used by the previous phone - The previous phone's charging method required a direct connection between the charger and the phone, which indicates that it was using conduction. Step 2: Analyze the charging method of the new phone - The new phone's charging method does not require a direct connection between the charger and the phone. Instead, it utilizes a charging dock, indicating that it's using a different method than conduction. Step 3: Determine which charging method is being used - There are two primary methods of wireless charging: induction and resonance. Given that the new phone uses a charging dock and does not require direct contact between the charger and the phone, this suggests that it's using induction, as resonance generally requires special equipment and is not as commonly used for consumer electronics. Conclusion: The new cell phone is being charged using induction. This is because it does not require a direct connection between the charger and the phone, and instead relies on a charging dock for wireless power transfer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.  Question: \\"The Pope's visit to what country may have helped motivate the release of prisoners from that country?\\" Answer: \\"Mexico\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is incorrect.

Last month we reported about a study that showed eating even a little less salt could greatly help the heart. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists used a computer model to predict how just three grams less salt a day would affect heart disease in the United States.  The scientists said the results would be thirteen percent fewer heart attacks, eight percent fewer strokes , four percent fewer deaths and eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings. Researchers said it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety-two thousand deaths every year.  They and public health professionals in the United States are interested in a national campaign to persuade people to eat less salt. Such campaigns are already in place in Britain, Japan and Finland.  Michael Alderman is among the critics. He is a high blood pressure expert and professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Doctor Alderman says that eating less salt results in lower blood pressure. But he says studies have not clearly shown that lowering salt means fewer heart attacks or strokes. And he says salt has other biological effects. He says calling for reduction in the national diet could have good effects, but it could also have harmful results. He says there is not enough evidence _ .  Another critic is David McCarron, a nutrition and kidney disease expert at the University of California, Davis. He and his team looked at large studies of diets in thirty-three countries. They found that most people around the world eat about the same amount of salt. Most of them eat more salt than American health officials advise. Doctor McCarron says the worldwide similarity suggests that a person's brain might decide how much salt to eat.  Both Doctor McCarron and Doctor Alderman have connections to the Salt Institute, a trade group for the salt industry. Doctor Alderman is a member of an advisory committee. But he says he receives no money from the group. Doctor McCarron is paid for offering advice to the Salt Institute.

Because heat is not spontaneously generated, the oven must be turned on to generate the heat necessary to boil the water in the tank above it. This act of turning on the oven is a necessary first step in the process. To boil water, we need a source of heat.

The Republic of the Union of Myanmar is otherwise known by what name????","output":"The Republic of the Union of Myanmar is also commonly known as Burma. To provide a deeper understanding, allow me to give you an insight into the historical background that led to such a duality in names. Myanmar, located in Southeast Asia, sits between Bangladesh, India, China, Laos, and Thailand, making it a culturally diverse country. The British annexed Burma (Myanmar) as a province of India in 1886. They named it Burma based on the dominant ethnic group, the Bamar people. The nation gained independence from the British on 4 January 1948, after a series of resistance movements, and officially became the 'Union of Burma.' However, nearly four decades later, in 1989, the ruling military junta changed the country's official name from \\"Burma\\" to \\"Myanmar\\" as part of a broader set of reforms aimed at eradicating vestiges of British colonial rule. \\"Myanmar\\" is derived from the local short-form name \\"Myanmah\\" and is thought to be representative of all the diverse ethnic groups within the country, more inclusive than the original \\"Burma\\", which is closely associated with the Bamar ethnic group. It is noteworthy to mention that the dispute over the name change is largely a political one. It was announced by a military regime that, among certain segments of the population, particularly pro-democracy groups and many countries, has not earned recognition. As a result, some entities, predominantly Western ones, still refer to the country as Burma. For instance, the United States and United Kingdom officially do not recognize \\"Myanmar\\" and continue to use \\"Burma.\\" In general parlance today, both names are used interchangeably, and both are recognized. Myanmar is more formally acknowledged in diplomacy, international relations, and legal contexts, whereas Burma is more commonly used in informal speech and writings, especially among those who still challenge the legitimacy of the government that proposed the name change. The people from this country can be referred to as Burmese in English, while in official contexts, such as the United Nations, \\"Myanmar\\" is used to refer to the country and its people.  Regardless of its name, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (or Burma) is a mesmerizing country known for its rich culture, history, and significant Buddhist sites, in particular, the stunning pagodas located all over the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Hydnum is a genus of fungi in the Hydnaceae family. They are notable for their unusual spore-bearing structures of teeth rather than gills. The best known are the edible species \\"Hydnum repandum\\" and \\"H. rufescens\\". The word is derived from \\"(h)udnon\\"/, an Ancient Greek word for truffle. The white or buff \\"Hydnum repandum\\" has a spore scatterer of still another shape. The smooth cap grows as wide as 8 inches across. The stem is off-center and is less than 2 inches long. \\"Hydnum\\" has many brittle, white teeth from which the spores drop. The mushrooms of the \\"Hydnum\\" group grow both on ground and on wood. Some species have teeth which hang from ascending branches, while other species have teeth which project downwards from the undersurfaces of dead wood. Most \\"Hydnum\\" are safe to eat.  - The Hydnaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. Originally the family encompassed all species of fungi that produced basidiocarps (fruit bodies) having a hymenium (spore-bearing surface) consisting of slender, downward-hanging tapering extensions referred to as \\"spines\\" or \\"teeth\\", whether they were related or not. This artificial but often useful grouping is now more generally called the hydnoid or tooth fungi. In the strict, modern sense, the Hydnaceae are limited to the genus \\"Hydnum\\" and related genera, with basidiocarps having a toothed or poroid hymenium. Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. \\"Hydnum repandum\\" (the hedgehog fungus) is an edible species, commercially collected in some countries and often marketed under the French name \\"pied de mouton\\".  - The Gomphaceae are a diverse family of fungi belonging in what is classically known as the Phallales or cladistically as the gomphoid-phalloid clade. The family has 13 genera and 287 species.  - The Cantharellaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains the chanterelles and related species, a group of fungi that superficially resemble agarics (gilled mushrooms) but have smooth, wrinkled, or gill-like hymenophores (spore-bearing undersurfaces). Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. Many of the Cantharellaceae, including the chanterelle (\\"Cantharellus cibarius\\"), the Pacific golden chanterelle (\\"Cantharellus formosus\\"), the horn of plenty (\\"Craterellus cornucopioides\\"), and the trumpet chanterelle (\\"Craterellus tubaeformis\\"), are not only edible, but are collected and marketed internationally on a commercial scale.  - The Phallales are an order of fungi in the subclass Phallomycetidae. The order contains three families: the Claustulaceae, the Gomphaceae, and the Phallaceae, which, according to a 2008 estimate, collectively contain 26 genera and 88 species.  - The Cantharellales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. The order includes not only the chanterelles (Cantharellaceae), but also some of the tooth fungi (Hydnaceae), clavarioid fungi (Aphelariaceae and Clavulinaceae), and corticioid fungi (Botryobasidiaceae). Species within the order are variously ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, associated with orchids, or facultative plant pathogens. Those of economic importance include edible and commercially collected \\"Cantharellus\\", \\"Craterellus\\", and \\"Hydnum\\" species as well as crop pathogens in the genera \\"Ceratobasidium\\" and \\"Thanatephorus\\" (\\"Rhizoctonia\\").  - Cantharellus is a genus of popular edible mushrooms, commonly known as chanterelles. They are mycorrhizal fungi, meaning they form symbiotic associations with plants, making them very difficult to cultivate. Caution must be used when identifying chanterelles for consumption due to lookalikes, such as the Jack-O-Lantern species (\\"Omphalotus olearius\\" and others), which can make a person very ill. Despite this, chanterelles are one of the most recognized and harvested groups of edible mushrooms.  - The Agaricomycetes are a class of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. The taxon is roughly identical to that defined for the Homobasidiomycetes (alternatively called holobasidiomycetes) by Hibbett & Thorn, with the inclusion of Auriculariales and Sebacinales. It includes not only mushroom-forming fungi, but also most species placed in the deprecated taxa Gasteromycetes and Homobasidiomycetes. Within the subdivision Agaricomycotina, which already excludes the smut and rust fungi, the Agaricomycetes can be further defined by the exclusion of the classes Tremellomycetes and Dacrymycetes, which are generally considered to be jelly fungi. However, a few former \\"jelly fungi\\", such as \\"Auricularia\\", are classified in the Agaricomycetes. According to a 2008 estimate, Agaricomycetes include 17 orders, 100 families, 1147 genera, and about 21000 species. Modern molecular phylogenetic analyses have been since used to help define several new orders in the Agaricomycetes: Amylocorticiales, Jaapiales, Stereopsidales, and Lepidostromatales.  - The Aphelariaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains a small group of tropical and subtropical clavarioid fungi, but is not well characterized and has not been the subject of published research.  - The Clavulinaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family is not well defined, but currently comprises species of clavarioid (club and coral) fungi as well as some corticioid (crust- and patch-forming) fungi. These species are nutritionally diverse, some being ectomycorrhizal, others wood-rotting saprotrophs, others lichenized, and yet others lichenicolous (growing on or parasitizing lichens).  - Phallaceae is a family of fungi, commonly known as stinkhorn mushrooms, within the order Phallales. Stinkhorns have a worldwide distribution, but are especially prevalent in tropical regions. They are known for their foul-smelling, sticky spore masses, or gleba, borne on the end of a stalk called the receptaculum. The characteristic fruiting-body structure, a single, unbranched receptaculum with an externally attached gleba on the upper part, distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass typically smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although there is great diversity in body structure shape among the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as \\"eggs\\". According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species.  - Phallomycetidae is a subclass of the class Agaricomycetes of fungi.  - The Botryobasidiaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains a group of corticioid fungi that form thin, web-like basidiocarps. Some species form asexual anamorphs producing chlamydospores. All are believed to be wood-rotting or litter-rotting saprotrophs. None is known to be of any economic importance.  - Craterellus is a genus of generally edible fungi similar to the closely related chanterelles, with some new species recently moved from the latter to the former. Both groups lack true gills on the underside of their caps, though they often have gill-like wrinkles and ridges.  - The Gomphales are an order of basidiomycete fungi . Some or all families belonging to Gomphales have been sometimes included in the order Phallales ( and vice versa - they are also sometimes treated as synonyms ) , the now - obsolete Ramariaceae was also previously included in Cantharellales . Recent phylogenetic analyses include in Gomphales the families of the original description of the order by W. Jülich , with addition of Clavariadelphaceae . According to one 2008 estimate , the Gomphales contain 18 genera and 336 species .    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\".  In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.  Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.

What is a question about this article? If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \\"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \\"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major.

Though the process of human reproduction and development consists of a series of fixed, biological stages such as mating, fertilization, growth, and maturity, external factors like culture, society, and religion can still have an influence. In this case, becoming more religious can lead to potential changes in values, beliefs, and behavior surrounding procreation and family planning. Possible indirect effects of increased religiousness on the growth of fetuses may include: 1. Attitudes towards contraception and family planning: If religious beliefs discourage the use of contraception or encourage having larger families, this could lead to an increase in the number of pregnancies, and therefore more fetuses. 2. Beliefs about the sanctity of life and abortion: A higher religiosity might lead to stronger anti-abortion stances, further contributing to an increase in the number of fetuses brought to term. 3. Changes in sexual behavior: Becoming more religious may impact sexual behavior, either by promoting abstinence until marriage or by discouraging casual sexual encounters. Consequently, the number of potential pregnancies and growing fetuses could be affected. 4. Influence on social norms and expectations: An increase in religiosity may lead to shifts in societal expectations surrounding family size, the role of women and men, and when it is appropriate to start a family. These changes can also indirectly impact the number of pregnancies and growing fetuses. It is important to note that the influence of religion on the growth of fetuses is not a direct alteration or interference in the biological process of human development.

Fossett had one of his team members develop a more advanced balloon autopilot that would allow him to sleep and do other tasks while flying safely. Steve Fossett attempted the hot-air balloon trip around the world six times. This was not easy to do. He flew in the balloon'scapsule   that was too small to stand upright. During his fourth attempt in 1998, he was almost killed during a storm off the coast of Australia. He fell 9,000 meters into the Coral Sea with his balloon's capsule on fire. He was later rescued at sea. Fossett successfully made the trip in 2002. The trip started and ended in Australia. He traveled more than 33,000 kilometers for more than 14 days. On this flight, Fossett set other records including a speed record of 322 kilometers per hour. One main problem with earlier balloon flights was the threat of dangerous storms. A team of weather experts e-mailed and talked to Fossett by a satellite telephone to help him avoid such weather. Steve Fossett's hot-air balloon is now at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

Write an article based on this \\"Donald Trump's anticipated appointment of Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State firms the view that his administration's policy will be transactional, a change that will benefit Russia.\\"","output":"Title: The Implications of Rex Tillerson's Appointment as Secretary of State on U.S.-Russia Relations Introduction Donald Trump's anticipated appointment of Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has sparked extensive discussions on the potential consequences of such a decision for the United States' international relations, particularly with Russia. This article examines the possible implications of Tillerson's appointment for the U.S.-Russia relationship, focusing on the idea that the Trump administration's policy will be more transactional compared to those of previous administrations. Background of Rex Tillerson Rex Tillerson has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil, beginning as a production engineer in 1975 and rising through the ranks to assume the top executive position in 2006. His professional background has made him a prominent figure in the energy industry, and his leadership has seen Exxon Mobil expand to become one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies. With operations in over 50 countries, Tillerson's experience has been largely focused on securing energy deals and development projects across the globe. Tillerson's Links to Russia Throughout his tenure at Exxon Mobil, Rex Tillerson has developed strong ties with Russia and its state-owned oil company, Rosneft. In 2011, he signed a landmark deal with Rosneft, estimated at 500 billion, to explore the vast Arctic and Russian Black Sea regions' crude oil reserves. This agreement established Tillerson as a significant figure in the Russian business community and led to him being awarded the Order of Friendship by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. The Potential Impact on U.S.-Russia Relations With his experience as CEO of Exxon Mobil and his documented relationships with key Russian figures, it is possible that Tillerson's appointment as Secretary of State may significantly influence U.S. foreign policy towards Russia. The following factors are worth considering: 1. A Shift Toward Transactional Diplomacy: Tillerson's background in business may result in a more transactional approach to diplomacy. The Trump administration may prioritize economic and trade interests over traditional U.S. foreign policy concerns, including human rights and the global promotion of democracy. This newly-emphasized focus on practical and economic cooperation could create new opportunities for the U.S. and Russia, as both countries may seek to break existing deadlocks and pursue joint energy projects. 2. Sanctions Relief: The current U.S. sanctions against Russia — imposed in response to the annexation of Crimea and Moscow's support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine — have limited Exxon Mobil's ability to pursue its 2011 agreement with Rosneft. Tillerson, who has criticized these sanctions, could push for their rollback as Secretary of State. This move would benefit Russia and its struggling economy, which has been hampered by decreased oil prices and Western sanctions. Sanctions relief could also enable both countries to explore potential collaborations in the energy sector. 3. A Realpolitik Approach to International Relations: Tillerson's appointment as Secretary of State coincides with Trump's stated willingness to engage in realpolitik and focus on pragmatic, mutually beneficial agreements. This approach could alter the tone of U.S.-Russia relations, with both nations pursuing options for cooperation that supersede their long-standing ideological differences. In this context, Russia might emerge as a key partner for the United States, particularly in areas such as counterterrorism, arms control, and energy development. Conclusion While Rex Tillerson's anticipated appointment as Secretary of State has raised concerns about the potential reorientation of U.S. foreign policy towards Russia, it is important to recognize that any shifts are likely to be gradual and contingent upon the broader evolution of global politics. Critics argue that closer U.S.-Russia relations could embolden Putin's authoritarian regime and undermine liberal international order. However, proponents of this change argue that a more transactional approach could facilitate cooperation and stability in an increasingly multipolar world. Ultimately, the direction of U.S.-Russia relations in the Trump administration will depend on a myriad of factors, including congressional dynamics, international crises, and public opinion. Tillerson's appointment does signal the potential for a distinct rethinking of American foreign policy and its priorities, particularly with respect to transactional diplomacy and the importance of economic cooperation. As such, his tenure may indeed redefine the U.S.-Russia relationship and shape the contours of global politics in the coming years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: People who are refined have opinions, but they tend to keep them to themselves when they involve other people in a negative light. If you want to be refined, then you should be above gossiping about other people, starting rumors, or asking if your two co-workers or classmates are hooking up. If you have the reputation of being a gossip, then people won’t think of you as refined at all; instead, they’ll see you as an unsophisticated, immature person. To be truly refined, you should be positive if you plan on talking about a person who isn’t in the room.  Instead, practice saying nice things about people “behind their backs.” Say nice things about people who aren’t in the room and it will get back to them. Refined people don’t pick fights with people and don’t make a big deal about it if they disagree with something. They are still comfortable stating their opinions, but they don’t do so to make other people feel bad or to look superior. If you find someone challenging your ideas when you’re having a conversation, then you should be polite about disagreeing, and not resort to name calling. Refined people should be easy to get along with, and are easygoing and tend to go with the flow instead of being prickly or confrontational.  If you’re asked to settle an argument and know the answer — lets say people are debating about whether a quote is attributed to The Bible or Shakespeare — then it’s best to say you’re not sure of the answer even if you do. There’s no need to cause conflict. If someone is trying to tell you your opinions are worthless, do not engage. Take the high road and exit the conversation instead of being determined to prove the person wrong. Refined people are knowledgeable and interesting, but they don’t need to brag to make it known. Even if you’ve memorized every scene in every Goddard film or speak eight foreign languages, you shouldn’t go telling everyone you know. Instead, wait for your areas of interest to come up in conversation so that people can be impressed by how much you know instead of thinking you’re obnoxious for showing off. When you share what you do know, don’t act like an authority but just casually mention the information in a friendly way instead.  You should praise people on their achievements as often as you can instead of harping on your own. If you’ve really accomplished a lot, then people will hear about it. If they mention it, be modest instead of acting like yeah, you know you’re pretty great. If you really want to be refined, then it’s important for you to spend time with like-minded people. Refined people spend time with other people they can talk to about politics, wine, traveling, other cultures, foreign films, cultural events in their areas, and other subjects of interest. They don’t spend time with too many people who can’t contribute much to a conversation or who don’t listen to anything other than Top 40 and watch Judge Judy for a cultural good time. They tend to be friends with people who can stimulate them and encourage them to be even better than they are.  Though it’s not refined to completely ditch someone in your circle because you think that person makes you look bad, you should think about the company you keep. If you think you spend too much time with people who are vulgar, lack class, and who bring you down, then it’s time to reconsider those relationships. People who are refined have interesting opinions about politics, sports, cuisine, wine, and other subjects, but they try to avoid being a bore and talking about them all night long. They also tend to avoid being self-absorbed and talking about themselves incessantly. They’d prefer to talk about other people or about interesting world matters instead. It’s not refined to do 90% of the talking in a conversation, no matter how interesting you may think you are. If you’ve noticed that you’re dominating a conversation, switch gears and ask the people you’re with light questions, from what they’re doing this weekend to what their favorite sports team is. Good manners are a sign of refinement. In order to have good manners, you’ll need to eat with your mouth closed, avoid cursing, wait your turn, hold doors and pull out chairs for people, and generally conduct yourself in an admirable fashion. People with good manners are sensitive to the needs of others and make sure other people, whether they are guests or serving you coffee, are feeling comfortable. Ask people how they are, respect their space, and avoid making a mess if you want to have good manners. Be polite. Always greet people in a friendly fashion, introduce yourself to people you don’t know if they join a conversation, and avoid being unnecessarily rude to people even if you think they deserve it. You don’t have to speak seventeen languages to be cultured, but it does help to know something about other cultures, whether it’s knowing how to correctly pronounce “foie gras” when you order at a French restaurant, or you know that, in certain cultures, it’s polite to remove your shoes when you enter a person’s house. There’s no one way to suddenly become cultured, but you can make an effort to get to know how people live in other parts of the world, to watch foreign films, sample the cuisines of other countries, and most importantly, avoid having the attitude that everything is done the “right way” in your country.  Make a point of attending cultural events in your area, whether there are local theatres or museum openings. Read, read, read. Become knowledgeable on everything from ancient philosophy to contemporary poetry. Refined people tend to be very well-read. Refined people speak with extreme tact and understand that they have to choose their words and timing carefully when it comes to saying something. They don’t overstep their bounds and get too friendly with people they don’t know that well, they deflect negative comments from others, and they are able to be discreet when it’s necessary. They are masters at being gracious and don’t make people feel embarrassed in public.  Have a sense of a person’s sense of humor before you try to make a joke. Avoid mentioning how much money you make or asking about a person’s salary. That is seen as crude and not tactful at all. If someone has something in his teeth, for example, a tactful person would try to tell him privately. Tactful people also know that timing is important. You may be excited to announce that you’re pregnant, but you should see that you should avoid doing this when your friend is gushing about her engagement. Summary:","output":"Being refined means being polite, kind, and respectful to others. Refined people don't gossip or say mean things about others who aren't there. They don't pick fights or try to make others feel bad. If they disagree with you, they'll do it in a polite way. They're also easy to get along with and don't always need to be right. Refined people can know a lot, but they don't brag about it. They wait for the right time to share their knowledge in a nice, friendly way. Also, they give compliments to others instead of always talking about what they've done. Some of their friends are people who also talk about things like politics, traveling, or culture. They don't like to spend time with people who are rude or don't have manners. Good manners are important to refined people, like eating nicely, waiting turns, and being kind to others. Refined people also try to learn about different cultures and how things are done in other countries. They read lots and know how to speak carefully so they don't hurt other's feelings. They can make jokes, but only when they know it's okay to do so. And they don't talk about money or try to embarrass others.

MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): Valdes; Rafael, Thorpe, Blackett, James; Harrop, Grimshaw, Young (Weir, 59); A. Pereira, Powell, Fletcher (Love, 65) Subs not used: J. Pereira, Kellett, Willock. Booked: Harrop, Powell, Pereira. Scorers: Pereira 69, Thorpe 84.

Booked: Houghton. Scorer: Solanke 55. The Blues fielded a starting XI of complete juniors whereas United had six players who had represented the first team under Louis van Gaal. The experienced line-up included the likes of former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes, Ashley Young, Rafael and Tyler Blackett. Chelsea began the evening top of the table and started like leaders. Blackett failed to deal with an early delivery from the Blues and the ball fell to Andreas Christensen, but he shot wide from eight yards at a tight angle. The half descended into a scrappy affair with Young the main receiver of some tough challenges from the away side, as neither team managed to conjure up any promising chances. Deadline day loan signing Andy Kellett (centre, back row) was an unused substitute on Monday night. Manchester United had former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes between the sticks on Monday. The contest sprung into life after the break. Young was guilty of a misplaced back pass which left Blackett under unnecessary pressure and the lively Izzy Brown stole the ball to seek out Dominic Solanke at the back post to tap in from a few yards  on 55 minutes. Soon after Young was replaced having played an hour of football on his return to action, having missed five games with a hamstring injury. Chelsea fully deserved their lead and Brown once again impressed. After the hour mark the England Under 19 international jinked past three challenges before whipping in a fierce drive from the edge of the United box. Fortunately for the home side Valdes was ready to react and tip the shot around the post with a smart save. Ashley Young (left) was on the receiving end of several tough challenges during the feisty match. Chelsea captain Jordan Houghton (centre) attempts to win possession from the Manchester United defence. The pivotal moment in the match came when Rafael went on another marauding run forward, to be eventually hauled down on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area. Andreas Pereira took the honour and his effort deflected cruelly off Jay Dasilva in the Chelsea wall and wrong footed Mitchell Beeney to level the match. That was the catalyst for United as minutes later Pereira flashed in another long range free-kick, only for Beeney to pull off a fine reaction save. Chelsea's Dominic Solanke celebrates scoring the opener against Manchester United on 55 minutes. Andreas Pereira fires in Manchester United's first goal, his free-kick delfecting in past Mitchell Beeney. Finally, United were in the ascendancy and made the pressure count in a tense final ten minutes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. There's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numers' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However, by the time the credits roll, there's no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the \\"cop side\\" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'Birthday Girl') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Bottom Line: it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is mostly negative. The reviewer is frustrated with the movie and finds it disappointing.

I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while that's something like what this film is; I also can't help but think that it's just a poor man's Sleuth. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot, but certainly it's the case with the execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest play bombs, Sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, arrives on his doorstep. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work. Despite all of its clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and that's the characters. The film fails to provide a single likable character, and it's very hard to care about the story when you're not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but nobody else does themselves proud. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance. It's lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film. The plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others, but there's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in its own right, and the cinematography fits the film well. Overall, I have to admit that I did enjoy this film; but it could have been much, much better. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review has a mixed opinion about the movie. While it acknowledges that the story is good, with clever twists and turns, and appreciates the style and cinematography by director Sidney Lumet, it also criticizes the lack of likable characters, the acting of Christopher Reeve and Dyan Cannon, as well as stating that it feels like a poor man's Sleuth.

Please answer the following question: -  Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process is \\"water is in the air.\\" This occurs when water vapor, an invisible gaseous form of water, is present in the Earth's atmosphere. Water vapor is generated through various processes such as evaporation, where water from the Earth's surface turns into vapor and rises into the atmosphere, and transpiration, where plants release water vapor through tiny openings in their leaves called stomata. The amount of water vapor in the air can vary depending on factors such as temperature, air pressure, and humidity levels. When the air contains a high amount of water vapor, it creates an environment conducive to the formation of clouds, which are large groups of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. As the air temperature decreases, water vapor in the atmosphere can condense into tiny ice crystals if the temperature falls below the freezing point of water, around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). This is more likely to occur at higher altitudes where the air has cooled sufficiently, such as in the atmosphere's upper troposphere. Once the tiny ice crystals have formed, they can collide with each other due to air currents and turbulence within the cloud. As these ice crystals collide, they can stick together and aggregate through a process called accretion. This causes the ice crystals to grow in size, and over time, they can develop into more intricate and unique shapes that eventually resemble snowflakes. When enough ice crystals have combined, the snowflakes become too heavy to be supported by the air currents within the cloud. They then begin to fall from the cloud due to gravity, and depending on the temperature and conditions below the cloud, they may either fall as snow (if the air is cold enough) or they may melt into rain droplets before reaching the ground in warmer conditions. In summary, the first step of the process of snowflake formation is the presence of water vapor in the air, which is essential to initiate the condensation and freezing processes that ultimately result in the formation of snowflakes and their subsequent descent to the ground as snow."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

The game was the first start for rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill and head coach Joe Philbin. Tannehill became the first Dolphins rookie quarterback to start the first game of the season. Entering the game the Texans are the only team the Dolphins have not beaten, holding a 0-6 record all-time against the team. Both teams moved the ball well on their opening drives, but failed to score. The Dolphins received the ball on their own 42-yard line after a missed field goal by Houston kicker Shayne Graham. After a Reggie Bush recovered fumble on 3rd down on the Houston 14-yard line the Dolphins kicker Dan Carpenter attempted and successfully executed a 39-yard field goal with (3:19) left in the first quarter. Both defenses held steady, keeping both offenses out of the redzone heading to the mid-way point of the second quarter. However, at the (7:35) point, quarterback Tannehill was intercepted by Johnathan Joseph at the 50-yard line for 36 yards. Within the shadow of their own goal posts the Dolphins held the Texans to a Shayne Graham 35-yard field goal. The interception by Tannehill was the first of his career, and marked a downhill spiral for the rest of the game. Following the score the Dolphins moved quickly to the Houston side of the field after a 10-yard rush by Reggie Bush and 32-yard pass to running back Daniel Thomas. But after a few incomplete passes, Tannehill had his pass intended for receiver Legadu Naanee deflected by a defensive lineman and intercepted by linebacker Brian Cushing with (4:06) left in the second quarter. The Texans quickly turned the turnover into points, with an Arian Foster 14-yard rush. On the first play following the Houston kickoff quarterback Tannehill again had his pass deflected by a defensive lineman, but instead was intercepted by Kareem Jackson. After a defensive pass interference penalty, running back Arian Foster rushed for his second rushing touchdown of the game at the (0:49) mark. Again following the kickoff the Dolphins again turned the ball over following a Daniel Thomas fumble. The turnover was shortly followed by a 14-yard pass touchdown from Houston quarterback Matt Schaub to receiver Andre Johnson at the (0:12) mark. Following a quick three and out by the Texans following halftime, punt returner Marcus Thigpen returned a punt for 72 yards for a touchdown.

Duffy successfully passed his medical examination and agreed to the personal terms, officially securing his place in the team. Step 1: Background of Michael Duffy Michael Duffy is an impressive football talent originating from Derry City. As a highly skilled winger, he has demonstrated exceptional abilities on the field and has been a key player for Derry City during his time there. His quick movements, versatility, and agility have impressed spectators and professionals alike. Step 2: The signing process Considering the skills and experience Michael Duffy brings to the table, Celtic was quick to express their interest in securing him for their team. After a period of negotiations, Duffy completed a medical examination, which is standard practice to ensure that a player is physically fit to join a new team. Having passed the medical, Duffy moved on to finalizing the personal terms of his move to Celtic. Step 3: The personal terms agreement The personal terms of a transfer deal usually include the player's salary, contract length, and other clauses that outline the player's rights and responsibilities within the team. In Duffy's case, both parties were satisfied with the negotiated terms, ultimately leading to an official agreement and Duffy's move to Celtic. Step 4: Impact of Duffy's move on Celtic Michael Duffy’s move to Celtic will undoubtedly bolster the team's offensive capabilities. His presence on the wing will provide the team with additional options in attack, while his pace and skill can create opportunities for his teammates as well. Duffy's signing is likely to bring increased competition within the team, pushing other players to improve and maintain their form in order to secure a spot in the starting lineup. Step 5: Derry City's response and future plans Derry City will certainly miss Michael Duffy's contributions to the team, but they will likely move forward with new strategies and possibly scout for potential new talent to fill the void left by Duffy. The transfer fee received from Celtic could be used to invest in the development of the club further, possibly upgrading facilities or strengthening their youth academy. Conclusion: With the signing of Michael Duffy, Celtic has added a valuable player to their team, strengthening their already formidable lineup. Duffy's transfer to the Scottish champions serves as a testament to his footballing abilities and achievements thus far in his career. Fans will surely be eager to see him showcase his skills in the Scottish Premiership and contribute to the team's continued success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Household uses for soaps include washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping, where soaps act as surfactants, emulsifying oils to enable them to be carried away by water. In industry they are also used in textile spinning and are important components of some lubricants.  - A sulfonate is a salt or ester of a sulfonic acid. It contains the functional group R-SO.  - A carboxylate is a salt or ester of a carboxylic acid. \\"Carboxylate salts\\" have the general formula M(RCOO), where M is a metal and \\"n\\" is 1, 2...; \\"carboxylate esters\\" have the general formula RCOOR. R and R are organic groups; R  H.  - Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants.  - Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube).  - Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with \\"soft water\\"). Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone and chalk which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates.  - A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with \\"cleaning properties in dilute solutions.\\" These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water.  - Linear alkylbenzene is a family of organic compounds with the formula C6H5CnH2n +1 . Typically , n lies between 10 and 16 , although generally supplied as a tighter cut , such as C12 - C15 , C12 - C13 and C10 - C13 , for detergent use . The CnH2n +1 chain is unbranched . They are sometimes called LABs . They are mainly produced as intermediate in the production of surfactants , for use in detergent . Since the 1960s , LABs have emerged as the dominant precursor of biodegradable detergents .

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: In-text citations should be provided to readers immediately after you’ve quoted, paraphrased, or referred to information from a source. This will avoid any confusion about where the cited information comes from. The citation should come after the last word of the sentence but before the period. Put all in-text citations in parentheses.  An APA in-text citation for the book Escaping Salem: The Other Witch Hunt of 1692 by Richard Godbeer (2005) would look like this: “While many people immediately think of Salem, Massachusetts when they are asked about witchcraft in America, trials took place in other communities, as well (Godbeer, 2005).” Your reference list (which comes at the end of your paper) will include more information on each source, including the title and publication location. If you’re citing 2 sources by the same author published in the exact same year, it’s important to differentiate between them. Label them with “a,” “b,” “c,” and so on right at the end of the in-text citation. For example, “(Godbeer, 2005a)”  and “(Godbeer, 2005b).” If the sentence has lots of different clauses, it might get confusing for the reader if you put the citation all the way at the end of the line. Instead, include the citation at the end of the clause where you’ve referenced the source. For example, you might write, “Trials for witchcraft often targeted independent or single women (Godbeer, 2005); although there are many possible explanations for why communities might have accused people of practicing witchcraft.” Unlike some other citation styles (like Chicago), APA doesn’t make you include very much information in your in-text citations. If you’re citing a source with 1 identifiable author, all you need is the author’s last name and the publication date. Use “n.d.” (meaning “no date”) if no publication date is provided. When you’re quoting from a book rather than just referring to it or paraphrasing the author’s argument, page numbers are needed to tell your reader exactly where they can find the quotation. For a single page, use the letter “p” followed by a period: “p.” For more than one page, use two p’s followed by a period: “pp.” An in-text citation for a quotation would look like this: “The witchcraft trial in Stamford, Connecticut was very different from the one in Salem, Massachusetts. Community members avoided hysteria and “were for the most part remarkably cautious” during the trial (Godbeer, 2005, p. 7).” There might be times when you’d like to directly refer to the author in your sentence. Since you’ve done this, you don’t have to repeat the author’s last name in your in-text citation. Type out the publication date in parentheses immediately after you’ve stated the author’s name. If you’re quoting from a source, add the page numbers in parentheses at the end of the sentence. This type of in-text citation might look like this: “Godbeer (2005) argues that “seventeenth-century New Englanders believed their world was filled with supernatural forces” such as witchcraft” (pp. 144-145). If you’re citing 2 sources in the same sentence, it’s important to make that clear to your reader. You’ll need to include both authors’ last names and the publication dates of the 2 sources in parentheses at the end of the sentence. Order the 2 sources alphabetically within the parentheses. If you’re citing 2 sources by the same author, order them by their publication date, with older sources coming before newer ones.  For example, perhaps you want to cite both Escaping Salem and The Devil in the Shape of a Woman: Witchcraft in Colonial New England (1998) by Carol F. Karlsen. Your in-text citation would look like this: “(Karlsen, 1998; Godbeer, 2005).” If you were citing Escaping Salem and Richard Godbeer’s earlier book, The Devil’s Dominion: Magic and Religion in Early New England (1992), your citation would look like this: “(Godbeer, 1992; Godbeer, 2005).” Summary:","output":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on how to properly use in-text citations in APA style, detailing how to format citations for different situations, such as quoting, paraphrasing, citing multiple sources, and handling multiple works by the same author."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

Floridians  D. not enough information  === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"B. Californians Step 1: Identify the relevant information. The question asks who will consider a ban of high-capacity ammunition magazines. The passage states: \\"Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines.\\" Step 2: Match the information with the options. The passage clearly states that Californians will be considering this ban. This matches with option B. Step 3: Confirm the answer. Since the passage directly states that Californians are considering the ban of high-capacity ammunition magazines, the correct answer is B. Californians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Carbaminohemoglobin About 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported to the lungs. Carbon dioxide does not bind to iron as oxygen does; instead, carbon dioxide binds amino acid moieties on the globin portions of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin, which forms when hemoglobin and carbon dioxide bind. When hemoglobin is not transporting oxygen, it tends to have a bluish-purple tone to it, creating the darker maroon color typical of deoxygenated blood. The following formula depicts this reversible reaction:.   Q: About 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported where?   Choices:  - brain tissues  - intestines  - bones  - lungs  A: The answer is:","output":"- lungs About 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported to the lungs. This process occurs when carbon dioxide binds to amino acid moieties on the globin portions of hemoglobin to form carbaminohemoglobin. The binding of carbon dioxide and hemoglobin allows for the efficient transportation and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. When hemoglobin is not transporting oxygen, it has a bluish-purple tone, creating the darker maroon color typical of deoxygenated blood. This reversible reaction is essential for maintaining proper levels of carbon dioxide in the body and ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to tissues and organs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The French actor was caught short on a Paris to Dublin flight after the seat belt sign had been switched on for take-off. With the lavatories closed, the 62-year-old called out \\"I need to piss, I need to piss\\". But the cabin crew said no.      So the corpulent star of Cyrano de Bergerac, Jean de Florette and Green Card decides to take matters into his own hands. It is understood the movie star got out of his seat and tried to relieve himself into an empty bottle at the back of the plane but also peed on the floor.      While the scene may have brought the house down in French cinema theatres, the real-life incident failed to raise a laugh on Tuesday from irate passengers of the Dublin-based City Jet airline; they were told Mr Depardieu's antics meant the plane would be grounded for two hours while staff cleaned the carpet.      The French star, who was travelling with two companions, was thrown off the flight with his luggage and told to book another one.      Friends of the actor said he was “completely sober” but desperate to relieve himself. At first he was told he had 15 minutes to wait, but then due to congestion on the runway, he was informed he would have to endure another 20 minutes, they said.      Given his “irrepressible need”, his two travel companions, including the French actor Edouard Baer, offered him an empty bottle as a last resort.      They said he had no choice but to use it, but that he did it “without any provocation and after making sure he wasn’t seen”.      A little urine was spilt on the floor, which the actor offered to clean up himself, saying he was “sorry” for the inconvenience caused, they said.      “No proceedings or fine were signalled to him and he had the feeling the misunderstanding and the inflexible attitude of the hostess were understood by his interlocutors,” they said.      An outraged female passenger told France's Europe 1 radio: \\"Mr Depardieu got up, calling out 'I need to piss, I need to piss'\\" as the plane was heading to the runway.      \\"The air hostess replied: 'I am sorry, you'll have to wait 15 minutes until we are in the air, everyone is strapped in, the lavatories are shut, I can do nothing for you.'      \\"He said: 'No, I cannot wait.' He got up, and did it on the ground.      \\"The hostess was shocked, but nothing was said – everything was done courteously.\\"      \\"Mr Depardieu sat down again, and we went back to the plane parking space.\\"      The passengers said she was \\"outraged\\" by an actor who \\"thinks he is not like others, that he has to abide by their rules. He could've waited a couple of minutes.\\"      City Jet confirmed that an incident took place but declined to name the individual involved.      On Twitter, CityJet chose to see the funny side of the incident.      \\"As you may have seen on the news, we are busy mopping the floor of one of our planes this morning...,\\" read a first message.      A second read: \\"We'd also like to remind all passengers that our planes are fully equipped with toilet facilities...\\"      Mr Depardieu's agent said he declined to comment on the incident.      This is by no means the famously tempestuous food and wine-loving star's first brush with controversy.      In 2005, he smoked on a Jonathan Ross chat show on BBC ONE, and branded his fellow countrymen a bunch of \\"cretins\\". Later that year he knocked out a paparazzo with a headbutt after he photographed him with a female companion.      Last year, he called a female TV journalist a \\"slut\\" after she asked a question about his deceased son, Guillaume, then dubbed his fellow French male actors \\"narcissistic\\" and \\"self-satisfied\\". A real actor, he said was one who \\"has vomit on him, who stinks, who has just crapped a bit out of fear.\\"      Then he caused a furore last August by branding Oscar-winning French actress Juliette Binoche a \\"nothing\\" and a \\"nobody\\".      This drew a fierce response from French actors, one of whom, Annie Duperey said: \\"Gérard Depardieu talks rubbish. At this stage of his fame and drunkenness he thinks anything goes.      \\"He was a great actor but he should shut his mouth.\\"      Mr Depardieu was voted France's third most irritating celebrity in a 2010 poll, behind First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and film star Alain Delon.      Although lauded as a genius at his best, he has often been criticised for agreeing to appear in countless flops. Indeed, he recently admitted: \\"I've made 200 films, of which 150 were crap\\".      He had epic, public spats with his son Guillaume, who died three years ago and who described his father as a \\"coward, a cheat and lazy\\" in his autobiography, Tout Donner (Giving Everything).      On a chat show in May, he repeated over and again in slurred speech: \\"I am a piece of garbage.\\" ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A French actor really needed to pee during a flight from Paris to Dublin, but the seatbelt sign was on and the toilets were closed.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. Question: Who takes feedback? Answer: Answer:","output":"Taking feedback is an essential process for everyone, regardless of their background, profession, or personal disposition. It allows individuals to grow, learn from their mistakes, and continuously improve in various aspects of their lives. While it is true that some people may be more receptive to feedback, this is not a quality reserved for specific personality types or levels of expertise. People with varying confidence levels and experiences can take feedback and utilize its value to achieve their personal and professional goals. Confident individuals may find it easier to accept feedback as they believe in their abilities and social standing. They understand that feedback is a tool that can help them fine-tune their skills and further their growth. However, even these individuals may occasionally feel the sting of criticism, as nobody is infallible or impervious to mistakes. On the other hand, people experiencing imposter syndrome or those who are new in their careers may find it more challenging to accept negative feedback. Insecurities about one's abilities and performance can compound the sting of critical comments. However, feedback can still be valuable for such individuals, as it can provide an opportunity to learn, adjust, and develop their skills, ultimately increasing their confidence in the long run. Recognizing the value of feedback relies on a balanced self-perception, in which individuals have confidence in their abilities to improve and achieve their goals, while also acknowledging their current limitations and weaknesses. This mindset allows for an openness to learning and growth, as well as the self-awareness to seek and accept the counsel and guidance of others. To harness the power of feedback and turn it into a growth tool, individuals should actively seek opportunities to learn from their experiences and mistakes. This approach can be facilitated through soliciting feedback, engaging in reflective self-assessment, and implementing changes based on the received input. Ultimately, anyone can take feedback, but how they respond and act upon it determines the extent to which they can truly benefit from it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: Information:  - The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.  - The Crab Pulsar ( PSR B0531 +21 ) is a relatively young neutron star . The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula , a remnant of the supernova SN 1054 , which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054 . Discovered in 1968 , the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically . The optical pulsar is roughly 20 km in diameter and the pulsar \`\` beams '' rotate once every 33 milliseconds , or 30 times each second . The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission , which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula , seen from radio waves through to gamma rays . The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar 's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula , forming a termination shock . The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly , with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp - like features that steepen , brighten , then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula . The period of the pulsar 's rotation is slowing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind . The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy . It is very bright in X-rays and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant , with the exception of the pulsar itself . The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors . In X-ray astronomy , ' crab ' and ' millicrab ' are sometimes used as units of flux density . A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10  11 erg s  1 cm  2 ( 2.4x10  14 W m  2 ) in the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray band , for a \`\` crab - like '' X-ray spectrum , which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy , I ( E ) = 9.5 E  1.1 . Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness .  - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

Does the sentence \\"A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995, leading to Taylor's election as president in 1997.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did the economic community monitoring group do to intervene in the crisis?\\"","output":"The sentence \\"A peace deal between warring parties was reached in 1995, leading to Taylor's election as president in 1997.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What did the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) do to intervene in the crisis?\\" The sentence only provides information on the outcome of a peace deal and its subsequent effects on a political election. However, it is essential to explore the role of ECOMOG to understand their efforts to intervene in the crisis. ECOMOG, a multinational military force assembled by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), played a significant role in resolving various conflicts in West Africa, including the Liberian Civil War. Here is a detailed account of ECOMOG's intervention in the crisis: 1. Deployment of troops: ECOMOG, led by Nigeria, deployed troops to Liberia in 1990 to restore peace and stability in the country, which was devastated by a civil war. The objective was to implement a ceasefire between various warring factions and facilitate the establishment of an interim government. 2. Humanitarian efforts: ECOMOG was involved in providing humanitarian and logistical assistance to Liberian citizens affected by the conflict. They ensured the delivery of relief materials, facilitated medical aid, and helped to restore essential infrastructure required to support the population. 3. Neutralizing warring factions: ECOMOG forces actively sought to neutralize the influence of various armed groups, including Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and other factions, which were responsible for the atrocities committed during the civil war. They employed diplomatic and military strategies to minimize violence and achieve relative peace in the region. 4. Peace negotiations: ECOMOG played a significant role in mediating peace negotiations between the warring parties. They facilitated several rounds of peace talks and played a crucial role in forging agreements such as the Cotonou Accord (1993), the Abuja Agreements (1995), among others. These engagements led to the eventual peace deal in 1995, which the original sentence alluded to, and laid the foundation for the 1997 election. 5. Supervision of disarmament: ECOMOG monitored the disarmament and demobilization of armed groups, ensuring compliance with the agreed-upon conditions set forth in the peace agreements. This process was essential in preventing a resurgence of violence and fostering an environment conducive for democratic governance. 6. Election assistance: In the lead-up to the 1997 election, ECOMOG played a vital role in creating a secure environment for elections to take place. They provided security for election officials and voters, monitored the election process to ensure fairness, and facilitated the logistics necessary for a successful poll. In conclusion, the sentence provided does not properly address the role of ECOMOG in intervening in the crisis. It is essential to highlight the military, humanitarian, and diplomatic efforts of the group in quelling violence, supporting the citizens, and helping to pave the way for a return to democracy in Liberia. ECOMOG's involvement in Liberia was instrumental in achieving the eventual peace deal and setting the stage for the 1997 election."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage.

The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637.

Answer: Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816 Question: what is a chronograph watch Answer:","output":"A chronograph watch is a specialized type of timepiece that combines the traditional watch functions, such as displaying the current time, with a stopwatch feature, allowing for the precise measurement of elapsed time intervals. Chronograph watches are highly valued for their practicality, accuracy, and often sporty appearance. Over the years, they have become an essential tool for anyone involved in aviation, sports, or other activities where timing is crucial. The term \\"chronograph\\" comes from the Greek words \\"chronos,\\" which means time, and \\"graph,\\" which means record. As the name suggests, a chronograph watch records periods of time through its stopwatch functionality, while also continuing to function as a regular watch. Chronograph watches typically consist of a main watch face with an additional set of sub-dials (known as complications) that display the stopwatch measurements. These sub-dials may record the seconds, minutes, and hours elapsed, depending on the specific design of the watch. Furthermore, there are usually two or more buttons (pushers) located on the side of the watch case, which control the start, stop, and reset functions of the chronograph. Louis Moinet is credited with inventing the chronograph in 1816, and his purpose was to create a tool for astronomers to measure the passage of celestial bodies accurately. However, it wasn't until 1821 that the first chronograph wristwatch was developed by Nicolas Mathieu Rieussec, who sought to create a device that could record the times of different horse races. Since then, the chronograph has evolved significantly and has been adopted across many industries and professions due to its versatility and usefulness. Nowadays, chronograph watches are available in a wide variety of styles, materials, and features, ranging from entry-level models to high-end luxury watches with intricate mechanical movements. They often include additional features, such as tachymeters (for measuring speed), telemeters (for measuring distance), and even water-resistance capabilities, making them suitable for various activities and sports. In summary, a chronograph watch is a type of timepiece that offers both traditional watch functions and stopwatch capabilities for measuring elapsed time. From its inception in 1816, the chronograph has become an indispensable tool across many fields, fulfilling various timing needs and even advancing into the realm of high fashion and luxury accessories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Which English Monarch was created ‘Defender of the Faith’ by Pope Leo X?","output":"The English monarch who was bestowed the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" by Pope Leo X was King Henry VIII. This declaration was made on October 11, 1521, and it played a significant role in shaping the religious and political landscape of England during that period. King Henry VIII (1491-1547) was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty and ruled England from 1509 until his death. He is primarily remembered for his six marriages, his desire for a male heir, and his subsequent establishment of the Church of England after a volatile break away from the Roman Catholic Church. The title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" (in Latin, \\"Fidei Defensor\\" or \\"Fidei Defensatrix\\" for a queen regnant) was originally granted by Pope Leo X to King Henry VIII as a recognition of his loyalty and commitment to the Roman Catholic Church. In particular, it was an acknowledgment of the King's publication titled \\"Assertio Septem Sacramentorum\\" or \\"Defense of the Seven Sacraments.\\" In this book, Henry VIII defended the teachings and sacraments of the Catholic Church against the Protestant Reformation, which was initiated by the German theologian Martin Luther. Consequently, the Pope granted him the honorific title as a symbol of appreciation for defending the Church against the rise of Protestantism. However, the relationship between King Henry VIII and the Roman Catholic Church later deteriorated. The King's quest for a male heir and his desire to annul his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, led to a series of events that would ultimately result in England breaking away from the Catholic Church. The Pope's refusal to grant the annulment became the catalyst for the English Reformation, as Henry VIII sought to establish his own church in which he could exercise complete religious and political control. In 1534, the Act of Supremacy was passed, declaring King Henry VIII as the Supreme Head of the Church of England, severing ties with the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy. Despite this break from Rome, King Henry VIII maintained the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" for himself and his successors, as it had become an integral part of the English monarchy's identity and authority. Today, the reigning British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, still carries the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" as part of her official title: \\"Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.\\" The significance of the title has evolved over time, and it now represents the Crown's responsibility to uphold and protect the religious freedom of its citizens and also maintain the established Church of England."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Why are you study habits different from those of your friends? Why do you seem to learn faster in some classes while more slowly in others? One reason you may not know is that people have different types. Scientists say there are three different learning types: Visual ,Auditory ,and Kinesthetic  .  Visual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily remember information from pictures, graphs ,and videos, you are probably a visual learner. You're not good at copying down what the teacher says in class. Never mind. You can draw graphs or pictures instead, if you find that works better for you. Auditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to easily remember things by hearing them, then you are probably an auditory learner. You must listen carefully while the teacher is speaking because it's the easiest way for you to learn . Sometimes you may find that taking notes tops you from listening carefully. After class, you can write down what you remember or borrow your friend's notes to copy. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. Taking notes by writing can make you pay close attention to information as you receive it. Of course, you can learn best by making full use of labs or other class activities. Hope you learn better by knowing what your personal learning type is.

The vast majority of the Catholics in Bulgaria in 2001 were ethnic Bulgarians and the rest belonged to a number of other ethnic groups such as Croatians, Italians, Arabs and Germans. Bulgarian Catholics live predominantly in the regions of Svishtov and Plovdiv and are mostly descendants of the heretical Christian sect of the Paulicians, which converted to Roman Catholicism in the 16th and 17th centuries. The largest Roman Catholic Bulgarian town is Rakovski in Plovdiv Province. Ethnic Bulgarian Roman Catholics known as the Banat Bulgarians also inhabit the Central European region of the Banat. Their number is unofficially estimated at about 12,000, although Romanian censuses count only 6,500 Banat Bulgarians in the Romanian part of the region. Bulgarian Catholics are descendants of three groups. The first were converted Paulicians from the course of the Osam river  and around Plovdiv are the second  group, while the third  one is formed by more recent Eastern Orthodox converts.

When the child walks by, wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting's about, tell him this is a picture for adults and that he isn't big enough to watch it yet. That'll hold him there for a few minutes; director George Stevens and his team will keep him to the end. I think my father did that to me, anyway, and I'm the better man for it. This classic adventure yarn, set in India during the British occupation, features a trio of Army sergeants who find their tight union facing dissolution as one prepares to marry his sweetheart. Help arrives in the form of a vicious Thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against. \\"Gunga Din\\" was one of the great movies to come out of Hollywood's finest year, 1939. Even more than most great movies from that Golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. The theme music is instant hummable nirvana. While shot in California, the camera work (the only thing in \\"Gunga Din\\" that got so much as an Oscar nomination) has a windblown grandeur that feels very much like the Raj of a hundred years before. The battle scenes are shot in a very realistic manner, not too violent but very messy as people fall and shoot and run in all corners of each frame in a way that feels real, not staged like some Cecil B. DeMille Biblical slaughter fest. The script doesn't just set up action scenes, it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor. The main focus is on Sgt. Cutter, chasing after tall tales of golden treasures. It's a rare actioner for Cary Grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense. Anchoring the trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who dotes over his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutter from his own hare-brained schemes. He's just as funny in his own way, leaving Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., displaying some nice Errol Flynnish dash) as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up. If \\"Gunga Din\\" was a Lifetime movie, it would be about Joan Fontaine's efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks. But since it's a guys' film, the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save Ballantine from a fate worse than death, not only marriage, but as Cutter indignantly exclaims several times, the tea business, too. The political correctness police are hard on this film, not so much for the gender issue but the idea of British soldiers saving poor Indians from the vicious Thuggies. It reeks of colonial apologia. Thankfully, this film was made back when, and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of derring-do and false racial pride, have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval. After all, for all their swashbuckling glory, the film's true sacrifice involves the title character, played so heart-wrenchingly by Sam Jaffe. Back when this film was made, movie mogul Jack Warner had a saying: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Still, it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in \\"Gunga Din.\\" I watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what Gunga Din was really up to when he led Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really plotting revenge against his British overlords? Would he have been justified in doing so, especially given MacChesney's cold treatment of him? When Col. Weed delivers that eulogy, the poem by Rudyard Kipling on which the film is loosely based, was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism's folly, of lording it over someone who proved \\"a better man than I am\\" in the end? What did they make of the Guru's great speech, delivered in perfect clipped English: \\"You have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith, which is your country, England. Well, I can die for my country and my faith as readily as you...India, farewell.\\" Of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers: \\"Kill for the love of killing! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill!\\" Which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the British, and save the questions about what it all means for later. What \\"Gunga Din\\" means to me, most of all, is the quickest, surest 90-minute thrill ride on video. Cutter never found his golden temple, but there's one for all of us watching \\"Gunga Din.\\" Available choices: - negative - positive","output":"The correct sentiment of this review is: positive"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the \\"iceberg effect\\". On the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. If this would be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very well pass you by. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie. The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in American movies as of late). Although, at some parts it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as \\"needs improvement\\" is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip). The flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another \\"artistic\\" aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand.

A client of Strutt's, Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), overhears the conversation and says that he remembers this woman, wryly referring to her as \\"the brunette with the legs.\\"The woman, real name Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is a compulsive thief, and has made off with almost 10,000 stashed in the yellow purse. She changes her appearance, going from brunette to blonde, and flees with the cash, journeying south to a town in Virginia where she keeps her beloved horse, Forio, stabled. She then visits her mother Bernice (Louise Latham) in Baltimore. She lavishes her mother with expensive gifts in an attempt to impress her and win her love, but the woman is cold and distant with Marnie, showing much more maternal affection towards a little neighbor girl named Jessie whom she babysits. Marnie's intense jealousy of Jessie seems inappropriate for a grown woman to express, and along with her panic over a bouquet of red gladiolas and her mother's insistence that \\"decent\\" women don't need men, the first hints of the dysfunction that drives Marnie to lie and steal appear.Time goes by and Marnie constructs a new identity, Mary Taylor, with the intent to run her scam again on another victim. She applies for a job at a printing company in Philadelphia owned by none other than Mark Rutland. Despite her now chestnut hair, he recognizes Marnie as the woman who stole from Strutt, but, excited by the thrill of chasing and capturing the attractive criminal, he hires her.

Gather materials: Before starting, gather all the necessary supplies, which include:    - A soft brush (such as an old toothbrush or a specialized shoe brush)    - A cloth or sponge    - Mild laundry detergent or shoe cleaner    - Warm water    - A soft, dry cloth or paper towels    - A bowl or container large enough to hold water and detergent    - Optional: a washing machine, laundry bag, and fabric softener sheet (for machine-washing) 2. Remove loose dirt: Begin by removing any loose dirt or debris from your tennis shoes. Gently tap the shoes together or against a hard surface to remove large particles. Then, using the soft brush, gently brush away dirt from the surface of the shoes. Pay particular attention to the soles, where dirt and debris are more likely to accumulate. 3. Prepare the cleaning solution: In the bowl or container, mix a small amount of mild laundry detergent or specialized shoe cleaner with warm water. Stir the solution until it forms a soapy mixture. Avoid using harsh chemicals, bleach, or hot water, as these can damage your tennis shoes. 4. Start cleaning: Dip the cloth or sponge in the cleaning solution and gently scrub the surface of your tennis shoes in a circular motion. Work on one small area at a time, applying a little pressure to remove dirt and stains. Be careful not to saturate the shoes, especially if they are made of leather or suede. 5. Clean the soles: Use the soft brush dipped in the cleaning solution to scrub the soles and any grooves or crevices where dirt might be trapped. Ensure you thoroughly clean the areas around the sole and upper part of the shoe. 6. Rinse and dry: Wipe off any soap residue with a clean, damp cloth or sponge. Rinse the cloth or sponge in clean water to ensure the soap is removed from the shoes. Do not immerse your tennis shoes in water, as this can damage them further. 7. Air dry: Use the dry cloth or paper towels to pat your shoes dry. Then let them air dry away from direct sunlight or heat sources, such as radiators or heaters. Direct heat can cause your tennis shoes to shrink or warp. Removing the insoles and laces and propping the shoes open can help speed up the drying process. 8. Optional machine-washing: If your tennis shoes are machine-washable, make sure to check the manufacturer’s instructions for care. Remove the laces and insoles, and place your shoes in a laundry bag. Add a fabric softener sheet to help reduce potential damage. Use cold water and a gentle cycle to wash the shoes. Air dry the shoes afterward as in step 7. 9. Reassemble: Once your tennis shoes are completely dry, reinsert the insoles and re-lace them. Your tennis shoes are now ready for use. By following these steps, you will be able to keep your tennis shoes clean and in good condition, ensuring a better performance on the court and an overall longer lifespan for the footwear."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them.  A planet that is smaller has less gravity or more gravity? Answer:","output":"A planet that is smaller in size usually has less mass, and therefore, it would typically have less gravity.  Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. The force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them, as described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: F = G * ((m1*m2) / r^2), where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. 2. A smaller planet usually has a lower mass compared to a larger planet. 3. Since objects with greater mass have a stronger force of gravity between them, smaller planets, which have lower mass, would generally have a weaker force of gravity. 4. Therefore, a planet that is smaller has less gravity, considering all other factors being equal (such as distance to other celestial bodies)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translation in any language needs to consider many different factors, including but not limited to, the context, the intended audience, and the specific terminologies used.  Translating English to French can be somewhat straightforward because they have a lot of commonalities, as both languages are part of the Indo-European languages family and they share the same alphabet. Yet there are also some major differences that make translation a bit tricky. First of all, French and English grammars are not the same. French has a different word order than English. For instance, whereas in English one might say \\"blue cat,\\" in French one would say \\"cat blue,\\" or \\"chat bleu.\\" Similarly, French uses gender for nouns, which English does not. Secondly, there are lots of words in English that have many synonyms, which is not always the case in French. So, a translator needs to make sure that they choose the right equivalent in French, which conveys the same meaning as in English. Furthermore, the translator should also maintain the formality or informality of the text, as French has a formal and an informal way of addressing people, which is not the case in English. Regarding the translation of your sentence: \\"Arrangements for and expected operation of the Eighteenth Meeting of the Parties.\\", the French equivalent: \\"Dispositions pour et fonctionnement prévu de la dix-huitième Réunion des Parties.\\" tries to preserve the same meaning and the formal tone of the original sentence. \\"Dispositions pour\\" means \\"Arrangements for\\", \\"fonctionnement prévu\\" translates to \\"expected operation\\", \\"de la\\" means \\"of the\\", \\"dix-huitième\\" translates to \\"eighteenth\\", and \\"Réunion des Parties.\\" is \\"Meeting of the Parties.\\" Therefore, it is always important to consider these factors while translating. It is not a simple process of changing words from one language to another, but rather it involves a deep understanding of both languages, their grammar, and their cultural contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This decision could have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as personal financial needs, a desire to gain experience or develop a new skill, or a wish to contribute to their community by providing a useful service. In the process of reaching this decision, Carson may have gone through several stages, which can be outlined as follows: 1. Identifying personal goals and motivations: First, Carson needed to evaluate their personal circumstances and determine the reasons for seeking additional income or opportunities. This could have included reflecting on their financial situation, long-term career aspirations, or immediate needs, such as saving for a specific purchase or event. 2. Brainstorming potential money-making opportunities: After determining their goals, Carson would have explored various opportunities for making money. This could have involved researching part-time jobs, opportunities for entrepreneurship, or identifying tasks within their existing skillset that could generate income, such as lawn care services. 3. Assessing skills, resources, and feasibility: Before deciding on mowing yards as a means to earn money, Carson would need to consider their skills and available resources, as well as the feasibility of launching a lawn care service in their community. This step might necessitate acquiring any necessary equipment and identifying a target customer base (e.g., neighbors, family friends, or other local residents in need of lawn care assistance). 4. Preparing a basic business plan: To ensure the success of their lawn care service, Carson should create a basic business plan. This would help them establish a pricing structure, set achievable goals, and develop a marketing strategy to reach potential clients. A comprehensive plan would also enable Carson to track their progress over time and make any necessary adjustments to meet their changing needs and goals. 5. Getting started: Once Carson felt confident in their decision to pursue a lawn care service as a means of making money, they would need to take the necessary steps to launch the service. This could involve creating promotional materials, like flyers or business cards, getting the word out through personal networks, or using social media to reach a wider audience. In summary, before knocking on the door and negotiating a price to mow someone's yard, Carson needed to decide to try to make some money (Option 3).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Steeleye Span are an English folk rock band formed in 1969. Still active today, along with Fairport Convention, they are amongst the best known acts of the British folk revival, and were among the most commercially successful, thanks to their hit singles \\"Gaudete\\" and \\"All Around My Hat\\". They had four Top 40 albums and achieved a certified gold record with sales of \\"All Around My Hat\\". Throughout their history, Steeleye Span have seen many personnel changes. Reported difficulties among band members saw a split during the recording of Bedlam Born. Woods reportedly was uncomfortable with the financial arrangements of the band, health problems forced Johnson into retirement, and drummer Dave Mattacks' period as an unofficial member came to an end during this time.  For a while the band consisted of just Peter Knight and Tim Harries, plus various guest musicians, as they fulfilled live commitments. Rick Kemp resumed playing with the band at some of these gigs, with Harries switching to lead guitar. This was an uncertain time for the future of the band, and when Harries announced he was not keen to continue his role, even the willingness of Kemp to return to the line-up full-time was not enough to prevent what was effectively a break-up.  In 2002, Steeleye Span reformed with a \\"classic\\" line-up (including Prior), bringing an end to the uncertainty of the previous couple of years. Knight hosted a poll on his website, asking the band's fans which Steeleye songs they would most want to see the band re-record. Armed with the results, Knight persuaded Prior and Genockey to rejoin, coaxed Johnson out of a health-induced retirement, and along with Kemp and Knight, they released Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span (2002), a 2-disc set of new recordings of the songs.  But Bob Johnson's health prevented him from playing live shortly before the 2002 comeback tour, and he was replaced at the eleventh hour on guitar by Ken Nicol, formerly of the Albion Band. Nicol had been talking with Rick Kemp about forming a band when Kemp invited him to play for the tour, and this was to herald a significant return to form for the band.

Mack Sennett, born as Michael Sinnott on January 17, 1880 in Quebec, Canada, was an influential player in the early days of silent comedy. He was most renowned for his creation of the Keystone Studios, recognized for its wacky style of slapstick comedy. Sennett, considered as the originator of slapstick comedy in film, was famously known as the 'King of Comedy'. Sennett began his career in the film industry as an actor but found his calling behind the camera, as a director and also, an innovative producer. His notable contribution to filmmaking techniques, particularly in the field of comedy, propelled his career ahead to the point where he was co-founder of one of Hollywood's earliest and significant film studios, Triangle Film Corporation. Teaming up with Thomas Ince and D. W. Griffith, Hollywood’s prominent producers, they established Triangle Film Corporation in the summer of 1915. The name 'triangle' symbolized the trio's intent to 'do things in threes', accounting for the three very different sorts of motion pictures produced by the three subdivisions: Keystone Film Company (led by Sennett), New York Motion Picture Company (led by Ince) and Majestic Studio (led by Griffith).  The incorporation of Triangle Film Corporation was considered a significant event, meant to revolutionize the film landscape by adding a degree of prestige to the movie industry, not just as cheap entertainment. It aimed for higher production quality, longer films, and better stories. And, although it faced downfall just a few years later, the Corporation’s influence on the film industry was certainly substantial, launching careers of several stars and introducing superior production techniques. The effort put in by the three co-founders, including Mack Sennett, thus certainly played a pivotal role in shaping the future of cinema."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: In what sport does Mark teach offense? , can you please find it?   Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School.  Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off.  Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive.  He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring.  When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter.  While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser.  Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs.

Here is a question about this article: Darwin's barnacle studies convinced him that variation arose constantly and not just in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.

Article: An increase in the number of suicides in prefix = st1 /South Korea, has led policeman Yoo Byoung-jong to a new job. He patrols  Seoul's bridges to stop desperate people from throwing themselves into the river. According to South Korea's health ministry, suicide rates have doubled in a decade and are now the leading cause of death for people in their 20s and 30s. The country has the fourth-highest suicide rate among the 30 industrialized countries in the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD). It recorded 22.8 suicide deaths for every 100,000 people in 2003. That's lower than Hungry, Finlandand close neighbourJapan. But the number is growing by about 1 percent each year, faster than for all other OECD nations. In a move to cut suicides by a fifth by 2010, the health ministry is running a television ad campaign. It opens with a lonely man walking on a bridge. A voice over says: \\"Think five minutes more before you give it all away. Don't forget you have a loving family.\\" Other ministry plans include setting up more hotlines and training more suicide counselors. Authorities are also limiting websites that provide suicide methods and sometimes even sell toxic  chemicals.     Distressed individuals range from students worried about poor grades to people in debt as well as disgraced politicians.     Experts say the rising toll  in some way can be blamed on media coverage of recent high-profile suicides. These include top business leaders and celebrities  who apparently lead a number of people to copy their actions.     \\"We saved 50 lives this year when people turned to bridges as a place to die after news reports of such deaths by 'big shots',\\" said the 38-year-oldYoo, in December.

Towering above the village is the estate of Elias Graves, a wealthy man who hopes to use his influence to remove these squatters from his land. When his lawyer is unable to so directly, he instead enacts a ban on net fishing, removing the livelihoods of many people in the village, including Tess and her father. Despite the ban, some continue to fish illegally, though they are soon confronted by men sent by Graves. In this confrontation, one of Graves' men is shot and killed. Tess' father is wrongfully accused of the murder and arrested. Meanwhile, through these altercations Tess meets Frederick Graves, Elias' son, who is home on a break from his theological studies.

Please answer the following question: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.  Which friend studied less about short wavelength solar energy? A:","output":"Vick studied less about short wavelength solar energy. While both Vick and Frank were studying the Earth's atmosphere, their areas of focus were different. Vick was focused on studying the troposphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere where weather changes occur and where planes cruise. Its study involves weather systems, cloud formations, air pressure and temperature gradients.  On the other hand, Frank chose to study about the Greenhouse Effect. Understanding the Greenhouse Effect involves looking at how sunlight in the form of short-wave solar energy reaches the Earth's surface, getting through the layer of greenhouse gases without being absorbed due to its short wavelengths. Then, studying how some of the longer wavelengths, or far-infrared radiation, from the Earth's heat gets absorbed by these greenhouse gases and is reradiated back towards the Earth, which contributes to the global warming phenomenon represents another important layer of the Greenhouse Effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that Frank studied more about short wavelength solar energy than Vick because understanding this energy's behavior is fundamental to comprehending the Greenhouse Effect, while studying the troposphere doesn't inherently require knowledge of the behavior of short wavelength solar energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise provides some information, but not enough to draw a definite conclusion about the Asian male's reasons for riding a bike in the city. Let's break down the information we have and what it implies: Premise: An Asian male rides a bike in the streets of a large brightly lit city. This information tells us the following: 1. There is an Asian male involved in the situation. 2. He is riding a bike. 3. The location is in the streets of a large, brightly lit city. Hypothesis: An Asian man rides his bike home after work. For this hypothesis to be true, we need to know or infer the following: 1. The man is riding the bike after work. 2. He is riding the bike to go home. Going back to the premise, we do not have any information about the time of day or whether the Asian male just got off work. Also, no information is given about his destination, meaning we do not know whether he is actually riding the bike to go home.  While it may be possible that the Asian man is riding his bike home after work, this hypothesis is not definitively supported by the given premise. The man could be riding for leisure purposes or running errands in the city, among other reasons. The brightly lit city can contribute a picturesque atmosphere, or it may point to the time of day, but again, we cannot make a sure conclusion based on the premise alone.

Zinni feared that  Bin Laden would in the future locate himself in cities, where U.S. missiles could kill thousands of Afghans. He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.

One day the Prince wanted to go hunt-ing with his men. He told his dog to stay at home and look after his baby son. The baby was in a wooden cradle, which was like a small bed. When the Prince came back from hunt-ing, Gelert ran out to meet his master. He wagged his tail and jumped up to put his paws on the Prince's chest. Then the Prince saw the blood on Gelert's jaws and head. \\"What have you done?\\" the Prince said. He rushed into his house and looked for his baby son. The cradle was lying on its side on the floor. The clothes were torn and there was blood on them. \\"So you have killed my son?\\" the Prince said angrily. \\"You unfaithful dog!\\" He took out his sword and killed the dog. Just as Gelert was dying, he managed to bark. Then the Prince heard a baby call to the dog. The Prince ran out of the house and saw his son lying on the ground unhurt. Near him was a dead wolf.

Court gives banks 'beat-down' over foreclosures                  NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- The Massachusetts high court ruled on Friday that two foreclosures are invalid because the banks could not prove they had the proper paperwork to foreclose.      The banks \\"failed to make the required showing that they were the holders of the mortgages at the time of foreclosure,\\" Justice Ralph Gants wrote for the Massachusetts Supreme Court.      This could be a harbinger of things to come because it is the first ruling by a state high court on the issue of whether banks can foreclose on homeowners if can't prove they hold the mortgages.      Numerous instances of this emerged last fall, as evidence appeared that banks were robo-signing foreclosure documents without actually reading them. As a result, there are dozens of similar cases in lower courts across the country, all waiting for the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling.      \\"It's about the most extensive beat-down the banks have received over their shoddy practices,\\" said Christopher Peterson, a real estate law professor at the University of Utah. \\"It could be a wake-up call for rubberstamping judges that they need to more carefully examine practices.\\"      What's the issue? Mortgage loans are like real property and can only be transferred by physically signing over the paperwork -- like someone endorsing a check or the title to a car -- and delivering it to the next holder. Without that, the holder of record doesn't change.      Under mortgage securitization, loans get transferred many times after origination before landing in pools of mortgages that are sold to investors. But often times, the banks simply didn't endorse the paperwork between steps.      Massachusetts law on how to legally transfer mortgages goes back more than 200 years and is very clear, according to Paul Collier, the attorney who represented homeowner Antonio Ibanez in the case. \\"You've never been able to assign in blank in Massachusetts,\\" he said.      The high court agreed with that assessment, but also clarified that when banks transfer mortgages into a pool they can establish ownership through proper recording or through a document that states all of the mortgages held in the pool, with addresses and owner names. Although, Justice Grants said, \\"recording is likely the better practice.\\"      \\"The key in either case is that the foreclosing entity must hold the mortgage at the time of the notice and sale in order accurately to identify itself as the present holder in the notice and in order to have the authority to foreclose under the power of sale,\\" he added.      What happened? Regardless of recording issues, there is little dispute that Antonio Ibanez, a special education teacher in Springfield, Mass., defaulted on his loan for 103,500. He did not even fight the foreclosure when it came in 2007.      The case only went to trial because the bank needed to establish clear title to the property after foreclosure so it could resell the house. The insurance companies would not issue title insurance on the home without a court ruling.      The case went before state Land Court Judge Keith Long, who found no evidence that the plaintiffs were the actual mortgage holders and asked them to prove it.      According to court papers, Ibanez's loan went through five different owners before winding up in a pool of mortgages that U.S. Bank was the trustee for. During that trip down the chain, the parties failed to legally assign the mortgage.      The bank produced documents that showed that the loan was one of the mortgages put into a pool, but that failed to satisfy the court, which cited \\"the utter carelessness with which the plaintiff banks documented the titles to their assets.\\"      In the case of Mark and Tammy LaRaces, Wells Fargo, provided evidence that the loan had been assigned to a pool. The evidence, however, was merely a copy of the pooling and servicing agreement that had been downloaded from the SEC website and was unsigned.      The state's high court ruled that, in both the Ibanez and the LaRace cases, no valid assignments were made after the lender assigned it to the record holder, Option One Mortgage Corp. in both cases. Option One, therefore, was the mortgage holder at the time of the foreclosures and no one else had the right to foreclose.      The future: Bruce Allensworth, an attorney for the banks, said they have the records to prove ownership in both cases, but since they were not introduced in Land Court hearing, rules of evidence prevented them from being introduced into the appeal.      \\"I'm thinking if there's a way of going back and reintroducing these documents to the Land Court,\\" he said.      So where does that leave Ibanez and the LaRaces?      According to Collier, his clients may now own the home free and clear. \\"I don't see how [the banks] can win if they challenge the decision,\\" he said, \\"but maybe they'll take a shot.\\" ||||| The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court today upheld a contentious land court ruling that puts in question the ownership of hundreds, possibly thousands, of foreclosed properties in the state.      The ruling challenges the way lenders have traditionally foreclosed on properties -- without having all the paperwork in place at the time a home is seized. It affirms a 2009 lower court decision that invalidated foreclosures on two Springfield homes because the lenders did not hold clear titles to the properties.      Cambridge attorney Paul Collier, who represented one of the homeowners in the case, said the supreme court ruling invalidates thousands of foreclosures, reverting ownership back to the homeowners who lost the homes, at least temporarily. In most cases, those property takings will have to be redone, further clogging an already bogged down foreclosure process that many real estate specialists say has contributed to the stagnant housing market.      \\"The banks and the investors are going to have to deal with those homeowners as to what happens to those properties,\\" Collier said.            During the housing boom, millions of mortgages were packaged into bonds and sold to investors, a process that resulted in lengthy and tangled paper trails that can obscure ownership. Many lenders believed they could complete foreclosure transactions and later produce formal proof they held a mortgage. Today's ruling makes it clear that the practice will not be allowed in Massachusetts.      \\"We agree with the [land court] judge that the plaintiffs who were not the original mortgagees, failed to make the required showing that they were the holders of the mortgages at the time of foreclosure,'' the justices said in their opinion.            The decision will also have national implications at a time when lenders' foreclosure practices are being scrutinized by federal regulators and state attorneys general.       ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The Massachusetts high court ruled that two foreclosures are invalid due to the banks' inability to present proper paperwork proving their authority to foreclose. This is the first ruling by a state high court on the issue of banks foreclosing on homeowners without proof of holding the mortgage. The ruling may set a precedent for numerous similar cases in lower courts across the United States. Mortgage loans are transferred multiple times after origination before landing in pools of mortgages that are sold to investors. Banks often fail to endorse the necessary paperwork between these transfers, which the Massachusetts high court has identified as a requirement for a valid foreclosure. This ruling could mean that thousands of foreclosures are invalidated, reverting ownership back to the homeowners, at least temporarily. The banks and investors will now have to work with these homeowners to determine the future of the affected properties.

As you hinge forward, lower your arms and place your palms flat on the ground shoulder-width apart. Ensure that your wrists are in line with your shoulders. Walk your feet back until you reach a full plank position, with your body forming a straight line from your head to your heels. Your legs should be hip-width apart and your gaze should be slightly ahead of your hands. Take a moment to ensure your core is still engaged and your body is in proper alignment. 3. Lower your body: Begin to lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, ensuring they are pointing towards your ribcage and not flaring out to the sides. While doing this, maintain a steady breath, inhaling as you lower yourself down. Keep your body straight and avoid letting your hips sag. 4. Push up: Once your chest is close to the ground, pause momentarily. Exhale as you push your body back up into the plank position by straightening your arms. Make sure you keep your core engaged and maintain a straight body line. 5. Return to the starting position: From the plank position, walk your feet towards your hands, then slowly lift your upper body back up, hinging from your hips. Extend your arms above your head, returning to the initial standing position with your body aligned in the modified Pilates stance. 6. Repeat the push-up sequence: Aim to complete 8-12 Pilates push-ups, ensuring you are maintaining proper form and breathing throughout the exercise. Take a break if needed, but try to keep proper form with each repetition. 7. Add variations (optional): To increase the challenge of the Pilates push-up, you can add variations, such as performing the exercise with your legs lifted one at a time or by placing your hands on an unstable surface, like a BOSU ball or an exercise ball. Incorporating Pilates push-ups into your exercise routine can help improve your upper body strength, core stability, and overall body control. As with any exercise, it's essential to maintain proper form, alignment, and breathing to maximize the benefits and reduce any risk of injury. Remember to stretch and warm up before beginning your workout, and to seek guidance from a certified Pilates instructor if you're unsure of your form or technique."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What a waste of money. The wings always fall off and the way they clip on makes it impossible to put other clothes on the doll. The other day she took off the clothes and put them on another barbie. Don't waste your 17.99. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review provided can be described as depicting the product in an unflattering light. Several reasons support this interpretation, which are detailed below. 1. Disappointment from expectations: The reviewer begins by mentioning that the product was a Christmas present for their 5-year-old daughter. The context of a special occasion delivery followed by dissatisfaction implies that the product did not live up to the expectations tied to such an event. 2. Comparison to another product: The reviewer states that their daughter also owns a playset from the Fairytopia line. By mentioning this, it is possible that the reviewer wants to emphasize that they do have experience with this type of product, and therefore, their opinion should be considered reliable. 3. Issues with functionality: The primary complaint of the reviewer is that the product's wings fall off easily, leading to a subpar experience for their daughter. Additionally, they mention that the way the wings attach to the doll makes it difficult to change its clothes. These negative aspects highlight that the product has design flaws affecting its usability and play value, which reflects unfavorably on the product. 4. Preference for other products: The reviewer shares that their daughter went on to dress another Barbie doll with the product's clothes. This detail might suggest that the intended play experience with the product's clothes is more enjoyable when used with other dolls, further casts a negative light on the original product. 5. Price concern: The reviewer concludes by advising potential buyers not to waste their 17.99 on the product. This statement implies that the reviewer believes the product is overpriced given its quality and the issues with its design, adding to the overall negative perception. In summary, the review portrays the product in an unflattering light due to the various issues mentioned, such as design flaws and disappointment from expectations. The comparison to another product line and a clear warning not to waste money on the product further strengthens the negative portrayal of the product."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which entity is this text about? Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, KCN (born 21 September 1963) is a former cricketer from Antigua who played 98 Test matches for the West Indies. A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists. The West Indies toured Australia in 1992-93, recovering from losing the second Test to win the final two matches and take the series 2-1. The team also won the annual World Series Cup. In the first three Tests, Ambrose was hampered by pitches which did not suit his bowling and, according to Tony Cozier writing in Wisden, was often unlucky when he bowled, although he took five for 66 in the first Test. In the final two Tests, he took 19 wickets. In the fourth he took ten wickets, including six for 74 in the first innings; in the second innings, he took three wickets in 19 deliveries and the West Indies won the match by one run. According to Cozier, the captains of both teams, Richie Richardson and Allan Border, \\"paid tribute to the man who made the result possible: Ambrose consolidated his reputation as the world's leading bowler\\". On the first day of the decisive final Test, Ambrose took seven wickets at the cost of one run from 32 deliveries and finished with figures of seven for 25. Cozier described it as \\"one of Test cricket's most devastating spells\\". West Indies won by an innings and Ambrose was named man of the series, having taken 33 wickets to equal the record in an Australia-West Indies Test series. He topped the West Indian bowling averages with an average of 16.42. Cozier described Ambrose's performance as \\"instrumental in winning [the series]\\" and his bowling as \\"flawless\\".  In the one-day tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final--both games were won by the West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to remove his white wristbands while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals. After a one-day tournament in South Africa, West Indies returned home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2-0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be fifth in the team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that he was suffering from fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.  Having developed a slower ball, and using the yorker more sparingly, Ambrose took five wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets.","output":"This text is about Sir Curtly Elconn Lynwall Ambrose, a former cricketer from Antigua who played for the West Indies.

On its own, the word \\"thud\\" does not carry any inherent sentiment – positive or negative. It is an onomatopoeic expression representing a heavy, dull sound produced when an object strikes or falls onto another surface. To determine the sentiment behind this sentence, one must take into account the surrounding context and the intentions of the speaker or writer. Here are a few examples of how \\"thud\\" could be used in different contexts with varying sentiments: 1. In a suspenseful or frightening context: Imagine a scene in a thriller movie where a character is walking through a dark, eerie forest, and suddenly hears a \\"thud\\" in the background. In this case, the sentiment associated with \\"thud\\" would be negative, as it can evoke feelings of fear, anxiety, or tension for the character and the audience. 2. In a humorous or light-hearted context: If \\"thud\\" is used in a funny scenario, such as someone accidentally dropping a watermelon, which makes a loud \\"thud\\" sound on the ground, the sentiment would be more light-hearted and amusing. In this context, the \\"thud\\" may evoke laughter or amusement rather than any negative emotions. 3. In a neutral, descriptive context: If \\"thud\\" is used alone to describe the sound made by an object falling or striking another surface, without any additional context, it can be seen as a straightforward, neutral description of auditory imagery. In this case, there is no specific sentiment associated with the sentence – it is merely providing information about the sound. 4. In a positive or victorious context: In situations where \\"thud\\" is used to symbolize or emphasize a triumph or success, the sentiment can be positive. For example, during a weightlifting competition, a contestant successfully lifts the weights, and the \\"thud\\" sound made as they drop the weights onto the platform may signal victory and accomplishment. Here, the \\"thud\\" could elicit feelings of satisfaction, pride, or enthusiasm. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"thud\\" can be perceived in multiple ways, depending on the context in which it is used. To accurately gauge the sentiment behind it, one must consider not only the word itself but also the surrounding text, dialogue, or scenario in which it appears. Without specific context or additional information, it's challenging to determine the precise sentiment of the word \\"thud.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Snapchat agrees to settle FTC charges that it deceived users Messaging app Snapchat promised users that the photos and videos they send disappear forever seconds after they're opened. But security and privacy advocates have repeatedly reported that that's not always true. On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission announced that the smartphone app maker has agreed to settle charges alleging that the company had deceived consumers with assurances about the \\"disappearing nature\\" of messages sent through the service and other data collection and security practices. The FTC complaint laid out several ways that photo \\"snaps\\" sent through the application could be saved without the users' knowledge. For example, some third-party apps could be used to capture messages sent through the service, the FTC said, and video messages remained accessible to recipients who connected their smartphone to a computer. The FTC also alleged that the app collected data from users without their consent or knowledge -- including geolocation information from those using the Android version of the app and contacts from the address books of those using the Apple iOS version. Additionally, the complaint alleged that Snapchat failed to properly secure it's \\"Find Friends\\" feature -- resulting in the widely reported security breach that allowed attackers to compile a database of 4.6 million Snapchat usernames and phone numbers. Snapchat later released an update that fixed the issue and let users to opt out of the feature. Under the terms of its settlement, Snapchat will not be fined. But the app maker will be prohibited from misrepresenting the privacy, security or confidentiality of user data within the app and be required to implement a comprehensive privacy program to be monitored by an independent party over the next 20 years. If Snapchat violates the settlement in the future, it could face financial penalties. Although the consent decree did not require Snapchat to admit fault, the app maker acknowledged in a statement to The Washington Post that it had made mistakes. \\"While we were focused on building, some things didn’t get the attention they could have,\\" Snapchat said in the statement, noting that it should have been \\"more precise\\" in how it communicated with users. But the company also insisted that it had resolved many of the issues in the complaint before the settlement was announced and that it is \\"devoted to promoting user privacy and giving Snapchatters control over how and with whom they communicate.\\" A recent update to Snapchat added new capabilities, including text messaging and video conferencing. The text messaging feature will allow recipients to save exchanges without notifying the sender -- a significant departure from the supposedly disappearing picture messages that drove the app's initial growth. Update: Julia Horwitz, Consumer Protection Counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center which originally complained to the FTC about Snapchat, told the Post it was happy with the resolution. \\"We're extremely pleased that the FTC is taking its data privacy protection seriously and is recognizing behaviors by companies like Snapchat that breach promises to consumers,\\" she said. \\"This was a real success.\\" \\"But this consent order's true effectiveness depends upon the agency's consistent enforcement over the next 20 years,\\" she cautioned.","output":"Snapchat is an app that allows people to send pictures and messages to each other, and the main feature is that the pictures and messages are supposed to disappear after a short time. However, some people found out that the pictures and videos didn't always disappear, and there were other issues with privacy. Now, Snapchat has agreed to not lie about the privacy of their users' data and to have a special privacy plan that will be checked by an independent group for the next 20 years. They won't have to pay any fines, but if they break the rules in the future, they might have to pay money.

There has been a great deal of debate in the past few years in the United Kingdom about whether to discourage cousin marriages through government public relations campaigns or ban them entirely. The debate has been prompted by a Pakistani immigrant population making up 1.5% of the British population, of whom about 50-70% marry a first cousin. In the 1980s researchers found that children to closely related Pakistani parents had an autosomal recessive condition rate of 4% compared to 0.1% for the European group. For example, Environment Minister (later Immigration Minister) Phil Woolas said in 2008, \`\`If you have a child with your cousin the likelihood is there'll be a genetic problem'' and that such marriages were the \`\`elephant in the room''. Physician Mohammad Walji has spoken out against the practice, saying that it is a \`\`very significant'' cause of infant death, and his practice has produced leaflets warning against it. However, Alan Bittles of the Centre for Comparative Genomics in Australia states that the risk of birth defects rises from roughly 2% in the general population to 4% for first cousins and therefore that \`\`It would be a mistake to ban it''. Aamra Darr of the University of Leeds has also criticized what she called an \`\`alarmist presentation of data'' that exaggerates the risk.

Process:  - An organism dies - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having fewer remains happens, how will it affect LESS fossils forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation you proposed, having fewer remains, would directly affect the formation of LESS fossils. Let's analyze the entire process to provide a more comprehensive understanding: 1. An organism dies: The fossilization process begins with the death of an organism. Fewer remains imply the reduced availability of organic material for fossilization to occur. 2. Water seeps into the remains: As water penetrates the dead organism's remains, it begins the process of mineralization. With fewer remains available, there is less opportunity for this step to take place. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: The minerals in the water create crystals, which aid in preserving the organism's remains. However, if there are fewer remains, fewer opportunities exist for crystal formation. 4. Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden: Hardening of the remains is an essential step in fossil formation, ensuring their preservation. Fewer remains result in a decrease in this hardening process and thus lesser fossils. 5. The minerals form a fossil: As the crystalized minerals continue to form and replace the original organic material, a fossil is created. With fewer remains available for this process, there will be a reduction in overall fossil formation. In summary, the proposed perturbation of having fewer remains directly impacts the fossilization process, leading to a decrease in the formation of fossils. Less dead organic material means fewer opportunities for each stage of the fossilization process to occur, ultimately resulting in fewer fossils being formed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth!

A:","output":"To determine an appropriate response for the listener in this conversation, I need to analyze the given information, understand the context, and consider possible answers. Here's my step-by-step reasoning: 1. First, I need to understand the key elements of the conversation.    The conversation consists of one short question from a character named F:    \\"F: Are you going to work long?\\"     2. Secondly, I will try to understand the context or the background of the conversation.    Since there is limited context, I'll interpret the question as a general inquiry about the listener's working hours or duration for that particular day or time frame. 3. Next, I will consider possible responses that the listener can say. The answer can naturally fall into one of two categories: affirmative (yes, they plan to work long) or negative (no, they do not plan to work long). The listener might also provide additional information depending on their relationship with F, the context, or personal preference. 4. Then, I will decide on a potential response for the listener based on the categories outlined above. Considering these factors, an apt response for the listener might be: A: No, I don't plan to work too long today. I should be finished in a couple of hours. This response not only answers the question but also provides extra information regarding the expected duration of the listener's work.

Thomson was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the youngest of six children. He arrived in the United States two years later. His father, a cabinet maker, had moved to New York City shortly before Bobby's birth and sent for his family in 1925. Thomson grew up on Staten Island in New York City and signed with the New York Giants for a 100 bonus right out of Curtis High School in 1942. Thomson became a celebrity for his walk-off home run off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca to win the 1951 National League pennant. The home run, nicknamed the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\", was dramatic as, until 1969, league pennants were only decided by playoff when the teams involved finished the regular season in a tie. Prior to 1951 playoffs had only been necessary in 1946 (NL) and 1948 (AL).  Although in mid-August the Giants were 13 1/2  games behind the league-leading Dodgers, they won 37 of their final 44 games to tie Brooklyn on the final day of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff. The Giants won the first game 3-1 as a result of a two-run home run by Thomson (off Branca). Brooklyn's Clem Labine shut out the Giants in the second game, 10-0. The decisive contest, played on October 3 at the Polo Grounds, was the first major sporting event televised coast-to-coast in the United States. The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning; but Giants shortstop Alvin Dark singled, advanced to third on a single by Don Mueller, and scored on a double by Whitey Lockman. With Lockman on second and pinch-runner Clint Hartung at third, Thomson's walk-off home run turned looming defeat into a 5-4 victory. The moment was immortalized by Giants play-by-play announcer Russ Hodges's excited multiple repetitions: \\"The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!\\"  Waiting in the on-deck circle to hit behind Thomson was rookie Willie Mays. The Giants' season ended, however, at the 1951 World Series; the Yankees swept the last three games to win the best-of-seven series, 4 games to 2. Thomson batted .238 in the Series with no home runs.  The bat from the \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" is in the collection of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The uniform worn by Thomson on that day is apparently a part of a large private collection owned by Dan Scheinman, a member of the San Francisco Giants ownership group. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What was the \\"Shot heard round the world\\"?","output":"The \\"Shot Heard 'Round the World\\" was a very special and famous home run in baseball history.

The fact that you are communicating with your friends shows how determined you are to overcome your current challenges. It's nice to know that you have supportive people in your life who care about your well-being. Now, about the grueling ride that was mentioned – there could be several factors contributing to the intensity and difficulty of the ride. Here are some possible reasons as to why it was deemed grueling: 1. Challenging terrain: The route chosen for the ride might have included steep inclines, rough surfaces, or technical sections that push riders to their physical and mental limits. Navigating through such tricky terrain requires not only stamina and strength but also advanced riding skills and focus. 2. Weather conditions: Riding under extreme weather conditions, such as scorching heat, torrential rain, or strong winds, can add an extra element of difficulty to the ride. Such conditions require riders to combat fatigue, dehydration, and slippery surfaces, to name a few challenges. 3. Long distance: If the ride covered a long distance or lasted for an extended period, it could lead to increased exhaustion levels and muscle weariness. Longer distances require riders to be both physically and mentally prepared while also ensuring they have enough energy and supplies to complete the journey. 4. High elevation: The ride might have taken place at higher altitudes where the air is thinner, causing a decrease in oxygen levels. This can lead to accelerated fatigue and exhaustion, making the ride much more challenging than usual. 5. Unfamiliar routes: If the riders took a new path they were not familiar with, they might have faced unexpected obstacles or challenges that would make the ride grueling. Being prepared for the unknown is a skill developed with experience. 6. Personal fitness levels: The riders' individual fitness levels play a crucial role in determining how grueling the ride feels. While more experienced riders might have had an easier time, those who are less fit or new to riding might find the same route much more demanding. Challenging oneself and consistently pushing limits is a vital part of developing better endurance and skills. It sounds like you have another exciting adventure planned with the Sheep Mountain Ride tomorrow at the Rattlesnake. Remember to prepare well, stay hydrated, and ensure your bikes and equipment are in good working condition.

A broker can help you create a diverse and profitable investment portfolio in line with your financial goals and risk tolerance. But it's essential to know what to expect when working with a professional broker, from account types and fees to investment strategies and tax implications. In this article, we'll break down eight key expectations to consider when engaging a professional broker to manage your investments. 1. Expect to pay a fee for every transaction you make Professional brokers make their income through commissions and fees. Every time a trade or transaction is executed on your behalf, you should anticipate a fee associated with that transaction. These fees can be based on a percentage of the transaction amount or a flat fee per trade. Always make sure you understand the fee structure upfront to avoid any surprises later on. 2. Expect your broker to ask your acceptable level of risk Before a broker can create a personalized investment strategy for you, they will need to understand your risk tolerance. Your acceptable level of risk will help your broker determine the types of investments that best suit your needs and goals. Be prepared to answer questions about how long you're planning to invest, your financial goals, and your comfort level with potential losses. The more information you provide, the better-equipped your broker will be to create an investment plan tailored to your unique needs. 3. Expect most professional investors to choose margin accounts, not cash accounts There are two primary types of accounts that brokers offer: margin accounts and cash accounts. Margin accounts provide investors with the ability to borrow money from their brokerage firm to invest in additional securities and amplify gains and losses. Cash accounts, on the other hand, only allow investors to trade stocks and other assets limited to the cash available in their accounts. While cash accounts can be appealing for novice investors due to their simplicity, most professional investors opt for margin accounts because of the increased flexibility and purchasing power they provide. Margin accounts can lead to higher returns if used wisely but can also lead to more significant losses. Therefore, it's crucial to consider your risk tolerance, experience, and financial goals before choosing an account type. 4. Expect the broker to determine your tax status based on your financial needs A professional broker should be able to determine and inform you of your tax status as it relates to your investments. Tax implications play a significant role in your overall investment strategy, as different investment products and income streams are treated differently for tax purposes. Understanding the tax implications of your investments ensures you're compliant with tax laws provides crucial information for tax planning and maximizing your investment returns. 5. Expect the meeting to end with a request for your investment money Once your broker has gathered all the necessary information, including your risk tolerance, financial goals, and preferred account type, expect them to request your initial investment. Make sure you have the funds available and are comfortable with the amount you're investing. Keep in mind that investing always carries risks, so never invest more than you're prepared to lose. 6. Expect a professional broker often uses algorithm-based trading Many professional brokers leverage algorithm-based trading in their investment strategies. These algorithms can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, automate specific trades, and help brokers identify potential opportunities based on pre-set criteria. Algorithm-based trading can result in cost and time savings for investors while ensuring your investment strategy is consistently executed in line with your preferences. 7. Expect a professional to invest in things other than stocks While stocks are a popular type of investment, professional brokers will typically develop a diverse investment portfolio on your behalf. This might include other assets like bonds, mutual funds, real estate, commodities, and even alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. Diversifying your investment portfolio helps spread your risk across various asset classes, which reduces your exposure to potential market downturns and increases the chances of long-term success. 8. Expect a broker to invest in \\"funds,\\" or pre-made collections of stocks Along with individual stocks and assets, professional brokers often invest in funds or pre-made collections of stocks. These baskets of securities might include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and index funds, which give investors exposure to a broad range of stocks while minimizing the risks associated with individual stock picking. Investing in funds can be a more accessible and cost-effective way for investors to diversify and gain exposure to various market segments. Conclusion Understanding what to expect when working with a professional broker is key to building a strong partnership and achieving your investment goals. From fees and account types to investment strategies and tax implications, familiarizing yourself with these eight expectations will ensure you're well-prepared for your journey into the world of professional investing. With the right broker and a proactive approach to managing your investments, you'll be well on your way to realizing your financial objectives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Carthage was Palermo’s major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement Panormos (Πάνορμος) from which the current name is derived, meaning \\"all port\\" due to the shape of its coast. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 B.C. the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the name Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's go step-by-step and analyze the impact of collecting more water vapor on the formation of more powerful hurricanes: 1. Thunderstorms form over the ocean: More water vapor can lead to increased thunderstorm formation due to greater moisture available in the atmosphere. This is a direct impact on this step of the process. 2. An area of low pressure causes rotation: The additional water vapor could cause lower pressure areas to intensify, indirectly affecting this step by creating more favorable conditions for rotation. 3. Several thunderstorms come together around this area: With more thunderstorms forming, there is a higher likelihood of multiple thunderstorms converging around the low-pressure area, directly impacting this step of the process. 4. The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating: More water vapor increases the storm's fuel supply, as warm, moist air is essential for hurricane development. This directly impacts this step of the process. 5. When the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is considered a hurricane: The presence of additional water vapor can contribute to increased wind speeds, as more energy is available to the storm. This could indirectly impact this step of the process by making it more likely for a storm to reach hurricane status. Answer: The supposed perturbation due to collecting more water vapor is directly impacting a step of the process and indirectly impacting a step of the process. It directly impacts the formation of thunderstorms and the storm being fed by warm ocean water evaporating. It indirectly impacts wind speeds reaching hurricane status and possibly the intensification of low-pressure areas, leading to rotation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hummer pursued a broadcasting career briefly in 1996 and worked for TVG Network , a horse racing network . Hummer briefly pursued a broadcasting career in 1996 . He first worked for TVG Network , a horse racing network .","output":"Although the two sentences convey similar information, they do not have the exact same meaning. Here is a detailed analysis of the differences between the sentences: 1. Sentence one highlights that Hummer pursued a broadcasting career briefly in 1996 and worked for the TVG Network, a horse racing network. The sentence structure and phrasing give the impression that Hummer's entire broadcasting career was short-lived and was solely focused on working for the TVG Network during 1996. 2. Sentence two states that Hummer briefly pursued a broadcasting career in 1996 and initially worked for the TVG Network, a horse racing network. This sentence implies that Hummer had a short stint in broadcasting during 1996, with the TVG Network being the first place where he worked. The emphasis on \\"He first worked\\" suggests that there may have been other positions or opportunities within the broadcasting industry after the TVG Network experience. The second sentence leaves the door open to further developments in Hummer's broadcasting career, whether short or long term. In summary, while both sentences point out that Hummer pursued a broadcasting career in 1996 and worked for the TVG Network, the first sentence indicates that his entire broadcasting career was short and limited to his work at the TVG Network. In contrast, the second sentence portrays the TVG Network as the starting point of Hummer's broadcasting pursuit but doesn't exclude the possibility of other broadcasting roles later on."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'Every time","output":"\\"Every time a Lifetime movie comes out, I brace myself for the worst, but this one is surprisingly well-done,\\" said one viewer on social media. The movie takes on the infamous 2013 case of Jodi Arias, who was convicted of the first-degree murder of her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander. It delves into the disturbing and complex relationship they shared, as well as the subsequent trial that gripped the nation. Directed by Rob Lowe, the film stars Tania Raymonde as Arias and Jesse Lee Soffer as Alexander, both giving eerily accurate portrayals of the real-life figures they represent. The movie is praised not only for its acting, but also for its storytelling, which manages to present a more nuanced and layered picture of the events than many viewers were expecting. \\"It's not just a regurgitation of the sensational headlines,\\" said one film critic. \\"There's an attempt to understand the characters and the motivations behind their actions, which is more than can be said for many true crime adaptations.\\" While some might argue that it's still a sensationalized portrayal of a tragic and violent event, Dirty Little Secret has undoubtedly surpassed many expectations for a made-for-TV movie. Critics and viewers alike acknowledge that, in the often-maligned world of Lifetime originals, this one definitely stands out. \\"The fact that it isn't just another poorly executed retelling of a real-life crime is quite refreshing,\\" said another viewer. \\"It's a stark reminder of the potential that Lifetime movies can have when they take the time to put effort into the storytelling and performances.\\" Ultimately, Dirty Little Secret serves as an example that not all Lifetime original movies are lackluster and forgettable - some may even have the power to spark meaningful conversations about the complex and often dark realities of human nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

As the plot unfolds, H escalates his methods (with Brody as the \\"good cop\\"). Brody realizes that Yusuf anticipated that he would be tortured. Yusuf then makes his demands: he would like the President of the United States to announce a cessation of support for \\"puppet governments\\" and dictatorships in Muslim countries and a withdrawal of American troops from all Muslim countries.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What happened one universities were no longer the best place to get scientific information? Context: Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Jefferson Thomas, one of the so-called \\"Little Rock Nine,\\" the nine students who integrated Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957, has died, according to Carlotta Walls LaNier, president of the group's foundation. He was 67. Thomas died of pancreatic cancer on Sunday, the Little Rock Nine Foundation said in a statement. He was living in Columbus, Ohio. As a 15-year-old, Thomas was one of the nine African-American students who braved segregationist mobs to integrate the all-white school under the protection of military forces. A retired federal accountant for the Department of Defense, Thomas \\"had spent the last decade of his life doing community service, traveling to promote racial harmony and supporting young people in seeking higher education,\\" the foundation said. In 1999, he and the others received a Congressional Gold Medal from President Bill Clinton. Thomas' oldest sister, Alma Hildreth, told CNN she believes God protected Thomas so that he could accomplish a mission that God had given him: \\"To stand up and do what he thought was right, [and to show] that education belonged to him and all the children.\\" \\"He did a lot of good that he really enjoyed doing and wanted to do. He did a lot of speaking and encouraging young people to reach for the stars. That was his mission, to do that,\\" Hildreth said. President Barack Obama expressed his condolences to Thomas' family in a statement issued Monday, and praised Thomas' bravery in entering Central High School. \\"Mr. Thomas was just a teenager when he became one of the first African-American students to enroll in Little Rock Central High School.  Yet even at such a young age, he had the courage to risk his own safety, to defy a governor and a mob, and to walk proudly into that school even though it would have been far easier to give up and turn back,\\" the Obama statement said. Obama said the action \\"helped open the doors of opportunity for their generation and for those that followed.\\" The surviving members of the Little Rock Nine \\"expressed their heartfelt sadness at the passing of the man they called their brother in a unique group for the past 53 years,\\" the foundation's statement said. The nine have remained close, and through their foundation they provided college scholarships and mentoring to students. \\"I will miss his calculated sense of humor,\\" said LaNier, another member of the nine. \\"He had a way of asking a question and ending it with a joke, probably to ease the pain during our teenage years at Central. He was a Christian who sincerely promoted racial harmony and took his responsibilities seriously.\\" \\"Jefferson has always been, to us, a brother,\\" said Melba Pattillo Beals, another one of the nine. \\"He's funny and very strong, like when we would have a very difficult day, things were absolutely at their worst, he would say, 'Smile, you're on Candid Camera,' or, you know, 'Look at what you're wearing!' He was just really, really funny.\\" She said Thomas sent other members of the group funny e-mails almost until the day of his death. On September 4, 1957, a national furor erupted as the nine students attempted to enter Central High. Then-Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus, in defiance of a federal court order desegregating schools, called out the Arkansas National Guard to prevent them from entering. \\"The nine students, chosen by Little Rock school system administrators for their excellent grades and records of good behavior, were stunned by the presence of hundreds of rioting segregationists and the Arkansas National Guard, the foundation said. The group was turned away. For two weeks, the group remained at home, attempting to keep up with their schoolwork. The federal court ordered Faubus to stop interfering with the court order, so he removed the guardsmen from the front of the school. On September 23, the nine entered the school for the first time, but an angry crowd outside beat African-American reporters who were covering the events, according to the encyclopedia. Little Rock police, who feared they could not control the mob, pulled the nine from the school that day, and they returned home. President Dwight D. Eisenhower then mobilized the Army's 101st Airborne Division to escort the nine into the school, calling the mob's actions \\"disgraceful,\\" according to the encyclopedia. The nine entered on September 25. The military presence remained for the entire school year, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture. However, the harassment did not end after the nine integrated the school. Military guards were assigned to escort the nine students to classes, according to the encyclopedia, but could not go everywhere, and name-calling, kicking and shoving continued in restrooms and locker rooms. \\"I do remember [the family] got a call that he had been knocked out -- someone had hit him on the back of head while he was at a locker in hallway,\\" said Jessie Agee, another sister of Thomas'. \\"But he wanted to continue on with it.\\" When it was time to leave school, he'd run home, and one of his older brothers -- armed with a tire iron -- would wait around a corner to escort him the rest of the way, Agee said. The following year, Faubus closed all the Little Rock high schools to avoid integration, the foundation said. When the high schools reopened for the 1959-60 school year, Thomas and LaNier returned to Central High and graduated in May 1960. \\"We're very sad,\\" Minnijean Brown Trickey, also a member of the nine, told CNN Monday. \\"We were friends before the Little Rock Central crisis, and we've been very close over the years, so it's a great tragedy for us.\\" Thomas was a track athlete at the African-American Dunbar Junior High School in Little Rock when he volunteered to attend Central High as a sophomore, according to his biography on the Little Rock Nine Foundation website. Hildreth said one of the reasons Thomas was inspired to volunteer came to him in biology class. At his old school, the class and the teacher had to share one frog when it came time to dissecting an animal. \\"But he heard at Central, all the students had their own frog to dissect. And he said he wanted to go to Central High because he would be in a class where each student had their own frog,\\" Hildreth recalled. \\"We would laugh about it [later]. He said, 'I just want my own frog.'\\" \\"He found out about the wonderful education they were getting there, and that's what he wanted to experience,\\" Hildreth said. Agee told CNN that everyone in their family, except their mother, thought Thomas' attempt to go to Central was a good idea. \\"She wasn't too keen on it, but she went along with it. His father wanted him to do it. She finally gave in. Him being the youngest, she was very protective of him. And he managed to do it,\\" Agee said. After graduating from Central, he entered Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, but joined his family after they relocated to Los Angeles in 1961. He attended Los Angeles State College, where he was a member of the student government and president of the Associated Engineers. He was inducted into the Army in 1966, and was assigned to duty in south Vietnam with the 9th Infantry Division, the biography said. \\"He served as an infantry squad leader and directed numerous field campaigns as they confronted enemy troops.\\" He returned to civilian life in 1968, where he helped his father run the family business and obtained his bachelor's degree from Los Angeles State College. He went to work as an accounting clerk and later a supervisor for Mobil Oil Corporation's Los Angeles Credit Card Center, while still working with the family business. When Mobile moved its operations to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1978, Thomas chose to stay in Los Angeles and went to work for the Defense Department. When the department relocated some of its Los Angeles operations in 1989, he sold the family business and moved to Columbus. In Columbus, he was active in education and community service. He received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Ohio Dominican University \\"in recognition of his life-long efforts in human rights and equality,\\" the biography said. Thomas was a recipient of the NAACP's Springarn Medal. \\"Date and time are pending for a celebration of Thomas' life in Columbus, Ohio, and Los Angeles, California,\\" the foundation said. Thomas is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Jefferson Thomas Jr.; and two stepchildren, identified as Frank and Marilyn by the foundation. \\"We volunteered to go to Central, not anticipating the opposition that we would face,\\" Trickey told CNN. It was only after Eisenhower sent in the 1,200 troops that the group was able to enter, she said. \\"We stay in contact because we had that experience, and we grew up together in Little Rock,\\" she said. \\"... we cared so much about each other and felt that, that common experience bonded us in an amazing way.\\" In 1999, the group formed the Little Rock Nine Foundation, which according to its website aims \\"to promote the ideals of justice and equality of opportunity for all.\\" CNN's Jason Hanna and CNN Radio's Michelle Wright contributed to this report.

Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - A mockumentary (a portmanteau of mock and documentary) or docucomedy is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary.  - Timothy John Bevan, CBE (born December 1957) is a British film producer, the co-chairman (with Eric Fellner) of the production company Working Title Films.  - The Kid from Brooklyn is a 1946 American musical comedy film directed by Norman Z.

It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom, generally during the Christmas and New Year season and, to a lesser extent, in other English-speaking countries. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing, employs gender-crossing actors, and combines topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or folk tale. It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.  - Bloom subsequently established himself as a leading man in Hollywood films such as Balian de Ibelin in Ridley Scott's \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" (2005) and \\"Elizabethtown\\" (2005). He made his professional stage debut in West End's \\"In Celebration\\" at the Duke of York's Theatre in London in 2007 and starred in a Broadway adaption of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in 2013.

But Rebecca Harris retained the seat with 23,112 votes - an increase of more than 3,000 votes from 2010. Mr Carswell held Clacton, but his majority was cut by 9,000 votes compared with last year's by-election. The Conservative candidate Giles Watling came second in Clacton again, but his vote increased from 8,709 to 16,205.

HBO Go will now be available on yet another tablet, the Kindle Fire, through eight out of the top 10 pay TV services in the U.S.      And it was just one more incremental move for HBO, as the premium cable company — the leading edge of parent Time Warner’s effort to move the traditional pay TV model into the IP-device world — re-establishes itself as television’s most relevant programming brand.      Also read: Preview – How HBO Go on Kindle Fire could boost Amazon’s revenue      Yes, HBO is just as important to the evolution of the television business as it was a decade ago, just for different reasons. Instead of bucking the TV establishment with groundbreaking shows, the subscriber-supported service, which still touts an industry-leading 29 million customers, is now carrying the establishment on its back.      As traditional TV’s most proliferate brand — available on Xbox 360 game consoles, iPads, Roku set-tops and now Android tablets like Kindle Fire, through a consensus roster of pay TV operators — the fate of HBO Go is the fate of TV Everywhere.      Netflix is out there teaching consumers that they can stream all they want for 7.99 a month; HBO is trying un-teach the concept that eight bucks a month will really sustain the kind of truly premium television content you’ve grown accustomed to.      And until Netflix proves that it can reliably create a full slate of original hits, no other programmer is as boldly venturing into the multi-device world on the strength of its own content.      My zeitgeistiness is gone. Has anyone seen my zeitgeistiness?      Certainly, a number of media industry pundits have pondered what HBO isn’t anymore. In April, media writer Michael Wolff explained in The Guardian that in the post-Sopranos era, the network is no longer the “sine qua non of the modern television generation,” i.e. those who are “upwardly mobile, zeitgeisty with-it, and media savvy.”      Wolff’s essay followed a March New York Observer story headlined, Is HBO’s Luck Starting to Run Out? The Observer also pondered just how special HBO is anymore, competing in a business in which other cable programmers, from AMC to Showtime, have developed their own Emmy-winning, cinematic-quality adult programs, driven by sharp, independent creative voices.      I’ll concede that HBO has lost something in terms of cultural weight and artistic merit — it’ll never be 2004 again, a year in which critically beloved achievements like David Milch’s Deadwood, David Simon’s The Wire and Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm all filled out HBO Sunday night schedules already anchored by still-running hits The Sopranos and Sex and the City.      That year was the middle of what Grantland writer Andy Greenwald called television’s “golden age” — an era, kicked off by the introduction of The Sopranos, when a former newspaperman like Simon could get a green light to explore, in the densest of all possible narratives, the interwoven institutional dysfunction of Baltimore (The Wire); or Matthew Weiner, a writer’s-room underling to David Chase on The Sopranos, could get license to make a period drama set in the white-collar world of an ad agency (AMC’s Mad Men).      These shows, Greenwald effectively argues, were developed when HBO and AMC were in their younger brand-building stages, able to take chances on acclaimed producers willing to work cheaply in order to freely explore out-there series concepts.      The business models — and the ratings expectations — have changed. Top level producers still enjoy ample creative freedom, but they need to be working off of source material with solid commercial foundations.      A producer like Alan Ball can make a show like HBO’s True Blood because it’s themed around a popular genre concept (vampires); Frank Darabont can create AMC’s Walking Dead because zombies have also proven to be box-office winners; HBO’s Girls (pictured above) can exist because Sex and the City already showed that female friends living in Manhattan works.      HBO’s hit period drama Game of Thrones? Lets just put it this way: the producers of that show came in with an eponymous adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s best-selling novels; when he was pitching The Sopranos in the late-1990s, David Chase was well-regarded as a top show-runner, but all he had was a resume that had Northern Exposure on it.      And, of course, it’s always tough to re-create the magic: After Deadwood (right), for example, HBO let Milch develop John From Cincinnati, a strange, etherial drama about a family of Southern California surfers that left viewers and critics trying to get water out of their ears. And last year, Milch and HBO missed again with Luck, a period drama themed around horse-racing that ended up losing the network about 35 million.      The cultural touchstones might be gone — not just from HBO, but from TV … everywhere. Has AMC come up with anything as fresh, profound and poignant as Mad Men or Breaking Bad? (I mean, come on, Walking Dead is fun, solid TV, but it is, in the end, just good genre television). And for however many comedic-dramas Showtime creates around female anti-heroes, will it ever top Weeds?      Yeah, I think Greenwald might be right — that magic hour, when desperate forces collided in the cable programming business and innovated the narrative story-telling capability of television, is gone. It probably ended in 2007, when Chris Albrecht, the brilliant architect of the programming renaissance HBO foisted upon the industry, was forced out following a very public Las Vegas arrest; or when Rob Sorcher and Christina Wayne, the creative executives who introduced Mad Men and Breaking Bad, left AMC in a huff.      I wonder if, in the ultra-fragmented video age we operate in, where DVR/VOD appointments are always pending and the spoiler-alert status is always on orange, if we could even coalesce a water-cooler hit anymore. What would happen if you told your office mates about a new show you saw the night before set in 1960s-era Madison Avenue? If you weren’t told, “Don’t tell me about it — I have it recorded,” you might hear “I watched Downton Abbey on PBS” instead.      Maybe, as they try to get attention to their emerging original series accumens, Netflix or Hulu will achieve an old-fashioned HBO level of alchemy, but so far initial efforts like Lilyhammer and Battleground have fallen far short of the mark.      The brand plays on      For its part, HBO has moved on to its next phase of product innovation — proliferating across platforms. And the programming mandate is different.      Its hits may not command the national conversation as say, The Sopranos once did, or Mad Men and Breaking Bad still do. But measuring its audience across platforms — something HBO started doing several years ago, way ahead of most other traditional programmers — the audience for Game of Thrones this season has averaged over 10 million viewers. That’s twice the size of Mad Men‘s audience.      There was a time when shows like The Wire, Deadwood and the creepy, Depression-themed Carnival helped HBO stand out and distinguish its brand. The attention from TV critics was nice.      But when you’re fighting with Netflix, Hulu and other original-series aspirants, seeking to make potential cord cutters not just cable subscribers, but cable subscribers who pay an additional 12 bucks a month for premium channels, merely appealing to well-educated media consumers in Manhattan and L.A. may not be enough.      The Wire gets you the “zeitgeisty with-it.” Game of Thrones gets you authenticated. ||||| HBO      Related HBO Says No, for Now, to Fans Who Want a Web-Only Option New York Times      It was just one more small step for TV Everywhere.

That year was the middle of what Grantland writer Andy Greenwald called television’s “golden age” — an era, kicked off by the introduction of The Sopranos, when a former newspaperman like Simon could get a green light to explore, in the densest of all possible narratives, the interwoven institutional dysfunction of Baltimore (The Wire); or Matthew Weiner, a writer’s-room underling to David Chase on The Sopranos, could get license to make a period drama set in the white-collar world of an ad agency (AMC’s Mad Men).      These shows, Greenwald effectively argues, were developed when HBO and AMC were in their younger brand-building stages, able to take chances on acclaimed producers willing to work cheaply in order to freely explore out-there series concepts.      (MORE: Google Takes Another Experimental Step Toward Delivering TV)      The business models — and the ratings expectations — have changed. Top level producers still enjoy ample creative freedom, but they need to be working off of source material with solid commercial foundations.      A producer like Alan Ball can make a show like HBO’s True Blood because it’s themed around a popular genre concept (vampires); Frank Darabont can create AMC’s Walking Dead because zombies have also proven to be box-office winners; HBO’s Girls (pictured above) can exist because Sex and the City already showed that female friends living in Manhattan works.      HBO’s hit period drama Game of Thrones? Lets just put it this way: the producers of that show came in with an eponymous adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s best-selling novels; when he was pitching The Sopranos in the late-1990s, David Chase was well-regarded as a top show-runner, but all he had was a resume that had Northern Exposure on it.      And, of course, it’s always tough to re-create the magic: After Deadwood, for example, HBO let Milch develop John From Cincinnati, a strange, etherial drama about a family of Southern California surfers that left viewers and critics trying to get water out of their ears. And last year, Milch and HBO missed again with Luck, a period drama themed around horse-racing that ended up losing the network about 35 million.      The cultural touchstones might be gone — not just from HBO, but from TV … everywhere. Has AMC come up with anything as fresh, profound and poignant as Mad Men or Breaking Bad? (I mean, come on, Walking Dead is fun, solid TV, but it is, in the end, just good genre television). And for however many comedic-dramas Showtime creates around female anti-heroes, will it ever top Weeds?      Yeah, I think Greenwald might be right — that magic hour, when desperate forces collided in the cable programming business and innovated the narrative story-telling capability of television, is gone. It probably ended in 2007, when Chris Albrecht, the brilliant architect of the programming renaissance HBO foisted upon the industry, was forced out following a very public Las Vegas arrest; or when Rob Sorcher and Christina Wayne, the creative executives who introduced Mad Men and Breaking Bad, left AMC in a huff.      I wonder if, in the ultra-fragmented video age we operate in, where DVR/VOD appointments are always pending and the spoiler-alert status is always on orange, if we could even coalesce a water-cooler hit anymore. What would happen if you told your office mates about a new show you saw the night before set in 1960s-era Madison Avenue? If you weren’t told, “Don’t tell me about it — I have it recorded,” you might hear “I watchedDownton Abbey on PBS” instead.      Maybe, as they try to get attention to their emerging original series accumens, Netflix or Hulu will achieve an old-fashioned HBO level of alchemy, but so far initial efforts like Lilyhammer and Battleground have fallen far short of the mark.      The brand plays on      For its part, HBO has moved on to its next phase of product innovation — proliferating across platforms. And the programming mandate is different.      Its hits may not command the national conversation as say, The Sopranos once did, or Mad Men and Breaking Bad still do. But measuring its audience across platforms — something HBO started doing several years ago, way ahead of most other traditional programmers — the audience for Game of Thrones this season has averaged over 10 million viewers. That’s twice the size of Mad Men‘s audience.      (MORE: Apple Wants to Upend the TV Business: Will Big Content Play Ball?      There was a time when shows like The Wire, Deadwood and the creepy, Depression-themed Carnival helped HBO stand out and distinguish its brand. The attention from TV critics was nice.      But when you’re fighting with Netflix, Hulu and other original-series aspirants, seeking to make potential cord cutters not just cable subscribers, but cable subscribers who pay an additional 12 bucks a month for premium channels, merely appealing to well-educated media consumers in Manhattan and L.A. may not be enough.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which student learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators?  Hannah and Joe are two colleagues. They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus.  Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. Answer:","output":"Joe learned less about ants fighting off aphid predators, as he studied ants that farm fungus rather than ants that farm aphids. Hannah, on the other hand, studied ants that farm aphids and thus learned about the ants' mutualistic relationship with aphids and their protective behavior against aphid predators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They argue that it hinders reconciliation, replaces old wrongs with new wrongs, undermines the achievements of minorities, and encourages groups to identify themselves as disadvantaged, even if they are not. It may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within minority groups at the expense of the disenfranchised within better-off groups (such as lower-class whites and Asians).There has recently been a strong push among American states to ban racial or gender preferences in university admissions, in reaction to the controversial and unprecedented decision in Grutter v. Bollinger. In 2006, nearly 60% of Michigan voters decided to ban affirmative action in university admissions. Michigan joined California, Florida, Texas, and Washington in banning the use of race or sex in admissions considerations.

Before you can start finishing your basement, you’ll need to make sure that you don’t have uncontrollable mold and moisture problems. Work to stop all mold in your basement and ensure that you can stop water from getting in. If you can’t, then you may need to consider that it would be unwise to continue. Once you know that it’s possible to finish your basement, you’ll need to create a budget to find out how much money you really have to work with. Don’t forget to take into account things like building supplies, extras, labor you’ll need to hire, and the items you’ll need to put in the basement like toilets and showers. Hiring a contractor or a designer may be a good idea, as they can help you figure out how much money you need and where you can save a few bucks. You’ll need drawn out plans, especially if you’re going to be doing the work yourself. You’ll need to know the lengths of all the walls you’ll put in, how much square footage of flooring material you’ll need, how much wall space you need to drywall, etc.  Draw out plans for your basement and the changes you plan on making and remember: measure twice, cut once!

This involves eliminating any existing mold and taking preventive measures to keep water from entering the basement. If moisture problems persist or are uncontrollable, it may not be feasible to proceed with the project. Once you have confirmed that your basement can be finished, the next step is to establish a budget.

The law is upheld, so where does it go from here? A. Now the scramble to enact the law continues. Unless the law is repealed by Congress, most of the major changes take effect on Jan. 1, 2014. By then, states must have set up health insurance exchanges, where people can buy coverage. Insurers will have to offer policies to anyone who applies, including people with expensive medical conditions. And people who do not qualify for exemptions based on income or religion will be required to have minimum insurance coverage or pay a penalty. Q. In what way was the Medicaid expansion “limited”? What is the meaning of this portion of the decision? A. The Supreme Court’s decision means that the Medicaid expansion is now an option for states, not a requirement. If states do not participate, experts have speculated that it could create a subset of people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid — the exact threshold varies — but not enough to qualify for the tax credits that would help them pay for insurance. States will not have to pick up the added costs of the Medicaid expansion until 2016. After that, the federal government will gradually reduce its contribution until it reaches 90 percent of the costs by 2020. Q. I’m unemployed and can’t afford health care, what does this ruling do for me? A. Beginning in 2014, the law expands Medicaid to cover people who are under 65 and earn income up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or 30,657 for a family of four in 2012. Families who make between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level — or 92,200 for a family of four in 2012 — will be eligible for tax credits for insurance plans that are purchased through state-run exchanges. Q. My parents are screaming about higher taxes from the Affordable Care Act. Any figures for those who have health insurance through our employers already? What does this mean for us? A. The law imposes tax changes that would affect some people who are covered through their employers, especially those in higher tax brackets. Beginning next year, the law increases the Medicare tax by 0.9 percent on earnings over 200,000 for individual taxpayers and 250,000 for married couples filing jointly. It also imposes a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for high-income households. Q. Does the ruling that allows states to reject the expansion of Medicaid allow states to reject all expanded care in the A.C.A.? A. No. The rest of the law stands. For example, states must continue to set up health insurance exchanges or the federal government may step in operate the exchanges itself. Q. I’ve heard that I’m required to have insurance. When does that go into effect? And what sort of penalties will I face if I don’t comply? A. Starting in 2014, most Americans will be required to have health insurance and could face federal penalties if they do not. Taxpayers will be required to indicate on their tax returns whether they have health insurance that meets minimal benefits standards, according to the Commonwealth Fund. If consumers do not have insurance by 2014, they would owe 95, or 1 percent of taxable income, whichever is greater. The penalty rises to 325, or 2 percent of taxable income in 2015, and then 695, or 2.5 percent of taxable income in 2016, up to a maximum of 2,085 per family. Q. What does the law mean for retirees on Social Security and facing high drug costs? A. The law shrinks the Medicare drug coverage gap known as the “doughnut hole” by requiring pharmaceutical companies to give a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs. Federal subsidies will gradually fill in the rest of the gap until it is closed by 2020. Q. I am now being covered by a plan in New Jersey that covers people with pre-existing conditions. It ends December 2013. What will happen? A. The high-risk pools that cover people with pre-existing conditions are intended to be a temporary measure until the rest of the law takes effect. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2014, insurers are no longer allowed to turn away customers with pre-existing conditions, and they must charge them rates that are comparable to other healthy people their age. Q. What happens to employees receiving health insurance from small-business employers? A. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from penalties that otherwise will be imposed for not covering their workers. Small businesses with fewer than 25 workers and average wages of less than 50,000 get tax credits to help cover their workers. The state health insurance exchanges, which go into effect in 2014, will also allow small businesses to buy coverage there. Q. Will my insurance premium go up? A. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that private health insurance premiums will increase by 5.7 percent each year, on average, from 2012 until 2022. But premiums would be getting more expensive with or without the Affordable Care Act. The budget office has estimated that, relative to what would happen in the absence of the law, premiums in the individual insurance market will be a little higher, employer-sponsored insurance premiums for big companies will be a little lower and employer-sponsored insurance premiums for small companies will stay about the same. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The government passed a law called the Affordable Care Act to help people get health insurance. In 2014, this law will help people who can't afford insurance by giving them money to buy plans. Some people will also qualify for Medicaid, which helps people with lower incomes get healthcare. If you don't get health insurance, you might have to pay a penalty. This law will also help seniors with high drug costs and people with pre-existing conditions get better insurance. Some people will have to pay a new tax, but overall, the law is meant to help more people get affordable healthcare."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since both terms on the left side of the equation contain the variable s, we can add them together. 28s + 11s = (28 + 11)s = 39s Now the equation is simplified: 39s = 195 Step 2: Isolate the variable s. To isolate s, we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 39: (39s) / 39 = 195 / 39 s = 5 Step 3: Check the solution. To check if the solution is correct, we can plug the value of s back into the original equation to see if both sides of the equation balance: 28(5) + 11(5) = 195 140 + 55 = 195 195 = 195 Since both sides of the equation balance, the solution s = 5 is correct. Therefore, the solution to the equation 28s + 11s = 195 is s = 5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Traditional typometry units are different from familiar metric units because they were established in the early days of printing. Though most printing is digital now, the old terms and units have persisted.  - The thumb is the first digit of the hand. When a person is standing in the medical anatomical position (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit. The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is pollex (compare \\"hallux\\" for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is pollical.  - The pica is a typographic unit of measure corresponding to 1  72 of a foot , or 1  6 of an inch . The pica contains 12 point units of measure . The pica originated around 1785 , when François - Ambroise \`\` L'éclat '' Didot ( 1730 -- 1804 ) refined the typographic measures system created by Pierre Simon Fournier le Jeune ( 1712 -- 1768 ) . He replaced the traditional measures of cicéro , Petit - Roman , and Gros - Text with \`\` ten - point '' , \`\` twelve - point '' , etc. To date , in printing these three pica measures are used : The French pica of 12 Didot points ( also called cicéro ) generally is : 12 × 0.376 = 4.512 mm ( 0.177 in ) . The American pica measure of 0.013837 ft. ( 1  72.27 ft ) . Thus , a pica is 0.166044 in . ( 4.2175 mm ) The contemporary computer pica is 1  72 of the International foot of 1959 , i.e. 4.233 mm or 0.166 in . Note that these definitions are different from a typewriter 's pica setting , which denotes a type size of ten characters per horizontal inch . Usually , pica measurements are represented with an upper - case \`\` P '' with an upper - right - to - lower - left virgule ( slash ) starting in the upper right portion of the \`\` P '' and ending at the lower left of the upright portion of the \`\` P '' ; essentially drawing a virgule ( / ) through a \`\` P '' . ( P ) Likewise , points are represented with number of points before a lower - case \`\` p '' , for example , 5p represents \`\` 5 points '' , and 6P2p represents \`\` 6 picas and 2 points '' , and 1P1 represents \`\` 13 points '' , which is converted to a mixed fraction of 1 pica and 1 point . Publishing applications such as Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress represent pica measurements with whole - number picas left of a lower - case \`\` p '' , followed by the points number , for example : 5p6 , represents 5 picas and 6 points , or 5 picas . Cascading Style Sheets defined by the World Wide Web Consortium use \`\` pc '' as the abbreviation for pica ( 1/6 of an inch ) , and \`\` pt '' for point ( 1/72 of an inch ) .  - The metric system is an internationally agreed decimal system of measurement. It was originally based on the and the introduced by the French First Republic in 1799, but over the years the definitions of the metre and the kilogram have been refined, and the metric system has been extended to incorporate many more units. Although a number of variants of the metric system emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the term is now often used as a synonym for \\"SI\\" or the \\"International System of Units\\"the official system of measurement in almost every country in the world.  - Middle English (ME) is collectively the varieties of the English language spoken after the Norman Conquest (1066) until the late 15th century; scholarly opinion varies but the Oxford English Dictionary specifies the period of 1150 to 1500. This stage of the development of the English language roughly followed the High to the Late Middle Ages.  - The yard (abbreviation: yd) is an English unit of length, in both the British imperial and US customary systems of measurement, that comprises 3 feet or 36 inches. It is by international agreement in 1959 standardized as exactly 0.9144 meters. A metal yardstick originally formed the physical standard from which all other units of length were officially derived in both English systems.  - The Germanic languages are a branch of the Indo-European language family spoken natively by a population of approximately 500 million people mainly in North America, Oceania, Southern Africa, and Central, Western and Northern Europe. It is the third most spoken Indo-European subdivision, behind Italic and Indo-Iranian, and ahead of Balto-Slavic languages.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information.  - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.  - An inch (abbreviation: in or ) is a unit of length in the imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to yard but usually understood as of a foot. Derived from the Roman uncia (\\"twelfth\\"), \\"inch\\" is also sometimes used to translate related units in other measurement systems, usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb. Traditional standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past, but since the adoption of the international yard during the 1950s and 1960s it has been based on the metric system and reckoned as exactly 2.54cm. Name. The English word \\"inch\\" was an early borrowing from Latin \\"\\" (\\"one-twelfth; Roman inch; Roman ounce\\") not present in other Germanic languages. The vowel change from Latin /u/ to English // is known as umlaut. The consonant change from the Latin /k/ to English /t/ or // is palatalisation. Both were features of Old English phonology. \\"Inch\\" is cognate with \\"ounce\\", whose separate pronunciation and spelling reflect its reborrowing in Middle English from Anglo-Norman \\"unce\\" and \\"ounce\\".  - In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \\"length\\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness.  - An ounce (abbreviated oz; apothecary symbol: ) is a unit of mass used in most British derived customary systems of measurement. It is most pervasive in the retail sale of groceries in the United States, but is also used in many other matters of domestic and international trade. Similar customary uses include recipes in cookbooks and sales of bulk dry goods.  - Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical types or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called sorts in mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography for visual display. Typesetting requires the prior process of designing a font (which is widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for typeface). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of works could be spotted more easily, making it difficult for copiers who have not gained permission.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Jason Munt said him and Carly Furnish got beamed up by a bunch of aliens just after he'd boldly gone with her in the car park woods. It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog.

In middle school, a lot of kids think it's cool to cuss and toss around four-letter words like a soccer ball at recess. McKay Hatch, 16, launched an initiative to curb the use of profanity. But when McKay Hatch was in eighth grade, he called foul on the cussing he heard. Hatch started the No Cussing Club. It began at his school and then, through his Web site, attracted members of all ages from all 50 states and 30 countries. His efforts even got the attention of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which declared the first week of March \\"No Cussing Week.\\" CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke to the 16-year-old about the recent success of his movement and the trials he overcame to start it. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. McKay Hatch: Actually, when I first went to my parents about the idea, my dad was kind of like, 'No, no, don't do this.' He knew I'd get bullied and teased, which I did, and more. I got a lot of death threats from people, but I realized that through this whole thing that these people were bullies and I wasn't going to let them win.  Watch the entire interview with McKay Hatch ». Nicole Lapin: Well, you received not only death threats we should say, McKay. Your site was hacked into, prostitutes were sent to your house. Were you ever scared by any of those threats? Hatch: At first I was actually pretty scared because they said, 'I know where you live.' Our address was posted online on a really big Web site and at first I was scared. But like I said, these are bullies and they wanted me to be scared and I wasn't going to let them win. Lapin: Even with the bullies, even with the threats, is this now in 30 different countries with thousands of members? Is it worth it? Hatch: It's definitely worth it. Now we have members in all 50 states and 30 countries. People are signing up with our Web site nocussing.com and they're taking the pledge to use language to uplift and make people feel good about themselves. That's what this whole club is. Lapin: It's not really about just cussing. It's also about civility.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which happened first, Franz Claasen becoming the first 'free colored\\" landowner or the African slave trade being ended by Denmark?","output":"Title: The Chronology of Social Milestones: Franz Claasen and Denmark's Abolition of the Slave Trade Introduction: The history of the African slave trade and the struggle for racial equality are undeniably interconnected. Two events – Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner, and the abolition of the African slave trade by Denmark – stand as milestones symbolizing hope and progress. But which of these two events happened first? In this article, we will take an in-depth look at the timeline of these two historical events and determine their chronological order.  Step 1: Research on Franz Claasen as the first \\"free colored\\" landowner To determine when Franz Claasen became the first \\"free colored\\" landowner, we'll need to delve into the available historical records. Our preliminary research reveals that Franz Claasen, a former slave, was a South African man who lived in the Cape Colony during the Dutch colonial rule. He was granted his freedom in 1676 and, thereafter, acquired land in Stellenbosch in 1679, making him the first known \\"free colored\\" landowner in South Africa. Step 2: Research on the end of the African slave trade by Denmark Now that we have the relevant information about Franz Claasen's milestone, we'll turn our attention to Denmark's abolition of the African slave trade. Denmark was among the first European countries to abolish the trade in African slaves. A thorough investigation into historical records indicates that the Danish parliament passed a law to abolish the slave trade in Danish colonies on March 16, 1792, which came into full effect on January 1, 1803. Step 3: Comparison of the two events With the critical information gathered for both milestones, we can now accurately compare their dates: 1. Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner – 1679 2. The African slave trade being abolished by Denmark – 1792 (enforced in 1803) Conclusion: Based on our research, it is clear that Franz Claasen becoming the first \\"free colored\\" landowner (1679) preceded Denmark's end to the African slave trade (1792). While both events signify important steps in the path toward racial equality and the cessation of the inhumane slave trade, their chronology establishes that the beginning of progress was marked by individual struggles, such as Claasen's, which ultimately culminated in collective efforts, like that of Denmark, to bring about systemic change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jason moved far overseas without Logan since","output":"Jason moved far overseas without Logan since he received an amazing job opportunity that he couldn't refuse. He felt a mix of excitement and sadness, as this meant leaving behind his best friend, Logan. They had been nearly inseparable since kindergarten, and the idea of being thousands of miles apart was daunting. Step 1: Introduce Jason's new life and work As Jason settled into his new life in this foreign country, he began working diligently at his new job as a software engineer. The company he joined was a leading technology firm, and the work environment was both challenging and stimulating. However, the absence of Logan left a void in his life that he struggled to fill. He spent his evenings exploring the city, tasting exotic foods, and trying to make new friends. But he couldn't shake off the constant longing for his old pal. Step 2: Show Jason's attempts to maintain a connection with Logan To bridge the distance, Jason and Logan set up weekly video calls, where they would catch up on each other's lives and share their experiences. Jason listened intently as Logan narrated stories of their hometown, and Logan eagerly took in Jason's tales of his new adventures. Despite this, they both felt that it wasn't enough; the bond they shared could never be truly replaced through video calls alone. Step 3: Introduce a catalyst One day, Jason received an email from a local cultural center, inviting him to join a weekend workshop on the traditional dance of his new country. Seeing this as an opportunity to immerse himself in the local culture and make new friends, he signed up. Maybe, he thought, this kind of experience would help fill the void that Logan's absence had left. Step 4: Describe Jason's experience at the workshop At the workshop, Jason was teamed up with a lively, friendly local named Maria. Together, they awkwardly tried to navigate the challenging dance steps, laughing at their own mistakes and clumsiness. Through this shared experience, Jason and Maria quickly became friends, and she introduced him to her circle of friends, who welcomed him with open arms. Step 5: Develop Jason's transition and growth As time went on, Jason began feeling more at home in his new country. He formed meaningful connections with his new friends, who showed him all the hidden gems of the city and helped him understand the local customs and traditions. Even as he created new bonds, he continued maintaining his strong friendship with Logan. The weekly video calls never stopped. Step 6: Introduce a plan for the future One evening, during one of their video calls, Jason shared an idea with Logan. He proposed that they should plan a big trip together, with a dual purpose: for Logan to visit him and explore his new country, and afterward, for both of them to set off on a backpacking adventure through neighboring countries. This way, they could create new memories together while exploring the world. Step 7: Conclude the story Both excited about the plan, Jason and Logan started researching possible routes and making arrangements. This newfound sense of purpose brought them even closer, despite the distance that physically separated them. Jason realized that friendships weren't defined by proximity, but by the genuine bond forged between two hearts. And as their adventure drew near, they knew that no matter where life took them, their friendship would continue to flourish and grow."},{"instruction":"Q: Question: what is the highest point in oahu?

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby.

It has borders with many countries, including Russia. In the past few days, some airplanes from Russia have been flying into the sky above Turkey. This is a big problem because countries have their own space in the sky, just like in a playground, and they don't like when others come into their space without asking.

As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and vocalist/banjoist Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \\"Rock Island Line\\", while with Chris Barber's band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \\"beat boom\\" of the 1960s. The 2017 line up is; Chris Barber and Bob Hunt (trombones); Mike Henry and Pete Rudeforth (trumpets), Bert Brandsma, Nick White and Ian Killoran (clarinets and alto sax, tenor sax, baritone sax). John Watson (drums), John Day (double bass), Joe Farler (banjo & guitar) Pat Halcox, trumpeter with the Chris Barber Band since 31 May 1954, retired after playing his last gig with the Big Chris Barber Band on 16 July 2008. Halcox and Barber were together in the band for 54 years - the longest continuous partnership in the history of jazz, exceeding even that of Duke Ellington and Harry Carney (48 years between 1926 and 1974). Tony Carter (reeds) also left the band at this time. Vic Pitt (double bass) retired in January 2007 after 30 years with the band.  His feature duet with the drummers of the day - \\"Big Noise From Winnetka\\" was not only a feature of the Barber concerts, but also his time with the Kenny Ball band immediately before. When Amy Roberts joined the band in 2011, she was still a student at Royal Northern College of Music and thus not always able to be present. On several tours Bert Brandsma (reeds) replaced her. Brandsma joined as a permanent member in 2012.  At St Luke's, London, on 9 June 2007 Barber appeared in the horn section of Nick Lowe's band during a concert. In 2008 Barber, along with Eric Clapton and others, were involved in a new co-operative record company, Blues Legacy. On 23 July 2009, Barber, Bilk and Ball played a one-off concert at Indigo2 at the O2 in Greenwich. The concert was presented by the British Music Experience.

The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

They must now set out to discover the truth behind their bizarre situation. As the story unfolds, Stella and Elle first suspect that they might be victims of some extraterrestrial force or the shuttle expedition somehow altered their reality during the time they spent on Seloria.

Stella and Elle decide to confront the team leaders and expose their deceit. However, they must be cautious not to anger or alert the secretive civilization they had unknowingly stumbled upon during their mission. They must uncover what the probe reveals about the lost human settlement and unravel the dark conspiracy lurking behind their assignment. As the duo makes one shocking revelation after another, they realize whatever force resides on Seloria poses an even graver threat to humanity. Loosening their memory wipe, they make themselves the prime targets of these sinister beings. With time running out, Stella and Elle must rely on their courage, quick-thinking, and unbreakable bond to prevent an imminent interstellar war while trying to regain their identities and restore their memories.

Given the question: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. Why did experts pay little attention to the problem of Atlantis? A) Because it worked perfectly. B) Because the right booster was still OK. C) Because nothing serious happened then. D) Because fewer people died in the flight.

As the situation continued to deteriorate, horrified onlookers could only watch in utter disbelief as the unthinkable transpired. The aggressor reportedly shoved Basin onto the tracks just as a Manhattan-bound G train made its way into the station. Unable to react in time, the subway train crushed Basin, bringing his life to a tragic and untimely end. Emergency responders rushed to the scene, desperately working to save Basin. Despite their best efforts, it was too late for the young man, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. The incident left both the responders and the witnesses in a state of shock and anguish, haunted by the events that unfolded before their eyes. The NYPD has now launched a manhunt to track down the unidentified assailant, who managed to escape the station after the incident. The investigators have released a description of the individual, calling for public support to help apprehend the suspect and bring him to justice. Meanwhile, detectives are thoroughly examining available CCTV footage and are trying to piece together a clearer picture of the events that led to the tragic death of Joshua Basin. This horrendous incident has left the community devastated and understandably concerned about safety in and around public transportation facilities. In response, local authorities have announced plans to increase security measures at subway stations, aiming to prevent any similar occurrences in the future. The family and friends of Joshua Basin are mourning the loss of the young man, who was known to be full of potential and well-loved by those who were fortunate enough to have known him. As they grapple with this profound grief, they are also faced with the painful reality that his life was taken so senselessly and violently. As the hunt for the perpetrator continues, the community stands united in their support for the victim's family and their desire for justice. The devastating events that transpired on Saturday evening serve as a grim reminder to all of the fragility of life – and the importance of ensuring that public spaces remain safe environments for everyone. In memory of Joshua Basin, a vigil is scheduled to take place near the Greenpoint Avenue Station this weekend, offering a space for mourners to gather and pay their respects to the young man whose life was cut tragically short."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Stallman was born to Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman, a printing press broker, in 1953 in New York City. Stallman had a difficult relationship with his parents, as his father had a drinking habit and verbally abused his stepmother. He later came to describe his parents as \\"tyrants\\". He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094. Context: As a first-year student at Harvard University in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in Math 55. He was happy: \\"For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard.\\"  In 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and became a regular in the hacker community, where he was usually known by his initials, RMS (which was the name of his computer accounts). Stallman received a bachelor's degree in physics (magna cum laude) from Harvard in 1974.  Stallman considered staying on at Harvard, but instead he decided to enroll as a graduate student at MIT. He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.  While working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under Gerry Sussman, Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI truth maintenance system, called dependency-directed backtracking. This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems. As of 2009, the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking. The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.  As a hacker in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects such as TECO, Emacs for ITS, and the Lisp machine operating system (the CONS of 1974-1976 and the CADR of 1977-1979--this latter unit was commercialized by Symbolics and LMI starting around 1980). He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. When MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward. Question: what did he study at Harvard? Answer:","output":"At Harvard University, Richard Stallman studied mathematics and physics. He was particularly known for his strong performance in Math 55 during his first year. He eventually received a bachelor's degree in physics (magna cum laude) from Harvard in 1974."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The nice thing about a city like Vegas was that when a man walked into a drug store covered in blood and reeking of sweaty dog, it was business as usual. I stepped up to the counter and threw down the bandages, handi-wipes, some sports drinks, and three pounds of beef jerky. Some girl with green hair and a pierced head was behind me chatting on her cell phone about flying out to Amsterdam to catch a P show at the end of the month.

Question 2: How can I play video from one file and audio from another file simultaneously so that I can enjoy video playback from one file and audio from another? Choose from: [i] no; [ii] yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Question 1: What is the best way of moving a really big file from one computer to another? The best way to move a really big file from one computer to another depends on your available resources, time constraints, and the size of the file. Here are a few different methods to consider: 1. External hard drive: Using an external hard drive is one of the most straightforward ways to move a large file between computers. Connect the drive to the source computer, copy the file to the drive, then connect the drive to the destination computer and copy the file from the drive to the new location. This method is relatively fast and is suitable for files that are too large for other transfer methods. 2. Network transfer: If both the source and destination computers are on the same local network, you can transfer the file directly between them without using an external drive. Set up a shared folder on one of the computers, then copy the file to that shared folder using the other computer. This can take a while depending on your network speed and file size, but it's convenient because it doesn't require additional hardware. 3. Cloud storage: Uploading the file to a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive is another option, particularly if the computers are not in the same physical location. Upload the file to your chosen cloud storage from one computer, then download it to the other. This method can be slow, depending on your internet connection speed and the file size, and it might require a paid subscription to accommodate large files. 4. File transfer tools: Some applications, like FileZilla, TeraCopy, and Resilio Sync, are specifically designed for transferring large files quickly and efficiently. These tools often use optimized algorithms to improve transfer speeds and can handle files of any size. 5. Physical mail: In some cases, especially when transferring really large files and when there's no time constraint, it might be more convenient to copy the file to an external hard drive or high-capacity USB drive and then physically mail it to the recipient. This is often referred to as the \\"sneakernet\\" method. Question 2: How can I play video from one file and audio from another file simultaneously so that I can enjoy video playback from one file and audio from another? To play video from one file and audio from another file simultaneously, you will need to use a media player that supports this functionality. Here are two popular media players that allow you to do this: 1. VLC Media Player: - Open the video file in VLC Media Player. - Pause the video. - In the menu, go to \\"Audio\\" -> \\"Audio Track\\" -> \\"Open File.\\" - Browse to the audio file and select it. - The audio will now play in sync with the video. You can adjust the synchronization by going to \\"Tools\\" -> \\"Track Synchronization.\\" 2. MPC-HC (Media Player Classic - Home Cinema): - Open the video file in MPC-HC. - Pause the video. - In the menu, go to \\"Play\\" -> \\"Filters\\" -> \\"MPC Audio Renderer\\" -> \\"Properties.\\" - Click \\"Add External File,\\" browse to the audio file, and select it. - The audio will now play in sync with the video. You can adjust the synchronization by using the +/- keys on your keyboard or going to \\"View\\" -> \\"Options\\" -> \\"Internal Filters\\" -> \\"Audio Switcher.\\" Regarding whether the answer to these two questions would be the same, the answer is [ii] yes, because the methods and tools discussed in each question vary significantly. Question 1 focuses on transferring large files between computers, while question 2 deals with playing video and audio from separate files simultaneously."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven, and notices that her son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a sÃ©ance at the Addams home led by Grandmama in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap.

In \\"That's All Right\\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \\"a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion.\\" While Katherine Charlton likewise calls Presley \\"rockabilly's originator\\", Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that \\"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly.\\" and, according to Michael Campbell, \\"Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit.\\" In Moore's view, too, \\"It had been there for quite a while, really.

They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village during the night of a blood moon, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren (Jimmy's great ancestor) returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva. The baron forged a sacred sword, then defeated Carmilla, but before dying, Carmilla cursed the village, adding that when the blood of the last of Mclaren's bloodline mixed with a virgin girl's blood, Carmilla would be resurrected.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - Menangle virus is a virus that infects pigs , humans and bats .  - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.  - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals.    What is the relationship between 'menangle virus' and 'species'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between the Menangle virus and species lies in the virus's ability to infect and impact various species, including pigs, humans, and bats. These species can be potentially affected by the Menangle virus, which is an infectious agent replicating inside the living cells of other organisms. This relationship between the virus and species showcases the interconnectedness and complexity of biological systems. In the context of this information, 'species' refers to distinct groups of organisms that share similar characteristics and can interbreed to produce fertile offspring. In the case of Menangle virus, it impacts the following species: 1. Pigs: Pigs belong to the genus Sus within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates, and they encompass the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals that can be affected by the Menangle virus, possibly leading to health issues or disruptions in the pig's population dynamics. 2. Humans: As part of the animal kingdom and members of the species Homo sapiens, humans are also susceptible to infection by the Menangle virus. Although rare, transmission from pigs to humans has been reported, posing potential public health concerns. 3. Bats: Bats represent another group of species that can be affected by the Menangle virus. These mammals serve as natural reservoirs for various viruses and may play a crucial role in the transmission and maintenance of the Menangle virus in nature. Thus, the relationship between the Menangle virus and species lies in the virus's ability to infect and affect multiple species' health and potentially trigger cascading effects within various ecosystems. Studying this relationship further can help us better understand the virus's transmission pathways, its potential risks to affected species' populations, and possible methods for preventing or controlling its spread."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Prell gives them a presenation on the Yeti, displaying slides with representations of what the unknown beast might look like based on descriptions of supposed eyewitnesses. Prell is planning an expedition with the four graduate students to Boot Island, where his associate Dr. Karl Werner (Tawm Ellis) lives. Werner has told Prell that he suspects a yeti lurks in the woods around his estate, and Prell intends to capture evidence proving the creature's existence. Prell seems particularly interested in Keith, and takes him to dinner at an exclusive restaurant, where he orders a meal for them that isn't on the menu, a special dish called \\"gin sung\\".The other students go to a party where they meet a former student of Prell's, Spencer Ste. Clair (Tom Grail). Spencer starts drinking, much to the objection of his wife (Luci Brandt), and when he overhears the students talking about the expedition with Prell, Spencer causes a scene at the party. He becomes hysterical, recounting his own experience on one of Prell's expeditions 8 years prior. Spencer and Prell were the only ones to survive, the others presumably killed by the yeti, which Spencer says attacked him and left him for dead. The people at the party don't take Spencer's story seriously, and he and his wife leave. When they return to their apartment, Spencer's wife breaks his bottle of liquor, causing Spencer to attack her with an electric carving knife.

Earth Answer:","output":"Title: Invaders of Metaluna Plot Summary: In the depths of the cosmos, the distant and advanced civilization of the Metalunans is facing the imminent destruction of their home planet, Metaluna, due to a dying sun and catastrophic solar flares. Desperate to save their people, the Metalunan leaders, led by King Zargon, seek out a new planet to relocate their entire population. After years of searching and numerous attempts at contact, the desperate Metalunans finally set their sights on Earth. Act 1: The movie opens with a series of increasingly powerful solar flares devastating the planet Metaluna. The viewer is introduced to the Metalunans, a technologically advanced species with an innate connection to metal, which they use to create and power their incredible technology. The Metalunans' close bond with their planet has allowed them to endure the increasingly harsh conditions for centuries. However, they have now come to the realization that they cannot survive much longer on their dying world. Desperate to save their people, King Zargon and his council summon the best and brightest minds to create a plan to find a new home. Xandra, a brilliant scientist, discovers Earth—a planet with abundant resources and a climate suitable for the Metalunans. Fascinated by the human race and their technology, Xandra sets off to Earth to establish contact and secure a lifeline for her civilization. However, her arrival does not go unnoticed by the humans. Act 2: Military and intelligence operatives detect Xandra's arrival with awe and trepidation. Fearful of the unknown, the human leaders attempt to make contact with the alien visitor. Despite their cultural differences and initial miscommunications, Xandra eventually befriends Jessica, a brilliant scientist working for the government, and shares the urgent need of her people. Jessica, moved by the plight of the Metalunans, takes the matter to the world's leaders, urging them to cooperate. However, the governments of Earth are divided—some leaders see the Metalunans as potential allies, while others are wary of the consequences of allowing an extraterrestrial species to settle on Earth. Act 3: With time running out for the Metalunans, tension between the human governments reaches a boiling point. As conflicts arise, Jessica feverishly works alongside Xandra to develop a plan for peaceful coexistence, leading to the establishment of a groundbreaking space alliance. Meanwhile, King Zargon, growing impatient and desperate, takes matters into his own hands, assembling a fleet of warships to secure Earth by force, if necessary. In the climactic final act, Jessica and Xandra must race against time to convince the world's leaders to unite against the approaching warships and present the peaceful coexistence plan. Just as tensions escalate and a war between humans and Metalunans seems inevitable, the united front of Earth's nations stands tall, convincing King Zargon that peace is the best course of action. Epilogue: King Zargon accepts the proposal, preventing war and ushering in a new era of cooperation between the Metalunans and humans. The Metalunans find a new homeland on Earth, and together with their human counterparts, embark on a journey to advance both species' technology and understanding, eventually stabilizing Metaluna's sun and rebuilding their home planet. \\"Invaders of Metaluna\\" becomes a thrilling tale of survival, diplomacy, and the power of unity, as two vastly different races come together to preserve their futures and change the course of the galaxy forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Manchester City 3-1 Everton Sergio Agüero of Manchester City scores his team's second goal against Everton in the Premier League at Etihad Stadium. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images The big news was that Joe Hart kept his place as Manuel Pellegrini fingered Micah Richards, Gaël Clichy and Matija Nastasic as the chief culprits from the defence that played in the miserable 3-1 defeat to Bayern Munich here on Wednesday evening. This meant Hart and Vincent Kompany were the sole survivors from that back five, with Jesús Navas and Edin Dzeko also being dropped ahead of an afternoon that would prove fine entertainment. The contest pitted a Manchester City that hoped to avert a third consecutive defeat against an Everton seeking to maintain the division's only unbeaten record. By the time Sergio Agüero claimed his second, on 69 minutes, to give his gang a 3-1 advantage, it would be City who had accomplished their mission, though Everton continue to look a fair outside bet to challenge for a Champions League berth. Although Hart was at fault for Everton's goal he would also be cheered for every regulation catch, save or kick he performed as the home crowd followed Pellegrini's decision to stand by his man by offering their support. While Kompany would last only 34 minutes before an injury meant Nastasic was restored, the contest lit up just past the quarter hour mark. This was when Romelu Lukaku collected a fourth of the season from a strike that will again focus scrutiny on Hart. The on-loan Chelsea forward took the ball, moved too easily past Joleon Lescott inside the area, then aimed an effort that went to the right of the goalkeeper. Hart got a glove to the ball but the failure to make the save will disappoint. With the Etihad Stadium still digesting this, City moved up-field and equalised almost instantly through Alvaro Negredo. Every time the \\"Beast of Vallecas\\" features for the Blues he makes an impact. In the hiding received from Bayern, Negredo entered as a second-half replacement ahead of pirouetting and potting sweetly beyond Manuel Neuer, for his team's consolation goal. Selected in the starting XI on Saturday, the Spaniard was in the right place at the right time to finish an eye-catching move. Fernandinho drilled a pass into David Silva, who ensured Yaya Touré received possession precisely where he would want. The Ivorian, particularly disappointing against the Germans, found Negredo and he pulled the trigger to slip the ball under Tim Howard for a fourth City goal of his debut season. Passages now ensued where City were given the runaround by this bright Everton side, though these became almost nonexistent during the second period. Ross Barkley continues to impress, his ability to ghost past opponents with his head up reminiscent of a young Paul Gascoigne. An illustration came when, in a central position, the Everton No20 skipped forward and looped the ball on to Kevin Mirallas's head, who drew an impressive save from Hart, before Martin Atkinson blew for offside. City's second came moments after Negredo and Seamus Coleman engaged in an argument near Everton's goal, which consisted of the latter accusing the former of going down too easily. Play had moved near City's end before, when it returned, Silva slid a cold-eyed ball along the inside right channel to Agüero. The diminutive Argentinian turned on the after-burners to gain half a yard, then rifled the shot past Howard. Pellegrini, who had had an animated conversation with James Milner after Everton's opener, showed further disquiet following the incident that forced Aleksandar Kolarov off on 57 minutes. After Steven Naismith shoved Nastasic into the left-back, Kolarov suffered a facial injury that meant Clichy should have been primed to enter, having warmed up. Instead, the Frenchman sat back on the bench to leave Pellegrini waving him back while asking his assistant Brian Kidd what, exactly, had occurred. The same question might have been asked of Atkinson of the 68th-minute penalty he awarded. Coleman made minimal contact with Pablo Zabaleta yet the referee still pointed to the spot. Agüero chose the nonchalant approach to execution and came close to coming unstuck: his spot-kick was a pea-roller that did not fool Howard, who palmed the ball on to his left post only for it to rebound from his head and in. Summary:","output":"Manchester City played against Everton in a soccer game. It was a fun and exciting match to watch. Manchester City wanted to win, so they wouldn't lose three games in a row. Everton wanted to win too, because they hadn't lost any games yet. In the end, Manchester City won the game with a score of 3-1. There were some really cool and skillful moments during the game, like when Sergio Agüero scored his second goal to help his team win. The players and fans had a good time, and everyone kept trying their best throughout the match."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He is approached by Fulton Greenwall, a British correspondent working for a provincial consulate in the fictional African country of Nibia. Being that Ace's influence is disruptive to the monastery, the Grand Abbot eagerly gives Ace excuses by which to justify his departure.Greenwall asks Ventura to find a sacred animal called Shikaka, which has become a point of contention. Shikaka, which is a great white bat, is a sacred animal for the Wachati and Wachootoo tribes of Nibia; whenever its name is spoken, the tribesmen must bow. Accompanied by his capuchin monkey, Spike, Ace travels to Africa and returns to his pet detective work.After arriving in Nibia and meeting with the head of the consulate, Vincent Cadby, Ace begins learning about his case as well as the possible suspects. Ace, normally an animal lover, must overcome his fear of bats in order to continue studying the case.

His career subsequently halted after his 6th birthday. Since his heyday, he has been reduced to parking cars at Morton's and appearing on Celebrity Boxing, where he is matched with Emmanuel Lewis. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi who apparently leaves him during a roadside incident, Dickie is washed up. After talking to an old friend, Leif Garrett, Dickie is absolutely convinced that a new Rob Reiner movie in the works, Mr. Blake's Backyard, will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and he pesters Tom Arnold to hook him up with Reiner. After he is kicked out because he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what turns out to be a Lamaze class. However, Brendan Fraser (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie. Reiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives.

Answer the following question: Article: There are plenty of different parks to visit in the UK. All theme parks in Britain have cafes, restaurants, picnic areas and gift shops, so you'll still have plenty to see and do when you and the kids have been on enough rides. There are usually smaller \\"funfair\\" rides and games as well, so younger children won't get bored. Several theme parks also have other attractions next to them, e.g. water parks often open all year round, unlike the theme parks. Wherever you are in Britain, there's likely to be a theme park within one or two hours' drive, bus ride or train journey. Several theme parks even have accommodation  so you can stay for a day or two if you want to make a trip into a short holiday. Prices for UK theme parks vary considerably; some have an entrance price which allows you to go on all the rides, while in others you have to pay for every ride individually. It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays. Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year! If you're thinking of visiting a UK theme park, it's worth having a look for special offers on tickets. Products such as chocolate bars and cereals sometimes have \\"buy one get one free\\" offers on theme park tickets, so keep a look out in shops and supermarkets. Question: According to the passage, what should you do if you are tired of crowds in the theme park? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Avoid the busiest months.\\"? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, I will go step by step: 1. Identify the relevant information in the passage related to crowds in theme parks.    - In the passage, it states, \\"Theme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year!\\" 2.
