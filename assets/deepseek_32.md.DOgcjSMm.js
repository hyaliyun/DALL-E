Joséphine-Éléonore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de Béarn (1825–1860) married Albert de Broglie on 18 June 1845, and they had five sons together. Although not high royalty, on the occasion of their marriage, they styled themselves Prince and Princesse respectively. Pauline was a highly intelligent and religious woman, who was well read and wrote a number of texts in her lifetime. Her shyness was well known; she was widely considered strikingly beautiful and charming, but those around her would often avoid eye contact so as not to embarrass her. Albert was devoted to his wife, and commissioned the painting after being impressed by Ingres' 1845 portrait of his sister, the Comtesse d'Haussonville. Albert approached Ingres around 1850 to undertake the portrait. Ingres dined with the de Broglie family in January 1850, and according to one eye witness, \\"seemed to be very happy with his model.\\"Although Ingres' main source of income came from portraiture, it distracted from his main interest in history painting, which early in his career, was far less lucrative. He found acclaim in the 1840s, when he became successful enough to no longer depend on commissions. This painting was Ingres' second-last female portrait, and final society portrait.Influenced by the working methods of Jacques-Louis David, Ingres began with a number of nude preparatory sketches, for which he employed professional models. He built up a picture of the sitter's underlying anatomical structure, as seen in the Musée Bonnat study, before deciding on how to build the lavish costume and accessories. Although there is no surviving record of the commissions, and the exact sequence of events is uncertain, the sketches can be dated from 1850, the year the style of her evening dress came into fashion. Ingres signed and dated the final picture at the left center \\"J. INGRES. pit 1853\\".Pauline died in 1860 aged 35 from tuberculosis.

To that end, he conducts two tests, test A an test B, on an organism. In test A he reduces catalysts from the organism, but in test B he induces catalysts in the organism. He needs to observe the outcomes of these tests.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would test B see reactions taking place slower or faster than test A?  Hint: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts. Answer:","output":"Test B would see reactions taking place faster than test A.  Step-by-step reasoning: 1. The hint provided states that most chemical reactions within organisms are hard to carry out under normal cellular conditions (such as low temperature and reactant concentrations).  2. To increase the rate of biochemical reactions, a catalyst is required. In organisms, these catalysts are called enzymes.  3. In test A, Mark reduces the catalysts (enzymes) in the organism. This means that fewer enzymes are available to speed up the reactions, thus making the reactions slower. 4. In test B, Mark induces catalysts (enzymes) in the organism. This means that more enzymes are available to speed up the reactions, thus making the reactions faster. 5. Comparing both tests, test B has more catalysts (enzymes) than test A. Therefore, test B would see reactions taking place faster than test A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: being imprisoned, no longer live, dies, fine, feeling of guilt  Why is \\"being imprisoned\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Being imprisoned\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a common and realistic legal consequence of committing a serious crime such as killing or murder in most societies. When someone commits a crime, especially one as severe as taking another person's life, it is generally understood that they will face punishment as determined by the legal system. Imprisonment serves several purposes in the context of such crimes, including retribution, deterrence, public safety, and rehabilitation. By imprisoning those who commit violent acts like murder, society attempts to deter others from engaging in similar behaviors and keeps criminals away from potential future victims. The other options provided in the possible answers are either less relevant or less likely: 1. No longer live: This might refer to the capital punishment, which is applied in some jurisdictions; however, it is not a universal legal consequence for killing and is less common in comparison to imprisonment. 2. Dies: The person who committed the killing is unlikely to die as a direct legal consequence (unless they face capital punishment, which, as mentioned earlier, is not a universally applied punishment). 3. Fine: Fines are generally reserved for minor offenses and would not be an appropriate or proportional punishment for a violent crime like killing. 4. Feeling of guilt: This is an emotional, not legal, consequence and might vary greatly depending on the individual. In a legal context, feelings of guilt are not considered as a formal consequence. Thus, among the given possible answers, \\"being imprisoned\\" is the one that aligns with human common sense because it effectively addresses the severity and implications of committing a killing and is a widely recognized legal outcome in most societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Just another night on the tiles: Ms Lepore - pictured here with Daphne Guinness, Lady Gaga and Terry Richardson last September - says she cannot believe her career success. Ms. Lepore's father withdrew her from public school - where she was already. isolated - hired a private tutor and even took her to a psychologist. who helped her obtain a hormone prescription. After moving to New York Ms Lepore. established her career as a nightlife figure, partying at night and. spending her days working in a nail salon, as a dominatrix, and later as. a cosmetics salesgirl for Patricia Field. 'I really associate glamor with being happy. If you put on high heels and lipstick or get a new outfit, you feel great' One evening while hosting at a bar in downtown Manhattan, she met celebrity photographer, David LaChapelle, and began collaborating with him. It was this partnership which ultimately helped her to achieve international acclaim as his muse. She has since appeared in fashion magazines, including French Playboy and Vogue, and scored cameos in music videos for artists including Elton John, The Dandy Warhols, and Grace Jones. Looking back on her career success, Ms Lepore previously told Interview Magazine: 'When I was in the hospital getting my sex change, I was just wishing I could be a pretty girl working in a mall. 'If I could have a crystal ball and see. what I look like now - you know, modeling, David LaChapelle, hanging out. with Daphne Guinness, singing with Lil' Kim, and traveling all over the. world, I'd be like, \\"Wow, I can't believe this.\\" 'I really associate glamor with being happy. If you put on high heels and lipstick or get a new outfit, you feel great,' Ms Lepore said. She is currently working on a new music album and getting her memoirs ready for publication. When it comes to fashion, Ms Lepore says she likes tight-fitting clothing that shows off her 'tiny waist.' And on the beauty front, she says she always does her hair and make-up herself because she's very particular about her look. 'I've had my boobs done and my bottom rib broken and pushed in - I think Raquel Welch and Cher did that, too' She likes to use a combination of foundation, concealer. blush, powder, topped off with a carefully applied brush of bright lipstick. 'Once I put my make-up on, it really doesn’t move. If I’m traveling, sometimes I will sleep with it on so that I don’t have to do it again - I’ll get off a flight and do whatever I'm doing with it on.' She has also been using a variety of creams to hide scars on her body after being involved in a car accident last year. The charismatic performer concluded on her made up look: 'I really associate glamor with being happy. If you put on high heels and lipstick or get a new outfit, you feel great. 'It's a celebration of loving yourself, and the whole ritual of it is so great.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Amanda Lepore, a famous transsexual figure in the New York party scene, has opened up about the extensive plastic surgery that has helped create her iconic image. After undergoing sex reassignment surgery at the age of 19, Lepore has since had three breast augmentations, buttock implants, and even had her lower ribs broken to achieve a smaller waist. This last procedure, which she believes stars like Raquel Welch and Cher also underwent, is illegal in the U.S., so Lepore had it done in Mexico. Along with her body modifications, Lepore has received numerous facial procedures such as lip injections, fillers, Botox, a nose job, a forehead lift, and her hairline lowered. These aesthetic choices were inspired by iconic figures like Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, and Jessica Rabbit. Lepore's journey into the world of plastic surgery was motivated by her desire to escape the bullying of her childhood peers and her fascination with Hollywood glamor. While she already had feminine features, she pushed the limits of transformation, earning her the title \\"The Most Expensive Body on Earth.\\" Her sex reassignment surgery was an incredibly painful experience for Lepore, but it played a critical role in shaping her identity and career. After moving from New Jersey to New York, Lepore became a renowned figure in the nightlife scene, hosting events and working various jobs during the day. Her career skyrocketed after meeting celebrity photographer David LaChapelle, who featured her as his muse in various projects that led to appearances in fashion magazines and music videos. Her collaborations with notable figures like Daphne Guinness, Elton John, and Lil' Kim has made her an international icon in the world of beauty and entertainment. Reflecting on her journey, Lepore associates glamor with happiness and loves the process of dressing up, transforming herself with makeup, and maintaining her image, which she meticulously does herself. She is currently working on a new music album and preparing her memoirs for publication. Amanda Lepore's life and choices demonstrate her extraordinary dedication to self-expression, pushing the boundaries of beauty, and celebrating her identity."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Here's a detailed description of how that works: After the glucose and oxygen are produced from the initial steps in photosynthesis, the plant needs to utilize these products to sustain its growth, repair, and reproduction. This is achieved through a process called cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide, water, and energy (in the form of ATP - Adenosine Triphosphate). ATP acts as a universal energy currency for cells, enabling them to carry out various metabolic processes, including growth and reproduction. Cellular respiration occurs in the various cells and tissues of the plant, mainly in the cell organelles called mitochondria. The process can be divided into three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. 1. Glycolysis: This is an anaerobic process (does not require oxygen) that occurs in the cell's cytoplasm. During glycolysis, glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) is split into two molecules of pyruvate (3-carbon molecules). In this process, two molecules of ATP are consumed, but four molecules of ATP are generated. Therefore, the net gain of ATP in glycolysis is two molecules. 2. Krebs Cycle: Also known as the citric acid cycle or TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic Acid cycle), the Krebs cycle is an aerobic process (requires oxygen) that takes place in the mitochondria of cells. During the Krebs cycle, the two pyruvate molecules generated during glycolysis are converted into Acetyl-CoA (2-carbon molecules) which enter the cycle where they are broken down, producing carbon dioxide as a waste product. The energy released from this process is stored in the form of ATP, NADH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide), and FADH₂ (Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide). 3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC): The ETC is the final stage of cellular respiration. It is also an aerobic process and occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane. During the electron transport chain, the electrons from the NADH and FADH₂ produced in previous stages are transferred through a series of protein complexes. These complexes use the electrons' energy to pump protons across the membrane, creating a gradient that helps generate a large amount of ATP. Oxygen serves as the final electron acceptor in this process; hence, oxygen is essential for cellular respiration. Upon accepting electrons, oxygen combines with protons to form water, which is another waste product of cellular respiration. In summary, the final step of the process you've described is the conversion of the glucose produced during photosynthesis into energy (ATP), carbon dioxide, and water through cellular respiration. This energy, in the form of ATP, is used by the plant for various metabolic processes, growth, and reproduction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The French sing, loosely translated by Marseillaise.org, “Listen to the sound in the fields/The howling of these fearsome soldiers/They are coming into our midst/To cut the throats of your sons and consorts/To arms citizens/ Form your battalions/March, march/Let impure blood/Water our furrows!” The lyrics of “God Bless the USA” are not only age-appropriate, they involve very little watering of furrows with blood. And even if they did, it would still be a better song. “Baby,” meanwhile, runs as follows: “Baby, baby, baby, ooh. Baby, baby, baby, ooh. Baby, baby, baby, ooh — ” Well, you get the idea. There are also other lyrics in there about “She knows she got me dazing ‘cause she was so amazing.” These are not age-appropriate either: They are an insult to the intelligence of any self-respecting kindergartner. Not only that, but he’s Canadian.

Next, we are told that 5/8 of these homes are collapsing. Therefore, the remaining homes that are termite-ridden but NOT collapsing are 3/8, because 5/8 + 3/8 = 1.  To find the fraction of all homes that are termite-ridden but NOT collapsing, we need to multiply the fraction of termite-ridden homes (1/3) by the fraction of termite-ridden homes that are not collapsing (3/8). (1/3) * (3/8) = 3/24 Simplifying the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: 3/24 ÷ 3/3 = 1/8 So, the fraction of all homes that are termite-ridden but NOT collapsing is 1/8.

From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism).

Hypothesis: Gosnell: America's Biggest Serial Killer is about a doctor that some people think may have been a serial killer.","output":"Yes, from the given context, we can draw the hypothesis that Gosnell: America's Biggest Serial Killer is about a doctor whom some people consider to be a serial killer. This conclusion is based on the information provided within the context, which presents an outline of the upcoming American film and its focus on Kermit Gosnell.  To elaborate further, the context mentions that the film is centered around Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor who has been reported to have killed hundreds of infants born alive during abortion procedures. The fact that Gosnell was convicted of three counts of murder adds weight to the depiction of him as a serial killer, as the term \\"serial killer\\" typically refers to an individual who has committed multiple murders over a period of time, often with a similar modus operandi. Furthermore, the context explicitly states that many people consider Gosnell to be a serial killer, which highlights the controversy and public opinion surrounding his crimes. This can be inferred as the main reason behind the production of a film about his actions, as it seeks to explore and shed light on this contentious figure and his appalling deeds, as well as raising awareness about the consequences of such unethical practices. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Gosnell: America's Biggest Serial Killer is about a doctor that some people think may have been a serial killer can indeed be drawn from the context provided. The film highlights Kermit Gosnell's heinous actions, focusing on his convictions for murder and the overall public opinion that he could be considered a serial killer due to the nature and extent of his crimes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season. The win also clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Patriots.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Now, I have a new situation: Fred was a good athlete in his youth, and so was Vic. Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's. His cholesterol is very high now.

Summarize this article: Teaching your Bernese Mountain Dog proper leash etiquette is very important — a big dog like a Bernese could easily drag you down the street if she isn't trained. Start out by letting her get comfortable with her collar. Put it on when she's likely to be distracted, like when she's playing or eating food.  If she tries to scratch it off or remove the collar, do not allow her to do so. Do not remove the collar until she's forgotten about it.  Once your Bernese is used to wearing her collar, clip on a lightweight leash. Don't try to lead her or do anything with it — let her just drag it around the house (under your supervision) and sniff it. Once your dog feels comfortable with his collar and leash, take the leash and begin walking around the house with him. If he walks beside you and/or lets the leash be loose or slack, give lots of praise, pats, and treats. If he begins to pull, stop in your tracks. Do not pull him back to you and do not proceed — allow him to come back to you. When the leash is loose again, praise him and begin walking again.  Never allow your puppy to pull you on the leash, as this teaches him that this is acceptable. By stopping the walk, he learns that pulling and straining will get him nowhere. If he wants to walk, he must do so without pulling.  If your puppy does the opposite and sits down, do not yank on the leash to get him to keep moving. Instead, call him over to you, offering treats and rewards when he comes.

Summarize this article: BAD TIMING      It’s hard to believe that it’s taken this long for The Disney Channel to feature a same-sex couple in one of its shows, but apparently, it has happened. The Disney Channel officially featured their first lesbian couple in an episode of Good Luck Charlie this week, and the whole situation is just so hilarious that they’ve plugged a laugh track over it because—you know—gay people are hilarious!      As you can see in the clip above, parents Bob and Amy Duncan share confusion over who, exactly, is the mother of Taylor, a child whom Charlie has invited over for a playdate. While awaiting the arrival of their guests, Amy swears she’s met Taylor’s mother Susan. Duncan swears he’s met Taylor’s mother Cheryl.      Haha! screams the laugh track, as Amy opens the door to reveal Taylor’s two lesbian moms. Faint giggles are heard as the lesbian mothers are introduced. Finally, a screeching LOL! in response to Duncan’s revelation that “Taylor has two moms!”      Disney claims it “consulted child development experts and community advisors” to make sure the Miley Cyrus-approved same-sex parent plot was “relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.” LOL! Wonder if those child development experts roared with laughter when Disney brought up lesbian moms?      Sure, I understand that most sitcoms rely on laugh tracks to ease you through painfully boring dialogue, but is making a lesbian couple the punchline of (admittedly a harmless) joke the best way to “reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness”? C’mon, Disney, I thought you were smarter than this. ||||| While you were busy reading your 27th think piece on Macklemore performing “Same Love” at the Grammys and Looking being boring, something actually kind of monumental happened: the Disney Channel featured its first gay couple on an episode of one of its original series.      Good Luck Charlie, one of the network’s most popular original comedies, featured a lesbian couple on Sunday’s episode. The plot was refreshingly innocuous, but pointed enough to let it be known that it was, you know, kind of a big deal that a Disney Channel series aimed at young children was taking this step.      The very sitcom-y premise: parents Bob and Amy Duncan set up a playdate for their daughter, Charlie, with her friend, Taylor and Taylor’s parents. Amy says the mother’s name is Susan. Bob swears he met her before…but her name is Cheryl. When they arrive, they find out that they were both right. Taylor has two mothers, and their names are Susan and Cheryl. Here’s the scene:      It’s so painfully clear what will happen when Bob and Amy open the door—Oh my god! Two moms!—that you almost cringe in anticipation of a groan-worthy gag or borderline offensive punchline. But the actual joke was neither of those things! Bob facepalms his forehead. “Taylor has two moms,” he says, in a “duh!” manner signaling that’s there’s nothing else to be discussed about it. That it’s no big deal. That it’s fine.      In fact, Disney was so bullish about this whole idea that Taylor having two moms was “fine” that it even put in the episode’s plot description that ran on TVGuide.com: “In the storyline, parents Amy and Bob Duncan (Leigh-Allyn Baker and Eric Allan Kramer) set up a playdate for preschooler Charlie (Mia Talerico) and one of her new friends. When the kid arrives, the Duncans learn that Charlie’s pal has two moms. That’s fine [emphasis ours], but the potential new friendship is put to the test as one mom chats with Amy, and the other is stuck listening to Bob's dull stories.”      As amusing as it is that Disney felt the need to editorialize the plot description, it is good news that the company is, indeed, fine with showing a gay couple on the series. When it was announced back in June that they would be doing the episode, Disney’s spokesperson was happy to say just how fine they were with it, saying the plot was developed “under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisers. And like Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.”      While Disney was fine—so fine!—with its decision to feature a gay couple, the anti-gay group One Million Moms, predictably, was not. Here’s a little bit of the hogwash 250-word “Calling all parents!” bulletin it put out encouraging a viewer and advertiser boycott of the show: “Just because something may be legal or because some are choosing a lifestyle doesn’t make it morally correct.”      The move did have two very high-profile fans, though, in Evan Rachel Wood and former Disney princess herself, Miley Cyrus:      There are, as there always are, reasons for some to be dissatisfied with the extent of Disney’s gesture, and some who may view it as empty. To begin with, it was a fringe storyline on the episode—not part of the main plot. There’s also the fact that these characters aren’t slated to appear in any more episodes of the series because—oh yeah—the next new episode of Good Luck Charlie will be its series finale.      But you know what? That’s still fine. ||||| Last night's episode of Good Luck Charlie, \\"Down a Tree,\\" broke new ground for the Disney Channel with the inclusion of a lesbian couple, the network's first out characters in a series. In the episode, Amy and Bob Duncan set up a playdate for their daughter Charlie and one of her new friends, who just happens to have two moms. The couples come to find that they just don't get along when Bob bores one mom with work stories and the other continuously cuts Amy off, check out a clip below.      The inclusion of a family with two moms is a historic move in the right direction for the network which has never before included out gay characters in their series and made-for-TV films. In an interview about the Good Luck Charlie episode, a Disney spokesperson said, \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\"      During November 2012, the Disney Channel's social outreach campaign \\"Make Your Mark,\\" which encourages and inspires kids to make a difference in the world, featured a 14-year-old named Ben, an aspiring filmmaker who has two moms. Ben's spot ran on Disney Channel for several weeks, check it out below. ||||| While Macklemore was rapping about marriage equality on the Grammys stage, the Disney Channel was making a statement of its own on Sunday, Jan. 26. The network featured its first ever same-sex couple on the show Good Luck Charlie.      After announcing the decision in June 2013, the channel finally delivered when lesbian mothers Susan and Cheryl dropped off their daughter Taylor for a play date with the main family's daughter Charlie.      PHOTOS: Out and proud celebs      Disney even added in some humor to the introduction when Charlie's parents Amy (Leigh-Allyn Baker) and Bob (Eric Allan Kramer) are confused about who Taylor's mom was before meeting the couple.      \\"Taylor has two moms!\\" Bob declared after meeting the two women, proving he had been right in calling one of the moms Cheryl.      \\"Wow, nothing gets past you, Bob,\\" his wife sarcastically replied.      PHOTOS: Hollywood's gay power couples      Actress Desi Lydic, who played mom Susan, tweeted to excited fans after the episode aired, \\"I'm so proud to be part of that episode! Go Disney! #equality.\\"      The show has been on since 2010 and is currently in its fourth and final season. Last June, Disney channel producers spoke with TV Guide about the groundbreaking decision to include a same-sex couple on the children's show.      \\"This particular storyline was developed under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisors,\\" a Disney Channel spokesperson told TV Guide. \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\"      DISNEY CHANNEL/Bob D'Amico      At the time of the announcement, former Disney star Miley Cyrus tweeted out in support of her former network's decision.

Life isn't bright sets & wardrobe & kids becoming superstars! This is INSPIRING.\\"      But not everyone was as pleased as Cyrus was with the family-based programming.      One Million Moms -- the same group who led a boycott on JCPennys for naming Ellen DeGeneres as an ambassador -- posted an official call to action on their website based on the historic episode.      PHOTOS: Disney stars through the years      \\"Disney has decided to be politically correct instead of providing family-friendly programming,\\" the group wrote. \\"Disney should stick to entertaining, not pushing an agenda. Conservative families need to urge Disney to avoid controversial topics that children are far too young to comprehend. This is the last place a parent would expect their children to be confronted with topics that are too difficult for them to understand. Mature issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon, and it is extremely unnecessary.\\"      The Susan and Cheryl characters are not expected to appear on the series after the Jan. 26 episode. ||||| While Queen Latifah was marrying all manner of couples at the Grammys on Sunday night, the Disney Channel slipped its own milestone under the radar: the first appearance of a lesbian couple on one of its TV shows.

Charlie has a playdate with a new friend, Taylor, who—it turns out—has two moms. As you can see from the clip above, that's treated as no big thing. The problem is, according to TV Guide's synopsis, \\"the potential new friendship is put to the test as one mom chats with Amy, and the other is stuck listening to Bob's dull stories.\\"      Disney explained the development of the episode back in June, when it was initially announced:      Advertisement      \\"This particular storyline was developed under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisors,\\" a Disney Channel spokesperson says. \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\"      It's strange in this day and age to see lesbian parents treated as a little exotic. Plenty of kids (and probably plenty of kids watching the Disney Channel) are being raised by same-sex couples. Then again, I suppose you could read the little argument over Taylor's mom's name as a lesson in making assumptions.      Plus, you're generally doing something worthwhile when it inspires One Million Moms to shit bricks. But Miley approves!      Sponsored      (h/t Joe. My. God) ||||| Alerting all parents! In a first for the Disney Channel, an episode in the next season of \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" will feature a family with two moms.      The episode will air in early 2014 as part of \\"Good Luck Charlie's\\" final season. Because \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" is coming to a close, the characters are only expected to appear in one episode. However, one episode is bad enough, and the network repeatedly airs previews in commercials leading up to new episodes and also replays episodes in reruns.      In the storyline, parents Amy and Bob Duncan (Leigh-Allyn Baker and Eric Allan Kramer) set up a playdate for preschooler Charlie (Mia Talerico) and one of her new friends. When the child arrives, the Duncans learn that Charlie's pal has two moms.      Disney Channel understands the controversial nature of featuring a same-sex couple on one of its sitcoms and said it took extra care in crafting the episode. \\"This particular storyline was developed under the consultancy of child development experts and community advisors,\\" a Disney Channel spokesperson said. \\"Like all Disney Channel programming, it was developed to be relevant to kids and families around the world and to reflect themes of diversity and inclusiveness.\\"      Just because something may be legal or because some are choosing a lifestyle doesn't make it morally correct. Disney should stick to entertaining instead of pushing an agenda. Disney decided to be politically correct versus providing family-friendly programming. Disney has a choice whether to produce a program with certain fictional characters; the storyline could be re-written or changed. Conservative families need to urge Disney to exclude confusing topics that children are far too young to comprehend.      Media influences children tremendously. Gay-rights advocate Miley Cyrus, who got her start on the channel's hit series \\"Hannah Montana,\\" has praised the network for the decision. In a post on Twitter, she wrote, \\"I commend Disney for making this step into the light of this generation. They control so much of what kids think!\\"      Unfortunately, children are now being exposed to same-sex marriage on a network that is designed for kids. This is the last place a parent would expect their children to be confronted with topics that are too complicated for them to understand. Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon, and it is becoming extremely common and unnecessary.      Families tuning in to watch a children's network may encounter a premature discussion on sexual orientation that is completely uncalled for. Disney claims it is not responsible for Gay Days held at the Magic Kingdom because it is out of its hands, but Disney cannot hide behind that excuse any longer and pretend it is not pushing an agenda. One Million Moms will hold Disney accountable for the content produced and marketed directly to young viewers over the Disney Channel Network, which they have complete control over.      Take Action      Please send Disney an email letter requesting they omit the scene in \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" featuring two moms or do not air this controversial episode at all. If producers keep this episode as originally planned, then conservative families will have no choice but to no longer watch Disney Channel Network in their homes so they can avoid the previews, commercials and reruns for this irresponsible episode. Families will not allow Disney Channel in their homes if they must protest the network veering away from family-friendly entertainment. |||||","output":"The Disney Channel featured its first same-sex couple in an episode of \\"Good Luck Charlie\\" in 2014. The episode introduced a lesbian couple as the parents of a child who comes over for a playdate with Charlie, the lead character. While Disney Channel consulted child development experts and community advisors to ensure the storyline was family-friendly and diverse, it received mixed reactions. Some praised the inclusion of a same-sex couple, while others, such as the anti-gay group One Million Moms, objected and called for a boycott of the show."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The X Files Movie plot: The film opens in prehistoric times in a wordless sequence. A Neanderthal man stumbles upon what appears to be a large, primal, vicious alien in a cave (although the camera work uses zooms and flash-edits to keep the creature from being visualized fully). The two fight, and the caveman wins, stabbing the alien to death. However, fans of the show will recognize the black oil as it bleeds from the alien's wounds and soaks into the Neanderthal. After a fade to modern-day small-town Texas, a little boy (Lucas Black) falls down a hole in his back yard, and finds a human skull. As he picks it up, black oil seeps out from the ground beneath his feet, and black slivers move up his legs until they reach his head - his eyes go black. Shortly afterward, a team of firemen descend to rescue him. They are presumably lost to the same fate as the boy.In the summer of 1998, at the end of the show's fifth season, the X-Files were shut down, and Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were assigned to other projects. They are first seen assisting Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Darius Michaud (Terry O'Quinn), and his FBI team investigating a bomb threat to a Federal building in Dallas, Texas. When Mulder separates from the team to scout out the building across the street, he discovers the bomb in a first-floor vending machine. While Michaud remains to disarm the bomb, Mulder and Scully are able to evacuate the building and prevent hundreds of casualties before it explodes. It becomes clear to the viewer, (but not the agents,) that Michaud is making no effort to disarm the bomb, which ultimately explodes.(Several media commentators noted parallels between this and the real-life 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing.)[1][2]Mulder and Scully return to Washington, D.C., but instead of commending their roles in preventing the deaths of hundreds, they are instead chastised because four victims were still in the building: three firemen, and one little boy.

Therefore, by using the sentence context, the correct answer is likely 'Lok Sabha' (লোকসভা) as it aligns with the person's political career at the national level.

Kindness Does Not Equate To Weakness In Leadership Following World Kindness Day, it’s a time to reflect on being kind and, for those of us who lead organizations, a time to think about kindness in leadership. For many critics, kindness in leadership equates to weakness. However, in today’s age of open feedback available on the web both from customers and employees, being a kind leader is essential to success. Being a kind leader does not mean that you don’t fire people. It doesn’t mean that you don’t make tough decisions that will impact the bottom line. And it doesn’t mean that you won’t work harder than those who are unkind. It simply means that you are focused as much on the delivery of your message as you are on the message itself. Business leader and blogger Jon Mertz describes it has kind leaders having an “iron fist in a velvet glove.” Think about esteemed leader Colin Powell for just a minute. In his book It Worked For Me, he talks about the skill set needed to be a drill sergeant. While every soldier is taught to fear his or her drill sergeant, the best drill sergeants aim to also instill strength and confidence in their soldiers. By building that strength through kindness, the sergeant is better able to deliver the very tough decisions that they need to make. Do you have what it takes to be this type of leader? Here are three key elements of kind leadership. Be kind to your employees, but remember that your customers deserve kindness too. As a leader, I work really hard to be kind to my employees. One of my greatest accomplishments has been being named a top place to work in New York City. But there have been a few times when my employees have made mistakes at the expense of my clients. While I can be kind in my delivery of a message to my employees, I need to remember that being a good leader is about being kind to customers too. In the services industry, I am responsible for ensuring that my customers (and their customers) have an incredible experience working with us. Being kind to my clients means that I am protective of their end product. And if my employees are not delivering that, they know that I will very kindly tell them that they likely are not the right fit here. And this has been openly communicated to them so that they are never surprised when it happens–because another part of being a kind leader is making sure people always know where they stand. Act like a good dentist. I’ve been to a number of dentists throughout my life and have often been quite fearful of the experience. I’ve found that the very best dentists are the ones who tell me what’s going to happen next. “Carrie, now I’m going to use the polisher…Carrie, I’m going to use a Novocaine needle…Carrie, we’re all done.” When I know what to expect, I am much more apt to trust my dentist. It’s the same in leadership. Being kind is not necessarily singing a song about how wonderful everything is–in fact, it’s almost the opposite. It’s getting everyone on the same page and letting them know what to expect so that you’re all marching in the same direction and end up with the desired result (in the case of a trip to the dentist–it’s clean, pearly whites). Create a culture of ferocious kindness. One of my favorite companies that I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with is BELFOR—the worldwide leader in disaster recovery and property restoration. These guys are fierce–they focus on being the absolute BEST in their category. But they are also incredibly kind and build that into the company’s DNA. One of their mottos is: “Do the right thing, even when no one is watching.” You see this culture of kindness funnel through every aspect of the organization, whether it’s advertising or social media campaigns. And the kindness that Sheldon Yellen, BELFOR’s CEO, showed on the hit show Undercover Boss kept with this theme. BELFOR walks the walk and talks the talk–while simultaneously being focused on being number one in their category. The true magic comes when the ferocity to win and the commitment to be kind are both a part of your company DNA. And what happens when you are not kind? Well, the recent explosion of review sites, both from the consumer side and employee side, would indicate that unkind leaders will be revealed. Almost any time a prospective employee applies to my organization, that person lets me know that he or she has already checked Likeable Media on Glass Door, a review site for employers and employees. You should certainly be kind even when you think no one is watching–but realize that, in today’s day and age, people most definitely are watching your every move. Would you classify yourself as a kind leader? Do you think it’s important to be kind in today’s market? Share below. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Kindness in leadership does not equate to weakness, it means remaining focused on both the message itself and on the delivery of the message. Kind leaders are essential for success in today's age of feedback available on the web from customers and employees. Three key aspects of kind leadership include being kind to employees as well as customers, being clear about expectations and what is to happen next, and creating a culture of ferocious kindness.

Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man.

Step 4: Create a climax and resolution In the climax of the movie, Alex finally locates Damien's lair deep in the heart of Maryland's wilderness. He sets out to confront Damien and save the abducted individuals. During the confrontation, Alex is tested both mentally and physically against Damien's formidable magical powers. In the end, Alex prevails, either by outsmarting or overpowering Damien, or possibly by enlisting the help of the abducted individuals, who are able to use their newfound supernatural powers against the Warlock. With Damien defeated, the abducted individuals are freed. However, not all of the victims are willing to return to their normal lives, leading to a potential sequel where Alex must track down and help those who have chosen to use their powers for nefarious purposes. The answer to the question \\"Whose location is identifying by Warlock? Maryland\\" is that Warlock, Damien Blackwood, is identifying and abducting people with supernatural potential in the state of Maryland, and Alex Hart is tasked with putting an end to his dark plans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  Now, I have a new situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.

The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad. That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing   it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince   Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer. Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition  . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up. Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911.

Moments after a panicked and injured man, Dan (Jeffrey DeMunn), runs in warning of danger, a thick mist envelopes the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors and the town's tornado siren. A man disregards the warnings and is attacked while running to his car. A mentally unstable religious woman, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), decides that this is the beginning of Armageddon. A shaken woman (Melissa McBride), against objections from the others, leaves the store to go home to her children and disappears. While investigating the store's generator, a bag-boy named Norm (Chris Owen) volunteers to go outside, but is snatched and pulled into the mist by a tentacle connected to an unseen monster. Norton heads outside with a small group to seek help, only to be attacked and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows. That night, enormous insects land on the windows and pterodactyl-like animals attack them, breaking the glass and allowing the creatures to begin fighting inside the store. One of the insects lands on Mrs. Carmody, but doesn't sting her because she keeps still during her prayer. As a result, she starts preaching more and quickly gains followers among the distraught survivors. A trip to the neighboring pharmacy to gather medical supplies goes horribly wrong and two people are killed by giant spiders. Mrs. Carmody's faction now contains most of the survivors.

Poke holes under buckets, fill with water, and place next to tree. Justification: The best way to create a slow garden watering tool is to allow water to seep gradually and directly into the soil, ensuring that the water reaches the roots of the plants. By poking holes in the bottom of the bucket, the water will be released slowly into the soil, giving it enough time to penetrate and be absorbed by the roots. This method also helps to prevent water loss due to evaporation as the water is released directly into the soil rather than exposed to air. Furthermore, this technique can provide a more even distribution of water around the tree, as the water spreads out radially from the bucket."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the mulch breaks down, it naturally adds nutrients to the underlying soil.","output":"First, determine the area you want to cover with mulch and calculate the required amount of mulch needed to cover it.  Step 1: Assess the area to be mulched Consider factors such as the type of plants, the local climate, and any specific needs of your landscape. Step 2: Choose the right type and depth of mulch Based on your assessment, select the appropriate organic mulch type from the options available. Determine the depth of mulch needed, typically 2-4 inches for most applications. Step 3: Prepare the area Clear the desired area of weeds, debris, and rocks. This will help ensure the mulch lays flat and prevents weed growth. Step 4: Apply a layer of landscape fabric (optional) If desired, lay a layer of landscape fabric over the area to provide a barrier against weeds while still allowing water and nutrients to pass through to the soil. Step 5: Spread the mulch Using a wheelbarrow, shovel, or rake, spread the mulch evenly over the landscape fabric or prepared area at the recommended depth. Step 6: Keep mulch away from plant stems and tree trunks Make sure to keep the mulch at least 1-2 inches away from plant stems and tree trunks to prevent rot and diseases. Step 7: Water the mulch After mulch is applied, water the area to help settle the mulch into place and stabilize it against wind and erosion. As time progresses, organic mulch will break down and continue to provide valuable nutrients to the soil, promoting healthy plant growth. Consider replenishing the mulch annually or as-needed to maintain its effectiveness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pope links prosperity with spreading 'spiritual desert' As he wrapped up a visit to Australia on Sunday, Pope Benedict XVI warned a crowd of 400,000 young people that a feeling of spiritual emptiness often accompanies material wealth. He urged them to avoid the pitfalls of prosperity as he led an outdoor mass for pilgrims who had gathered for the Roman Catholic church's six-day World Youth Day festival in Sydney. \\"In so many of our societies, side by side with material prosperity, a spiritual desert is spreading: an interior emptiness, an unnamed fear, a quiet sense of despair,\\" the pontiff said. The Pope referred to the modern worldâs âhard crust of indifferenceâ to God and said the world âwants to forget God, or even reject him in the name of a falsely conceived freedom.â He urged followers to throw off indifference and embrace a new age free from \\"shallowness, apathy and self-absorption,\\" which he said \\"deadens our souls and poisons our relationships.\\" âA new generation of Christians is being called to help build a world in which Godâs gift of life is welcomed, respected and cherished â not rejected, feared as a threat and destroyed,â the Pope told the crowd. The pope, 81, also announced that Madrid, Spain, would host the next World Youth Day in 2011 and told the pilgrims that he looks forward to being there in three years.

Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.  Paragraph: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which river had a food source mostly derived from algae?","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the Mures river, which is slow-moving and deep, would have a food source mostly derived from algae. This is because wider streams and those that lack a canopy, like the Mures river, tend to derive the majority of their food base from algae rather than from trees in riparian forests which primarily support fast moving rivers like the Olt.

After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What are the strangers accused of? Of the death of another person or persons The answer is:","output":"Step 1: Determine the genre of the movie In order to build a movie plot around the question, I need to first determine what genre the movie will be. Considering the theme of accusations involving the death of another person, I'll choose the thriller/mystery genre for this movie. Step 2: Develop main characters To create an interesting movie, strong and well-defined characters are key. In this case, I'll develop three main characters: a) A detective: The primary investigator of the mysterious death(s). b) A victim: The individual(s) who have died under suspicious circumstances. c) Strangers: Several individuals who become linked to the case and are accused of being involved in the death. Step 3: Set the scene and conflict The movie will open with the discovery of the victim's body in a small, close-knit town. The death appears to be suspicious and the detective is brought in to investigate. As the detective delves deeper into the case, he stumbles upon a group of strangers with seemingly no connection to the victim, but eventually become the prime suspects. These strangers just arrived in town, and their sudden appearance adds to the tension and suspicion surrounding the case. Step 4: Introduce the plot twist and complicating factors As the detective continues to build a case against the strangers, unexpected evidence comes to light that puts their guilt into question. This evidence may include conflicting alibis, a hidden motive involving another character in the story, or a previously unknown connection between the strangers and the victim. The detective must now question everything he initially believed and reevaluate his approach to solving the case. Step 5: Climax and resolution The climax of the movie occurs when the detective confronts the strangers directly, leading to a dramatic and tense encounter. Further evidence is revealed, and the detective is confronted with a difficult decision: Does he trust his intuition and pursue charges against the strangers, or does he let them go and continue searching for the truth? In the end, the detective must face his doubts and choose the path he believes will bring justice for the victims. Step 6: Wrap up the movie The movie concludes with the detective revealing the true culprit and solving the case, providing closure for the victims and their families. The strangers' lives are forever changed by the accusations. The detective learns a valuable lesson about trusting his instincts and the importance of thoroughly examining every piece of evidence. In summary, the movie plot revolves around a mysterious death, strangers accused of being involved, and a detective's quest for justice amidst a web of secrets and lies."},{"instruction":"What is the full name of the person who was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  By the reign of Henry VII the cathedral was complete, appearing much as it does today (though the fittings have changed). From 1508 to 1546, the eminent Italian humanist scholar Polydore Vergil was active as the chapter's representative in London. He donated a set of hangings for the choir of the cathedral. While Wells survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries better than the cathedrals of monastic foundation, the abolition of chantries in 1547 resulted in a reduction in its income. Medieval brasses were sold, and a pulpit was placed in the nave for the first time. Between 1551 and 1568, in two periods as dean, William Turner established a herb garden, which was recreated between 2003 and 2010.Elizabeth I gave the chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, creating a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended with the onset of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailor, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him through with a sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks. Answer:","output":"Walter Raleigh"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lechenaultia is endemic to Australia, which means it is native and found primarily in this country. Within Australia, Lechenaultia thrives in the diverse climates ranging from the arid regions of Western Australia to the temperate environments of the south-western part of the continent. Species of Lechenaultia are known for their aesthetic appeal due to their striking flowers, which come in various colors like blue, orange, yellow, and red. Some popular species in the genus include Lechenaultia biloba (blue leschenaultia), Lechenaultia tubiflora (orange leschenaultia), and Lechenaultia linarioides (yellow leschenaultia). Corokia, on the other hand, is a genus of flowering plants that belong to the Argophyllaceae family. Comprising of approximately 60 species of evergreen shrubs, Corokia is native to New Zealand. Species within this genus are easily identified by their distinctive zigzagging branches, small leaves, and star-shaped flowers (usually yellow or white), followed by clusters of bright, ornamental berries. Corokia species are commonly found in coastal and montane forests, shrublands, and along riverbeds in various parts of New Zealand. Some well-known species include Corokia cotoneaster (wire netting bush), Corokia buddleioides (kohuhu), and Corokia × virgata (wire corokia).

Perfume intolerance or perfume allergy is a condition wherein people exhibit sensitivity or allergic reactions to ingredients in some perfumes and some other fragrances. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: is it possible to be allergic to perfume?","output":"Yes, it is possible to be allergic to perfume. Perfume intolerance, also known as perfume allergy, is a condition wherein individuals exhibit sensitivity or allergic reactions to certain ingredients present in some perfumes and other fragrances. This condition can affect people of any age, gender, and ethnicity and can manifest as a wide range of symptoms. Perfumes and fragrances are often complex mixtures of various synthetic and natural substances, which serve to create the desired scent. Some of these substances may cause sensitivity or allergy in certain people. The most common culprits for perfume allergy are substances such as alcohol, preservatives, dyes, and synthetic and natural fragrances, including essential oils. When someone with a perfume intolerance or allergy is exposed to a fragrance that contains an allergenic substance, their immune system may recognize it as a foreign substance and mount an immune response, causing an allergic reaction. This reaction can result in symptoms ranging from mild to severe, which can include: 1. Skin irritation: Redness, itching, and swelling of the skin upon contact with the perfume or fragrance. In some cases, this can lead to contact dermatitis, a condition characterized by chronic skin inflammation. 2. Respiratory symptoms: Inhalation of the perfume or fragrance may cause sneezing, nasal congestion, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. This could be particularly troublesome for people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. 3. Eye irritation: Exposure to the allergenic substances in a perfume may cause redness, itching, and teary eyes. 4. Headaches: Some individuals who are sensitive to perfume may experience headaches or migraines upon exposure to certain fragrances. 5. Other symptoms: Perfume allergy can also provoke hives (urticaria), exacerbation of eczema, as well as exacerbation of pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma. To manage perfume intolerance or allergy, it is important for affected individuals to identify and avoid the fragrances that trigger their symptoms. They should be cautious when using or purchasing personal care products, scented candles, air fresheners, and laundry detergents. Additionally, they can seek the advice of a medical professional, such as an allergist or dermatologist, to determine the specific allergenic substances and receive appropriate treatment for their symptoms. In some cases, a patch test may be conducted to pinpoint the specific allergens causing the reaction. In conclusion, it is indeed possible to be allergic to perfume. Perfume intolerance or perfume allergy represents a sensitivity or allergic reaction to certain ingredients found in perfumes and other fragrances. Identifying and avoiding the specific allergens, as well as seeking medical guidance, can help manage the symptoms and minimize discomfort for the individuals affected by this condition."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot. If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Can the film be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems? Title: Werckmeister Harmonies Movie plot: The film can be seen as an allegory of post-World War II Eastern European political systems - told as a black-and-white cinematic poem with 39 long, single-camera takes. It examines the brutalization of a society, its political systems and ethics through the metaphor of a decaying circus whale and its star performer. It is set in a desolate, isolated small town in Hungary during Soviet times. The film starts with JÃ¡nos Valuska, a simple person, conducting a poem and dance with drunken bar patrons. The dance is of the total eclipse of the sun, which disturbs, then silences the animals. It finishes with the grand return of the warm sunlight. One of the significant reoccurring characters in this plot is the subtle transitions between light and darkness. The first appearance of this motif is a lamp in the bar, moving to a door into the darkness. The circus arrives like a Trojan Horse in the darkness of night. A window is opened as a glimmer of hope and dressed to shut out the world. The antagonist is only ever seen as a shadow. JÃ¡nos' uncle GyÃ¶rgy is a composer, and therefore one of the intelligentsia. GyÃ¶rgy observes the imperfection and compromise of the musical scale (as defined by Andreas Werckmeister a historical theorist). GyÃ¶rgy proposes changes to the scale to make it more harmonious. This utopian approach to music represents a flawed, naive idealism that never can be achieved; it is not developed any further in the film or the book.

Write a summary based on this article: The Trump administration is moving toward handing back to Russia two diplomatic compounds, near New York City and on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, that its officials were ejected from in late December as punishment for Moscow’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.      President Barack Obama said Dec. 29 that the compounds were being “used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes” and gave Russia 24 hours to vacate them. Separately, Obama expelled from the United States what he said were 35 Russian “intelligence operatives.”      [The luxurious, 45-acre compound in Maryland being shut down for alleged Russian espionage]      In early May, the Trump administration told the Russians that it would consider turning the properties back over to them if Moscow would lift its freeze, imposed in 2014 in retaliation for U.S. sanctions related to Ukraine, on construction of a new U.S. consulate on a certain parcel of land in St. Petersburg.      Two days later, the U.S. position changed. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a meeting in Washington that the United States had dropped any linkage between the compounds and the consulate, according to several people with knowledge of the exchanges.      1 of 21 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Russian compounds in Maryland and New York shut down View Photos Two luxury retreats, in Centreville, Md., and Oyster Bay, N.Y., where Russian diplomats have gone for decades to play tennis, sail and swim, were shut down by the Obama administration in retaliation for Moscow’s alleged hacking in the presidential election.

[Inside the Oval Office with Trump and the Russians: Broad smiles and loose lips]      In Moscow on Wednesday, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said Russia was “taking into account the difficult internal political situation for the current administration” but retained the option to reciprocate for what he called the “expropriation” of Russian property “if these steps are not somehow adjusted by the U.S. side,” the news outlet Sputnik reported.      Senior Tillerson adviser R.C. Hammond said that “the U.S. and Russia have reached no agreements.” He said the next senior- level meeting between the two governments, below the secretary of state level, will be in June in St. Petersburg.      Before making a final decision on allowing the Russians to reoccupy the compounds, the administration is examining possible restrictions on Russian activities there, including removing the diplomatic immunity the properties previously enjoyed. Without immunity, the facilities would be treated as any other buildings in the United States and would not be barred to entry by U.S. law enforcement, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters.      Any concessions to Moscow could prove controversial while administration and former Trump campaign officials are under congressional and special counsel investigation for alleged ties to Russia.      [Comey may testify before Senate as early as next week on Trump interactions]      Changes in the administration’s official posture toward the compounds come as Russian media recently suggested that Kislyak, about to leave Washington after serving as ambassador since 2008, may be proposed by the Kremlin to head a new position as U.N. undersecretary general for counterterrorism.      (WUSA 9)      Kislyak, who met and spoke during the campaign and transition with President Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn; Trump’s White House adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner; Attorney General Jeff Sessions; and others, is known to be interested in the post. His replacement as ambassador, Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Antonov, was confirmed last month by the Russian Duma, or parliament. Officials in Moscow said Russian President Vladi­mir Putin will officially inform Trump of the new ambassador when the two meet in July, at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. It will be Trump’s first meeting with Putin as president.      The U.N. General Assembly must first approve establishment of the counterterrorism slot, part of a larger U.N. reorganization and the first new post at that level for decades.      Russia will almost certainly claim the slot as the only member of the five permanent members of the Security Council without one of its nationals in a senior U.N. position. Jeffrey Feltman, a former senior U.S. diplomat, is undersecretary-general for political affairs; comparable jobs for peacekeeping, humanitarian affairs and economic affairs are held, respectively, by nationals from France, Britain and China.      Secretary General António Guterres will decide who fills the new job, although both Russia and the United States are expected to make their views known.      Kislyak has repeatedly rejected descriptions of him in the U.S. media as a spy. Asked whether U.S. intelligence considered him to be one, James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, told CNN on Sunday that “given the fact that he oversees a very aggressive intelligence operation in this country — the Russians have more intelligence operatives than any other nation that is represented in this country, still even after we got rid of 35 of them — and so to suggest that he is somehow separate or oblivious to that is a bit much.”      [Russian ambassador told Moscow that Kushner wanted secret communications channel with Kremlin]      The Russian compounds — a 14-acre estate on Long Island and several buildings on secluded acreage along the Corsica River on Maryland’s Eastern Shore — have been in Russian possession since the days of the Soviet Union. According to a Maryland deed in 1995, the former USSR transferred ownership of the Maryland property to the Russian Federation in 1995 for a payment of one dollar.      Russia said it used the facilities, both of which had diplomatic immunity, for rest and recreation for embassy and U.N. employees and to hold official events. But U.S. officials dating to the Reagan administration, based on aerial and other surveillance, had long believed they were also being used for intelligence purposes.      Last year, when Russian security services began harassing U.S. officials in Moscow — including slashed tires, home break-ins, and, at one point, tackling and throwing to the ground a U.S. embassy official entering through the front of the embassy — the Obama administration threatened to close the compounds, former Obama officials said.      In meetings to protest the treatment, the Obama administration said that it would do so unless the harassment stopped, and Moscow dropped its freeze on construction of a new consulate to replace the one in St. Petersburg, considered largely unusable because of Russian spying equipment installed there. Russia had earlier blocked U.S. use of a parcel of land and construction guarantees in the city when sanctions were imposed after its military intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.      The threat of closing the compounds was not pursued. In late December, after U.S. intelligence said there had been election meddling, and in response to the ongoing harassment in Moscow, Obama ordered the compounds closed and diplomats expelled. “We had no intention of ever giving them back,” a former senior Obama official said of the compounds.      Trump, then at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, appeared to disparage the Obama administration sanctions, telling reporters, “I think we ought to get on with our lives.”      Surprisingly, Russia did not respond. It later emerged that Flynn, in a phone conversation with Kislyak, had advised against retaliation and indicated that U.S. policy would change under the Trump administration.      [Putin says he won’t deport U.S. diplomats]      The Kremlin made clear that the compound issue was at the top of its bilateral agenda. Russia repeatedly denounced what it called the “seizure” of the properties as an illegal violation of diplomatic treaties.      On May 8, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, Thomas Shannon, traveled to New York to meet with his Russian counterpart, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on what the State Department described as “a range of bilateral issues” and what Russia called “irritants” and “grievances.”      Ryabkov brought up the compounds, while Shannon raised St. Petersburg and harassment, suggesting that they deal with the operation of their diplomats and facilities in each others’ countries separate from policy issues such as Syria and proposing that they clear the decks with a compromise.      Russia refused, saying that the compound issue was a hostile act that deserved no reciprocal action to resolve and had to be dealt with before other diplomatic problems could be addressed. In an interview with Tass, Ryabkov said Moscow was alarmed that Washington “carries on working out certain issues in its traditional manner, particularly concerning Russia’s diplomatic property in the states of Maryland and New York.”      Two days later in Washington, Tillerson told Lavrov that the United States would no longer link the compounds to the issue of St. Petersburg.      Immediately after their May 10 meeting at the State Department, Tillerson escorted Lavrov and Kislyak to the Oval Office. There, they held a private meeting with Trump. The night before, the president had fired FBI Director James B. Comey, who was then heading an FBI investigation of the Russia ties.      Comey, Trump told the Russians, was a “real nut job,” and his removal had “taken off” the ­Russia-related pressure the president was under, the New York Times reported. Later in May, the Justice Department appointed former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to oversee the federal investigation.      In a news conference at the Russian Embassy after his meetings with Tillerson and Trump, Lavrov said of the compound closures, “Everyone, in particular the Trump administration, is aware that those actions were illegal.”      “The dialogue between Russia and the U.S. is now free from the ideology that characterized it under the Barack Obama administration,” he said.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Deforestation rate remains alarming An average of 7.3 million hectares of forest, an area about the size of Sierra Leone or Panama, was destroyed annually in the last five years, theÂ Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO)Â said on Monday. The lossÂ between 1990 and 2000 wasÂ 8.9 million hectares a year. Deforestation was most extensive in South America, where an average of 4.3 million hectares wasÂ lost annually over the last five years, followed by Africa with 4 million hectares, the Rome-based agency said whileÂ presenting The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005 (FRA 2005). North America and Oceania saw smaller forest losses over the same period, while forest areas in Asia and Europe grew, the FAO said. \\"While good progress is being made in many places, unfortunately forest resources are still being lost or degraded at an alarmingly high rate,\\" said Hosny El-Lakany, the agency's assistant director-general for forestry. Forests now cover nearlyÂ four billion hectares or 30% of the world's land area. HoweverÂ 10 countries account for two-thirds of all forest area: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Peru, the Russian Federation and the US. Forests help offset increasingindustrial carbon emissionsOceania lostÂ 356,000 hectares a year betweenÂ 2000-2005, while North and Central America together lostÂ 333,000 hectares a year during the period. Forests help offset increasingindustrial carbon emissions Asia moved from a net loss of around 800,000 hectaresÂ a year in the 1990s to a net gain of one million hectares per year between 2000 and 2005, primarily as a result of large-scale afforestation reported by China. Forest areas in Europe continued to expand, although at a slower rate than in the 1990s. Primary forestsÂ with no visible signs of past or present human activitiesÂ account for 36% of total forest area, but are being lost or modified at a rate ofÂ six million hectares a year through deforestation or selective logging. FRA 2005 also found that new forests and trees are being planted at increasing rates, but plantations still account for less than 5% of forest area, it notes. Major methodological flaws in the UN's report according to the Rainforest Foundation:- the UN figure for 'net' deforestation is grossly misleading, as it conceals the fact that most deforestation is taking place in the world's tropical rainforests, whereas most of the reforestation and natural re-growth of forests is taking place in the northern hemisphere, and much of this consists of plantations rather than forests; - the UN figure is based on a definition of forest as being an area with as little as 10% actual tree cover, which would therefore include areas that are actually savannah-like ecosystems and badly damaged forests; - areas of land that presently have no trees on them at all, but that are 'expected' to regenerate, are also counted as forests; - the UN includes in its data for existing areas of forest those that are covered by industrial tree plantations, which are actually lacking some of the key functions of true forests.However, the UK-based Rainforest Foundation said the FRA 2005 figures are misleading, inaccurate and understate the real extent of deforestation and damage to forests globally.

He said the new Forest Resources Assessment repeats the bad science of previous assessments, which have been widely criticised, and obscures the real extent of deforestation. Forests have multiple functions, including conservation of biological diversity, soil and water, supplying wood and non-wood products, providing recreation opportunities and serving as carbon sinks. While most forests are managed for multiple uses, FRA 2005 found that 11% are designated principally for the conservation of biological diversity - and such areas have increased by an estimated 96 million hectares since 1990. Around 348 million hectares of forests are used to conserve soil and water, control avalanches and desertification, stabilise sand dunes and protect coastal areas. Around 348 million hectares of forests are used to conserve soil and water, control avalanches and desertification, stabilise sand dunes and protect coastal areas. One-third of the world's forests are mainly used for production of wood, fibre and non-wood products, and more than half have production of these products as one of their management objectives. Forests are particularly important as carbon sinks: the amount of carbon stored in forest biomass alone is about 283 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, though it decreased globally by 1.1 Gt annually between 1990 and 2005. Carbon stored in forest biomass, deadwood, litter and soil together is roughly 50% more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Fred Rooney is a lawyer who embodies the qualities of a good-hearted, hardworking individual driven by social justice. Even as a lanky young man, he had a trace of childish innocence in his face, which made others find him trustworthy - much like the lovable character of Jimmy Stewart. Indeed, Fred Rooney is a bit of a modern-day folk hero, through the law practice that he has established in the south Bethlehem region. In his law practice, Rooney caters to working-class families, who are primarily Latino and often do not have the financial means to afford top-of-the-line legal representation. This is in stark contrast to his own upbringing, as the son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York and a member of an affluent Long Island family. Interestingly, it was during his undergraduate studies at Moravian College that he experienced the seeds of social justice which would later define his entire legal career. Rooney's dedication to helping those who cannot afford legal representation took him to the City University of New York Law School in Queens. It is here that he contributes to their innovative Community Legal Resources Network by guiding budding lawyers to establish their own storefront practices that cater to underprivileged communities. His humble and Midwestern-like demeanor, as observed by the dean of the law school, Kristin Booth Glen, captivates and inspires loyalty from others, making him the perfect candidate to head the network. Fred Rooney's commitment to social causes goes beyond the legal realm as he also focuses on finding medical care for children in Latin America who are suffering from serious illnesses. It is because of these selfless acts, along with his passion for bringing legal representation to the poor, that Moravian College alumni have chosen Rooney for the distinguished Haupert Humanitarian Award. While politics also run in the Rooney family, Fred's journey was completely different from his brother's and uncle's, choosing instead to devote his career to social justice after being deeply impacted by the suffering he had seen during a trip to Colombia during his time at Moravian College. Upon his graduation from CUNY Law School in 1986, Rooney's first job was at Lehigh Valley Legal Services. In conclusion, Fred Rooney is a passionate and inspiring lawyer who has dedicated his career to ensuring that those who cannot afford legal representation receive the help they need. His work not only in establishing his own law practice but also in guiding and mentoring aspiring lawyers to do the same underlines a commitment to social justice and compassion for the less fortunate. As a result, he is not only a legal luminary but also an inspiring example of humanitarianism in action."},{"instruction":"In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_).

This might involve helping them understand their new responsibilities, navigate political nuances, and build beneficial alliances. 2. Observing the Consequences: Lee may wish to observe the results of their actions, especially if the decision was a difficult one like appointing a new ruler. This might include watching how people react to the new king or queen, and how the kingdom changes under their rule. 3. Stepping Back: If Lee held significant power before (enough to give the throne), they might be looking to step back from the responsibilities and duties. Passing the throne might be a sign of retirement, suggesting that Lee wants to live in relative peace and obscurity. 4. Maintaining Influence: If Lee bestowed the throne, it's possible they wish to maintain influence behind the scenes.

Chief to Step Down, Citing Return to Private Life The veterans’ agency drew embarrassing publicity last year under Mr. Nicholson when thieves took a laptop computer from the home of an employee that held personal data including the names, birth dates and Social Security numbers of millions of Navy and National Guard veterans discharged since 1975. The Federal Bureau of Investigation later determined that the information had not been compromised. Mr. Nicholson said Tuesday that the uproar over the theft resulted in a reorganization, and that this “has really changed the way we do business in this huge agency,” adding, “I feel very good about it.” Bob Wallace, executive director of Veterans of Foreign Wars, described Mr. Nicholson’s time on the job as “kind of rough.” “He came to the job with no real experience about what Veterans Affairs was about,” Mr. Wallace said. “I thought that was very positive because I thought that would mean he would ask a lot of questions and delve into things.” But Mr. Wallace said Mr. Nicholson’s unfamiliarity with how the department worked “overcame” him, adding that he “was gradually getting there” by the end of his tenure. Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, said Tuesday that he had to work with Mr. Nicholson “during some challenging times, including an underfunded V.A. during his early tenure in office” but that the secretary was “willing to work with the committee and the Congress on behalf of our nation’s veterans.” Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, the ranking Republican on that committee, said Mr. Nicholson “leaves behind a proud record of accomplishment for the nation’s 24.5 million veterans.” He said that Mr. Nicholson had also sought to improve care for veterans with brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, had hired more outreach coordinators to ensure returning veterans get necessary treatments and had approved more than 80 new community clinics around the country. Bobby Muller, the president of Veterans for America, said his organization welcomed Mr. Nicholson’s resignation and called him a product of “political patronage.” Every year Mr. Nicholson has been secretary, Mr. Muller said, the department has had to request emergency supplemental financing from Congress to handle its wartime caseload. The department, with a staff of 235,000, operates 155 medical centers and more than 1,400 treatment centers, and in 2006 provided health care to almost 5.5 million people.

As Linda rummaged through her pantry, she suddenly realized that her trusty, old mixer – a gift from her grandmother – had vanished. It was incredibly special to her, and its sentimental value was unmatched. She frantically searched the entire house, tearing apart cabinets and closets, but the mixer was nowhere to be found.

When archaeologists unearthed the well-preserved tomb of a second-century Roman general that had lain under muddy clay for 1800 years, their find was hailed as the most important ancient Roman monument to come to light for decades. The burial place of Marcus Nonius Macrinus, the general who advised Emperor Marcus Aurelius and fought Germanic tribes in the second century, was found at Saxa Rubra, north of Rome, in 2008, and boasted marble pillars and Latin inscriptions. But despite the joy of historians who pored over the important ancient mausoleum, Italian authorities say it may now have to be reburied as they cannot afford the preservation works necessary to keep it open. Beautifully preserved: The tomb of Marcus Nonius Macrinus lay under thick clay for nearly 2000 years before being excavated in 2008. Austerity measures mean cash for maintaining Italy's archaeological sites has been cut by 20 per cent since 2010, which means that unless a sponsor comes forward soon with the €2-3m (£1.6m-£2.4m) needed to preserve the ancient tomb, it will have to be be covered up. 'It is a painful choice but we cannot risk losing the monument,' Mariarosaria Barbera, Rome's archaeological superintendent, told the daily La Repubblica. 'The marbles can't face another winter [so] we must bury the site in order to preserve it.' Unlike Russell Crowe's character Maximus Decidus Meridius, Macrinus died a rich man after a long and successful career, and his extravagant tomb bears testament to that. With marble roof tiles, a panel carved with Latin script detailing his military career, which included a visit to Spain, and perfectly preserved carvings and friezes, the monument has lain under the thick clay of the nearby river Tiber, which has helped it stay in such good condition. Since it has been opened up, however, cracks have appeared in the stonework and the delicate letterwork has been discoloured by air pollution. 'The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor': Russell Crowe in the 2000 film, Gladiator. Darius Arya, an American. archaeologist who is campaigning to keep the monument open, said: 'This. is an extraordinary site, it blows you away. 'Burying these remains is a disaster - you wonder what is the point of archaeology.' Maria Grazia Vernuccio, of the heritage group Italia Nostra, told The Observer that cuts were threatening the condition of many historical sites including Pompeii and Villa Jovis, Emperor Tiberius' palace on Capri. She said: 'Over 40 per cent of Italy's archaeological sites are now closed due to lack of funds.  Inspectors often cannot even get to the more remote sites in their cars because the ministry won't give them petrol and there is less money for guards to keep looters out.' Macrinus' tomb, which lies close to the ancient Via Flaminia which linked Rome to the Adriatic sea on the east coast, was attacked by looters shortly after it was uncovered in 2008.  However the thieves were unable to carry the heavy piece of marble they wanted, and had to dump it nearby. As winter approaches, the filling-in work may begin any day soon. Daniela Rossi, the archaeologist who led the dig, said: 'There are more mausoleums waiting to be revealed along this stretch of the Via Flaminia.  It's a gold mine we may never get to see.' Marcus Nonius Macrinus was born in Brescia, northern Italy. Born to a distinguished local family, Macrinus became a senator at around 25 and a consul 16 years later in around 154AD. Macrinus was a general and consul who led campaigns for Marcus Aurelius from 161AD to 180AD. He fought numerous battles against adversaries including the Germanic Quadi and Marcomanni tribes who invaded Italy. He became one of the Emperor's favourites and part of his inner circle, serving as proconsul in Asia.

The Italian authorities don't have enough money to protect it, so they might have to cover it up again to keep it safe. The tomb is very important because it helps us learn about Roman history.

Therefore, they cannot be directly compared, and the premise does not provide any information that allows us to determine whether the hypothesis is true or not. The premise describes a scene where five soccer players are tending the field next to the goal net.

The main subjects here are the soccer players and the activities they are performing. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that two people are swimming in a lake. This scenario takes place in a completely different setting, which is a lake, and involves an unrelated activity, swimming. The main subjects in the hypothesis are the two swimmers and their actions. Since the premise is focused on the soccer players and their actions, it does not offer any information about the presence, actions, or location of the two swimmers mentioned in the hypothesis. Consequently, we cannot determine whether the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided. To establish the truth of the hypothesis, new information related specifically to the swimming scenario would be required.

They tour a luxurious, four-story brownstone and are shown, among other things, the master bedroom which houses an interesting commodity: a panic room. Lydia Lynch (Ann Magnuson), the realtor, explains that the previous owner was a reclusive millionaire who built the hidden panic room as a safeguard against intruders. It's protected with four-inch walls and an impressive security system built in complete with a separate phone line and security cameras situated throughout the townhouse. However, despite Sarah's intrigue, Meg is apprehensive about the room. Still, pressured by the tight market and assured that the home will quickly close, Meg decides to move in right away. After some light unpacking and a pizza dinner, they settle in for the night. Meg checks her daughter's watch, designed to track her blood sugar and keep her type 1 diabetes in check, before retreating to her room to bathe and down a bottle of red wine, clearly distraught over the move and her recent divorce. She attempts to wire the phone system in the panic room but gives up and goes to bed as rain falls outside.Later that night, three men break into the house. Junior (Jared Leto), the grandson of the previous owner and Burnham (Forest Whitaker), an employee of the security system with which the panic room was fitted, intend to steal the 3 million in bearer bonds stored in a floor safe inside the panic room. Burnham is distressed to see, however, that Junior has recruited a buddy of his named Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) to assist in the heist. Burnham argues over Raoul's presence, saying that he knows nothing about him and the plan was for just two of them to quietly go in, get the money, and get out.

Even on Mindanao, where tens of thousands have been killed over five decades of armed conflict, the week-long battle for Marawi stands out as a fiasco. The army, though, now believes it unwittingly interrupted a plan by the Maute group to take over the city and sack it. Soldiers were following a tip-off that Isnilon Hapilon, leader of the notorious Abu Sayyaf Group and the most wanted insurgent leader in the Philippines, was in Marawi. They had gone in to try to capture him, and were surprised by the number of Maute group fighters inside the city. The result was a week of fierce clashes, air strikes, summary executions and tens of thousands of displaced people. So who are the Maute group? And why are they important on an island which is home to dozens of well-armed groups? A tradition of armed resistance to central government authority goes back centuries in Mindanao. The Spanish colonial administration barely maintained a presence on the island, and the US administration which replaced Spain fought brutal battles with the Moros, as the various Muslim clans of Mindanao are generally called. In the late 1960s the Moros rose up again against the government - after years of settlement by Christians from other parts of the Philippines had left Muslims a minority on Mindanao - under a new nationalist movement, the MNLF. That armed struggle, costing tens of thousands of lives, has continued more or less to the present day, with occasional breakthroughs - like the 1996 peace agreement with the MNLF leader Nur Misuari, and the more recent Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro in 2014 with the MILF, once a breakaway group from the MNLF and now the largest armed organisation on the island. That deal is stalled, but is supposed to create an autonomous Moro state on Mindanao. President Rodrigo Duterte has promised to make peace on the island a priority, but his view of the 2014 deal is not clear as he talks about broader federalism for the Philippines. All those years of conflict have created a warrior culture among young men, and flooded Mindanao with weapons. Private armies and militias wield more power than the official security forces in many areas. They have also created fertile ground for radical Islam. Best known of the radical groups is Abu Sayyaf, founded in 1991 and named after a mujahideen commander in Afghanistan. It was linked to al-Qaeda through support given by Osama bin Laden's brother-in-law. It used to operate only in the far south-west, on the islands of Sulu and Basilan, and became known for a series of kidnappings of foreigners for ransom and for beheading their captives. US forces were deployed to the area in 2002 to help the Philippines military deal with Abu Sayyaf. Despite the deaths of many fighters and commanders, the group continues to fight, though it has now broken into rival factions over the decision in 2014 by Isnilon Hapilon to swear allegiance to so-called Islamic State (IS), and to declare himself the \\"amir\\" of a South East Asian caliphate. Who are the Abu Sayyaf group? But when Hapilon moved to Lanao del Sur, on the main island of Mindanao, apparently after being badly injured in a firefight at the end of last year, a new and potentially dangerous alliance emerged, bringing Abu Sayyaf together with three other small, hardline insurgent forces, who reject peace talks with the government and advocate a Salafi form of Islamic rule. The Maute group is one of them, and, say experts who monitor Islamic groups in the region, the most potent. It was founded five or six years ago by Omar and Abdullah Maute, natives of Lanao del Sur and members of the Maranao clan. They both studied in the Middle East: Omar at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, and Abdullah in Jordan. They both speak Arabic, unlike Isnilon Hapilon, and are well-versed in Salafi and jihadist ideology. They are believed to have many connections with IS supporters in the Middle East. The Maute brothers also have strong family ties to some of the top MILF leaders, which, until recently, gave them access to the resources and training areas of the mainstream insurgent group. They are believed to have formed a close relationship with a well-known Indonesian radical, Sanusi, who was killed by police at the Mindanao State University in Marawi in 2012. The Mautes probably started carrying out terrorist attacks in Mindanao in 2013. But they first grabbed national attention in the Philippines when they raided the prison in Marawi in August last year, freeing 23 inmates. They were then blamed by the authorities for a bomb attack in Davao, President Duterte's hometown, in September, which killed 14 people. They took over the town of Butig late last year, and again in January this year, and despite heavy losses, have continued to clash with the troops sent in to deal with them. Their apparent plan to take over Marawi, coinciding with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, would have been a huge propaganda coup; their tenacious resistance to the army in Marawi may also now be used to attract more recruits. Perhaps more significantly, they have a number of foreign militants fighting with them, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. They are believed to have received training from a skilled Malaysian bomb-maker called Zulkifli \\"Marwan\\" Abdhir, who was killed by the police in 2015. Another Malaysian radical, Dr Mahmud Ahmad, is still thought to be with them. Sidney Jones, who runs the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta and is perhaps the best-informed expert on Islamic extremists in South East Asia, believes the Maute group now has overseas sources of funding, probably from Indonesia, she says, but possibly Syria. The Mautes, she says, are the brains behind the attempt to establish an alliance loyal to IS in Mindanao, not the self-styled \\"amir\\" Isnilon Hapilon, for whose capture the US is offering a 5m (Â£3.9m) reward. She believes the Philippines government has underestimated the strength of the Mautes, and their capacity to act as a crucible for terrorist actions across the region. Ms Jones says that today Indonesian militants are able to travel freely to the Philippines, on scheduled flights, to buy weapons in Mindanao. Her fear is that as IS is forced to retreat further in Syria and Iraq, the hundreds of Indonesian and Malaysian militants fighting there will come home, and be looking for new opportunities to wage jihad. The Maute group and its new alliance will offer an ideal partnership for them. \\"President Duterte's declaration of martial law is just a band-aid,\\" Ms Jones says. \\"The government has turned a blind eye to how these groups have united; it keeps downplaying the threat they pose. But these four groups together now have a geographic reach pro-IS groups in the Philippines have never had before.\\" It is worth remembering that the last time South East Asia faced a sustained terrorist threat, it also germinated in Mindanao. Jemaah Islamiyah, the group that carried out the devastating Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, most of them tourists, originated in Indonesia and Malaysia in the 1980s. But it learned its lethal bomb-craft from veterans of the Afghan war, mostly in training camps inside MILF-controlled areas. Today the MILF is more wary of hardline militants within its ranks as it pursues a still elusive final autonomy settlement with the government. The Mautes have been expelled from MILF areas in the past, and get little co-operation today. But while poverty and violence still afflict the southern Philippines, the radical groups will appeal to many young Muslims, and pose a significant threat to the mainstream MILF leadership, to other parts of the country vulnerable to terrorist bombings, and even to the wider region.

With the Raiders tied with both the Chargers and Chiefs atop the AFC West, the Raiders traveled to Kansas City with only four games left in the season. Looking to give themselves the tiebreaker with the Chiefs and stay above .500 on the season, the Raiders failed miserably. The defense allowed a field goal on the Chiefs' first possession to fall behind 3-0. The Chiefs extended the lead on the first play of the second quarter as Kareem Hunt scored from one yard out. Trailing 10-0, the Raider offense was only able to get one first down on their first three possessions. The Chiefs, scoring on their third straight possession, got another field goal to move their lead to 13-0. The Raiders began to move the ball on their ensuing possession, moving into Chiefs territory. However, Derek Carr was intercepted at the Chief 24 to end the drive. The Chiefs added another field goal on the ensuing possession, moving the lead to 16-0 with 1:45 remaining in the half. The Raiders quickly went three and out, giving the Chiefs, who had scored on their first four possessions, the ball with 1:14 remaining. The defense was able to keep the Chiefs from scoring as the half ended. The Chiefs began the second half with another field goal to take a 19-0 lead. A Raider three and out preceded the first punt of the game by the Chiefs. Looking to take advantage of the defense's first real stop of the game, Carr hit Johnny Holton on a 19-yard pass on the first play of the drive, but Holton fumbled and the Chiefs recovered. The Chiefs immediately turned the ball back over as Alex Smith was intercepted on the first play of the ensuing drive. However, the Raiders failed to convert on the turnover and punted to the Chiefs again. Four plays later Charcandrick West scored on a 13-yard run to extend the Chief lead to 26-0 and all but ending the game. After the teams exchanged punts, the Raiders finally scored with just under nine minutes left in the fourth quarter as Marshawn Lynch rushed 22 yards for a touchdown. Following a successful two-point conversion, the Raiders recovered an onside kick and Carr hit Jared Cook on a 29-yard pass to narrow the lead to 26-15. Electing not to attempt another onside kick, the Chiefs took over and were able to run nearly five minutes off the clock before punting to the Raiders with 2:39 remaining. The Raiders were able to move the ball, but Carr was intercepted in the end zone with 46 seconds left and the Chiefs were able to run out the clock. The 26-15 loss moved the Raiders to 6-7 on the season. The Raiders again struggled as the defense gave up 408 yards while the offense managed only 268, most of which occurred after the game had been decided. The Chiefs out-rushed the Raiders 165-70 in the game as the Raiders fell to a game out of first in the AFC West. A Chargers victory on the day also meant the Raiders fell a game behind them as well.

Information:  - The Pacific Northwest (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into far northern California and east to the Continental Divide, thus including Idaho, Western Montana, and western Wyoming. Narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern US or to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains. The variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the region's history, geography, society, and other factors.  - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River.  - Portland is a seaport and the largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the seat of Multnomah County. It is in the Willamette Valley region of the Pacific Northwest, at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers. The city covers and had an estimated population of 632,309 in 2015, making it the 26th most populous city in the United States. Approximately 2,389,228 people live in the Portland metropolitan statistical area (MSA), the 23rd most populous MSA in the United States. Its Combined Statistical Area (CSA) ranks 17th with a population of 3,022,178. Roughly 60% of Oregon's population resides within the Portland metropolitan area.  - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area.  - Carson Friedman Ellis ( born October 5 , 1975 ) is an artist living in Portland , Oregon . She is best known for her children 's book illustrations and her album art.  - The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province.  - The Portland metropolitan area or Greater Portland is a metropolitan area in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington centered on the principal city of Portland, Oregon. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget identifies it as the PortlandVancouverHillsboro, ORWA Metropolitan Statistical Area, a metropolitan statistical area used by the United States Census Bureau and other entities. The OMB defines the area as comprising Clackamas, Columbia, Multnomah, Washington, and Yamhill Counties in Oregon, and Clark and Skamania Counties in Washington. The area's population is estimated at 2,348,247 in 2014.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.

Choices:  - through germination  - through cell respiration  - through photosynthesis  - through water uptake  A:","output":"A: Most growing plant cells expand through water uptake. For plant cells to grow and eventually expand, they need to undergo a process called cell enlargement, which is primarily driven by water uptake. Each cell in a plant has a central vacuole, a sort of storage within the cell that holds materials and wastes. Additionally, the vacuole is also important for plant growth as it sustains turgor pressure that prevents the plant from wilting. In growing plant cells, this central vacuole expands by taking in water, causing the cell to become larger.  The process starts when water moves from an area of lower solute concentration (outside the cell) to an area of higher solute concentration (inside the cell), a movement facilitated by osmosis. When water enters the plant cell, it fills the central vacuole and induces a pushing pressure against the cell wall. The cell wall, which is flexible yet strong, expands but holds its shape due to its composition of cellulose and other materials. This pressure is then balanced by the rigidity of the cell wall, creating turgidity and causing the plant cell to become rigid and stand upright. Moreover, the growth of plant cells not only relies on the water uptake, but also on the synthesis and rearrangement of the component of the cell wall. During growth, new materials must be inserted into the cell wall to allow it to flex and expand, this process is controlled by enzymes and other proteins that are produced by the plant cell.  As for the other choices, germination is the process by which plants emerge from seeds and begin growth, not how the cells themselves expand. Cell respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments. However, all these processes, while crucial for overall plant development and survival, do not directly cause the expansion of individual plant cells. That role belongs to water uptake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

This latest failed attempt was prompted by attacks on Manjib by coalition forces, which later issued a 48-hour offer to withdraw from the town without violence, Al Jazeera reports.

A major part of keeping your relationship exciting when you’re apart is being able to look forward to when you will see one another again. Plus, having distance between the two of you makes every moment you do get to be together all the more special.  Aim to see one another as much as you can. And, after each visit, you should set a date for when you will meet again. The time apart will be more exciting when you have a date in the future to get excited about. If the distance is too far, try to compromise. One person can visit the other the first time, and then vice versa for the next visit. You can also meet halfway in an interesting city for a mini-vacation. Doing this allows both of you to save on travel costs and times. The two of you can’t meet up on Fridays or Saturdays to see a movie or go to the park, but you can still have date night. Be sure to download a video call application such as Skype or Google Hangouts. These applications allow you to see your date in real-time, so you can pretty much do whatever you’d do on a regular date via a video call. One suggestion might include ordering takeout meals or cooking a meal and then eating at the same time by candlelight. Do whatever you two would normally do on a date night over the call. Distance can make the heart grow fonder, especially when you spice things up every now and then. A great way to keep your LDR smoking hot is to tend to your intimacy needs. You can send flirty pictures of yourself blowing kisses in sexy poses or send a teasing message telling your date how you’ve been thinking about him or her all day. Do what feels comfortable to you and your partner. Imagine how it will brighten your special someone’s day to receive a package in the mail from you. Of course, shipping can be expensive on large items, so be creative and do something that fits your budget.  Examples of nifty gifts can be a handwritten love letter, a funny card, a framed photograph of you, some home-baked cookies, or a new CD. Consider what your date really likes and send a little something that says “I’m thinking of you.” It may even be a sign of a commitment if each of you gifts a personal item for the other to keep for a time. This might include a special shirt or an inexpensive piece of jewelry. Keeping the spark alive can also extend to your online profiles. Even if the two of you aren't together everyday, it can make things even more exciting to demonstrate your commitment to the world. You can set your statuses as \\"in a relationship\\" or share cute picture of your partner on your Facebook or Instagram pages.

After wanting to check out this place for a while, a friend and I decided to check it out during PGH Restaurant week - we were not disappointed.  After being seated, we checked out the menu - my friend ordered the restaurant week special (brussels sprout appetizer, trout, desert) and I opted for the duck testicles and cassoulet (pork belly, chicken hearts, oxtail). The brussels sprouts and duck testicles arrived - the duck was good - nice flavor and something I would consider ordering again even though it is a little out there - but the brussels sprouts were from another planet. I don't know exactly what they did, but it almost seemed like they had a general tso's flavor to them - I would recommend them to anyone.   Mains arrived right after we were finished with appetizers - perfectly timed - the cassoulet was great - balanced flavors and the pork belly in it just fell apart. The trout was light, flavorful - I would consider ordering both again.   We tried the flour-less chocolate cake with the beet ice-cream for desert - the chocolate was rich, but not overly sweet and the beet ice-cream was good.  The service was great the entire time - attentive but not too much.

The war ended in 1996, with a Chechen separatist victory establishing a de facto independent Chechnya. Barayev formed the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, where he and his associates became infamous for their alleged part in a wave of lawlessness which swept the devastated country. Crimes include including brutal killings and kidnappings as well as suspected involvement in two failed attempts to assassinate the Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov, and the successful assassinations of the Chechen interior minister Nasrudi Bazhiyev, and Shadid Bargishev, head of the newly formed anti-abduction service. The group, based around the town of Urus-Martan, were linked to a series of high-profile crimes including the notorious murder of six foreign Red Cross employees shot dead in the hospital of Novye Atagi in September 1996, as well as the kidnappings of Yelena Masyuk, a Russian NTV journalist and personal friend of President Maskhadov, and Valenti Vlasov, Russian president Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya. Other high-profile hostages allegedly kidnapped by Barayev included the ORT journalists Roman Pereveztsyev and Vladislav Tibelius, an Italian journalist Mauro Galligani, British children-aid workers Camilla Carr and Jon James (during a failed operation to rescue them, the Chechen anti-kidnap unit commandos engaged in a deadly clash with \\"unknown terrorists\\", unofficially Salman Raduyev's men; they were eventually ransomed by Boris Berezovsky) and others.  In 1997, Maskhadov signed a decree putting Barayev and his Special Purpose Islamic Regiment under the command of the Chechen interior ministry. Barayev, who also held the post of deputy commander of the National Guards, however refused to obey the order. When six of his men were detained in Ingushetia, Barayev attacked an Ingush police post and took hostages; one of them was killed and the rest were prisoner-swapped. Two more of his men were captured in Chechnya and made to confess to kidnappings on the state TV. His militia and some Islamist allies from Shariah Security forces fought with the Chechen government forces in a large-scale gun battle in the city of Gudermes in the summer of 1998. Between 50 and around 80 people were killed in the mutiny. The SPIR was not disarmed, but Barayev was stripped of his rank of Brigade General and declared as the \\"enemy of Ichkeria and the Chechen people\\". In December 1998, Barayev proclaimed the Supreme Council of Islamic Jamaats, dug trenches around Urus-Martan and threatened to attack targets across and outside of Chechnya if Maskhadov tried to fight them.  A commonly accusation against Barayev regarded the late 1998 abduction and beheading of four foreign mobile phone engineers. It was claimed that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) outbid the employers of kidnapped British engineers to get them decapitated by Barayev and his gang rather than be released; supposedly, the video and photographic materials of their executions fed the FSB anti-western propaganda efforts at beginning of Second Chechen War.  A former Russian hostage Abdurakhman Adukhov told the BBC that Barayev told him it was actually Osama bin Laden who paid him 30m for the atrocity, outbidding the ransom offer of 10m.

Rosie said it probably began when she was on a different TV show called \\"The View.\\" One day, she talked about a girl named Tara Conner who was in trouble for drinking and using drugs when she was too young. President Trump decided to forgive her, and Rosie thought that was a bit strange.  So, she looked up some information on the internet about President Trump and found some not-so-nice things about him. She talked about those things on her TV show, and that made President Trump very upset. Then, Rosie and Seth began talking about a big investigation that's going on right now about Russia and President Trump. Seth joked that if Trump gets in trouble, Rosie should be the one to give him the news. Rosie thought that was a fun idea, so she tweeted about it.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Royal Marine corporal  for the following movie plot:  In 1934, Winston Churchill is deep in his wilderness years, and struggling to complete his biography of his ancestor the Duke of Marlborough, which he hopes will revive his fortunes. Winston is chided by his wife Clemmie for their lack of money and is aware that as a 'man of destiny' his moment may have passed. At the same time he struggles in the House of Commons as a backbencher to get a hearing for his concerns about German re-armament under Hitler and the policy of appeasement. Churchill is also disappointed by the behaviour of his son Randolph Churchill (Tom Hiddleston), which leads to further arguments with Clemmie, who announces she is leaving to go on an extended overseas trip. Churchill is devastated and throws himself into his pet activities: painting, and building walls around the family house. Clemmie eventually returns, and the couple are reconciled. During the same period, a young official in the government, Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) has become concerned about the growth of the German Luftwaffe (air force), and is convinced by his wife to leak information about it to Churchill. Shortly afterwards, Churchill uses Wigram's information to launch an attack on the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). In 1936, Wigram commits suicide. With Churchill's fortunes restored, the narrative jumps forward to September 1939, with the declaration of war against Germany at the start of World War II, and the announcement that Churchill will be taking over command of the Royal Navy again as First Lord of the Admiralty. An impatient Churchill bids farewell to the staff at the country house, and travels to London.

Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.  Paragraph: David is experimenting with electromagnetic waves. He has four different waves to study, wave A, wave B, wave C, and wave D. In wave A, distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves is greater than that of wave B. In wave C, the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given time is greater than that of wave D.

Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... Why were a lot of Midlanders out of work?

Step 1: Understanding the properties of Thor's hammer Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, can only be lifted by those who are deemed worthy by the enchantment placed on it by Odin. If someone is unworthy, they cannot lift it. Step 2: Evaluating if an elevator can be worthy An elevator is an inanimate object and does not possess the ability to be worthy or unworthy, as the concept of worthiness applies to beings with consciousness and morality. Step 3: Considering the condition of lifting Mjolnir If the elevator is simply moving between floors and Thor's hammer is placed on the elevator floor, technically it is not \\"lifting\\" the hammer in terms of overcoming the enchantment since it is not attempting to move Mjolnir with the purpose of wielding it.

Ted Cruz of Texas urged voters in Kansas’ 4th District to support Ron Estes in Tuesday’s congressional special election.      Cruz, a 2016 presidential candidate, rallied Monday afternoon with about 200 Estes supporters in a hangar stop near Eisenhower National Airport, the last major campaign event leading up to Tuesday’s election.      He called on members of the crowd to vote and to take nine others with them to the polls.      “Our enemy right now is complacency,” he said.      Our enemy right now is complacency. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at a rally in support of Republican congressional candidate Ron Estes      Estes, the Republican state treasurer, is locked in a hard-fought battle with Democratic civil rights attorney James Thompson for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mike Pompeo. Libertarian Chris Rockhold, a flight instructor, is also in the race.      Cruz said Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election was an “overwhelming cry from the American people to change the path we’re on.”      “That’s the mandate we’ve been given with a Republican president and both houses of Congress,” Cruz said.      He said it’s important to send Estes to Congress to work toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, reforming tax policy and cutting regulation on business.      He called Thompson “another knee-jerk vote for (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi.”      Cruz deflected a question about whether his presence indicated concern at the national Republican Party level about an Estes victory on Tuesday.      “My being here is indicative that I think this race matters,” Cruz said.      GOP boost      Cruz’s visit was part of a full-court press by the national GOP to boost Estes’ campaign in the final days. “On Tuesday, Republican Ron Estes needs your vote and needs it badly,” President Trump told voters in an automated call on Monday, calling Estes “a conservative leader who’s going to work with me to make America great again.”      More Videos 1:12 'Stranger Things' comes to College Hill for Halloween Pause 1:11 Bishop Carroll advances to 5A soccer semifinals 0:39 Denver Broncos' Jamaal Charles and Kansas City Chiefs' Charcandrick West exchange jerseys 4:11 Flying with QuikTrip 2:39 Fighting crime with pipettes and microscopes 3:00 Chiefs' Alex Smith after 29-19 win over the Broncos 1:21 Chiefs linebacker Justin Houston talks about stopping the Broncos offense 1:04 Kansas City Chiefs head to locker room after beating the Denver Broncos 0:31 More Shockers basketball players hawk queso 1:29 Retiree talks about working for Tyson Video Link copy Embed Code copy      Facebook      Twitter      Email      President Trump records robocall urging voters to back Estes Hear President Trump’s robocall urging voters to vote for GOP congressional candidate Ron Estes.

Cruz is a popular national GOP figure among Kansas Republicans, admired for his strong positions on social issues, especially his opposition to abortion.      Last year, he was an easy winner over Trump in the Kansas Republican presidential caucus.      Thompson said he’s not intimidated that Estes brought in Cruz to campaign for him.      He said he thinks it shows the weakness of the Estes campaign.      I love the fact that he can’t fight his own fights. James Thompson, Democratic congressional candidate, on Ron Estes      “I love the fact that he can’t fight his own fights,” Thompson said. “He’s got the vice president making phone calls for him. He’s got the speaker (House Speaker Paul Ryan) who’s sent out a fundraising letter, and now he’s got Senator Cruz coming in, and I’m still here fighting the same fight I’ve been fighting all along.      “I think it’s sad he can’t do debates, he can’t do his own fundraising and he can’t fight his own fight,” Thompson added. “So if he can’t do any of those things, why is he running in the first place?”      Rally reactions      Back at the airport, tax accountant Myron Ackerman, 62, was fairly typical of the crowd. He’s been active in conservative politics and said he once served as a campaign treasurer but never will again.      “I’ve worked with Ron’s wife a lot for Americans for Prosperity,” he said. In November, Susan Estes left that organization, which was founded and funded by Koch Industries executives and advocates for low taxes and light regulation of business.      “If her husband listens to Susan, I know he’s going to hear good things,” said Ackerman, whose biggest concerns are national security and the recent missile attack by the U.S. on Syria.      “I hope it’s a good rally point for the party to get out and vote tomorrow,” added Jonathan Bender, an aircraft maintenance worker for Yingling Aviation, which hosted the event.      He liked what he heard.      “All of them (speakers at the rally) speak to my moral and ethical values. That’s why I align myself with the Republican Party,” he said. “Of course, the right to life, health care reform, gun control, those are all issues that are near and dear to me anyway.”      Cruz drew some of his biggest applause when he pressed for a flat tax and for abolishing the Internal Revenue Service.      In a statement he called “somewhat tongue-in-cheek,” he proposed padlocking the IRS building in Washington and sending its 90,000 employees to the southern border to deter illegal immigrants.      He said if you walked across the desert to the border and found 90,000 IRS agents waiting, “You’d turn around and go home, too.”      The 4th District seat has been open since late January, when Pompeo resigned from Congress to accept a position as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Trump administration.      The election marks the first major electoral test since Trump won the presidential election in November and the first of four congressional elections to fill seats vacated by Trump appointees. ||||| WICHITA — President Donald Trump stepped Monday into an unusually competitive special congressional election in Kansas, recording a get-out-the-vote call on behalf of Republican candidate Ron Estes.      The robocall from Trump came as the contest also pulled U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to Wichita to campaign for Estes and amid a flood of out-of-state GOP money ahead of Tuesday’s election in the 4th Congressional District of southern Kansas. It was the first special congressional election since Trump’s election as president last year.      \\"Republican Ron Estes needs your vote and needs it badly,\\" Trump said in the minute-long call. \\"Our country needs help. Ron is going to be helping us, big league.\\"      The Associated Press obtained a recording of the call from a person close to the campaign who did not want to be identified because it was being released ahead of an official announcement. The person said it was recorded over the weekend.      The Kansas Republican Party later tweeted that Trump’s call was going to \\"tens of thousands\\" of prospective voters.      The vote in Kansas will be the nation’s first congressional election since Trump’s victory, and the contest in the heavily Republican district was watched across the nation for any sign of waning support from the president’s supporters. Trump won with 60 percent of the votes cast in the 17-county congressional district of south-central Kansas.      Trump’s call came after the Estes campaign used a similar call recorded by Vice President Mike Pence, starting Saturday.      His Democratic rival, James Thompson, is spending the final day of campaigning before Tuesday’s election talking directly to voters. Thompson’s campaign says he’s countering the visit by Cruz — who vied with Trump for the Republican presidential candidacy — by knocking on doors, going to diners and doing interviews.      At stake is a House seat Republicans have held for more than two decades. The vacancy was created when Trump chose former U.S. Rep. Mike Pompeo as his CIA director.      A raft of big GOP campaign donations and a last-minute ad buy last week of nearly 100,000 by the National Republican Congressional Committee also signaled GOP anxiety over the seat, flooding the local airways with negative advertising against Thompson, a civil rights attorney. Big out-of-state campaign donations have been flowing in the waning days of the campaign to the Republican’s coffers.      The last-minute national GOP interest comes in a race in which Estes, the state’s treasurer, had been expected to coast easily to victory. After a missed candidate event last week, Thompson’s campaign noted that Estes has failed to show up in 10 candidate forums and debates during the campaign and attended just three others.      \\"James Thompson is countering the Cruz visit by talking with voters — something Ron Estes has refused to do. Ron Estes is not raising his own money, he is not campaigning for himself and he is too afraid to go face voters himself,\\" said Chris Pumpelly, his campaign spokesman.      Thompson’s campaign announced Monday that it hit 20,000 in total donors to its campaign, which has mostly come in as small dollar donations in the past 76 days. The Kansas Democratic Party contributed 3,000 to him, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has not put any money into the race that has now turned unexpectedly competitive in the deep red state.      \\"James Thompson has done all of this on his own,\\" Pumpelly said. \\"He is interested in talking with voters, he is not going to be hiding behind any D.C. politicians like Ron Estes is.\\"      Republicans have represented the district since Todd Tiahrt unseated veteran Democratic Rep. Dan Glickman in 1994. Pompeo won the state’s 4th District seat in 2010, when Tiahrt gave it up to run unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate.      Trump’s administration picks and a California Democratic appointment has created five openings in the U.S. House, where Republicans have a 237-193 edge. Republicans are defending four GOP-leaning seats — in Kansas, Georgia, Montana and South Carolina — while Democrats are protecting a seat in a liberal California district.      ___      AP Political Writer John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, also contributed to this report. ||||| Kansas has been reliably Republican in federal elections, but GOP operatives head into Tuesday uncertain of an easy victory when the deep-red state holds the first congressional election since President Donald Trump’s inauguration.      Republican Ron Estes, the twice-elected state treasurer, faces Democrat James Thompson and Libertarian Chris Rockhold in the race to replace former Rep. Mike Pompeo, who gave up his seat in January to head the CIA.      Pompeo, a Wichita Republican, won re-election in Kansas’ 4th Congressional District by 31 percentage points in November. The last time a Democrat won the district — which is home to Republican megadonor Charles Koch — was in 1992.      But Republicans say they are in a tight race.      Digital Access For Only 0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.      “I’ve heard people whose opinions I respect tell me they think it would be single digits,” said Clay Barker, the executive director of the Kansas Republican Party.      Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have recorded robocalls to urge voters in the Wichita area to vote for Estes. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican firebrand who won the state’s GOP presidential caucus last year, flew into Wichita for a rally Monday.      An internal poll circulating among Republicans showed Estes up by only a single point as of last week. Trump’s call suggests the urgency of the situation. “Ron Estes needs your vote, and needs it badly,” the president says in the call to voters.      An Estes loss — or even a win by only a slim margin — would likely be read nationally as a sign of a backlash against Trump in the heartland and be seen more locally as a renewed vitality for Kansas Democrats as they head into 2018 with the governor’s office and the rest of the state’s U.S. House seats up for election.      SHARE COPY LINK Kansas officially picked Donald Trump for president on Monday (Dec. 19, 2016).      Many GOP operatives have blamed the surprisingly competitive race on Estes’ campaign, which saw the Republican treasurer avoid some candidate forums and shoot an ad where he stood in a swamp and asked voters to help him drain it in a nod to one of Trump’s campaign slogans.      Bob Beatty, a political scientist at Washburn University, said Estes’ swamp ad was problematic both because “the image is ripe for mockery” and because Estes, as a two-term state official, cannot credibly run as an outsider who is going to drain the swamp.      Democrats have used the image of Estes standing in the swamp and superimposed Gov. Sam Brownback’s head on an alligator swimming alongside him.      “You really stay away from situations where you can be mocked or become an internet meme, and obviously him standing in a swamp with gators is going to bring a lot of chortles to the opposition,” Beatty said.      Barker said he’s received a lot of complaints about the campaign but that this was not uncommon in close races.      “You start getting people on the side saying they should’ve done this or they’ve should’ve done that,” he said.      Barker said the party has focused on turning out diehard Republican voters.      “We always thought turnout would be 20 percent, maybe a little lower, so we focused on the voters that we had to get,” he said.      Colin Curtis, Thompson’s campaign manager, said that Estes has “taken the district for granted and the people for granted. He expects these voters just to show up and blindly vote for him because he’s a registered Republican.”      He said that Thompson, a civil rights attorney, has crisscrossed the district to meet with voters in diners and coffee shops, attend community forums and go door to door.      “It’s definitely competitive. You can look at the early vote numbers. We’re neck and neck,” he said.      Nearly 13,000 GOP voters had cast ballots in advance by mail or in-person compared to about 10,900 Democrats as of Monday morning, according to data provided by the Republican Party. Another 3,400 unaffiliated voters, who could tip the balance, had also cast ballots.      Estes’ campaign manager, Rodger Woods, stressed the importance of turnout in the campaign’s final 24 hours in an email.      “Turnout is vital in Special Elections and in the next 24 hours we are focused on getting our voters to the polls on April 11,” Woods said. “We feel confident that South-Central Kansas wants to elect a conservative problem solver who is committed to balancing the budget, repealing and replacing Obamacare and protecting the unborn.”      Thompson’s supporters say their candidate’s hard work has energized grass-roots activists and made the race competitive unlike previous Democratic campaigns, which fell flat. Thompson’s unique biography — he was homeless as a child and served in the U.S. Army — has helped him appeal to voters.      As an attorney, Thompson has sued the city of Wichita on behalf of people who have been shot by police, according to Djuan Wash, a Black Lives Matter activist who has served as the campaign’s director of African-American outreach.      “I think that really excites people to have someone who has fought on behalf of the rights of the disenfranchised and abused,” Wash said.      Estes has seen a flood of spending by national Republicans in the final days of the race, while Thompson’s campaign struggled to get the Kansas Democratic Party or the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to devote significant financial resources.      “There was potential here,” Curtis said. “We tried to make that selling point. We didn’t get buy-in initially.”      The DCCC did not directly answer a question about the organization’s lack of spending in the race, but it did tout that it would be launching a phone campaign Monday to reach 25,000 households in Kansas to encourage voter turnout.      Meredith Kelly, the DCCC’s spokeswoman, said it’s clear Thompson has “worked harder and smarter than his opponent, and national Republicans are feeling the pressure in their effort to hold onto this reliable seat.”      Jesse Hunt, the press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the organization was confident that Estes will “close strong in the final days” and that GOP voters will turn out to “help send Ron to Washington to help support President Trump and Republican leadership in Congress.”      Curtis said the robocalls from Trump and Pence, Cruz’s appearance, and the late spending by the National Republican Congressional Committee were a sign of Republicans’ concerns.      “You don’t sound the alarm if you think you’re safe,” he said. ||||| House Speaker Paul Ryan sent an email to Republican donors last week, urging them to support Kansas congressional candidate Ron Estes.

Summarize the following: Don’t try to dodge the issue if you cheated and your teacher caught you because it likely will not prevent you from getting into trouble. Instead, explain why you cheated. Be clear about why you made that choice. For example, if you didn't have time to study or couldn't grasp the material, be straightforward about it. You can say something like, \\"I made the choice to cheat because I didn't have time to study, which was in error. Next time, I will give myself more time to properly prepare.\\" Be clear about which assignment or test you cheated on. If it was just on one assignment, you will want to clarify that you did not cheat on other assignments. Be aware that your teacher will probably want to review your previous work or keep a closer eye on your future work to make sure cheating is truly a one-time incident. If you cheated because you were struggling in the class, tell the teacher you need some additional help in the subject. Be specific about which elements of the course material you don't understand. They may be able to recommend a tutor or some additional resources. You could say: \\"I am not sure I understand how to measure the surface area. This was one of the reasons why I cheated on the test. Do you know of any tutors who might be able to help me understand this topic?\\" If you received a failing grade for cheating on a test or assignment, ask for a makeup assignment or extra credit work to start salvaging your grade. Your teacher might be able to give you a make-up assignment or have you do more problems than other students so that you can catch up. Being apologetic may lessen the consequences and punishment from cheating, but you will need to be genuine. You will need to take personal responsibility to move on from the incident. Tell your teacher the cheating was out of character for you and not something you intend to do again in the future. Although you will still likely be punished for cheating or plagiarizing, being remorseful can help minimize the lasting effects to your academic reputation. You could say: \\"I am very sorry that I cheated on last week's test. I understand that this was a wrongdoing and that my actions have consequences that I will need to face. At the same time I also want to reassure you that this was a one-time incident and it will not happen again.\\"","output":"If caught cheating, don't dodge the issue.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: A man in a black suit, is standing in front of a group of people in white suits and black dresses. Hypothesis: The man is making a presentation. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"To determine the likelihood of the hypothesis being true, we must first analyze the premise and consider alternative possibilities or contexts for the given scene. The hypothesis suggests that the man in the black suit is making a presentation to the group of people. While this is a possibility, there are multiple factors to consider before arriving at a conclusion. 1. The attire of the group: The individuals are dressed in white suits and black dresses, which suggests a formal setting. Depending on the context, the formal nature of the attire could either support or contradict the hypothesis. For instance, if the setting is a business setting, the hypothesis could be more likely. However, if it is a wedding or a formal event, the likelihood of the hypothesis dramatically reduces.  2. Body language and positioning: To better assess the hypothesis, it is essential to know more details about the body language of the people involved. Are they seated, standing, or actively engaged with the man in question? The body language of the listeners might shed light on whether the man is genuinely making a presentation or perhaps playing a different role in the setting. For example, if the people are focused on the man, taking notes, or asking questions, it would strengthen the hypothesis. 3. Context of the scene: The context of the scene plays a crucial role in determining the validity of the hypothesis. Is this taking place in a business environment, a social gathering, or an academic institution? The surroundings could help to confirm or negate the hypothesis. For example, if the environment is a conference room or a classroom, the likelihood of the man making a presentation increases. In contrast, if the setting is an art gallery or a theater, the hypothesis might be less likely. In conclusion, without additional information regarding the context of the scene, body language, and the relationship between the man and the group, we cannot definitively conclude that the man is making a presentation. It is essential to consider alternative scenarios and take into account the factors mentioned above before confirming the hypothesis. Some other plausible interpretations of this scene could be: the man is an event host addressing the guests, a wedding officiant conducting a ceremony, or an artist explaining their creation during an exhibition opening. The hypothesis that the man is making a presentation is just one possibility among many, and further information is needed to make a more accurate assessment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers. In this perspective, wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor (worker, capitalist/business owner, landlord).

Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations  , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek   movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button.

What is the answer to this question? when does monsoon season start in pakistan 2017?","output":"The monsoon season in Pakistan in 2017 started in late June and lasted until mid-September. However, it's important to note that the monsoon season can vary slightly each year, so it is not always possible to predict the exact start and end dates with absolute certainty. The monsoon season in Pakistan is mainly characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, which are caused by the seasonal reversal of winds in the Indian Ocean. This leads to the development of a low-pressure area over the Indian subcontinent, and as the prevailing winds change direction, they pick up moisture from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, bringing extensive rainfall to Pakistan and surrounding regions. Pakistan's monsoon season can be divided into two main phases. The first phase typically begins in late June or early July, affecting mostly the southern parts of the country, such as Sindh and Balochistan provinces. The second phase is usually more intense and occurs between late July and mid-September, affecting the northern and central parts of Pakistan, including Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. During the monsoon season, Pakistan experiences torrential rains, which can often lead to severe flooding. The intensity of the rainfall varies from year to year, sometimes causing devastating floods and loss of life and property. In addition to the negative aspects, the monsoon season plays a crucial role in Pakistan's agriculture. It provides the necessary water for irrigation and helps in recharging groundwater levels, which are essential for the country's primarily agrarian economy. In summary, the monsoon season in Pakistan in 2017 started in late June and lasted until mid-September. While the dates may vary each year, the monsoon season is generally characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity throughout the country, with the southern regions experiencing rains earlier in the season and the northern and central parts affected more towards the end of the season. Due to its pervasive influence on agriculture and potential for natural disasters, the monsoon season is closely monitored and forecasted by meteorologists and the relevant authorities in Pakistan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: HONG KONG – Hong Kong police battling activists for control of an underpass in the dead of night Wednesday sparked public anger after officers were seen kicking a handcuffed protester in the worst violence since street demonstrations for greater democracy began more than two weeks ago. Officers armed with riot shields, batons and pepper spray knocked activists to the ground, dragging dozens away, and tore down barricades protesters used as roadblocks around the underpass outside the government's headquarters. Outrage over their aggressive tactics exploded after local TV showed officers taking the protester around a dark corner and kicking him repeatedly on the ground. It's unclear what provoked the attack. Local Now TV showed him splashing water on officers beforehand. \\"Hong Kong police have gone insane today, carrying out their own punishment in private,\\" said pro-democracy lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan. \\"Hong Kong's values and its rule of law really have been completely destroyed by police chiefs.\\" Police spokesman Steve Hui said seven officers who were involved have been temporarily reassigned, and that authorities will carry out an impartial investigation. Beijing, meanwhile, issued its harshest condemnations yet of the protests, calling them illegal, bad for business and against Hong Kong's best interests. The central government has become increasingly impatient with the demonstrations, the biggest challenge its authority since China took control of the former British colony in 1997. A front-page editorial Wednesday in the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's mouthpiece, condemned the protests and said \\"they are doomed to fail.\\" \\"Facts and history tell us that radical and illegal acts that got their way only result in more severe illegal activities, exacerbating disorder and turmoil,\\" the commentary said. \\"Stability is bliss, and turmoil brings havoc.\\" However, there were no signs that the central government was planning to become directly involved in suppressing the demonstrations, which have marshalled opposition to plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in Hong Kong's first election to choose the city's chief executive in 2017. The protesters also want the current leader, deeply unpopular Leung Chun-ying, to resign. The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government, and it is unclear when and how the crisis will be resolved. Leung, who described the protests as being \\"out of control,\\" told reporters that officials are willing to talk to protesters, but reiterated that Beijing will not drop the election restrictions it imposed. He canceled a leader's questions session at the Legislative Council on Thursday, citing security risks. The police operation early Wednesday came hours after a large group of protesters blockaded the underpass, expanding their protest zone after being cleared out of some other streets. The protesters outnumbered the police officers, who later returned with reinforcements to clear the area. The underpass borders the city government headquarters and is close to the main protest zone straddling a highway on the opposite side of the complex. Demonstrators appeared to storm the short tunnel in reaction to police attempts over the past two days to remove barricades on the edges of the sprawling protest zone. Police said they had to disperse the protesters because they were disrupting public order and gathering illegally. Hui, the police spokesman, said five officers were injured in the commotion, and that police arrested 45 demonstrators during the clashes — none of whom were injured. But local television showed a video of a group of plainclothes police officers taking a man around the side of a building, pushing him to the ground and kicking him. Local legislators and activists identified the protester as Ken Tsang, a member of a pro-democracy political party. Tsang, through his lawyer Tanya Chan, alleged that officers also slapped him after he was taken to a police station. Activists circulated photos of bruises on his face and back. \\"Some of us were sleeping in the park when more than a hundred of them ran toward us with torches as if they're trying to blind us temporarily. We were not prepared for how aggressive they were,\\" said protester Simon Lam, 22. After initial attempts to disperse protesters with tear gas and pepper spray two weeks ago, police have adopted a different strategy of chipping away at the three protest zones by removing barricades from the edges of the occupied areas in the early morning, when the crowd numbers are usually lowest. But Wednesday's raid was the most violent so far, with police charging the protesters and dragging them away. One officer ripped a facemask off an activist before spraying him with pepper spray, according to a video on the South China Morning Post newspaper's website. Positions on both sides have been hardening since the government called off negotiations last week, citing the unlikelihood of a constructive outcome given their sharp differences. Beijing is eager to end the protests to avoid emboldening activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. In language freighted with political symbolism, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, was quoted as telling Hong Kong legislators at a banquet Tuesday that the protest movement \\"is a serious social and political incident.\\" Zhang said the movement challenged Beijing's authority and had caused the city to suffer huge economic losses. It had \\"hurt the basis of Hong Kong's rule of law, democratic development, social harmony, international image and its relations with the mainland,\\" he said. Zhang called for an end to the protests as soon as possible to avoid further losses to Hong Kong's citizenry. But Lam, the student protester, said he was bracing for more tensions as students' distrust of police grows. \\"Now there is a feeling we are not just here to fool around or just to sit peacefully. We are feeling more prepared. We have become more united in building defenses,\\" Lam said.

They have also typically been among the largest size aircraft in contemporary military or civil service. Delivery of the largest possible amount of air-to-ground weaponry over long distances to strike enemy targets is the heavy bomber's mission (see also strategic bomber).  - A vision quest is a rite of passage in some Native American cultures. It is usually only undertaken by young males entering adulthood. Individual Indigenous cultures have their own names for their rites of passage. \\"Vision quest\\" is an English umbrella term, and may not always be accurate or used by the cultures in question.  Among Native American cultures who have this type of rite, it usually consists of a series of ceremonies led by Elders and supported by the young man's community. The process includes a complete fast for four days and nights, alone at a sacred site in nature which is chosen by the Elders for this purpose. Some communities have used the same sites for many generations. During this time, the young person prays and cries out to the spirits that they may have a vision, one that will help them find their purpose in life, their role in community, and how they may best serve the People. Dreams or visions may involve natural symbolism - such as animals or forces of nature - that require interpretation by Elders. After their passage into adulthood, and guided by this experience, the young person may then become an apprentice or student of an adult who has mastered this role. When talking to Yellow Wolf, Lucullus Virgil McWhorter came to believe that the person fasts, and stays awake and concentrates on their quest until their mind becomes \\"comatose.\\" It was then that their \\"Weyekin\\" (Nez Perce word) revealed itself.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force.

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Air-to-ground weaponry is aircraft ordnance used by combat aircraft to attack ground targets.

It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

Box Among the given options, the most common object people usually tie a ribbon around as a present is a box. This is because a gift box, which typically houses a present, is most likely to be adorned with a ribbon to enhance the overall appearance and create an element of excitement for the recipient. Additionally, tying a ribbon around a box serves more than just an aesthetic purpose; it also helps secure the wrapping paper or other coverings around the package. Presentation is an important aspect of gift-giving, and ribbons can transform an ordinary box into a beautifully wrapped gift, conveying thoughtfulness and care. Ribbons can come in numerous colors, patterns, and textures, offering a myriad of choices for customizing the presentation depending on the occasion, recipient, or personal taste. While some of the other options provided could also potentially include the use of ribbons (such as floral arrangements and girl's hair), neither of these instances involves tying a ribbon around a present. A ribbon would be tied around a floral arrangement for presentation purposes, while a ribbon is used in a girl's hair primarily as a decorative accessory or as a way to secure a hairstyle. Although some people might tie a ribbon around a car or a typewriter as a surprise or unconventional gift, these options are less common and certainly not as popular as tying a ribbon around a box as a present."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Worst Economist in the World A thought: it has occurred to me that we could use an economics equivalent of Keith Olbermann’s “Worst Person in the World” award. KO does not, of course, mean that the person he goes after on any given night really is the worst person in the world; he just uses the title to highlight some especially awful action or statement. I’d encourage others to enter this game — and yes, I know that various paid trolls and others will award me the title five times a day if they can. But here’s what caught my eye: the WSJ’s Real Time Economics explaining (or rather, “explaining”) the risks from competitive devaluation: When one country devalues its currency, others tend to follow suit. As a result, nobody achieves trade gains. Instead, the devaluations put upward pressure on the prices of commodities such as oil. Higher commodity prices, in turn, can cut into global economic output. In one ominous sign, the price of oil is up 8.7% since August 27. Why do dollar commodity prices tend to rise when the dollar falls? Because other countries buy commodities too, so that a constant dollar price would mean a fall in terms of other currencies. To a first approximation, in fact, you’d expect commodity prices to remain constant, other things equal, in terms of a GDP-weighted basket of currencies around the world. So yes, a fall in the dollar tends to raise the price of oil in dollars — but it also tends to reduce the price of oil in euros. A fall in the euro tends to raise the price of oil in euros, but raise reduce it in dollars. [whoops!] So what would devaluations that raise commodity prices in terms of all currencies look like? I have no idea. There is, I think, a tendency to think of devaluations as reductions in the value of currencies relative to something external and eternal — and hence as making us all poorer. But the reality is that my depreciation is your appreciation, and vice versa; we can’t all devalue at the same time. But competitive devaluation is one of those things people just know is bad, and so critical thinking has a tendency to go out the window. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the idea of having an economics equivalent of the \\"Worst Person in the World\\" award and encourages others to participate in this game. The author then explains competitive devaluation and its perceived risks, such as increasing commodity prices like oil. They argue that there is a misconception that devaluations make everyone poorer, but in reality, one currency's depreciation leads to another's appreciation, and vice versa.

The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation.

Italian outrage over Roma drowning photos (CNN) -- Italian newspapers, an archbishop and civil liberties campaigners expressed shock and revulsion on Monday after photographs were published of sunbathers apparently enjoying a day at the beach just meters from where the bodies of two drowned Roma girls were laid out on the sand. Photographs of the dead Roma girls on a beach caused outrage in Italy. Italian news agency ANSA reported that the incident had occurred on Saturday at the beach of Torregaveta, west of Naples, southern Italy, where the two girls had earlier been swimming in the sea with two other Roma girls. Reports said they had gone to the beach to beg and sell trinkets. Local news reports said the four girls found themselves in trouble amid fierce waves and strong currents. Emergency services responded 10 minutes after a distress call was made from the beach and two lifeguards attended the girls upon hearing their screams. Two of them were pulled to safety but rescuers failed to reach the other two in time to save them. Watch why the photos have generated anger » The Web site of the Archbishop of Naples said the girls were cousins named Violetta and Cristina, aged 12 and 13. Their bodies were eventually laid out on the sand under beach towels to await collection by police. Photographs show sunbathers in bikinis and swimming trunks sitting close to where the girls' feet can be seen poking out from under the towels concealing their bodies. A photographer who took photos at the scene told CNN the mood among sunbathers had been one of indifference.

Corriere della Sera said that a crowd of curious onlookers that had formed around the bodies quickly dispersed. \\"Few left the beach or abandoned their sunbathing. When the police from the mortuary arrived an hour later with coffins, the two girls were carried away between bathers stretched out in the sun.\\" The incident also attracted condemnation from the Archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Crecenzio Seppe. \\"Indifference is not an emotion for human beings,\\" Seppe wrote in his parish blog. \\"To turn the other way or to mind your own business can sometimes be more devastating than the events that occur.\\" Recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between Italian authorities and the country's Roma minority amid a crackdown by Silvo Berlusconi's government targeting illegal immigrants and talk by government officials of a \\"Roma emergency\\" that has seen the 150,000-strong migrant group blamed for rising street crime. That has provided justification for police raids on Roma camps and controversial government plans to fingerprint all Roma -- an act condemned by the European Parliament and United Nations officials as a clear act of racial discrimination. Popular resentment against Romanies has also seen Roma camps near Naples attacked and set on fire with petrol bombs by local residents.

The incident occurred at Torregaveta beach, west of Naples in southern Italy. The girls, aged 12 and 13, had been swimming with two other Roma girls when they encountered fierce waves and strong currents. Emergency services responded but were unable to save two of the girls. The indifference of sunbathers captured in the photographs provoked condemnation from the public, the Archbishop of Naples, and civil liberties campaigners. The incident took place in the context of heightened tensions between Italian authorities and the country's Roma minority, who have been targeted by the government in a crackdown on illegal immigrants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: What skills does Manray have? Title: Bamboozled Movie plot: In a New York City residence, Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) rises to begin his daily routine. Brushing his teeth, he gives us by voice over a definition of satire. He tells us that with the rise of the Internet, video and interactive games, his field as a television writer has seen a drop in popularity. Meanwhile, in a dilapidated building, squatter Womack (Tommy Davidson) wakes up his friend Manray (Savion Glover) for a day of work. This consists of travelling to the CNS (Continental Network System) building where Delacroix works, and Manray tap dancing to entertain the workers. They then collect money from the workers. The men see Delacroix walk by, and ask him for monetary help in the form of work of some kind.Delacroix walks into a staff meeting late and is immediately castigated by his boss, Thomas Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport). Dunwitty informs the staff that CNS has poor ratings. He says he wants them to write funnier material, and ends the meeting. In the privacy of his office, Dunwitty tells Delacroix that the material Delacroix's been writing for him seems like it's about white people with black faces. Dunwitty asserts that Delacroix is an \\"oreo\\" with his Harvard education, because he won't write a \\"n----r show.\\"The next day, Delacroix and his assistant Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett Smith) talk. They've decided that Manray is the solution to his problem. Delacroix plans to write a show that will be so \\"offensive and racist,\\" it will prove his point that the network only wants to see black buffoons on the air. Delacroix simply hopes to be fired, so he can be let go of his contract with CNS. Manray and Womack ask at the receptionist's desk for a \\"Delapoint\\" and the men working there tell them to step outside. However, Sloan steps into the lobby, sees what's happening, and escorts Manray and Womack to Delacroix's office. Delacroix explains to them that he has an idea for a television pilot, and they can make money with it. His main request is that Manray changes his name to Mantan, in an apparent homage... Answer:","output":"Manray has skills in tap dancing, as he is seen tap dancing to entertain workers in the CNS building."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Fleas and their eggs can easily hide in the grass and in areas of your yard where debris (e.g. leaves, etc.) has built up. To prevent fleas from being able to make a long-term home in these areas, keep your yard clean and your grass cut short. This is especially important in the areas of your yard where you dog hangs out the most. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a calcium dust that’s ground from single-cell ocean organisms. Only use DE that’s been certified as “food grade.” You can mix some DE in water (in a watering can if you have one) and sprinkle the mixture on your grass, sidewalks, decks, paving stones, and even in your flower beds. Focus on areas of your yard where your dog hangs out the most.  This mixture dries out flea eggs and makes it impossible for adult fleas to breathe, therefore killing them off. If you live in a moist and humid climate, you may need to apply this mixture every two months. If you live in a dry climate, you won’t need to apply as often, maybe once every three to four months. Make sure to wear a protective mask when handling the DE dust as it can irritate your lungs. You can buy DE online at shops like Amazon or at hardware/garden stores. Pest control companies may also sell it, as it’s used extensively to kill other types of pests as well. Water drowns fleas and flea eggs. You can use a garden hose to drown fleas and their eggs in your yard in areas where your dog frequents (e.g. kennel, dog run, favourite nap area, etc.). Just spray water in the area until it’s practically flooded. In order to kill fleas and their eggs inside your house, you need to keep up a regular cleaning routine around your house. Start by washing hard floors (e.g. wood, tile, etc.) as often as you can. Pay special attention to the cracks and gaps in the floors where fleas can hide. You should also vacuum your rugs and carpets every day to remove any fleas or eggs that may fall off you or your dog.  To help keep fleas at bay, and to prevent you from needing to do too much work, it may be easier to simply remove and store away your area carpets or rugs during flea season. Give them a good cleaning before you store them and when you take them back out again. When doing your daily vacuuming routine on carpets and rugs, you may also want to run the vacuum over any furniture in the same rooms (e.g. couches, ottomans, pillows, etc.). If you use a vacuum with a bag, you can freeze the bag in-between uses to kill the fleas you vacuum up. Note that the fleas will stay alive inside the bag between vacuuming if you simply store the vacuum between uses. If small enough, wash your dog’s bedding in your washing machine every week with hot water and mild laundry detergent. If the bedding is too big for the washing machine, you can always soak it in a tub of water mixed with vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. Worst case scenario, if your dog’s bedding is too big for either washing method, make sure to vacuum it thoroughly. If the flea infestation is really bad, or if it’s over but you want to make sure you got every last flea, consider hiring a steam cleaning company to come to your home. Ask them to use just hot water to steam clean your floors, furniture, and your dog’s bedding. Make sure you move furniture in order to steam clean underneath too.","output":"The article provides tips on preventing and eliminating fleas and their eggs from your yard and home by maintaining a clean environment through regular yard care and grass cutting, using diatomaceous earth to kill fleas, employing water to drown fleas in specific areas, maintaining a thorough indoor cleaning routine including washing floors and vacuuming carpets daily, removing and cleaning area rugs during flea season, vacuuming furniture, freezing vacuum bags to kill fleas, washing or soaking dog bedding regularly, and considering steam cleaning services if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The knife punctured the throat while deflecting off the bone, since the  OPT: (i). throat was softer.; (ii). bone was softer.;","output":"The knife punctured the throat while deflecting off the bone, since the: (i). throat was softer. In this sentence, the knife has been thrust towards an individual's throat, finding its way through the soft tissue. Since the throat is softer in comparison to the bone, its vulnerability to damage is higher. When referring to the throat in this context, it primarily refers to the soft tissue that is composed of muscles, cartilage, blood vessels, and other connective tissues. The throat not only plays a significant role in breathing, speaking, and swallowing but also houses various essential structures such as the larynx (voice box) and parts of the pharynx. Due to its softer nature, the throat can relatively easily be penetrated or damaged, as depicted in the sentence. On the other hand, bones are more rigid and robust structures in the body, mainly made up of collagen and calcium phosphate. The hardness of the bones is mainly due to the mineralized matrix present in them. Bones offer structural support, facilitate movement, protect delicate organs, and store essential minerals in the body. Given these facts, when the knife comes in contact with the throat and the bone, it is much easier for the softer throat tissue to be punctured. The bone, being harder and more resistant, deflects the knife rather than being directly damaged by it. In summary, the sentence implies that when a knife is forced towards an individual's throat, the knife effortlessly punctures the softer throat tissue but deflects off the bone without causing much harm to it, given the bone's harder nature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Affirmed (February 21, 1975 - January 12, 2001) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was the eleventh winner of the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade As a two-year-old, Affirmed won seven of his nine starts, with two placings, for earnings of 343,477 under regular rider Steve Cauthen, then a teenager. Notably, six of those starts were against his rival, Calumet Farm's Alydar, with Affirmed winning four and Alydar winning two.  Affirmed won his first start in a maiden special weight race at Belmont Park on May 24, 1977. He followed up with a win in the Youthful Stakes on June 15 where he defeated Alydar by eight lengths. On July 6 in the Great American Stakes, Alydar evened the score with a  3 1/2 length win after mounting a powerful stretch drive.  Affirmed was then shipped across country to Hollywood Park, where he won the Hollywood Juvenile Championship Stakes on July 23. He then shipped back to New York where he won the Sanford Stakes at Saratoga on August 17 by  2 1/2 lengths over the previously undefeated Tilt Up. In his next start on August 27 in the Hopeful Stakes, his main rival was Alydar, who was the even money favorite after winning four straight races. Affirmed stalked the early pace set by Tilt Up with Alydar in close contention. Around the far turn, Affirmed moved to the lead with Alydar closing ground on the outside. In mid-stretch, Alydar had closed to within a head but Affirmed pulled away in the final sixteenth of a mile to win by half a length. His time of 1:15 2/5 for  6 1/2 furlongs was a new stakes record.  The two horses again faced off in the Belmont Futurity on September 10, with Affirmed going off as the narrow favorite. After a good start, Affirmed settled into second place behind longshot Rough Sea, while Alydar overcame a bad start to move into third place down the backstretch. Rounding into the stretch, Affirmed moved to the lead. Alydar responded and the two horses dueled head-to-head for the final furlong. Alydar appeared to be in the lead for much of the stretch drive before Affirmed rallied in the final stride to win by a nose. \\"He never gave up,\\" said Cauthen, \\"even when he was headed.\\"  Alydar turned the tables in the Champagne Stakes on October 15, sweeping by Affirmed in the stretch to win by  1 1/4 lengths. The two faced off again in the Laurel Futurity on October 29, then one of the most prestigious races for two-year-olds in the country, with Affirmed winning by a neck. With his 4-2 margin in the series against Alydar, Affirmed was named the 1977 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did he do during tthe 1977 season?","output":"During the 1977 season, Affirmed, as a two-year-old, won seven of his nine starts, with two placings, for earnings of 343,477 under regular rider Steve Cauthen, then a teenager.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise given is: \\"That's what brought the name into your mind so pat.\\" The hypothesis postulated is: \\"That is why you completely forgot the name.\\" To thoroughly analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's break down the elements of each statement and examine their logical connection. The premise states that something specific (an event, situation, or stimulus) brought the name into your mind seamlessly and without effort. In this context, \\"so pat\\" probably implies that the event or trigger was particularly apt or fitting. It suggests that the retrieval of the name was relatively easy and immediate due to the strong association between the event and the name. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that this same retrieval process is the reason you completely forgot the name. This statement implies that despite the easy and immediate recall of the name initially, there came a point where the name was eventually forgotten. Now, let's evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must examine if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise. In other words, we need to see whether it is logically impossible for the premise to be true and the hypothesis to be false. In the given case, it is not necessarily impossible for the premise to be true while the hypothesis is false. The premise only mentions the ease with which the name was brought to mind, not that it led to its subsequent forgetfulness. Therefore, it is plausible that the initial recall of the name did not lead to forgetfulness in another context or at another point in time. It could even be the case that the name was remembered more firmly because of the strong association with the event. In conclusion, the premise, \\"That's what brought the name into your mind so pat,\\" does not entail the hypothesis, \\"That is why you completely forgot the name,\\" as the two statements do not necessarily confirm or depend on each other in a logically coherent manner. The premise is focused on the ease of the initial recall of the name, while the hypothesis revolves around the eventual forgetfulness of the same name. The connection between them is not strong enough to suggest that one is caused by the other, especially since the premise does not provide any information about the factors that led to the forgetfulness of the name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

They have mentioned children's entertainment, superhero comics, and Japanese animation, which are generally associated with elements that are well-loved and appealing to a wide audience. While the critic doesn't explicitly state their opinion, highlighting these specific aspects of the movie implies that they find them to be noteworthy and a positive aspect of the film. Children's entertainment, for one, suggests that the movie is lighthearted, innocent, and has a sense of wonder and creativity that can be enjoyed by young and old alike. This points towards the critic potentially appreciating the film's ability to entertain and captivate the imagination of a younger audience. Furthermore, the critic referenced superhero comics as an aspect of the movie, suggesting that they consider this another positive point. Superhero comics have a long history of thrilling readers with exciting adventures, larger-than-life characters, and intricate storylines. By the critic mentioning this genre, they indicate that the movie contains exhilarating action and heroic themes, which are generally seen as attractive features in movies. Lastly, the mention of Japanese animation highlights yet another element the critic seems to think favorably about. Japanese animation, or anime, is renowned for its unique visuals, storytelling techniques, and inventive concepts. By associating the movie with Japanese animation, the critic hints at a stylistic and narrative influence that elevates the movie from the standard fare. While the critic’s opinion isn't explicitly spelled out, the focus on these three positive aspects of children's entertainment, superhero comics, and Japanese animation leads to the conclusion that they viewed the movie in a positive light.

He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah.  Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella.

(CNN) -- Michael Clarke has big cricketing shoes to fill following the retirement of Ricky Ponting, but the Australia captain has already wiped out one of his predecessor's records. Clarke beat Ponting's leading mark of 1,544 runs scored in a calendar year by an Australian batsman, set in 2003, as he made 106 on day two of the second Test against Sri Lanka. The 31-year-old posted his 22nd Test century -- still 19 behind Ponting -- and his first in Melbourne as the home team reached 440-8 at stumps on Thursday for a lead of 284. \\"It is nice to get that monkey off my back and get my first hundred here,\\" Clarke, who overcame a hamstring injury to start the match, told reporters after taking his total for 2012 to 1,595.","output":"\\"It's a great honor to break such a prestigious record held by Ricky Ponting, someone I've always admired and looked up to throughout my cricketing career,\\" Clarke continued. \\"However, I must give credit to my teammates for their unwavering support and hard work, as this achievement wouldn't have been possible without them. We still have a lot of work to do in this Test match and the series as a whole, so our focus must remain on performing consistently and striving for victory in every game.\\" The Australian team, known for their powerhouse performances, has certainly benefited from Clarke's leadership and extraordinary ability to rack up significant scores. His determination and skill on the field have been instrumental in turning crucial games in their favor, and his personal achievements have inspired his teammates to reach new heights. As the Australian cricket team and its millions of fans celebrate this milestone, they also acknowledge the legacy left behind by Ricky Ponting, whose leadership, skill, and commitment to excellence set the stage for players like Clarke to flourish. Ponting's 19-year international career saw him amass 13,378 Test runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer of all time, just behind India's Sachin Tendulkar. While it remains to be seen whether Clarke can match or surpass Ponting's overall tally, his already impressive achievements have firmly established him as one of the greats in Australian and international cricket. With Clarke at the helm, the Australian cricket team is confident about their prospects in the ongoing Test Series against Sri Lanka and other future challenges. As cricket lovers worldwide eagerly follow the unfolding events in the Test match, they can take a moment to appreciate the talent, dedication, and discipline that have enabled superstars like Michael Clarke to shatter records and etch their names into the annals of the sport. In doing so, they inspire a new generation of players and fans alike, fueling the passion and excitement that make cricket such an enduring and beloved pastime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability","output":"In analyzing the content of the given review, it seems that the reviewer expresses a negative opinion of the movie. Here are a few key phrases and explanations that support this conclusion: 1. \\"at every opportunity to do something clever\\": This phrase implies that the film had potential to be wise, innovative, or original in various aspects, such as storytelling, character development, or cinematography. However, the reviewer doesn't seem to think the movie capitalizes on those chances. 2. \\"the film goes right over the edge\\": Using the term \\"over the edge\\" reflects that the movie may have taken its attempts to be clever too far, likely resulting in a situation where it becomes difficult for the audience to remain invested or engaged. A film going \\"over the edge\\" can be seen as excessive or overly dramatic, which is often considered negative in the context of a review. 3. \\"kills every sense of believability\\": Any movie - whether it's a fictional story or based on real-life events - should maintain a certain level of believability, where it remains plausible and the audience can suspend their disbelief. When believability is \\"killed\\", it means that the film is no longer convincing, hindering the viewer's ability to immerse themselves in the story. A reviewer that notes the loss of believability is likely conveying their dissatisfaction with the film. Based on these phrases and the overall tone, it can be surmised that the review portrays a negative opinion of the movie. The reviewer believes that the film fails to take advantage of opportunities to be clever and instead opts for excessive choices that diminish its credibility and appeal to the audience, leading to a less enjoyable viewing experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: There are a lot of poems focused on the theme of death, grief, or sympathy that are appropriate for funerals. Think about whether the deceased person had any favorite poets or specific poems. Pick one that reflects the deceased person and their passions or personality.  You could also write your own short poem about the person if you want to express your own emotions. If you don’t have room to include an entire poem, use 1 or 2 of the most meaningful lines from the piece instead. Choose a phrase that the person who passed away was known for, as long as it’s appropriate for the occasion. For example, you could use what Grandma Jane said every time she put a pie in the oven: “Everything tastes better with love!”  Only use quotes or phrases that most people will be familiar with. Avoid inside jokes that only you know. If the famous phrase includes curse words or something inappropriate, or if it could offend someone in the audience, don’t include it. If you have something you want to say to the person who passed, use the eulogy as an opportunity to share it. Keep it to 2 to 3 sentences and make sure it contains a message that the rest of the audience can relate to.  For example, now is not the time to tell Grandma Jane that you stained her good apron. Instead, say something like, “Grandma, I’ll miss your blueberry pie, but more than that, I’ll miss the way you used to hug me when I was sad or how your laugh was the best sound in the world. I can’t wait to see you again one day.” Look up towards the sky while you address the person to feel more connected to their spirit. If religion was a big part of their life and beliefs, incorporate it into your eulogy by ending with a quote from a spiritual leader or a passage from a religious text. For example, if they were Christian, you might use a Bible verse as the final sentence.  You could also end the eulogy with a brief prayer in the deceased person’s honor.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the band that achieved huge commercial success with its second album, Nevermind?  The underground punk rock movement inspired countless bands that either evolved from a punk rock sound or brought its outsider spirit to very different kinds of music. The original punk explosion also had a long-term effect on the music industry, spurring the growth of the independent sector. During the early 1980s, British bands like New Order and the Cure that straddled the lines of post-punk and new wave developed both new musical styles and a distinctive industrial niche. Though commercially successful over an extended period, they maintained an underground-style, subcultural identity. In the United States, bands such as Hüsker Dü and their Minneapolis protégés the Replacements bridged the gap between punk rock genres like hardcore and the more melodic, explorative realm of what was then called \\"college rock\\".A 1985 Rolling Stone feature on the Minneapolis scene and innovative California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, \\"Primal punk is passé. The best of the American punk rockers have moved on. They have learned how to play their instruments. They have discovered melody, guitar solos and lyrics that are more than shouted political slogans. Some of them have even discovered the Grateful Dead.\\" By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including indie rock, gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.As American alternative bands like Sonic Youth, which had grown out of the no wave scene, and Boston's Pixies started to gain larger audiences, major labels sought to capitalize on the underground market that had been sustained by hardcore punk for years. In 1991, Nirvana emerged from Washington State's underground, DIY grunge scene; after recording their first album, Bleach for about 600, the band achieved huge...

He becomes a Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1953, Leo, now married to Raisa and living in Moscow, is a captain in the Ministry of State Security, commanding a unit tasked with tracking down and arresting dissidents. They arrest a veterinarian, Anatoly Brodsky, and during the arrest, one of Leo's subordinates, the cowardly but ambitious Vasili Nikitin, shoots a farmer, Semyon Okun, and his wife in whose barn Brodsky has been hiding, orphaning their two young daughters. Angry, Leo strikes Vasili, who harbours growing resentment against Leo and the other officer in the unit, Alexei Andreyev; all three were in Berlin together in 1945. Vasili is in charge of Brodsky's interrogation and execution, and one of the names he gives to their superior, Major Kuzmin, is that of Raisa, a primary school teacher, several of whose colleagues have recently been arrested for dissident views. Kuzmin orders Leo to investigate his own wife. Meanwhile, Alexei's young son, Jora, is found dead near a railway yard.

The text refers to the reason behind the death of Jesus Christ, as mentioned in Christian theology. According to this belief, Jesus died on the cross as a means of taking the punishment that all sinners deserved, in order to offer forgiveness and eternal life to those who believe in Him. This act is known as atonement and signifies the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus made to reconcile humanity with God. In Christianity, it is believed that all humans are born with innate sinfulness, which began with the disobedience of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Due to this inherent sin, humanity became separated from God, who is divine and pure. This separation necessitates a way for humanity to find redemption and restore their broken relationship with God. Jesus, who is considered to be the Son of God and part of the Holy Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit), was sent to earth in human form to offer a pathway to salvation. His role as the \\"Lamb of God\\" or sacrificial figure represents the forgiveness of sins. The crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus are considered by Christians as the ultimate demonstration of God's love, offering salvation to all who believe in Jesus. In summary, not only is the fact that Jesus died crucially significant in Christianity, but the reason behind His death is equally important. By bearing the punishment that all sinners deserve, Jesus provides a means for humanity to attain forgiveness, redemption, and everlasting life with God. This vital aspect of Jesus' life and mission lies at the heart of the Christian faith."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Which individual studied the aspects of comics  during the seventies that is referred to as now as \\"closure\\"? Context: European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed \\"closure\\". In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term multicadre, or \\"multiframe\\", to refer to the comics a page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists' poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of \\"les littératures dessinées\\" (or \\"drawn literatures\\"). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud's which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. Since the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn has begun analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound \\"grammars\\" to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain's comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music. The answer to this question is:","output":"Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle studied the aspects of comics during the seventies that are now referred to as \\"closure\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They carefully use double-sided tape to hold the fold in place, before trimming any excess paper with a pair of sharp scissors. The person pays close attention to the precision of their cuts, making sure that each edge is straight and no jagged lines are present. After securing one side of the wrapping paper to the box, the person moves on to the other side. They patiently repeat the process, folding the paper tightly over the box and taping it down with more double-sided tape. They make sure to match the seams perfectly, so the wrapping appears seamless and even. Once the long sides of the box are completely wrapped, the person focuses on the shorter ends. They press the wrapping paper down along the crease where the short end of the box meets the long end, creating a crisp, distinct fold. They repeat the process for the remaining three corners. With all four corners defined, the person starts folding the wrapping paper on one short end of the box. They fold the top and bottom flaps down, making a neat triangle shape on both sides. Then, they bring the triangle flaps in toward the center of the box, ensuring that the points touch the previously folded edges. The person secures the flaps with double-sided tape, taking care once more to align the seams neatly. The individual then moves to the other short end of the box and follows the same procedure, folding the wrapping paper into triangle shapes and securing them with tape. They check to make sure the points of each triangle fold meet the edges of the box precisely, adjusting as necessary. Once the entire box is wrapped, the person steps back to admire their handiwork. The wrapping paper is tight and wrinkle-free, and all the seams line up perfectly. Satisfied with their work, the person moves on to adding some finishing touches. They gather a spool of ribbon and carefully cut a length of it, long enough to wrap around the box and form a decorative bow. Using a special technique, the person ties the ribbon around the box to create a beautiful and secure knot. They then take the time to form a perfect bow, fluffing out the loops and adjusting the ends until it looks just right. Finally, the person selects a coordinating gift tag and writes a heartfelt message for the recipient. They string the gift tag onto the ribbon and secure it with a small knot, making sure it hangs elegantly next to the bow. The person takes a moment to survey their masterpiece – a beautifully wrapped gift that is sure to delight its recipient. They carefully set the gift aside, ready to be placed under the tree or presented at the special event, confident it will bring joy and appreciation from the receiver.

It would be hard to find a person who is neutral  ,or simply doesn't care one way or the other. What I wonder is why something even without legs causes such great fear. Snakes are quite useful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Snakes help control the population of mice. Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake. The poison argument   is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones. And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend. Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do. If you're lucky, you might not run across more than a few of them in a lifetime. That would be fine with most of us.

The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building.

He tells the driver about two girls he knows about in Torrance Beach that he's planning to spend the night with. Later that day at Petro Park, a hangout in Orange County, the driver of the pickup tells some other dudes (known as \\"the guzzlers\\"), about the two girls. Tack, one of the guzzlers, walks away from the others, obviously on some sort of mission.

They're looking to party, but there isn't much going on. As if to emphasize the point, Joe's 8-track copy of \\"Hocus Pocus\\" by Focus is eaten by the tape deck.

People were embracing a bohemian lifestyle and the Hippie Movement was born.  To get the look that the hippies created, start thinking about theatrical costumes, recycled clothing, ethnic fashions, Indian prints, bright colors and mismatched patterns. Check out your nearest resale shop to look for vintage clothes and other items that you can repurpose, just like hippies did. Paisley prints and psychedelic prints are also great choices. You can’t go wrong by pairing those two elements together.  Jeans came in all colors of the rainbow and often featured embroidery or appliqued designs. Keep an eye out for those details or add them yourself.  Look for blouses with long and flowy \\"bubble\\" sleeves. Gauzy fabrics work great, too. Wear a simple chiffon baby-doll dress with spaghetti-straps for a feminine look. Hippies frequently went barefoot, but sandals and flip-flops were also popular. If you have boots or clogs, those will also work perfectly. You could have fun with fresh flowers, but fake ones will work. Daisies were especially popular and they were often worn instead of jewelry. Weave the flowers flowers into your hair and secure them with bobby pins. Try a simple braid adorned with flowers or weave them into a wreath to wear on your head like a crown. Gypsy scarves, flower headbands, and leather moccasins are all great options. Peace sign pendants, beaded jewelry, large rings, and chain belts will also work. You could also try stacked silver bangles, woven leather bracelets, and hooped earrings. Thrift stores will be gold mines for these items. There was a wide variety of hairstyles in the 1960s, the most iconic being the very long, natural looking style that the hippies wore. Part it down the middle and allow it to hang loose and free. If you don’t have long hair, check out wigs at your local costume shop. The beehive hairstyle was also very stylish. The hippies usually went for a natural look and wore very little makeup. They did use face paint, however, especially for special events and festivals. Paint images of daisies, rainbows, and peace signs on your cheeks or forehead. Add some face glitter for a little sparkle.  For those that did wear makeup, it was variable. However a pale mouth, large false eye lashes and exaggerated eye makeup will be instantly recognizable. For real life references of 60s makeup and hairstyles, look up pictures of icons like Twiggy, Brigitte Bardot, Janis Joplin, Edie Sedgewick, Jane Birkin and Marianne Faithfull. Summary:","output":"This article talks about the 1960s, a time of big changes in how people dressed and lived. The Hippie Movement started then, and people wore very colorful clothes with fun patterns. They shopped for old clothes and reused them. They liked wearing jeans, flowy shirts, and simple dresses. For shoes, they wore sandals, flip-flops, or boots. Instead of jewelry, they liked wearing flowers in their hair. Peace signs and beads were popular too.  People had many different hairstyles, like long hippie hair or the stylish beehive. They didn't wear much makeup, except sometimes face paint with fun symbols like daisies or rainbows. Famous people from that time, like Twiggy and Janis Joplin, can give you ideas on how people dressed and looked in the 1960s."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:This article: The village government is led by a mayor and four trustees, all unpaid officials elected at-large for two-year terms. The current mayor is Steven A. Vescio, elected in 2019. A full-time, appointed village manager handles day-to-day community affairs; the first was Max Vogel in 1967. Briarcliff Manor's government operates from the village hall, which houses the Justice Court and offices of the mayor and village manager. As of February 2014, there are 5,531 registered voters in Briarcliff Manor. As of 2017 the village's government employed 69 people full-time, including their building department, planning board, department of public works, the recreation department, the police department, the architectural review advisory committee, and the conservation advisory council. The village government administered a 2017–18 operating budget of approximately 28 million which predominantly went towards public works, police protection, debt service, and recreational facilities and services.Briarcliff Manor maintains a voting custom that dates to at least around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and has been described as an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into a formality. The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.In the Westchester County Board of Legislators, the western portion of Briarcliff Manor (in Ossining) is... contains an answer for the question: Of what town is Steven A.

Write a summary based on this article: There are two groups of people that are excited about the new CNN/WMUR poll of Democrats in New Hampshire: Bernie Sanders fans and political pundits.      Both are excited because this poll is a doozy of the blink-twice, ask-a-co-worker-if-you're-reading-the-numbers-correctly variety. Since the last CNN/WMUR poll in December, Sanders's then-large lead of 10 points has inflated to 27 points -- the sort of margin of victory that makes it hard for campaign staff to feel a lot of motivation to get out of bed in the morning.      This is why Bernie Sanders's staff probably isn't excited about this bananas poll. They need to raise money and get voters to the polls in a few weeks, and if Sanders backers think that the guy is going to win by a landslide, it doesn't really make trundling off to a church basement in New Hampshire winter weather seem particularly urgent. Especially given that, as CNN reports, \\"the Vermont senator's support rests heavily on groups whose participation in New Hampshire primaries is less reliable -- notably younger voters and those who aren't registered Democrats.\\" Among registered Democrats, Clinton trails by 9 points. Among undeclared voters, who can vote in either primary, she trails by 45. If Sanders is up big because people who don't usually turn out are supporting him, and then there's not much impetus for them to turn out, that's not great news.      Except Sanders's lead here is so big that even that wouldn't matter if it were true. And the poll suggests an enormous amount of support for Sanders. His favorability ratings are over 90 percent in the state, which is basically where Michael Jordan's favorability ratings would have been in Chicago in 1993. Clinton's favorability ratings are good, but lower here than nationally and, obviously, nowhere close to Sanders.      (There are other details in the CNN/WMUR poll, such as that Clinton is the \\"least-trusted\\" candidate by a wide margin. In what's a two-person race which includes a guy who essentially has home field advantage versus someone much better-known, it's hard to know how useful that is as a metric.)      We'd seen big leads in polls before, often linked to methodology. But this poll is different. You can see how it dramatically shifts the polling average in New Hampshire, as calculated by Real Clear Politics. Sanders is now over 50 percent support on average which, needless to say, is good news for him.      But is this an outlier? It is a sign of a quickly shifting race? Is it sampling the wrong people? Is it dead-on? It's almost impossible to say. The only thing we can say with certainty is that nearly everyone hopes it's wrong except those of us who like it when interesting and unexpected things happen in politics and those of you who are excited about the prospect of President Bernie Sanders. ||||| Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders chat following the Democratic Candidates Debate hosted by NBC News and YouTube on Jan. 17, 2016 in Charleston, South Carolina.

T Andrew Burton—Getty Images      Bernie Sanders is gaining on Hillary Clinton nationally, but she maintains a large lead, according to a recent poll .      A Monmouth University poll released Tuesday shows that Clinton's lead over Sanders has dropped below 20 points. Clinton has the support of 52% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters across the country, while Sanders gets 37% support, which is up from 26% in December.      Since then, Clinton's support has dropped among almost all of the major groups of Democratic voters. Her numbers among liberals inverted, going from a 57%-31% margin of support over Sanders in December to a deficit of 42%-51%. Support among women for Clinton has also declined, dropping to a smaller advantage now of 54%-35% over Sanders.      Politics Newsletter Sign up to receive the day’s top political stories. View Sample SIGN UP NOW      “With a shrinking margin, a strong showing by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could cut Clinton’s national lead even more. However, he would still have to overcome Clinton’s demographic advantage in the ensuing contests,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth poll. “Sanders is aided by the fact that most Super Tuesday contests are open to independent voters – a group where he performs well. On the other hand, about two-thirds of the pledged delegates awarded on March 1 will be from states where black and Latino voters comprise anywhere from one-third to a majority of the electorate. It looks like the demographic dynamic that hurt Clinton in 2008 may be what helps her in 2016.”      Where Clinton still holds a considerable advantage is with voters over the age of 50 and minorities. Older voters substantially favored Clinton to Sanders by a margin of 64% to 24%. Clinton's lead over Sanders with black and Latino voters remains solid and is growing, now standing at a 71%-21% margin, which is a 10 point increase for Clinton since December.      The Monmouth University poll was conducted by telephone from Jan. 15-18 with 1003 participating adults. Some 352 registered voters who identified as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party were used here, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.2%. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The new poll, mostly conducted before Sunday night's debate, found Sanders' support has grown by 10 points since a late-November/early December CNN/WMUR poll , which found Sanders holding 50% to Clinton's 40%.      New Hampshire Democrats' views on the race are solidifying as well, with 52% saying they have definitely decided who they will support, up from 36% who felt that way in early December. Among those voters, Sanders holds an even broader 64% to 35% lead.      But the Vermont senator's support rests heavily on groups whose participation in New Hampshire primaries is less reliable -- notably younger voters and those who aren't registered Democrats.      There are some signs in the poll that the increasingly contested Democratic race is gaining attention among the state's undeclared voters, who are not registered as members of any party and are able to choose which party's primary they will participate in. In the December poll, 38% of undeclared voters who said they planned to vote said they would likely participate in the Democratic primary, a figure that is up to 48% in the new poll.      Those undeclared voters are critical to Sanders' support: 70% in the new poll say they plan to vote for him, 25% Clinton. Among registered Democrats, it's 50% Sanders to 41% Clinton. Still, that represents an increase for Sanders among registered Democrats. The December poll found him trailing Clinton, 47% to 40%, among that group.      Sanders' rise in the poll comes as New Hampshire voters' focus on national security has faded.      The previous poll -- conducted in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Paris and as the attack in San Bernardino, California, unfolded -- found 23% of likely Democratic voters calling foreign policy and national security their top issue. That faded to 13% in the new poll, while the share naming the economy and jobs their top priority has climbed from 18% to 26%.      On the economy, New Hampshire voters now clearly give Sanders the edge over Clinton as the candidate more trusted to handle it: 57% say Sanders would best handle it vs. 33% for Clinton.      That's a massive shift since last summer, just as Sanders' campaign began to gain traction. In that poll, 37% said they preferred Clinton on the economy, 28% Sanders, and 22% were unsure which candidate would best handle that issue. In the new poll, Clinton maintains a broad lead over Sanders as the more trusted candidate when it comes to ISIS, 55% Clinton to 26% Sanders, about the same as in early December.      Sanders also has astonishingly high favorability ratings among those likely to vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, and is broadly seen as the candidate with the \\"personal characteristics and qualities that you think a president should have.\\"      Overall, 91% say they have a favorable view of Sanders, while just 2% have an unfavorable opinion. That's improved since December, when 83% had a positive take on the neighboring state's senator. Almost 6-in-10 say they see Sanders as the more presidential candidate in the field, compared to 33% for Clinton.      While Clinton is also viewed positively, her numbers lag well behind Sanders' ratings, with 65% saying they have a favorable impression of the former secretary of state. The poll suggests Clinton continues to be dogged by questions about her honesty, with the share saying she is the least honest in the field now at 55%, up from 46% in December.      The CNN/WMUR poll was conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center by telephone from January 13-18. The poll includes interviews with a random sample of 927 adult residents of New Hampshire, including 420 who say they plan to vote in the Democratic presidential primary. For results among the sample of likely Democratic primary voters, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points. |||||","output":"The latest CNN/WMUR poll has revealed that Bernie Sanders has taken a significant lead over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race, with Sanders now holding a 27-point lead over Clinton in New Hampshire.

The poll also reveals that Clinton is now the \\"least-trusted\\" candidate by a wide margin, showing dropping support in major groups of her previous core supporters. Whilst Sanders' campaign continues to grow strength, there have already been warning signs in terms of voter turnout. The polls show that the Vermont Senator's support relies heavily on those voters whose participation in the New Hampshire primaries is less reliable, for example younger voters, and those who are not registered Democrats.

Movie title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\". One day, Mickey picks up Heather in his cab and goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him... A:","output":"In the movie \\"She's the One,\\" the character who used to be a prostitute is Heather, played by Cameron Diaz. Heather is an important character in the film as she has connections with both Fitzpatrick brothers. Initially, she was engaged to Mickey (Edward Burns) but committed an act of infidelity that led to their separation. Later, she becomes the mistress of Francis (Mike McGlone), Mickey's brother, who is married to Renee (Jennifer Aniston). Heather's past as a prostitute plays a role in the complex relationships and emotional turmoil among the characters in the movie. The film explores themes of love, loyalty, family, and betrayal, set against the backdrop of Irish Catholic family values and contemporary New York City life. Each character is facing their own relational struggles, with Mickey trying to navigate life after his impulsive marriage to Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student. On the other hand, Francis deals with the consequences of his infidelity, as his wife seeks answers for his lack of interest in her. The movie highlights the brothers' contrasting approaches to life and love. Mickey is portrayed as a relatable, working-class individual who is somewhat disillusioned by his past, but his impulsive nature drives him to take risks in search of happiness. Francis, in contrast, is a white-collar stock investor who represents a more calculating and selfish approach to life. His extramarital affair with Heather stems from his arrogance and unwillingness to be emotionally committed to his marriage. To decide whether it's worth investing in this film proposal, consider the potential for the movie to captivate audiences with its exploration of complex relationships, family drama, and the search for happiness in the midst of moral dilemmas. The movie's mix of a strong cast, including well-known actors such as Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz, and Edward Burns, along with its unique blend of comedy and drama, offers a compelling narrative that could resonate with viewers. Additionally, assess the credentials of the people involved in the project, including the director, producer, and screenwriter, to determine if they have a track record of creating successful films. Evaluating the potential success of \\"She's the One\\" should also include researching the current market for similar films, exploring distribution channels, and estimating production budgets to ensure a solid return on investment."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Starting with the first statement made by M, we learn that Bob is supposed to arrive by 8:00. This means that his scheduled or expected arrival time is 8:00.  The second statement made by W provides more context about Bob's departure time and a revised expectation for his arrival. According to W, Bob's wife said he left home at 7:50. W then deduces that he won't arrive before 8:30. This detail about the possibility of a later arrival time does not change the original expectation about when Bob is supposed to arrive; it simply indicates that he may not arrive on time. To answer the given question, we must focus on the specific time that Bob was supposed to arrive, as mentioned in the dialogue. Considering the information provided by both speakers, we conclude that: A: The time Bob is supposed to arrive is 8:00."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the below context:  In 1905, Dinah Sheldon, an enthusiastic art student, is expelled from Miss Ingram's Seminary for wearing two petticoats instead of five, attending political rallies and insisting that she be allowed to study nudes. When she is sent home to Baltimore, Dinah's understanding father, Dr. Andrew Sheldon, an Episcopalian pastor, easily forgives his headstrong daughter this latest calamity, but her mother Lily encourages her to be more conventionally feminine. Dinah's childhood sweetheart, Tom Wade, also believes that she should settle down and confesses that, since her absence, he has begun dating the more \\"continental\\" Bernice Eckert.  Dinah feigns indifference to Bernice, telling Tom that her only ambition is to study art in Paris, and he agrees to help her fulfill her dream. When Dinah is arrested during a brawl in a public park, which starts after four loafers begin arguing over one of her paintings, the overworked Tom is asked to provide bail for all five. Out of gratitude, Dinah offers to write a speech for Tom on equality, which he is scheduled to deliver the next night at the Forum Society's Spring Dance. While preparing the speech, which is a modified version of one of her own debates, Dinah learns that her exit from jail was witnessed by two women, who then relayed the information to Dan Fletcher, Andrew's Scottish vestryman. Dan is upset by the scandal because Andrew has just become a candidate for the new bishop's post, and suggests that he punish Dinah.  Instead, the less ambitious Andrew encourages Dinah's dreams by confessing that, as a youth, he had a short career as a ballroom dancer but gave it up to protect his father's reputation. That night, Dinah shows up late at the Forum Society, and Tom is forced to read her speech cold.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Last weekend a Texas couple apparently discovered that the electronic \\"baby monitor\\" in their children's bedroom had been hacked.  According to a local TV station, the couple said they heard an unfamiliar voice coming from the room, went to investigate and found that someone had taken control of the camera monitor remotely and was shouting profanity-laden abuse. The child's father unplugged the monitor. What does this mean for the rest of us? How secure are consumer electronic systems, now that they're all attached to the Internet? The answer is not very, and it's been this bad for many years. Security vulnerabilities have been found in all types of webcams, cameras of all sorts, implanted medical devices, cars, and even smart toilets -- not to mention yachts, ATM machines, industrial control systems and military drones. All of these things have long been hackable. Those of us who work in security are often amazed that most people don't know about it. Why are they hackable? Because security is very hard to get right. It takes expertise, and it takes time. Most companies don't care because most customers buying security systems and smart appliances don't know enough to care. Why should a baby monitor manufacturer spend all sorts of money making sure its security is good when the average customer won't even notice? Five scary hacks. Even worse, that consumer will look at two competing baby monitors -- a more expensive one with better security, and a cheaper one with minimal security -- and buy the cheaper. Without the expertise to make an informed buying decision, cheaper wins. A lot of hacks happen because the users don't configure or install their devices properly, but that's really the fault of the manufacturer. These are supposed to be consumer devices, not specialized equipment for security experts only. This sort of thing is true in other aspects of society, and we have a variety of mechanisms to deal with it. Government regulation is one of them. For example, few of us can differentiate real pharmaceuticals from snake oil, so the FDA regulates what can be sold and what sorts of claims vendors can make. Independent product testing is another. You and I might not be able to tell a well-made car from a poorly-made one at a glance, but we can both read the reports from a variety of testing agencies. 'Smart homes' are vulnerable, say hackers. Computer security has resisted these mechanisms, both because the industry changes so quickly and because this sort of testing is hard and expensive. But the effect is that we're all being sold a lot of insecure consumer products with embedded computers. And as these computers get connected to the Internet, the problems will get worse. The moral here isn't that your baby monitor could be hacked. The moral is that pretty much every \\"smart\\" everything can be hacked, and because consumers don't care, the market won't fix the problem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Recently, a couple in Texas found out that their baby monitor was hacked and someone was controlling it from outside. This shows that electronic systems connected to the internet, like cameras, smart appliances, and even cars, can also be hacked because their security is not very strong. Most companies don't spend a lot on good security because most people buying these things don't know how important security is. To help protect these devices, there could be government rules or special testing, like how we have rules and tests for medicines and cars. Until that happens, many \\"smart\\" devices will not be very safe from hackers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C.  and a hint : The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz.

With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules. Question: What is the average lifespan for someone with cerebral palsy? === The answer to the above question is The answer is:","output":"The average lifespan for someone with cerebral palsy can vary significantly depending on the severity of the condition and the presence of other health issues. Some individuals with milder forms of cerebral palsy may have a normal life expectancy, while others with more severe disabilities may have a reduced life expectancy.

Some people say it's a big puzzle because it's hard to understand what's going on. 2. Some people find it funny, even though it's not supposed to be a comedy. That's because some parts are just so silly or strange.  3. The acting is a bit like watching a school play. They say stuff and do things that real people wouldn't, which can make it more confusing but also funny. 4. The story doesn't always make sense, like trying to read a book with pages missing. This is another reason some people like to laugh at it. 5. Even though there's a lot wrong with it and it can be very confusing, the movie has become very popular.

Sentence 1: The advantage of recognizing the approach as an application of case study methods is that some aspects of the method-such as the close yoking of data collection and analysis-that may not be widely used now could be applied in a way that increases timeliness without reducing quality. Sentence 2: There is no advantage to this approach. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The two sentences present opposing views on the advantage of recognizing an approach as an application of case study methods. To assess whether the second sentence is true in the context of the first sentence being true, it is necessary to analyze the claims made in the first sentence and compare them with the statement made in the second sentence. First, let's break down the claims made in the first sentence: 1. Recognizing an approach as an application of case study methods has advantages. 2. Some aspects of the method, such as the close yoking of data collection and analysis, may not be widely used currently. 3. Applying these aspects in a way that increases timeliness without reducing quality could be advantageous. The first sentence suggests that there are benefits to applying case study methods to a particular approach, particularly by encompassing some methodological aspects that may not be widely used. The primary advantage mentioned here is the potential to increase timeliness without sacrificing quality. Now let's analyze the statement made in the second sentence: \\"There is no advantage to this approach.\\" This sentence directly challenges the claims made in the first sentence, stating that there are no benefits to the approach being discussed. Now, considering the question of whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we can conclude that the two sentences are contradictory. If the first sentence is true and there are advantages to recognizing an approach as an application of case study methods, then the second sentence, which claims that there are no advantages, cannot also be true. The two sentences convey opposite opinions on the advantages of the specific approach, making it impossible for both to be simultaneously true. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence cannot be true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Inigo Lopez de Loyola (sometimes erroneously called Inigo Lopez de Recalde) was born in the municipality of Azpeitia at the castle of Loyola in today's Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Spain. He was baptized Inigo, after St. Enecus (Innicus) (Basque: Eneko; Spanish: Inigo) Abbot of Ona, a medieval Basque name which perhaps means \\"My little one\\". It is not clear when he began using the Latin name \\"Ignatius\\" instead of his baptismal name \\"Inigo\\". It seems he did not intend to change his name, but rather adopted a name which he believed was a simple variant of his own, for use in France and Italy where it was better understood. In 1539, with Saint Peter Faber and Saint Francis Xavier, Ignatius formed the Society of Jesus, which was approved in 1540 by Pope Paul III. Ignatius was chosen as the first Superior General of the order and invested with the title of Father General by the Jesuits.  Ignatius sent his companions as missionaries around Europe to create schools, colleges, and seminaries. Juan de Vega, the ambassador of Charles V at Rome, met Ignatius there. Esteeming Ignatius and the Jesuits, when Vega was appointed Viceroy of Sicily, he brought Jesuits with him. A Jesuit college was opened at Messina, which proved a success, and its rules and methods were afterwards copied in other colleges.  In 1548 Ignatius was briefly brought before the Roman Inquisition for examination of his book of Spiritual Exercises. But he was released and the book was finally given papal permission to be printed. It was published in a format such that the exercises were designed to be carried out over a period of 28-30 days.  Ignatius, along with the help of his personal secretary Juan Alfonso de Polanco wrote the Jesuit Constitutions, adopted in 1553. It created a centralized organization for the order, and stressed absolute self-denial and obedience to the Pope and to superiors in the Church hierarchy, using the motto perinde ac cadaver - \\"as if a dead body\\", i.e. that the good Jesuit should be as well-disciplined as a corpse. But his main principle became the Jesuit motto: Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (\\"for the greater glory of God\\").  During the years 1553-1555, Ignatius dictated his autobiography to his secretary, Father Goncalves da Camara. This autobiography (\\"Autobiografia de San Ignacio de Loyola\\" in Wikisource in Spanish) is a valuable key for understanding his Spiritual Exercises. It was kept in the archives of the Jesuit order for about 150 years, until the Bollandists published the text in Acta Sanctorum.

Summarize this article: The seven women and five men who found Casey Anthony not guilty of the murder of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee declined to discuss the verdict that stunned court watchers.      Judge Belvin Perry, who presided over the trial, ordered that the jurors' names be barred from being made public until further notice.      \\"We are not releasing their names at this time. They are asking you to respect their privacy,\\" Karen Levey, the director of due process services for the Orange County circuit court, told a swarm of reporters waiting to hear from the jurors. \\"They are just not interested...a universal, unequivocal no.\\"      Levey said that Orange County sheriff officers would be transporting the 12 jurors back to their hotel, where they have been sequestered for more than six weeks. The five alternate jurors also declined to speak publicly about the case.      Casey Anthony, who faced the possibility of the death penalty, was found not guilty of murdering Caylee. The jury declined to convict her of either first degree murder or aggravated manslaughter of a child.      The jurors found Anthony, 25, guilty on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement, which are misdemeanors. It's possible she could be released from prison later this week.      The jury has been a serious group with some taking notes, others focused with laser-like intensity throughout testimony which has ranged from the dramatic to the tedious.      Due to the intense media coverage of the crime in the Orlando area over the last three years, the jurors were selected from a pool in nearby Pinellas County in early May, and bused to Orlando for the duration of the trial. They have been sequestered and living out of an Orlando hotel since the trial began more than a month ago on May 20.      Updated evidence photos from the Casey Anthony murder trial      They range from a History Channel buff, to a tech savvy IT employee, to a woman who doesn't own a computer or even cable TV.      Updated Evidence Photos of Casey Anthony Murder Trial      A few admitted before the trial began that they were leaning towards guilty, but said they would keep an open mind. At least three are mothers, and one has two children who are Casey Anthony's age.      In addition to the dozen jurors who will decide Casey Anthony's fate, there are three men and two women alternatives, but surprisingly none of the juors have dropped out despite the lengthy trial and the sequestered conditions.      The profile of the jury was compiled from voir dire interviews during jury selection.      Juror #1 The 65-year-old woman is a retired nurse and volunteer counselor. She is married with two grown children, and her medical background may give her a better understanding of the scientific evidence. In particular, she's familiar with the smell of decomposing bodies. \\"I value life\\" she said while discussing the death penalty. \\"I also value the criminal justice system.\\" Throughout the trial, she has stayed focused on the testimony, rarely scanning around the courtroom.      Juror #2 A black male in his mid-30s, this juror works in IT, which might make him a good resource when the jury has to discuss computer searches. He is married with two children under 10. He said he was raised by a single mom \\"like Casey.\\" He knows about the case, but told the court, \\"If I had to return a verdict right now, I would say not guilty.\\" He admits to some misgivings about the death penalty. \\"God is the one who makes the final judgment,\\" he said, adding that he could vote for it \\"if I really believe it needs to be done.\\"      Juror #3 This 32-year-old nursing student at St. Petersburg College has the least prior knowledge of the case. \\"I know my ignorance works in my favor at this point,\\" she chirped, admitting she would like to serve on the jury. Now that she's on the jury, she often wears a perturbed look while listening to testimony. A weaver in her spare time, she has no children of her own, but has a pet rat terrier.      Juror #4 Court watchers were surprised when this potential defense-leaning juror made the panel. She is deeply religious and told the court, \\"I don't like to judge people\\" and \\"I just don't like to point my finger at anyone.\\" She said she \\"thinks\\" she can impose the death penalty. A black woman in her 40's, she has no children and lives alone. She wrote occasional notes early on, but her note-taking pace seems to have increased as the trial nears its conclusion. Her face betrays nothing of her reaction to the case so far.      Juror #5 With her long grey hair, glasses and a generally stern look about her, this 57-year old white woman constantly looks across the room in the direction of Casey Anthony and her lawyers. A retired nurse's aide, she has three children and is the only juror with a criminal record (a 1998 DUI arrest). Her stance on the death penalty is measured: \\"I guess I believe in the death penalty? I'd have to know a lot of facts before I really considered it.\\"      Juror #6 The 33-year-old restaurant equipment salesman is married with two children (ages 6 and 21 months). He earned a business degree from the University of Florida and is an avid chef who has twice cooked on television. In voir dire, he said the understood Casey Anthony's defense has no need to prove anything, and wouldn't hold it against her if she didn't testify. He also said he'd have no trouble imposing a death sentence. \\"If the law dictated it, I would be able to follow it,\\" he said. In court, he looks relaxed and attentive, although he rarely takes a note these days.      Juror #7 Professing \\"just some, not a lot\\" of knowledge of the case, the 41-year-old white female divorcee said she would be able to send Casey Anthony to death if the facts warranted. \\"It would be, gosh, a solemn decision,\\" she said. She is a victim of crime herself, having suffered a home invasion by a knife-wielding intruder, but was not injured. The intruder was later arrested and pleaded guilty. Her father was an attorney. She sits up straight in her jury seat, facing the witness box ? and never seems to look out at the gallery.      Juror #8 The daughter of a New Jersey police officer, this 55-year-old Verizon service representative has two sons in their 20s, the same age as Casey Anthony. Neither of her sons has had any legal trouble, but said \\"sometimes they're not angels. Being a mother, I would want someone to take all the facts\\" if they ever had to stand trial. Given the right set of facts, \\"I have no problem voting for the death penalty.\\" Like juror #7, she sits turned toward the witness, but has slouchier posture.      Juror #9 Perhaps the most attentive juror of them all, this 53-year-old former logger from Indiana watches the proceedings with a fervor befitting a man who watches PBS and the History Channel in his spare time. His nephew is a deputy in Manatee County, but he's not necessarily a pro-prosecution juror. \\"Our system is that you are innocent until you are proven guilty,\\" he told the court. \\"I believe in that.\\" He is perky and friendly. He often smiles at the deputies.      Juror #10 The panel's second Verizon employee, a 57-year-old male retention specialist, has never married and has no children. In court, he's inscrutable, focused on the proceedings, rarely glancing elsewhere. In voir dire, he claimed to enjoy reading, but hadn't kept up with the case. \\"I don't really know any of the details, and I do believe everyone is innocent until proven guilty,\\" he said. He once trained to be a corrections officer, but never applied for a job in the field. He's had familial legal troubles himself: his sister and her boyfriend committed a violent crime against his father.      Juror #11 This single 33-year-old high school gym teacher reminds many in the gallery of Johnny Depp and Matt LeBlanc. During compelling testimony, he leans forward to the edge of his seat, knees apart, elbows on knees, with his hands clasped. He was selected for the jury even though he had \\"formed an opinion of guilt\\" because he said he could set it aside and \\"keep my mind open.\\" He characterized the death penalty as \\"a necessary option.\\" This juror seems to have a voracious curiosity for everything in court ? especially the gallery and balcony, which he often scans during the numerous sidebars.      Juror #12 \\"Not a modernized person\\" is how this 60-something mother of two adult children (and one grandchild) described herself in voir dire. She doesn't own a computer, doesn't have cable TV and is \\"not that into\\" newspapers. Unsurprisingly, she had little knowledge of the case before these proceedings, although she did hear about it when news first broke. She works part-time as a cook at Publix supermarket and enjoys legal dramas. Asked for a number to represent her support of the death penalty, she stated, \\"the highest number, 10.\\" In court, she has a laser focus on the testimony before her. ||||| The verdict in the State of Florida vs. Casey Anthony murder trial coincided with a spike in online news traffic.

In this final, Liverpool played against Tottenham Hotspur, another English football club. The match took place at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, Spain. The 2018-2019 UEFA Champions League season had seen Liverpool advance all the way to the final after successfully navigating through various group stage matches, a round of 16, quarterfinal, and semifinal contests. In the final, Liverpool secured their victory with a score of 2-0 against Tottenham Hotspur. The goals were scored by Mohamed Salah, who scored a penalty in the 2nd minute, and Divock Origi, who sealed the win with a goal in the 87th minute. This victory marked Liverpool's sixth European Cup/Champions League title (previously winning 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, and 2005). Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager at the time, finally claimed his first Champions League trophy after previously losing two finals with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and Liverpool in 2018.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. The trouble is that when we are at work we are terribly unproductive; we produce less per hour than our main economic rivals. The difference is pretty dramatic, we produce on average 30% less per hour than workers in Germany, the US and France - we even produce 10% less than the average Italian. Leaving aside the fact that those bare statistics should undermine any stereotypes we have about Italian or French workers, they really matter because the more productive we are, the more money we can earn, as individuals and as a country. Professor John Van Reenen, head of the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE, makes the point rather graphically: \\"By Thursday lunchtime the other countries have produced as much as it takes us to produce by Friday afternoon when we knock off work. \\"So basically we could take every Friday off if we could be as productive as those other countries and earn the same amount of money.\\" I don't know about you, but I think taking every Friday off is quite appealing, another way of looking at it is we keep working the same hours and increase our wages by 30%. But the big question is: why exactly we are so unproductive? Economists have identified three main reasons. For a start, we do not invest enough - our companies don't spend enough on the latest technology or on research and development. For instance in Germany there are 1,034 R&D staff for every 100,000 people, in the UK there are 883. Nor do we have the best railways, roads and airports in the world.  We all know about the arguments over whether Heathrow should have a third runway or not, it has been going on for years, but Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris has had four runways for years. The second major factor is that our companies are not well managed, we are it seems a nation of David Brents - the self satisfied but useless office manager in the sitcom The Office. Bad management alone accounts for a quarter of the difference between our productivity and our rivals'. There are plenty of internationally successful and cutting edge companies in the UK, but they are outnumbered by a long tail of businesses with pretty mediocre managers. In particular, family owned and run businesses seem to be badly managed. In a sense this is fairly obvious, after all what are the chances that the best person to run a business should just happen to be the eldest son of the last manager? As Warren Buffet once put it: \\"Would anyone say the best way to pick a championship Olympic team is to select the sons and daughters of those who won 20 years ago? Giving someone a favoured position just because his old man accomplished something is a crazy way for a society to compete.\\" In Germany where there is a even larger section of small and medium sized family owned businesses, the so called Mittelstand, they tend to be run by professional managers. The final point is that not only are our workers poorly managed, they are also in comparison with many of our rivals, poorly educated and poorly trained as well. This explains why French or US workers get more from the equipment they use than British ones. BMW's mini plant in Oxford apparently struggles to find qualified operators for its machinery and attempts to improve their training with internal qualifications have failed to close that gap. Of course, some companies do invest heavily and are well managed but they still have to wrestle with skills shortages and bad infrastructure. Jaguar Land Rover has had billions poured into it since it was taken over by Tata Motors. But JLR is still not as competitive as its continental rivals says Professor Lord Bhattacharyya, head of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, part of Warwick University: \\"Productivity is not just about the amount of money they spend on R&D or technology. One of the most modern plants is engine manufacturing at Wolverhampton. A state-of-the-art facility, but they are still not as competitive as German engine plants.\\" Lord Bhattacharyya blames low skills and bad infrastructure as well as the fact that nearly all the key component suppliers are now based outside the UK. It all points to a worrying problem, to really deal with low productivity we will have to improve education, skills, investment, infrastructure and management. Just solving one or two factors is probably not going to be enough. It seems we might just have to get used to those long hours.","output":"UK workers are 30% less productive per hour than those in Germany, the US and France, and 10% less productive than Italians, which can be attributed to underinvestment in technology and infrastructure, poor management and lower levels of education and training among employees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Open Letter to an Editor I had an interesting conversation with a reporter recently -- one who works for you. In fact, he's one of your best reporters. He wants to leave. Your reporter gave me a copy of his resume   and photocopies of six stories that he wrote for you. The headlines showed you played them proudly. With great enthusiasm, he talked about how he finds issues, approaches them, and writes about them, which tells me he is one of your best. I'm sure you would hate to lose him. Surprisingly, your reporter is not unhappy. In fact, he told me he really likes his job. He has a great assignment  , and said you run a great paper. It would be easy for you to keep him, he said. He knows that the paper values him. He appreciates the responsibility you've given him, takes ownership of his profession, and enjoys his freedom. So why is he looking for a way out? He talked to me because he wants his editors to demand so much more of him. He wants to be pushed, challenged, coached to new heights. The reporter believes that good stories spring from good questions, but his editors usually ask how long the story will be, when it will be in, where it can play, and what the budget is. He longs for conversations with an editor who will help him turn his good ideas into great ones. He wants someone to get excited about what he's doing and to help him , exploring the best ways to report it. He wants to be more valuable for your paper. That's what you want for him, too, isn't it? So your reporter has set me thinking. Our best hope in keeping our best reporters, copy editors, photographers, artists -- everyone -- is to work harder to make sure they get the help they are demanding to reach their potential. If we can't do it, they'll find someone who can.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Choices: A). no. B). yes.","output":"These two questions ultimately address different situations and emotions, so the answer is A). No, they do not have the same meaning. However, they do share a common thread of concern for other people's well-being. I will break down each question to provide a clearer understanding. 1) \\"I hate my dad. Should I feel bad if he loses his job?\\" In this question, it appears that you have strong negative feelings toward your father. Your emotions may be affecting your sense of empathy and creating a struggle within yourself over whether you should feel bad if your dad loses his job. Losing a job can be a difficult and stressful experience for anyone, regardless of your relationship with them.  It is important to consider why you may have these destructive emotions towards your father – whether it's a result of past negative interactions or experiences. To resolve this internal conflict, you may want to explore these feelings further and attempt to empathize with your dad's situation. You do not necessarily have to feel overly emotional or provide support immediately after losing his job, but it may be valuable to view him and his situation with a sense of understanding and empathy. 2) \\"Should I contact my ex about losing his job? Multiple people have contacted me about checking on him, but I don't think it is my place. I care about his general well-being, but he pushed me out of his life, so I don't feel like it's my responsibility anymore to make sure he is okay. Am I being selfish?\\" In this question, you seem to be in a dilemma about whether it is appropriate or your responsibility to reach out to your ex-partner who has recently lost his job. It is clear that you still care about him and his well-being to some extent, but his actions, such as pushing you away, have led you to believe that it may not be your place to check up on him. Striking a balance between showing concern and respecting the boundaries of a past relationship can be difficult. It is common to feel torn between wanting to help someone but not wanting to overstep.  Considering the context, it would not be selfish to choose not to reach out to your ex, especially if he has made it clear that he wants distance between the two of you. However, it could be helpful to express your concern to one of the mutual friends or people who contacted you, so they can relay the message or provide him with support. This way, you are acknowledging your ex's feelings and situation but also respecting the boundaries of your past relationship. In conclusion, both questions touch upon the theme of concern for another person's well-being, but they address different situations and emotional contexts. Recognizing the unique circumstances and relationships that influence each question will provide a deeper understanding of your feelings and help you make informed decisions that align with your values and personal boundaries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? Pick your answer from: i. drumlin. ii. delta. iii. glacier. iv. moraine.","output":"The correct answer to the question is iii. glacier. A glacier is characterized as a persistent mass of moving ice and snow. This vast and dense accumulation primarily forms where the snowfall in an area outweighingly surpasses its melting, subsequently compressing over many years to create large, thickened ice masses. With the sheer weight of that dense ice mass and the influence of gravity, the glacier slowly moves or flows – much like a very slow river – shaping the Earth's surface in a multitude of ways as it moves. Glaciers are found in mountain ranges of every continent except Australia, although they are rapidly melting due to global warming. They are also found in the polar regions where temperatures remain low. Glaciers play a crucial role in fresh water storage; nearly 70% of the world's fresh water is held in glaciers. To clarify the other choices: A drumlin (i) is a oval-shaped hill, often found in groups, that is made up of glacial till. Till is the sediment left behind by a moving glacier. The presence of drumlins indicates a past glacial activity.  A delta (ii) is a landform that forms at the mouth of a river where the river flows into an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, or reservoir. Deltas are formed from the sediment carried by the river and deposited at the mouth of the river.  A moraine (iv) is accumulated debris (like soil and rock) directly deposited on the ground by a glacier. It's another landform that shows the historical path of a glacier, but this isn't the same as a large buildup of moving ice and snow.  So, amongst the given options, a glacier fits the definition of a large buildup of moving ice and snow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","output":"Hermann Scheer, born on April 29, 1944, and died on October 14, 2010, was a notable figure in German politics and global renewable energy efforts. This biography emphasizes several key aspects of Scheer's life and career which provide valuable insight into his beliefs, accomplishments, and contributions.  In terms of his political career, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party serving in the German Bundestag, which is the German federal parliament. This indicates that Scheer was not only politically active but also held a significant position within one of Germany’s largest political parties. His party affiliation also suggests that he likely supported principles of social democracy such as social justice, human rights, and economic fairness. Scheer's significant roles within renewable energy organizations are also highlighted in this biography. As the president of EUROSOLAR, the European Association for Renewable Energy, and general chairman of the World Council for Renewable Energy, Scheer held important leadership positions in major organizations in the field of renewable energy. These roles demonstrate his influence in promoting renewable energy at both regional and global levels. The fact that Scheer was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1999 for his work in promoting solar energy worldwide signifies that his commitment to renewable energy and sustainable development was widely recognized and appreciated. This distinguishes Scheer as a leading advocate for renewable energy. Furthermore, Scheer's strong belief in the potential of renewable energy as the key solution to various environmental, social, economic, and political challenges is strongly highlighted. He believed that the current patterns of energy supply and usage are problematic, and renewable energy presents the only realistic alternative. He was convinced that solar radiation could feasibly replace conventional fossil and nuclear energy systems worldwide, which indicates his visionary and ambitious stance on renewable energy potential. Scheer's insight into the main challenges for shifting to a renewable energy economy is also of note. He identified political issues as the main barrier, rather than technical or economic limitations. This viewpoint underscores his understanding of the interconnectedness of politics and sustainable development. Notably, in 1999, Scheer was one of the initiators of the German feed-in tariffs, which significantly contributed to the rise of renewable energies in Germany in the subsequent years. This demonstrates Scheer's tangible policy influence in expanding renewable energy adoption in Germany."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. <sep>As of 2001 , how many attorneys where on full role and how much money would the hike generate?<sep>57,392 on the full roll- raise 1 million","output":"No"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison.

Write some highlights for the following article: TV's newest crime thriller, \\"The Bridge,\\" is taking viewers to a volatile place most have only seen on the news: The U.S.-Mexican border. FX goes beyond the headlines with a series that aims to give a new twist to the serial killer storyline by setting it against the backdrop of a tumultuous border town. Named after the Bridge of the Americas that connects El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the show explores the real-world tensions along the border through the story of two detective agents -- one from the United States and one from Mexico -- who must work together to hunt down a serial killer who is terrorizing citizens on both sides. The series is an adaptation of a Scandinavian drama called \\"Bron,\\" and is brought to life for the American audience by creators Meredith Stiehm (\\"ER,\\" and \\"Cold Case\\") and Elwood Reid (\\"Cold Case\\" and \\"Hawaii 5-0\\"). Like \\"Bron,\\" \\"The Bridge's\\" pilot episode opens with a gruesome murder and a body splayed in the middle of the bridge joining both nations. This time, however, the murder involves an American judge with anti-immigrant ties. El Paso detective Sonya Cross (Diane Kruger) and Chihuahua state police detective Marco Ruiz (Demian Bichir) form an unlikely pair of agents whose investigation and relationship examines the hot topic of immigration while shedding light on the varying cultural experiences of both border towns. The series also addresses the powerful drug cartels and rampant corruption plaguing Mexican police. Filmmaker Gerardo Naranjo, known for his critically-acclaimed drug trafficking film \\"Miss Bala,\\" directed the pilot episode and told CNN the drama's authentic take on the U.S.-Mexican border is what sets it apart from other productions. For example, the series embraces dialect as an important component of the story. Much like the real-life fluidity of language alongside the border, \\"The Bridge\\" incorporates Spanish when set in Ciudad Juarez and adds English subtitles. There is even the occasional use of a mix of both languages (aka Spanglish). Aside from being a Mexican national, Naranjo brought a wealth of border knowledge to the director's chair. He spent close to three years interviewing criminals and researching the conflict in preparation for 2011's \\"Miss Bala.\\" \\"We tried to be as honest as possible,\\" Naranjo said. \\"It is not about making Mexico look good or bad, it is about what is the truth. Many people who are ignorant of Mexican issues are going to learn about certain realities through our show.\\" At the New Generation Latino Consortium Media, Marketing and Entertainment Conference (NGLC) in early June, Bichir echoed the sentiment. \\"I had a conversation with my producers and writers and that was the first thing that got me hooked on it -- the promise of it being real,\\" he said. The show's premiere coincides with a real event currently brewing in Washington. With the passage of a bill in the U.S. Senate earlier in the month that aims to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, the immigration debate re-entered the public discourse. Crucial to the passage of the bill was an amendment to strengthen border security by adding 20,000 more border agents and 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico. \\"The Bridge's\\" setting alongside the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez border allows the show to seamlessly navigate between both the entertainment and political world. Given this political relevancy and the Latino undertones of the drama, FX took the opportunity to launch a hyper-targeted campaign in an effort to cater to the 48 million TV viewers Nielsen says identify as Latinos. \\"When we first starting thinking about the show, we knew we had a huge potential opportunity with the Hispanic audience,\\" Sally Daws, FX's senior vice president of marketing, told CNN. \\"We understand that the Hispanic market is huge, represented by many cultures and nations of origin. We did our best to utilize materials that spoke in a relevant way to that audience.\\" Naranjo hopes that \\"The Bridge's\\" ability to cross multiple borders of language and culture will help spark a national debate about not only the U.S.-Mexican border, but the commonalities shared between the characters -- regardless of their cultural background. 'The Bridge' is a great bet,\\" Naranjo said to CNN. \\"I hope that this show can begin a good type of controversy and a good conversation.\\" \\"The Bridge\\" premieres July 10 PM ET on FX.","output":"1. \\"The Bridge\\" is a new crime thriller series exploring the U.S.-Mexican border, going beyond just the headlines to offer a deeper look into this volatile area. 2.

This is a trio of tales, \\"Shakti\\", \\"Devi\\", and \\"Kali\\", about an experimental commune (or some such thing) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown, and left a bit of damage here and there, I'd say. Many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself. Shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed. Seems this woman is able to project some inner demon, or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter. Devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to \\"jump out of his skin\\". He's a skinhead, a speed freak, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune, which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the tale of a healer, who attempts to \\"heal\\" this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did it or if SHE loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer. All three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness. This has a sort of low-budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout, much to its credit. I watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares (and gore) came it hit pretty hard. I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot. A good little find, this one, I'd give it 8 out of 10.

The reviewer finds the trio of tales to be creepy, suspenseful, and interesting, appreciating the unconventional premise and settings.

(CNN) -- The failure of the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia plus Germany) to reach agreement with Iran Saturday in Geneva is a good thing if it allows the United States and Israel to sort out what really divides them on the Iranian nuclear issue before negotiations resume in coming days. That the French -- not the United States -- seem to have taken the lead in stiffening the allies' demands with Iran is in itself a reflection of those differences. And while a high-ranking U.S. delegation headed to Israel Sunday to brief the Israelis on the talks, bridging the gap there won't be that easy.

On June 15, 2007, the Jaguars released veteran strong safety Donovin Darius, who had seen diminished playing time in previous years due to mounting injuries. On August 31, 2007, the Jaguars announced that long time back-up quarterback David Garrard would start for the team, ahead of former first round draft pick Byron Leftwich, who was released in the teams final roster cuts. Garrard led the Jaguars to an 11–5 record and a wild card spot in the 2007–08 NFL playoffs. The Jaguars defeated the 2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season 31–29 to win their first playoff game in almost eight years and their first road playoff win since 1997. It was also the first time in the 50+ year history of the Steelers that they had been beaten twice at home by the same team in the same season. However, in the divisional round, the Jaguars fell to the then-undefeated 2007 New England Patriots season; the teams were tied at halftime, but the Patriots pulled ahead and won 31–20. Tom Brady completed 26 of 28 passes in this game, being pressured by the Jaguars defense only once, on the first play.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On February 7, 2012, Metallica announced that it would start a new music festival called Orion Music + More, which took place on June 23 and 24, 2012, in Atlantic City. Metallica also confirmed that it would headline the festival on both days and would perform two of its most critically acclaimed albums in their entirety: The Black Album on one night, and Ride the Lightning on the other. In a July 2012 interview with Canadian radio station 99.3 The Fox, Ulrich said Metallica would not release its new album until at least early 2014. In November 2012, Metallica left Warner Bros. Records and launched an independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce the band's future releases. The band has acquired the rights to all of its studio albums, which will be reissued through the new label. Blackened releases will be licensed through Warner subsidiary Rhino Entertainment in North America and internationally through Universal Music.

What is the best way to: How to Make Key Lime Tartlets","output":"Alright, making Key Lime Tartlets is kind of like building a small tasty tower, using different fun parts. You need the following flavors for your towers - this is what we call ingredients: 1. For the tower base, you need cookies crumbs (about 1.5 cups), some sweetness you know, like sugar (1 tablespoon), and a bit of melted butter to make them stick together (5 tablespoons). 2. Then, for the flavor-tower itself, or what we call \\"filling,\\" you need key lime juice (1/2 cup), sweet condensed milk (1 can), zesty lime zest (1 tablespoon), and two large eggs. 3. Lastly, for the very top of the tower, we use whipped cream and lime slices for decoration. Now, let's start building our flavor-towers: 1. First, we make the bases: Take your cookie crumbs, sugar, and melted butter, mix them well, and press them into mini muffin tins. It's just like playing with sand - we're making little castles. Then we need to bake these at 350 degrees in the oven for about 10 minutes. 2. Now for the tower: Marsh your eggs, add the lime juice, sweet condensed milk, and lime zest to them, keep stirring until they are all friends. Fill this on top of your cookie bases. It should just touch the top. These need to go back into the oven for about 15 minutes at the same 350 degrees. 3. All that's left is to decorate the top of our towers: After your tartlets are cool, you can add a dollop of whipped cream on top, and a little lime slice. Try to wait until everyone can try them together. And remember, if you do your best, then they're sure to be yummy regardless of how they end up looking!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A man smiling into the camera, wearing a hat with sunglasses on top.\\" true if \\"A man is sun coverings is outside.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"A man is sun coverings is outside.\\" is somewhat difficult to decode, but it seems like it could be suggesting that a man is wearing items to protect himself from the sun while outside. Such items could potentially include a hat and sunglasses. However, from this statement alone, it's impossible to definitively confirm the premise \\"A man smiling into the camera, wearing a hat with sunglasses on top.\\" Provided the term \\"sun coverings\\" includes both a hat and sunglasses, this part of the premise can be met. The man's location 'outside' matches the premise as well. But there are some details missing in the given statement, which are not allowing us to fully confirm the premise. Firstly, the given statement does not tell us whether the man is smiling or not. This detail is crucial to confirm the premise as it specifically mention a man 'smiling into the camera'. It is entirely possible that the man is not smiling or there is no camera for him to smile into. Secondly, the statement does not provide us enough information about his interaction with a camera. Being outside and wearing sun coverings does not inherently mean that he is engaging with a camera, let alone smiling into it. It's possible, but we simply don't know based on the statement given. Thirdly, the phrase \\"sunglasses on top\\" in the premise could be interpreted in a couple of ways – it could imply that the sunglasses are on top of the man's head, or that they're mounted on the brim of his hat, or simply that he's wearing them. From the given statement, we have no way to ensure any of these conditions are true.  In summary, while the statement implies that the man might be wearing a hat (possibly with sunglasses) while he's \\"outside,\\" we're missing too many important details to entirely confirm the premise. We ideally need more information about if he's smiling, if there's a camera and where the sunglasses are positioned to determine the truth of the premise \\"A man smiling into the camera, wearing a hat with sunglasses on top.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No. The provided response doesn't actually answer the asked question about what a hosting company on a website is. Instead, it discusses aspects of a comprehensive package for a complex site, including database support and application development platforms. While these topics may be related to hosting, they do not clearly define the primary function or purpose of a web hosting company. A more suitable and accurate answer could be: A web hosting company is a business that provides services needed for a website or webpage to be viewed on the internet. Websites are stored, or 'hosted', on special computers called servers. When internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your website address into their browser. Their computer will then connect to your server and your web pages will be delivered to them through the browser. Most hosting companies require that you own your domain in order to host with them. If you do not have a domain, the hosting companies will help you purchase one.

The sentence in German \\"Die ZOW läuft damit zeitgleich zur Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition (SIFE), die jedes Jahr im März die Entscheider der Möbelbranche in der südchinesischen Wirtschaftsmetropole versammelt.\\" translates in English as \\"The ZOW therefore runs concurrently with the Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition (SIFE), which gathers decision-makers in the furniture industry every March in the southern Chinese economic metropolis.\\" ZOW in this context seems to be an event or fair, possibly in related industries, that is scheduled at the same time as the Shenzhen International Furniture Exhibition (SIFE). SIFE is evidently a major event in the furniture industry, attracting decision-makers in the industry and held annually every March. It takes place in Shenzhen, a major city in southern China that is often referred to as an economic metropolis due to its significant influence on the Chinese and global economy. Scheduling ZOW concurrently with SIFE is likely strategic. Industry decision-makers attracted by SIFE would already be gathered, thus increasing the exposure and potential audience for ZOW, and consolidating travel plans for professionals interested in both events. These types of strategic scheduling decisions are common in industries with multiple major professional events. They can maximize both audience size and engagement across events.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Foals are a rock band from Oxford, England formed in 2005, consisting of lead vocalist and lead guitarist Yannis Philippakis, drummer and percussionist Jack Bevan, rhythm guitarist Jimmy Smith, and keyboardist Edwin Congreave. They are currently signed to Warner Bros. Records, and have released four studio albums: Antidotes (2008), Total Life Forever (2010), Holy Fire (2013), What Went Down (2015), one video album, six extended plays and nineteen singles. The band have toured internationally and have featured at Glastonbury, Coachella and Roskilde festivals. Context: Holy Fire was released in both the UK and the US on 11 February 2013. The album's lead single, \\"Inhaler\\", received its first radio play on 5 November 2012. They played the song \\"My Number\\" for the first time on Later... with Jools Holland.  Holy Fire was produced by Flood and Alan Moulder, who have worked with many artists, including Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. The album was recorded at Assault & Battery studios in London.  Yannis Philippakis stated that the recording process had some unconventional moments: \\"At one point we even made these poor studio interns collect bones. We were inspired by voodoo, these Haitian rhythms. We collected some ourselves, from butchers in Willesden High Road. Mainly cows, I think often they had gristle and cartilage on them, mainly cow and occasionally sheep. We had to order these big pots because one of the shoulder blades was too big! We boiled the flesh away so we could use them as percussion! We wanted to get primitive!\\"  According to The Guardian: \\"Their producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, even tricked them by recording their rehearsal in order to capture a more uninhibited sound.\\"  In late November to mid-December, Foals toured the UK for an album preview. The tour was supported by Petite Noir (a close friend of Philippakis'). In summer 2013, they attended a number of festivals and headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July. The band have recently played a World and UK tour, which ended with two sell out shows at Alexandra Palace in February. The two shows were in stark contrast compared to playing the same venue 7 years earlier to an almost empty room while supporting Bloc Party, a sentiment which lead singer Philippakis did not fail to mention during the live shows. Holy Fire was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2013. Q awarded Foals with the Best Live Act award the same year while \\"Inhaler\\" received the Best Track award from NME. Not only this, but in a reader-nominated \\"Best Album of 2013\\" poll, Holy Fire topped the list; as did single \\"My Number\\" in a \\"Best Song of 2013\\" poll, beating NME favourites Arctic Monkeys, amongst other acclaimed bands. Question: what was significant about Holy Fire? Answer:","output":"\\"Holy Fire\\" holds a significant place in Foals' discography and career trajectory for multiple reasons. Firstly, it marked a shift in the band's sound towards a style that was more experimental and ambitious. This can be partly credited to the involvement of producers Flood and Alan Moulder, who are known for their work with other successful alternative and indie rock bands. Their influence led to unconventional recording methods, as described by Yannis Philippakis, such as the use of animal bones for percussion. This experimental approach helped Foals to push their music in a new and creative direction and marks \\"Holy Fire\\" as a turning point in the band's sound. Secondly, the album proved to be a commercial and critical success. It was released in both the UK and the US, indicating the band's growing international influence. The lead single \\"Inhaler\\" received significant airplay and won the Best Track award from NME, and \\"My Number\\" was also recognized in a reader-nominated \\"Best Song of 2013\\" poll. The album itself topped the same poll for \\"Best Album of 2013\\". In addition, \\"Holy Fire\\" was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize, which acknowledges the best album from the UK and Ireland each year, highlighting the positive critical reception the album received. Thirdly, \\"Holy Fire\\" was also a significant moment in Foals' live performance history. They toured extensively in the UK and appeared at various international festivals, including headlining at Latitude Festival in Suffolk. They even managed to sell out two shows at Alexandra Palace, a feat which was particularly meaningful for the band given their previous experience of playing to an almost empty room at the same venue seven years prior. This marked a triumphant moment for Foals and a testament to their growing popularity. Finally, the creation and success of \\"Holy Fire\\" attest to the band's willingness to take creative risks, adapt their sound and experiment with non-traditional recording methods, all of which have helped them to maintain relevance and interest in today's ever-evolving music industry. This has not only marked a significant milestone in the band's career but also affirmed their position as innovators within the indie rock genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The author of the tweet has conveyed their feelings and situation using casual language and by exaggerating the potential consequences. The first part of the tweet, \\"super tired,\\" indicates that the author is experiencing a strong feeling of fatigue or exhaustion. This showcases weariness, which could be interpreted as a negative sentiment. The author is likely overwhelmed by activities, work, or events throughout the day, leading to this state of tiredness. In the second part of the tweet, \\"i better go the bed soon or i might get sick,\\" the author expresses a mild concern due to their understanding of the potential detriment to their health if they do not rest. By using the conditional statement \\"if I don't go to bed soon,\\" they are implying that getting enough sleep is crucial to maintaining their health and avoiding illness. The sentiment here is subtle and concerned, but not overly anxious. The final part of the tweet, \\"nooooooo,\\" is an exaggerated response to the possibility of getting sick. The extended \\"o\\" sound is often used to emphasize distress, but the sentiment here has a hint of humor to it. The author is partly expressing genuine concern about their health while also poking fun at themselves for potentially neglecting self-care. This portion of the tweet lightens the mood slightly and adds a more playful element to the overall sentiment. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a blend of weariness due to exhaustion, mild concern for health and well-being, and a touch of humor.

Now, combine the r terms on the left side: 37*r - 703 = 0 Step 4: Isolate the r term. To isolate the r term, add 703 to both sides of the equation: 37*r - 703 + 703 = 0 + 703 Step 5: Simplify the equation. This addition will simplify the equation: 37*r = 703 Step 6: Solve for r.

As they started their makeup lessons, Mary began by sharing the basics of skincare, explaining the importance of prepping the skin before makeup application and the necessity of maintaining a healthy daily cleansing routine. She emphasized the significance of using gentle cleansers, toners, and moisturizers according to Patricia's skin type, describing the numerous benefits associated with regular exfoliation, including the removal of dead skin cells and the promotion of cell renewal. Next, Mary introduced Patricia to color science and makeup theory. She discussed the concept of the color wheel and its use for makeup application, illustrating the difference between complementary and analogous colors, and highlighting the best ways to select eyeshadow shades that would enhance Patricia's natural eye color and bring more depth to her features. As they continued to explore, they delved into the many techniques for blending and contouring makeup to achieve various looks, such as natural, dramatic, or avant-garde styles. In the course of their lessons, Patricia gradually began to recognize her facial features' uniqueness and appreciate the endless possibilities that makeup could provide to accentuate and complement her individual characteristics. They experimented with various lip colors, from bold matte lipsticks to shimmering glosses, finding those that suited her complexion and personality best. Moreover, Mary wanted Patricia to feel comfortable with makeup application, so she made sure to teach her the correct order of applying makeup products, starting with primer and foundation, followed by concealer, and moving on to powder, blush, and highlighter. As Patricia became more adept in applying makeup, Mary taught her how to accentuate her eyes by using eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara in ways that enhanced their shape and size, making them appear more expressive and captivating. Mary also emphasized the importance of using high-quality makeup brushes for a smoother and more professional application. She explained how different brush sizes and shapes were used for different purposes, guiding Patricia through the selection process and teaching her the proper techniques for maintaining and cleaning her brushes to ensure the longevity of the products. While helping Patricia explore the world of makeup, Mary also managed to instill in her friend the value of self-care and nurturing a positive self-image that went beyond cosmetics. As Patricia's confidence grew, she began to understand that external appearances were only part of the equation - true beauty came from within, and it was essential to cultivate self-love, acceptance, and compassion for herself just as much as she did for others. Over time, the bond between Mary and Patricia only grew stronger, with makeup becoming not just a shared passion but also a symbol of their friendship built on trust, understanding, and genuine care for one another's well-being.

Preheat the oven to 350 f (180 c). Set an ungreased baking sheet aside. To make gooey chocolate cookies, you'll first want to set out your cream cheese and a stick of butter to ensure they reach room temperature. If they're not at room temperature, they'll be hard to work with, and your cookies may not turn out as desired. Once your cream cheese and butter are ready, you can start preparing the rest of the ingredients and preheat your oven. Preheating the oven to 350 f (180 c) is essential because it will ensure consistent cooking temperature and proper baking results. While the oven is preheating, set an ungreased baking sheet aside. This will be used later when you're ready to bake the cookies. Next, gather all your other ingredients: sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, eggs, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips. Cream together the room temperature butter and sugar until they are light and fluffy. Gradually add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips. Now that your cookie dough is prepared, you can start portioning it out onto the ungreased baking sheet. Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the baking sheet, leaving enough space between each cookie to allow for them to spread as they bake. Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft. It's essential not to overbake the cookies, as you want to maintain that gooey, delicious texture. Once the cookies are done baking, let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. These gooey chocolate cookies are best enjoyed fresh, but they can also be stored in an airtight container for a few days or even frozen for longer storage.

Hypothesis: They receive a lot of cargo ships every week. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Alright, kiddo, let's think about it like this: A \\"premise\\" is like a fact or an idea we know to be true. In this case, the premise is that there are \\"ports.\\" Ports are like special parking spots for big boats (called cargo ships) where they bring in things from faraway places. Now, a \\"hypothesis\\" is a guess we make based on the premise. In this case, we're guessing that these ports receive a lot of cargo ships every week. To see if the premise \\"entails\\" the hypothesis, we need to know if the fact that they are ports means that they will always receive a lot of cargo ships every week. Since ports are made for cargo ships to park and unload their stuff, it's likely that they get a lot of those big boats coming in. But, we can't be 100% sure. Sometimes, ports might be small or not very busy, and they won't receive a lot of ships.

Defending champions the United States won their sixth consecutive Olympic title with a time of 3:19.06. Jamaica, who won bronze in London, took silver this time in 3:20.34. Doyle and Onuora made a positive start but it was Diamond's speed on the third leg, after a slow changeover, that pushed Britain into medal contention. The United States and Jamaica were ahead for the majority of the race but Ohuruogu's push on the final leg ensured GB won the struggle for bronze. American Allyson Felix, meanwhile, claimed her sixth track and field gold medal, making her the fifth most decorated female Olympian in any discipline. It is the first time since 1996 Russia have not featured in the top three, after their track and field team were banned from competing in Rio. Bronze means British athletics has hit its pre-Rio target of seven medals. This will be the last Olympics for Ohuruogu, who hinted at retirement after failing to qualify for the women's 400m final.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert (16 November 1717  29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the \\"Encyclopédie\\". D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him. The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Jean - Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert ( / dælmbr / ; French : (  batist l  dalb ) ; 17 November 1717 -- 29 October 1783 ) was a French mathematician , mechanician , physicist , philosopher , and music theorist . Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the Encyclopédie . D'Alembert 's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him . The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert 's equation .  - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers (\\"Encyclopaedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\\") was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the \\"Encyclopédistes\\". It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert.  - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz).  - The Encyclopédistes were members of the Société des gens de lettres, a French writer's society, who contributed to the development of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" from June 1751 to December 1765 under editors Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the philosophes. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the Enlightenment.  - The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of wavesas they occur in physicssuch as sound waves, light waves and water waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Denis Diderot (5 October 171331 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer. He was a prominent figure during the Enlightenment and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the \\"Encyclopédie\\" along with Jean le Rond d'Alembert.  - In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a transmission medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the \\"reception\\" of such waves and their \\"perception\\" by the brain. Humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Sound above 20 kHz is ultrasound and below 20 Hz is infrasound. Other animals have different hearing ranges.  - The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC.

Vaca is almost over.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of inquisitive, light-hearted, and slightly melancholic.  To break it down further, let's analyze the different elements of the tweet: 1. Inquisitive - The tweet starts with \\"@libraritarian59 What's on the agenda today?\\". This indicates that the person is asking a question, hence showing curiosity and wanting to know about the other person's plans for the day. The inquisitive nature highlights a sense of engagement and interest in the other person's life. 2. Light-hearted - The informal language and acronym usage (\\"Vaca\\" as the short form for \\"vacation\\") indicate that the tweet has a casual and light-hearted tone. The person isn't overly formal or demanding while waiting for the response. Instead, they are open and friendly, expecting a light-hearted and informal conversation. 3. Slightly melancholic - The second part of the tweet, \\"Vaca is almost over\\", suggests that the person’s vacation is nearing its end. This information implies a hint of sadness or melancholy because vacations are usually associated with relaxation and positive experiences. The phrase \\"almost over\\" might lead to a sense of disappointment that the enjoyable time is coming to an end. In summary, this tweet's sentiment can be best characterized as inquisitive and light-hearted with a subtle underlying tone of melancholy. The tweet demonstrates a desire for conversation, cheerful engagement, and acknowledgement of the temporary nature of pleasurable experiences such as vacations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - communication - fun - understood - ease tension - suffering  I believe the correct choice is \\"understood\\", here's why:","output":"\\"Understood\\" seems to be the most appropriate response to the question, \\"Sometimes just expressing yourself is the best way to be what?\\" In this case, we will break down each of the possible answer choices and explain why \\"understood\\" is the optimal choice. 1. Communication: While the act of expressing oneself contributes to the communication process, simply communicating does not necessarily imply full comprehension. Communication is a broader term encompassing a two-way exchange of information, feelings, or ideas. Expression, on the other hand, is a subset and fundamental aspect of communication. Thus, although communication is significant, it does not directly address the question at hand. 2. Fun: While expressiveness may lead to enjoyable conversations or interactions, the direct correlation is less clear, and enjoyment relies on other factors as well. Expressing oneself doesn't inherently imply having fun, so it isn't the best-fit response. 3. Understood: Expressing oneself can indeed lead to mutual understanding between parties. When individuals voice their thoughts and feelings, others can grasp their intentions, emotions, and viewpoints. Misunderstandings or misinterpretations are more likely when someone's expression is stifled or unclear. Consequently, being \\"understood\\" is in line with the idea of expressing oneself. 4. Ease tension: Expressing oneself can occasionally ease tension in certain situations. However, this isn't always the case since self-expression can sometimes escalate conflicts or create tension when diverse opinions or emotions arise. Easing tension may depend on context, tone, and timing, among other factors. As a result, this is not the most suitable response. 5. Suffering: Expressing oneself does not inherently imply suffering. Suffering may arise from various sources, such as external events or emotions. While expressing oneself may help alleviate suffering in some contexts (like expressing grief or venting frustration), suffering is not a direct result of self-expression. Thus, it isn't the best response to this question. In conclusion, it's evident that \\"understood\\" is the most fitting response to the question. By expressing oneself, individuals increase the likelihood of being understood by others. This understanding fosters empathy, compassion, and deeper connections. While the other answer choices may be tangentially related to self-expression, they do not directly address the core of the question as effectively as \\"understood\\" does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: who made a makeshift hospital? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Keys of the Kingdom Context: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice. Because the Church hadn't given the mission money for rice in over a year, \\"the faith left them when the rice gave out.\\" Francis rents a small room in the city to evangelize, but because he has no money or influence, he is attacked by those same \\"rice Christians\\" who were supposed to help...","output":"Step 1: Identify the question - Who made a makeshift hospital?

Was looking for a good dog on this side of town, and happened into Chicago Bob's.   I read the few reviews and decided to try the place.   Let me begin by saying they ripped off the few good places in town, the way the menu reads, but the food is not as good as others.  The Chicago Dog was over cooked. I have been eating these dogs for over 40 years and I can tell when one sits around too long. This one just had that \\"overcooked\\" flavor to it.  I also had two sliders. They are nothing like a few of the other places in town and have a weird after taste to them. As Patrick E said, NOTHING EVEN CLOSE to white castle. Chicago Hamburger or Sweet Home Chicago is the place for Sliders.   The fries were mushy and not made correctly for Homemade Fries. The best Homemade Fries in the valley are either Chicago Hamburger Co or Johnnies on Thomas.  These fries were dark and nasty tasting.  I was surprised that none of the employees even cared to ask how we liked our food.  To sum it up; The store looks like a typical Chicago place, but the food is not even close. I think Vienna should really look at who represents their product because this is yet another disappointment in the Chicago Food Experience....Choices: (I). negative. (II). positive. I think the answer is","output":"(I). negative.  The sentiment of the review is decidedly negative. This can be deduced from the various critical comments made by the reviewer. There are clear expressions of dissatisfaction with almost every aspect of their dining experience at Chicago Bob's.  Firstly, the reviewer begins by stating that the restaurant seems to have copied other successful establishments in town as indicated by the menu, however, it fails to deliver the quality of food that these other places offer. In essence, the reviewer expresses disappointment about the lack of originality and lesser quality of food at Chicago Bob's compared to others. They specifically critique the Chicago Dog for being overcooked, arguing from a position of authority as they claim to have been consuming these for over 40 years. The word \\"overcooked\\" and the quotation marks around it suggest a strong negative sentiment. Furthermore, their complaint about the sliders having a weird aftertaste underlines their dissatisfaction about the taste and quality of the food. They also compare these negatively to those found at other locations, indicating that they have a reference point and have found Chicago Bob's lacking. The reviewer's criticism extends beyond the main meals to encompass the side dishes, stating that the homemade fries were mushy, incorrectly made, dark and nasty tasting. This is another negative statement directed towards the quality of the food. The choice of words like \\"mushy\\", \\"dark\\" and \\"nasty tasting\\" add to the overall negative sentiment of the review. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the level of customer service, pointing out that none of the employees asked about their dining experience. This presents an image of indifference from the staff which is another negative aspect mentioned by the reviewer. Finally, the last part of the review reinforces the negative sentiment by stating that while the store looks like a typical Chicago place, the food does not live up to this image. The reviewer concludes by arguing that the brand the restaurant represents (Vienna) should reconsider who is representing their product, implying that Chicago Bob's is not doing a good job. In sum, the reviewer mostly uses negative words and phrases and does not express any enjoyment or satisfaction with the food or service at the restaurant.

These attacks aimed at causing significant damage to infrastructure and morale, resulting in civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its peak. However, the Luftwaffe's efforts eased in the last 10 attacks as seven Kampfgruppen (combat groups) were relocated to Austria in preparation for the Balkans Campaign in Yugoslavia and Greece. Due to the shortage of bombers, the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL, the German Air Force High Command) had to improvise. They used around 50 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers and Jabos (fighter-bombers), which were officially classified as Leichte Kampfflugzeuge (\\"light bombers\\") and sometimes referred to as Leichte Kesselringe (\\"Light Kesselrings\\"). While the defences in the targeted Western ports failed to prevent widespread damage, they occasionally managed to hinder German bombers from concentrating on their targets.

(3). mobiles should not be banned in public places. (4). it is possible to ban the use of mobiles in public places. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: While they were almost unknown twenty years ago, it seems that mobile phones these days are part of everyone's life. However, as with other inventions such as the television and the computer, they are a double-edged sword, inviting both supporters and opponents, especially in regard to their use in public places like restaurants and cinemas. One of the strongest arguments in favor of forbidding mobiles in public places is the trouble they cause to other people. For example, although we are often asked to turn off our phones when in a cinema, the film that we are watching is often interrupted by the sound of at least five rings. To make it even worse, some people insist on continuing their conversation, even though hundreds of people can hear what they say, which often drowns out the voice from the film. As a result, many people would welcome a ban on mobile phones in places where they might disturb other people. On the other hand, there are a number of arguments against such a ban. It is difficult to stop people bringing with them their mobile phones in public places, making it almost impossible to call for a ban. Some people would see this as an infringement of their rights, while other people would say they need them in case of an emergency. Despite being asked to silence their phones, some people insist on leaving them on.  It seems to me that a ban on mobile phones would not have any result in the end. People will find a way to escape a ban. Nevertheless, people should be discouraged from using them in public places, unless it is highly necessary. They should be made to know that it is bad manners to use them in certain places or at certain times.

Wilson (Erica Gavin) is nabbed by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation, marking the directing debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing a few of mentor Roger Cormans' New World films, Demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time, and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence, but has an appealing tongue-in-cheek quality to it as well; it's often as funny as it is flashy. Standout scenes include a lewd and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners, as well as a potent dream / fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed Superintendent McQueen (horror icon Barbara Steele, doing a marvelous turn in this antagonistic role). I also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious. As in other movies of this kind, it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation. These women are tough, they take no garbage from anybody, and they're more than capable of handling themselves. Our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the sassy Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and timid Lavelle, Gavin as the wide-eyed newcomer, and Lynda Gold (a.k.a. Crystin Sinclaire) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside. As our climax plays out, Demme comes up with a tense \\"beat the clock\\" finish as our heroines race to save Belle from being lobotomized by predatory Dr. Randolph (Warren Miller), the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women. Bouncing along to John Cales' flavorful score, \\"Caged Heat\\" is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time. 8/10 Choose your answer.

Q:Information:  - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.   - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment.  - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\".  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.  - The winghead shark (\\"Eusphyra blochii\\") is a species of hammerhead shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. Reaching a length of , this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. Its name comes from its exceptionally large \\"hammer\\", or cephalofoil, which can be as wide as half of the shark's total length. The function of this structure is unclear but may relate to the shark's senses. The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision, while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water. The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line, with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception respectively.  - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José.  - Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata. The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. The common name \\"lamprey\\" is probably derived from Latin \\"lampetra\\", which may mean \\"stone licker\\" (\\"lambere\\" \\"to lick\\" + \\"petra\\" \\"stone\\"), though the etymology is uncertain.  - Malpelo is a small island in the East Pacific Ocean, located about west of the Colombian mainland. Except for a small military post that is manned by the Colombian Armed Forces, it is uninhabited. It consists of a sheer and barren rock with three high peaks, the highest being \\"Cerro de la Mona\\" with a height of . The island is about one mile in length from northeast to southwest, and 700 yards in width.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure. Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluid media. Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes, or simply as ornamentation.  - Molokai or Molokai (Hawaiian: ), often called the \\"Friendly Island\\", is an island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is 38 by 10 miles (61 by 16 km) in size at its extreme length and width with a usable land area of , making it the fifth-largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island in the United States. It lies east of Oahu across the 25-mile (40 km) wide Kaiwi Channel and north of Lnai, separated from it by the Kalohi Channel.  - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas.  - Cocos Island is an island designated as a National Park off the shore of Costa Rica, that does not allow inhabitants other than Costa Rican Park Rangers. It constitutes the 11th of the 13 districts of Puntarenas Canton of the province of Puntarenas. It is located in the Pacific Ocean, approximately from the Pacific shore of Costa Rica. With an area of approximately , about and a perimeter of around , this island is more or less rectangular in shape.  - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.  - A tunicate is a marine invertebrate animal, a member of the subphylum Tunicata, which is part of the Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and notochords. The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile, and are permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor; others, such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips.  - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.  - USS Hammerhead ( SSN - 663 ) , a Sturgeon - class submarine , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hammerhead shark , a voracious fish found in warm seas , with a curious hammerlike head .  - In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard).  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a \\"hammer\\" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. Many not necessarily mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo Island in Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and near Molokai in Hawaii. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern Africa.

Born Lucille Fay LeSueur in San Antonio, Texas, the youngest and third child of Anna Bell (Johnson) and Thomas E. LeSueur, a laundry laborer. She was of English, French Huguenot, Swedish, and Irish ancestry. Crawford's elder siblings were sister Daisy LeSueur, who died before Lucille's birth, and brother Hal LeSueur. Crawford's father abandoned the family a few months before her birth, reappearing later in 1930 in Abilene, Texas, reportedly working as a construction laborer. In 1970, Crawford was presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award by John Wayne at the Golden Globes, which was telecast from the Coconut Grove at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. She also spoke at Stephens College, where she had been a student for two months in 1922.  Crawford published her autobiography, A Portrait of Joan, co-written with Jane Kesner Ardmore, in 1962 through Doubleday. Crawford's next book, My Way of Life, was published in 1971 by Simon & Schuster. Those expecting a racy tell-all were disappointed, although Crawford's meticulous ways were revealed in her advice on grooming, wardrobe, exercise, and even food storage. Upon her death there were found in her apartment photographs of John F. Kennedy, for whom she had voted for in the 1960 presidential election.  In September 1973, Crawford moved from apartment 22-G to a smaller apartment next door (22-H) at the Imperial House, 150 East 69th Street. Her last public appearance was made on September 23, 1974, at a party honoring her old friend Rosalind Russell at New York's Rainbow Room. Russell was suffering from breast cancer and arthritis at the time. When Crawford saw the unflattering photos that appeared in the papers the next day, she said, \\"If that's how I look, then they won't see me anymore.\\" Crawford cancelled all public appearances, began declining interviews and left her apartment less and less. Dental-related issues, including surgery which left her needing round-the-clock nursing care, plagued her from 1972 until mid-1975. While on antibiotics for this problem in October 1974, her drinking caused her to pass out, slip and strike her face. The incident scared her enough to give up drinking, although she insisted that it was because of her return to Christian Science. The incident is recorded in a series of letters sent to her insurance company held in the stack files on the 3rd floor of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts; it is also documented by Carl Johnnes in his biography of the actress, Joan Crawford: The Last Years.  When it came to personal politics, Crawford aligned herself as a Democrat who greatly supported, and admired, the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was once noted as saying: \\"The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored to be a part of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"What was the nature of Joan Crawford's relationship with her parents and siblings, and how did her early life experiences shape her acting career and personal life?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"How distant were the black students at Harvard to their ancestors?\\"  Context: \\"During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The majority of black students at Harvard during the 2003-04 academic year were not directly descended from the historic African American community, with only about a third of them having all four grandparents born into this community.

Draw two lines on both sides of the parallelogram to form a stalk. The three lines should not touch each other.  (C). Add another two lines which continue from the corner of the parallelogram but pass beneath its right edge. The two lines then separate vertically, one going up and another going down to meet with the end of the \\" l \\".  (D). Make sure to place one drawing side on top of another. They should have back marks on these lines, and the other side must be shaded in red.. The answer should be","output":"(C). Add another two lines which continue from the corner of the parallelogram but pass beneath its right edge. The two lines then separate vertically, one going up and another going down to meet with the end of the \\" l \\". Explanation: In this scenario, the story is about the step-by-step process of drawing an impossible cube. The next logical step, following the construction on the parallelogram and the \\"l\\", would be to continue building upon the existing lines of the shape. Answer choice (C) fulfills this by extending lines from the corner of the parallelogram, creating the illusion of a three-dimensional cube which fits the context of drawing an impossible cube. Now let's examine why the other answer choices are incorrect: (A) We are in the process of drawing an impossible cube, not decorating it with smiley faces. Smiley faces aren't contained within the steps to draw the structure of an impossible cube. (B) The mention of lines forming a \\"stalk\\" doesn't fit the context of drawing an impossible cube. An impossible cube doesn't consist of parts that can be referred to as a \\"stalk.\\" (D) The shading and marking of the cube can be a part of the final steps but at this point, we are still constructing the cube.

President Donald Trump is shifting his focus back to domestic issues after returning late Tuesday from a 12-day trip to Asia. This week, Trump will resume pressing congressional Republicans to pass a tax reform measure to follow through on one of his key campaign promises. Trump appears to be working closely with Republican congressional leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. \\"We ran in 2016 on doing this tax reform,\\" Ryan told reporters at the Capitol. \\"The president ran on doing this tax cut and tax reform. So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\\"  However, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey. In Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president. \\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik. Kondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives.

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album--\\"One of Us Must Know ( Most accounts of recording Blonde on Blonde, including those by Dylan scholars Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray, agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14-17 and March 8-10, 1966. This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records.  Dylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia in February and March, and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8. On that date, Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie\\" that Dylan selected for the album. Historian Sean Wilentz observed that \\"with the sound of 'Sweet Marie', Blonde on Blonde entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll\\". The same day saw the successful takes of \\"Just Like a Woman\\", and \\"Pledging My Time\\", the latter \\"driven by Robertson's screaming guitar\\".  According to Wilentz the final recording session, on March 9-10, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time. The first number to be recorded to Dylan's satisfaction was \\"Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine\\", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing the sound of the song radically. Dylan and his band then quickly recorded \\"Temporary Like Achilles\\". The session atmosphere began to \\"get giddy\\" around midnight when Dylan roughed out \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\" on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; \\"That sounds like the damn Salvation Army band\\". Dylan replied; \\"Can you get one?\\" Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song.  In quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded \\"Obviously 5 Believers\\" and a final take of \\"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\\" powered by Robertson's lead guitar. The session concluded with \\"I Want You\\" on which, as Wilentz notes, \\"Wayne Moss's rapid-fire sixteenth notes on the guitar\\" are an impressive element of the recording.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What was one of their songs?","output":"One of their songs is \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie,\\" which was recorded on March 8 during the sessions for Blonde on Blonde."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

Q:Information:  - Kamenz is a town (\\"Große Kreisstadt\\") in the district of Bautzen in Saxony, Germany. Until 2008 it was the administrative seat of Kamenz District. The town is known as the birthplace of the philosopher and poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.  - Rolf Huisgen (born 13 June 1920) is a German chemist. He was born in Gerolstein in the Rhineland-Palatinate and studied in Munich under the supervision of Heinrich Otto Wieland. After completing his Ph.D. in 1943 and his habilitation in 1947, he was named professor at the University of Tübingen in 1949. He returned to the University of Munich in 1952 where he remained dedicated to research long after attaining emeritus status in 1988.  - In organic chemistry, functional groups are specific groups (moieties) of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of. However, its relative reactivity can be modified by other functional groups nearby. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a radical, and if a covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are referred as free radicals. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (-COO), which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion.  - The Steglich esterification is a variation of an esterfication with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a coupling reagent and 4 - dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst . The reaction was first described by Wolfgang Steglich in 1978 . It is an adaptation of an older method for the formation of amides by means of DCC ( dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ) and 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole ( HOBT ) . This reaction generally takes place at room temperature . A suitable solvent is dichloromethane . Because the reaction is mild , esters can be obtained that are inaccessible through other methods for instance esters of the sensitive 1,4 - dihydroxybenzoic acid . A characteristic is the formal uptake of water generated in the reaction by DCC , forming the urea compound dicyclohexylurea ( DCU ) .  - The connectivity of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of isomers) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a structural formula is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate shape of the molecule.  - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level.  - An amide (or or ), also known as an acid amide, is a compound with the functional group RE(O)NR (R and R refer to H or organic groups). Most common are carboxamides (organic amides) (\\"n\\" = 1, E = C, \\"x\\" = 1), but many other important types of amides are known, including phosphoramides (\\"n\\" = 2, E = P, \\"x\\" = 1 and many related formulas) and sulfonamides (E = S, \\"x\\" = 2). The term amide refers both to \\"classes of compounds\\" and to the \\"functional group\\" (RE(O)NR) within those compounds.  - The University of Bonn is a public research university located in Bonn, Germany. Founded in its present form in 1818, as the linear successor of earlier academic institutions, the University of Bonn is today one of the leading universities in Germany. The University of Bonn offers a large number of undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of subjects. Its library holds more than five million volumes. The University of Bonn has 544 professors and 32,500 students. Among its notable alumni and faculty are seven Nobel Laureates, three Fields Medalist, twelve Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize winners, Prince Albert, Pope Benedict XVI, Frederick III, Karl Marx, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Konrad Adenauer, and Joseph Schumpeter. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2016 and the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2015 ranked the University of Bonn as one of the 100 best universities in the world.  - Life. Wolfgang Steglich was born in Kamenz and studied chemistry at the Technical University of Berlin and later at the Technical University of Munich where he received his PhD in 1959 for work with Friedrich Weygand. After his habilitation at the Technical University of Munich he became professor at the Technical University of Munich in 1969 where he stayed until he became professor at the University of Bonn in 1975. He succeeded Rolf Huisgen as head of the organic chemistry department of the University of Munich in 1991. He retired in 2001.  - The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is a research university with campuses in Munich, Garching and Freising-Weihenstephan. It is a member of TU9, an incorporated society of the largest and most notable German institutes of technology.  - Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic organic compound with the chemical formula CHN. It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group (=CH) replaced by a nitrogen atom. The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including azines and the vitamins niacin and pyridoxine.  - 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) is a derivative of pyridine with the chemical formula (CH)NCHN. This colourless solid is of interest because it is more basic than pyridine, owing to the resonance stabilisation from the NMe substituent.  - The Technische Universität Berlin, known as TU Berlin and unofficially as the Technical University of Berlin, is a research university located in Berlin, Germany. It was founded in 1879 and became one of the most prestigious education institutions in Europe.

In 1973, a year before that film was released, producer Tom Miller was instrumental in Winkler getting cast for the role of Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli, nicknamed \\"The Fonz\\" or \\"Fonzie\\", in Happy Days, which first aired in January 1974.  For Happy Days, director/producer Garry Marshall originally had in mind a completely opposite physical presence. Marshall sought to cast a hunky, blonde, Italian model-type male in the role of Fonzie, intended as a stupid foil to the real star, Ron Howard. However, when Winkler interpreted the role in auditions, Marshall immediately snapped him up. According to Winkler, \\"The Fonz was everybody I wasn't. He was everybody I wanted to be.\\"  Winkler's character, though remaining very much a rough-hewn outsider, gradually became the focus of the show as time passed (in particular after the departure of Ron Howard). Initially, ABC executives did not want to see the Fonz wearing leather, thinking the character would appear to be a criminal. The first 13 episodes show Winkler wearing two different kinds of windbreaker jackets, one of which was green. As Winkler said in a TV Land interview, \\"It's hard to look cool in a green windbreaker\\". Marshall argued with the executives about the jacket. In the end, a compromise was made. Winkler could only wear the leather jacket in scenes with his motorcycle, and from that point on, the Fonz was never without his motorcycle until season 2. Happy Days ended its run in 1984. Question: How long did the show last for? Answer:","output":"Happy Days, an American television sitcom, first aired in January 1974 and had a successful run until its conclusion in 1984. The show lasted for 11 seasons, during which it entertained viewers with its unique blend of humor, drama, and nostalgia. Throughout its run, Happy Days showcased the lives and experiences of a group of friends and family members living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and captured the essence of American life in the 1950s and 1960s. The show gained significant popularity, with memorable characters such as Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli (The Fonz or Fonzie), played by Henry Winkler, and Richie Cunningham, portrayed by Ron Howard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- The estate of the late actress Anna Nicole Smith has lost a Supreme Court appeal in a longstanding fight to secure a share of her deceased husband's fortune. The 5-4 ruling Thursday was the latest chapter in a tedious legal soap opera, over the kind of evidence a separate bankruptcy court may hear when deciding various claims and counterclaims. State courts generally hear probate cases, while bankruptcy proceedings are confined to federal courts. The high court's 38-page decision will now likely put an end to this particular legal dispute. J. Howard Marshall was married to the much younger Smith, who is named in court papers as Vickie Lynn Marshall, for 14 months before he died in 1995. His will left nearly all assets and trust to his son from a previous marriage, E. Pierce Marshall, and Smith received virtually nothing. She later sued, claiming her elderly husband promised to give her more than 300 million. A state probate court also dismissed her claims, saying","output":"that there was insufficient evidence to support Smith's claims that J. Howard Marshall had indeed promised her such a significant portion of his estate. The case continued to take numerous turns over the years, with various appeals and legal filings made by both sides, each attempting to gain the upper hand in the drawn-out battle for the late billionaire's fortune. Ultimately, the Supreme Court's ruling emphasizes the importance of abiding by the legal standards set forth by both state and federal courts in addressing complex probate and bankruptcy matters, as well as the necessity for clear and convincing evidence when making claims on a deceased individual's estate. This decision serves as a reminder that even though individuals may verbally express their intentions concerning their assets, it is essential for those intentions to be properly documented and executed through a legally binding instrument, such as a will or trust, to ensure the accurate distribution of wealth upon one's passing. In the case of Anna Nicole Smith, the failure to provide sufficient evidence to corroborate her allegations has ultimately left her estate unable to stake a claim to her late husband's fortune, forcing an end to this long-standing legal saga."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(WSVN) -- When an officer caught a woman speeding through a West Boynton Beach school zone and issued her a ticket, the driver cursed the officer out, and it was all caught on the police dashcam.      The driver's harsh statements were all caught on the deputy's dashcam, and that video has now gone viral.      According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, driver Joy Feinberg was speeding 30 miles over the speed limit. The sheriff said that her comments, regardless of the situation, were uncalled for. He said the officer was not rude to Feinberg, and her comments were unacceptable.      She was driving a white Subaru. When she speeds by the deputy's cruiser, he turns on his lights and sirens and makes a U-turn to make the traffic stop.      When Feinberg pulled over, she asked the deputy what she did. He responded, \\"You just went 51 miles an hour in a school zone.\\"      After her attempts to get out of the ticket fails, she begins to beg. \\"I'm begging you,\\" she said. \\"I promise I won't do it again. I really wasn't aware.\\"      The deputy is firm and hands her a citation for 606. And when she realizes her pleas were not working, the next few words were not as pleasant. \\"You know what? No wonder you people get shot,\\" Feinberg said. \\"You're absolute [expletive].\\"      Remaining calm, the deputy says, \\"OK, thank you, ma'am. I appreciate that.\\"      Palm Beach County Sheriff Rick Bradshaw said, \\"This isn't a deputy that made an arrest. This isn't a deputy that is in a fight with somebody. This isn't a questionable circumstance. This is a deputy trying to make sure children are safe. She has to make the comment of, 'This is why you people get shot,' and then calls him [expletive]. What's the reason behind that?\\"      According to the deputy's dashcam, Feinberg continued to disrespect the deputy and undermined his authority.      \\"You're going to have to do a drivers license re-exam also, ma'am,\\" said the deputy.            \\"Do you have the power to do that?\\" she replied.      \\"Yes, I do.\\"      \\"Then you are a double [expletive] hole.\\"      Bradshaw sees this verbal altercation as a trend of disrespect toward law enforcement. \\"There seems like there's this trend of disrespect when here's a deputy trying to save children's lives,\\" he said, \\"and somebody has got to talk to us like that? I think it's unacceptable.\\"      It's possible that Feinberg was having a really bad day. 7News tried to get her side of the story, but she has not commented. She has 30 days to pay the 606 ticket. ||||| A remarkably restrained Florida sheriff's deputy calmly thanked an angry driver he'd pulled over for speeding and walked away after she told him: \\"You know what?

After blasting out the small mine with dynamite, Plainview falls and breaks his leg. After finding the silver ore, he drags himself to town to sell it. He hires a crew, including a man caring for an infant son. When the silver lode plays out, Plainview discovers oil in the mine. He builds a pump and recreates himself as an oil man. The young father dies in a drilling accident, Planview adopts the young boy as his own and names him H.W. Nine years later, Plainview is a successful if still somewhat minor oil man. He has several productive wells around New Mexico and, with H.W. (Dillon Freasier), travels the state to buy the drilling rights to private property.At a meeting with local people of an unidentified town, Plainview lectures them on his business plan: he claims he does all the work himself, only hires men he can trust to complete the work and will eliminate the need for a \\"contractor\\", a middleman of sorts that will collect more money from the community that Daniel believes should go back to the landowners themselves. He also introduces his son as his partner and claims that his business is a family-run operation. When the people begin to question him rigorously and argue loudly among themselves, Daniel turns down the offer and leaves, knowing the community is a bit too smart to be taken advantage of.Daniel later meets with a husband and wife and draws up a contract to drill on their land. The couple are reluctant but Daniel appeals to them by talking about their children. The well comes in as a gusher some time later.One night, a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) visits Plainview's camp. Paul sells to Plainview information about his family's ranch in Little Boston, California, which he says has an ocean of oil underneath it. Plainview and H.W. travel to the Sunday Ranch and, while pretending to hunt quail, confirm what Paul told them. That night, Plainview negotiates with the Sunday patriarch,...

Here is a brief explanation of each option and why \\"decay\\" is more suitable: 1. Decay: This term implies a natural process of breaking down or deteriorating due to exposure to moisture, fungus, or other factors. Since the wallpaper is wet, it implies that it has started to break down due to the moisture, making \\"decay\\" the most appropriate option in this context. 2. Ruin: Although \\"ruin\\" can also imply damage or destruction, it is a more general term and does not provide as much specificity as \\"decay.\\" Ruin can occur due to various reasons, and it doesn't necessarily imply the progressive breakdown associated with decaying material. 3. Throw away: This option refers to discarding or disposing of something, which is not relevant to the deterioration of the wet wallpaper. 4. Destroy: Destruction is a more aggressive and intentional act, like smashing or tearing something apart. Unlike \\"decay,\\" it does not capture the natural process of deterioration that occurs when wallpaper gets wet. 5. Waste: This term is not relevant to the condition of the wet wallpaper because \\"waste\\" implies a misuse or inefficient use of resources. It does not appropriately describe the gradual breakdown of the material.

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates.  Which student knew more about seafloor spreading?  Hint: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the hint, seafloor spreading is primarily associated with divergent tectonic plates. This geologic process occurs when oceanic plates diverge and new oceanic crust forms due to rising magma that cools and solidifies. Considering that Bobby learned about divergent tectonic plates and Nate focused on convergent plates, it can be concluded that Bobby knew more about seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading is a critical component of the overall understanding of plate tectonics - a scientific theory that explains the large-scale movement of Earth's lithosphere. It involves the continuous formation of new oceanic crust and the movement of older crust away from the spreading zones, resulting in the Earth's continents gradually drifting apart or toward each other. Seafloor spreading not only provides insight into continental drift but also contributes to the understanding of various other geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and formation of mountain ranges. As Bobby's focus was divergent tectonic plates - where plates pull away from each other - he had a better understanding of seafloor spreading. This is because seafloor spreading mainly takes place along mid-ocean ridges, which are clear manifestations of divergent plate boundaries. The driving force behind this process is the tensional stress caused by tectonic plate pull, which results in fractures within the lithosphere. Furthermore, different spreading rates dictate whether the mid-ocean ridges are classified as fast, intermediate, or slow. These classifications provide valuable information on the rate at which new oceanic crust is being formed and subsequently, how different tectonic plates interact with each other. In contrast, Nate's focus on convergent tectonic plates deals more with the process of plates moving towards and colliding with each other, resulting in various regional geologic features such as mountain ranges, subduction zones, and volcanic arcs. While converging plates also play a critical role in the overarching theory of plate tectonics, their relationship to seafloor spreading is not as direct as that of the divergent plates studied by Bobby. In conclusion, based on their respective areas of focus within the study of plate tectonics, Bobby, who learned about divergent tectonic plates, had a more comprehensive understanding of seafloor spreading compared to Nate, who focused on convergent plates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i'd rather just go to Galveston Here is a hypothesis: We go every once in a while after having kids. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. Let's break down both statements to better understand the connection. Premise: \\"But now that we have children and we go every blue moon, I'd rather just go to Galveston.\\" The premise presents three relevant points: 1. The speaker has children now. 2. The speaker goes on trips every blue moon, which is an idiomatic expression indicating a rare occurrence or infrequently. 3. Given point 2, the speaker would prefer going to Galveston, which implies going somewhere might be more challenging after having kids or that Galveston might be a more family-friendly or accessible location than other destinations. Hypothesis: \\"We go every once in a while after having kids.\\" The hypothesis proposes that the speaker and their family go on trips infrequently or occasionally after having children. This idea aligns with point 2 of the premise, as both \\"every blue moon\\" and \\"every once in a while\\" suggest a low frequency of trips. Based on these observations, if we assume the premise as true, the hypothesis also holds true, as it captures the essence of the frequency of trips after having to adjust to the new responsibilities and lifestyle changes that come with raising children. Given the premise, the hypothesis does not directly address the preference for going to Galveston. However, it is still consistent with the broader idea that the family's schedule and preferences have changed as a result of having children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scott) addresses an unseen audience of American troops, (based on his speech to the Third Army). The film version of the speech is heavily condensed, with much of the original vulgarity removed. Following the humiliating American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in 1943, Patton is placed in charge of the American II Corps in North Africa. Upon his arrival, he enforces discipline amongst his troops, e.g. fining a cook 20 for not wearing his army issue leggings. Patton is then summoned to a meeting with Air Marshal Coningham of the Royal Air Force, where he claims that the American defeat was caused by lack of air cover. Coningham promises Patton that he will see no more German aircraft - but seconds later the compound is strafed by Luftwaffe planes. Patton then defeats a German attack at the Battle of El Guettar; his aide Captain Jenson is killed in the battle, and is replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Patton is bitterly disappointed to learn that Erwin Rommel, Commander of the German-Italian Panzer Army, was on medical leave due to having diphtheria, but Codman reassures him that: \\"If you've defeated Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel\\". After success in the North Africa campaign, Patton and Bernard Law Montgomery plan the Allied invasion of Sicily. Patton's proposal to land his Seventh Army in the northwest of the island with Montgomery in the South-East (therefore potentially trapping the German and Italian forces in a pincer movement), initially impresses their superior General Alexander, however Eisenhower rejects it in favour Montgomery's more cautious plan, which places Patton's army in the South-East, covering Montgomery's left flank. Whilst the landing is successful, the Allied forces become bogged down, causing Patton to defy orders and push his army northwest to Palermo, and then to the port of Messina in the northeast, narrowly beating Montgomery to the prize, although several thousand German and Italian troops are able to flee the island.

Upon coming across a millipede on their hike, Rebecca's excitement couldn't be contained as she took a picture of the magnificent creature, her admiration for bugs evident in the sparkle in her eyes. As a bug lover, Rebecca saw beauty in these often overlooked and misunderstood creatures, appreciating their roles in the ecosystem and the unique features that made them so extraordinary. Elena, on the other hand, had quite a different reaction. Just as Rebecca had captured the perfect shot of the millipede, Elena inadvertently stepped on the tiny arthropod. Although she didn't mean to harm the creature, it was clear that Elena didn't share the same passion for bugs as Rebecca did. Even with this incident, Rebecca was undeterred in her infatuation with the insect world. She continued to educate her friends about the importance of bugs and how they served as critical links in the chain of life. From pollinators like butterflies and bees to decomposers like beetles and millipedes, Rebecca recognized that the world wouldn't be the same without these tiny beings. Elena too started to change her perspective on bugs, with Rebecca's enthusiasm and knowledge slowly rubbing off on her. Together, they embarked on numerous hikes, discovering and documenting the countless insects along their way, contributing to the preservation and appreciation of these often-underappreciated creatures.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Throughout the Middle Ages, the common clothing amongst the Gaelic Irish consisted of a brat (a woollen semi circular cloak) worn over a leine (a loose-fitting, long-sleeved tunic made of linen). For men the leine reached to their ankles but was hitched up by means of a crios (pronounced 'kriss') which was a type of woven belt. The leine was hitched up to knee level. (Gaelicattire.com) Women wore the leine at full length. Men sometimes wore tight-fitting trews (Gaelic triubhas) but otherwise went bare-legged. The brat was simply thrown over both shoulders or sometimes over only one. Occasionally the brat was fastened with a dealg (brooch), with men usually wearing the dealg at their shoulders and women at their chests. The ionar (a short, tight-fitting jacket) became popular later on. In Topographia Hibernica, written during the 1180s, Gerald de Barri wrote that the Irish commonly wore hoods at that time (perhaps forming part of the brat), while Edmund Spenser wrote in the 1580s that the brat was (in general) their main item of clothing. Gaelic clothing does not appear to have been influenced by outside styles.  Women invariably grew their hair long and, as in other European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair--for example, a person could be forced to pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.  Gaelic men typically wore a beard and mustache, and it was often seen as dishonourable for a Gaelic man to have no facial hair. Beard styles varied - the long forked beard and the rectangular Mesopotamian-style beard were fashionable at times.

A team is sent from the Army's bio-defense department to retrieve the satellite, only to die from the disease themselves. The video footage recorded by the retrieval team and their strange deaths capture the attention of General George Mancheck, the head of the bio-defense department, who activates \\"Wildfire,\\" a team of five scientists who are called upon when high-level bioterror threats occur in the United States.

What type of dog is Beethoven in the film franchise of that name ?","output":"Beethoven, the main canine character from the film franchise of that name, is a Saint Bernard. The Saint Bernard is a large and powerful breed of dog that was originally bred in the Western Alps, particularly in Switzerland and Italy. The breed is known for its incredible strength, impressive size, intelligence, and gentle disposition. The Saint Bernard gained international recognition in the early 18th century when monks at the Great Saint Bernard Hospice, a monastery located at a treacherous Alpine pass between Switzerland and Italy, bred these dogs as rescue and working animals. They were known for their incredible ability to locate and rescue lost travelers buried beneath avalanches or stuck in snowstorms. Saint Bernards are massive dogs, with adult males generally weighing between 140 to 180 pounds and standing 28 to 30 inches tall at the shoulder. Females tend to be slightly smaller, weighing between 120 to 140 pounds with a height ranging from 26 to 28 inches. Despite their large size, these dogs have a calm and gentle nature, making them an excellent choice for families. The breed's distinctive appearance is characterized by a dense, muscular body, large skull, and powerful jaws. Their fur can be either short and smooth or medium-length and slightly wavy, with colors ranging from reddish-brown to brindle, and often including varying amounts of white. The Saint Bernard’s facial expression is typically very warm and friendly, which is a key part of the breed's endearing appeal. In the \\"Beethoven\\" film franchise, Beethoven, the lovable and mischievous Saint Bernard, is portrayed by a series of dogs. The first two \\"Beethoven\\" films starred a dog named Chris, who was followed by different Saint Bernards in later installments. Beethoven's adventures bring laughter and warmth to audiences, showcasing his innate intelligence, loyalty, and companionship.

While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, \\"Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me.\\" She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

She replied personally to all the letters she received from servicemen.

Forrest Lucas, husband of Charlotte Lucas, wrote the letter, published as an advertisement this week, after RTV6 broke the story of her Facebook post. The post talked about how minorities should not be running the country.      \\"I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!\\" Lucas wrote in the post. \\"As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that atheists (minority), muslims [sic] (minority) nor any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. Is everyone so scared that they can't fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?\\"      The next day, Charlotte issued an apology for the post.      Thursday morning, Forrest Lucas put out an ad (in the form of a letter), explaining what had happened and how he and Charlotte were trying to move forward.      The advertisement read:      Dear Friends:      Many of you know the story of how Charlotte and I started Lucas Oil from nothing in 1989. Over the last 25 years, Lucas Oil has achieved success with many oil products, developed a strong, supportive presence in motorsports, expanded into ranching and media operations, and became naming rights holder for the stadium that the Indianapolis Colts call home. Lucas Oil remains a family-owned business with manufacturing and distribution facilities in our home state of Indiana. Lucas Oil is proud to have employees, friends, customers and business partners reflecting ethnic and racial diversity.      Charlotte and I have been extremely fortunate, and we have found many ways to give back to the community. Among many other things, we have funded groups that provide opportunities and benefits for veterans, women, minorities and disadvantaged youth. We have supported causes that promote education and seek cures for cancer, diabetes, paralysis and other health problems.      Unfortunately, this week, Lucas Oil has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The media reported a story about a posting Charlotte made on her Facebook page in which she included statements directed to minority special interest groups. Although it was not Charlotte's intent to offend anyone, her comments were harsh and insensitive. Her words were hurtful to many and disappointing to all. Make no mistake, Charlotte feels extremely saddened by her actions and regrets the posting. She has issued an apology with the hope that it will be accepted as sincere.      The reality is that the message posted on Charlotte's Facebook page does not reflect the feelings in her heart. Those who know Charlotte appreciate that she is a caring and loving person who has great respect for everyone. We thank those who have consoled Charlotte in this time of turmoil and have encouraged her to learn from her mistake.      Lucas Oil will continue to focus on all of its positive business activities and events. We will use this opportunity to examine our diversity efforts and to strengthen our relationships with minority leaders and organizations. We appreciate the patience and understanding of the community as we make progress in these areas.

Tuesday was Confucius' birthday. He was born on September 28,551 BC in the Kingdom of Lu  , in today's Shandong Province. Chinese look upon Confucius as the greatest thinker and also the greatest teacher. He had about 3,000 students. For more than 2,000 years, Confucius' ideas have been around in people's everyday lives. Now they have gone far into Western countries and south Asia. People can still hear _ today. Why are his ideas so popular? They help not only in everyday life but also society. Confucius' most important ideas are kindness and good manners.

Question: Given the background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  and the situation: Bimmy and Harold are both four years old and are about to start attending school. Before that though, it is important that they have adequate supplies to be prepared. Bimmy's parents, who both have worn glasses their whole lives, took him to the store to pick up folders and pencils. While there, they bumped into Harold and his parents, who do not wear glasses. They quickly exchanged hellos before moving on with their shopping.  Answer the following question: Which boy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school? Answer:","output":"Bimmy will more likely struggle to see the chalkboard when they start school. The background information states that there is evidence that myopia (nearsightedness) is inherited, and if one or both of a child's parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that the child will too. Since both of Bimmy's parents have worn glasses their whole lives, he is at a higher risk of developing nearsightedness compared to Harold, whose parents do not wear glasses. Additionally, myopia commonly first occurs in school-age children. However, it is also important to note that there's no certainty about Bimmy or Harold developing nearsightedness, but based on the given factors, Bimmy is more likely to struggle to see the chalkboard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found out this morning over breakfast. Suicide. Walter. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \\"Gotcha!\\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away. After five years of friendship it's the least Walter deserves of me. One other thing. The package. It's still sitting there in my study. Mocking me. That's how it feels anyway. Should...

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   In which reservoir a good portion of the water would most likely not be replaced?  There are two hydroelectric dams in North Dakota. Both of them has large lakes or reservoirs, reservoir A and reservoir B. Since North Dakota has one the lowest unemployment rates in the country, it's hard to find an engineer to regulate and maintain the reservoirs. This year reservoir A could hire an engineer, but reservoir B failed to find an engineer. As a result, there is no one to regulate reservoir B. The engineer for reservoir A let the water out in the fall. But there was no one to do that for reservoir B.  Hint: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. Answer:","output":"Reservoir B would most likely not have a good portion of the water replaced. Since reservoir B failed to find an engineer to regulate and maintain it, there was no one to let the water out in the fall as it is done for reservoir A. This lack of regulation could lead to a less significant portion of water being replaced in reservoir B, potentially affecting its water quality."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

If you are afraid of the dark,it's not a big deal.It's perfectly normal to feel afraid After all,animals do too. \\"Fear matters,\\"says Karen Warkentin,an ecologist.\\"It's a good thing,\\" she adds, \\"because fear makes you do things that keep you alive.\\" Like kids,many animals experience fear and they respond to the feeling in variety of ways.A frightened turtle pulls its head and legs inside its shell.A  small fish will swim away when a big,hungry fish approaches. Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water.

How many percent are not Marriage couples living together?","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the given information: 1. 31.2% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them. 2. 28.0% of households were married couples living together. 3. 24.7% of households had a female householder with no husband present. 4. 45.5% of households were non-families. We are interested in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together. We know that 28.0% are married couples living together, so to find the percentage that are not married couples living together, we will subtract that percentage from 100%. 100% - 28.0% = 72.0% So, 72.0% of households are not married couples living together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If Indicated is a way of implying he said it while indicating he must not have actually said it., can we conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it.\\"?","output":"To determine if we can conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it,\\" let's break down and analyze the statement step-by-step: 1. Understand the problem: The statement suggests that the word \\"indicated\\" implies that someone both said something and that they might not have actually said it. We are asked whether that statement allows us to conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it.\\" 2. Identify the key elements:    a. Indicated: This implies that someone conveyed a message or an idea through various means, not necessarily direct or verbal communication.    b. Boldly confirmed: This implies that someone explicitly and confidently stated or acknowledged a fact or their involvement in an action. 3. Compare the key elements:     a. Indication vs. confirmation: Indication is an indirect way of communicating a message or an idea, while confirmation is a direct statement validating a particular fact. Therefore, they are not equivalent.    b. Boldness: Boldness can be associated with confidence. If someone is bold in making a statement, they are doing so assertively and without doubt.  4. Analyze the given scenarios:     a. The statement \\"Indicated is a way of implying he said it while indicating he must not have actually said it\\" can be understood in two different ways:         i. The person indirectly communicated that they said something but did not explicitly state it.        ii. The person indicated that they were misunderstood or that their words were taken out of context.    b. In either interpretation, the person did not \\"boldly confirm\\" that they had said something. Instead, they either indirectly communicated their involvement or expressed that their words were misconstrued. Based on this analysis, we cannot conclude that \\"He boldly confirmed that he had said it.\\" The use of \\"indicated\\" suggests indirect communication or a level of ambiguity, while \\"boldly confirmed\\" implies direct and confident affirmation. These two expressions describe different actions and cannot be equated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These two equations are: 1) x + y = 2 2) x^2 + y^2 = 2 We can solve them by first squaring the first equation (x + y)^2, which results in x^2 + 2xy + y^2.

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. On January 3, 2009, Warner led the Cardinals in their victory over the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 at home in the first round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 19 for 32 passing, a completion percentage of 59.4%, for 271 yards. He threw two touchdowns and one interception. This win represented the first time the Cardinals had won a post-season home game since the 1947 NFL Championship Game.  On January 10, Warner helped the Cardinals defeat the Carolina Panthers 33-13 in Charlotte, North Carolina in the second round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 21 for 32 passing, for 220 yards, a completion percentage of 65.6%, with two touchdowns and one interception. This win was the first time the Cardinals had won a game on the East Coast the entire 2008 season, after having lost away games to the Panthers, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, and the New England Patriots.  On January 18, Warner threw for 279 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles to lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Warner is one of three quarterbacks who made Super Bowl starts with two different teams (the others are Craig Morton [1970: Dallas Cowboys and 1977: Denver Broncos] and Peyton Manning [2006 & 2009: Indianapolis Colts and 2013 & 2015: Denver Broncos]). Warner also became the third quarterback in NFL history to win a conference championship with two different teams (following Craig Morton and Earl Morrall).  In Warner's third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1-2 record in Super Bowls. Despite losing, Warner still managed to throw for 377 yards (the fourth-highest total in Super Bowl history). He completed 72.1% of his passes, and had a quarterback rating of 112.3. Warner had now recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in the history of the Super Bowl, and joined Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, John Elway, and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls. Warner had taken his team to the Super Bowl every year that he played as the starting quarterback during all regular and post season games.

Who was Fred Astaire's dancing partner in the musical film The Band Wagon","output":"Fred Astaire's dancing partner in the musical film The Band Wagon (1953) was the talented actress, dancer, and singer Cyd Charisse. Cyd Charisse, born Tula Ellice Finklea, was an American actress primarily known for her work in the Golden Age of Hollywood musicals. She made her film debut in 1943 with small roles in two films, but it was in the 1950s that her talents as a dancer were showcased in numerous film projects. Charisse gained significant acclaim for her dancing skills and performances alongside notable legends Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in a series of successful musical films. In The Band Wagon, directed by Vincente Minnelli, Fred Astaire starred as Tony Hunter, a washed-up Hollywood star who returns to the Broadway stage as part of a last-ditch effort to revive his career. Cyd Charisse played the role of Gabrielle Gerard, a gifted and sophisticated ballerina who becomes Astaire's co-star and love interest in a grand show-within-a-show. The movie is a tribute to the behind-the-scenes experiences of creating theater productions and the personal lives of individuals involved in the entertainment industry. Throughout The Band Wagon, Astaire and Charisse's incredible on-screen chemistry, dancing prowess, and acting abilities are prominently displayed. One of the most memorable dance sequences is the \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" number, which has become iconic in the history of film. The two dazzled with their emotional performance, seamlessly blending acting, singing, and dancing. Their beautiful ballet and tap dance routines, enhanced by Charisse's grace and elegance, along with Astaire's finesse and charm, make for a perfect pairing across various musical numbers in the film. The Band Wagon, featuring the wonderful music by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz, went on to become one of MGM's most prestigious and beloved film musicals, earning three Academy Award nominations and an avid fan-following. The on-screen partnership between Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in this movie remains a touchstone for subsequent musical films and represents the height of Hollywood's Golden Age of musicals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They say that the quality of life is as important as life itself and that people should not be forced to go on living when conditions of life have become unbearable .

The article discusses the advancements in medical technology that have resulted in people being able to live longer.

On one side, there are people, including some doctors, who believe in the importance of considering the quality of life, and that an individual should have the right to decide when they want to die if their conditions become unbearable. They argue that people should be allowed to die with dignity and make their own choices regarding their lives. On the other hand, there are those who hold the view that life in any condition is preferable to death, and that it is the responsibility of doctors to prolong life wherever possible. This standpoint prioritizes the sanctity of life and the doctors' role in sustaining it. Despite the ongoing disagreement between these two sides, one of the central ideas put forth by some people is that the patient should have the right to decide whether or not they wish to continue living under unbearable circumstances. In this scenario, the choice should rest with the patient themselves, rather than being made by doctors, their surrounding environment, or close friends.

Q:As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

By sharing your story as a survivor rather than a victim, you are not only raising awareness but also instilling important values of activism and speaking the truth in your children. Just as you hope, they will grow up witnessing your strength and courage, enabling them to become more empathetic, compassionate, and resilient individuals themselves. Remember to keep nurturing their emotional well-being and offering them a safe space to express their feelings and concerns. In doing so, you are fostering their mental and emotional growth while also reinforcing their understanding of the importance of communication and support. It is evident that you are an incredibly strong and inspiring mother, and your children will undoubtedly learn a great deal from you about overcoming adversity, fighting for justice, and supporting others in need.

When the diaphragm contracts during inhalation, it creates a negative pressure within the chest cavity, allowing the lungs to expand and draw in air. When the diaphragm relaxes during exhalation, the pressure within the chest cavity increases, and the lungs naturally contract, pushing out air. This process of breathing is also referred to as \\"belly breathing\\" as it involves the diaphragmatic movement.

The circle is never round.” This sentence, taken from the film “Before the Rain’’ by Milcho Manchevski (Golden Lion Award in Venice, 1994), refers to history happening again and again through different facts and people. It is this concept that permeates the narrative of photojournalist Calogero Russo‘s photographs of East Berlin 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and its reunification with West Germany. A city can choose to weave its past into its new future, understanding that this new tapestry only strengthens its history and culture relevance. Or it can bury that past quietly under newly-erected buildings, roads and cafes to blot out its past transgressions. But it can never fully be erased. And East Berlin in the past 25 years, according to Russo, “is a city that doesn’t run away from its past in the “Deutsche Demokratische Republik” (DDR). On the contrary, it lives with it.” “OST: Berlin” the title of Russo’s photo series, is a play on the word “Ostalgie,” a term referring to nostalgia for parts of German culture and life. All across the city of Berlin today, one can find old portraits of Erich Honecker, the former first general secretary of East Germany’s Social Unity Party who led the country from 1971 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, in hotel rooms or painted on the sides of buildings. Food products that were once popular are now being sold once again in the new supermarkets. The most requested rental cars by tourists today? The old Lada and Trabant, which was created in East Berlin in the 1950s and which many East Berliners later drove over the Berlin wall when it fell. People like to go to the Soviet Memorial in Treptower Park for a walk, or to the abandoned fun fair for a weekend picnic. Cafès and restaurants furnished in pure DDR style, and the former Stasi headquarters, have now become touristic attractions. The lure of this nostalgia could be advantageous toward driving tourism as East Germany continues to build its economy as West Germany has. And newer landmarks, cars and cafes also bump against the Lenin-era architecture. Calogero has been documenting East Berlin’s transformation since April 2014, and is producing a fanzine that will be published on the anniversary of the fall in November.

Question: In 1908 psychologist Alfred Adler cited which leader in proposing an inferiority complex in short people, which became known as the ('What leader?) Syndrome'? Answer:","output":"In 1908, psychologist Alfred Adler cited the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte in proposing an inferiority complex in short people, which became known as the Napoleon Complex or Napoleon Syndrome. Napoleon Bonaparte was a military general who became the first Emperor of France in 1804. His conquests and strategic prowess significantly expanded the French Empire, leading to a widespread influence over continental Europe. However, despite his achievements, Napoleon was often depicted as short in stature, which became a popular talking point and subject of mockery over the years. Alfred Adler, an Austrian psychotherapist and a contemporary of Sigmund Freud, developed a theory known as \\"individual psychology.\\" He focused on the concept of feelings of inferiority and the compensatory behaviors people exhibit as a response to those feelings. As part of his theory, Adler introduced the idea of the Napoleon Complex or Napoleon Syndrome. This term refers to the tendency of some shorter individuals, particularly men, to overcompensate for their perceived shortcomings in height by acting more aggressively, asserting dominance, or seeking positions of power. According to Adler's theory, the Napoleon Complex arises from a sense of insecurity and self-doubt caused by societal expectations and prejudices linked to height. Consequently, some shorter individuals may develop a heightened sensitivity to their stature, leading them to adopt behaviors that counterbalance these perceptions of inadequacy. It is important to note that while the Napoleon Complex has become a widely-recognized term in popular culture, modern research on the subject presents mixed findings on the validity of the concept. In conclusion, Alfred Adler coined the term \\"Napoleon Complex\\" or \\"Napoleon Syndrome\\" in 1908, citing French leader Napoleon Bonaparte as the inspiration behind the concept. This syndrome refers to the supposed inclination of some short individuals to feel inferior due to their height, leading them to exhibit compensatory behaviors such as aggressiveness, dominance-seeking, and power ambitions. Although the Napoleon Complex has become a well-known idea, scientific research on its validity remains inconclusive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: A 19 year-old Marine from Riverside has died in Iraq, becoming the second U.S. military member to die as the U.S. fights the advance of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.      Lance Cpl. Sean P. Neal, a specialist in the use of mortars, died in a “non-combat related incident” Thursday in Baghdad, the Department of Defense announced Friday. The incident is under investigation.      Neal, who enlisted in 2013, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment at Twentynine Palms. The battalion deployed last month to the Middle East as part of what Marines call a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force.      The task force is meant to bolster the “crisis response capability” in the region. The announcement of Neal’s death marks the first indication that Marines from the task force are in Iraq.      In its Sept. 30 announcement about the deployment of the 2,300 Marines of the task force, the U.S. Central Command said that it was \\"not in response to the ongoing operations in Iraq\\" and that the Marines would be spread to several spots in the region.      Central Command said late Friday that there are approximately 150 Marines from the task force assigned to Iraq to provide additional security for U.S. personnel and facilities.      President Obama has insisted that there will be no U.S. ground combat troops in Iraq, but last month the administration approved sending additional troops to the Iraqi capital to bolster diplomatic security for State Department officials at the Baghdad embassy compound and its support facilities.      Not counting Marines from the special task force, the U.S. force in Iraq is now about 1,400.      The death of Neal, and the deployment of task force Marines to Iraq, indicates the key role that Marines and sailors from California bases are playing in the U.S. mission.      Earlier this month, Cpl. Jordan Spears, 21, from the San Diego-based 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, became the first U.S. fatality in the mission that the Pentagon recently dubbed Operation Inherent Resolve.      Spears bailed out of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft in the Persian Gulf when it appeared on the verge of crashing. After searching for two days the Navy declared Spears as “lost at sea.”      From 2003 to 2011, 345 Marines and sailors from Camp Pendleton and 115 from Twentynine Palms died in Iraq.      The administration has steadily increased its efforts against the Islamic State militants as they have seized large swaths of western and northern Iraq and threatened Iraq's government and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region.      Plans for the task force crisis response unit began in summer of 2013, months before the assault on Iraq by Sunni militants under the banner of setting up an Islamic caliphate, the Marine Corps said.      The force will be headquartered in Kuwait, Col. Kenneth DeTreux told the newspaper Stars and Stripes. Kuwait was the staging point for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein.      The force includes infantry Marines from Twentynine Palms, fixed-wing and rotary aircraft from Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego, headquarters and logistics personnel from Camp Pendleton.      Spears, from Memphis, was a crew member on the Osprey, which deployed to the Persian Gulf aboard the amphibious assault ship Makin Island.      The Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group consists of three San Diego-based ships and 4,000 Marines and sailors. The Marines are the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Pendleton.      A week ago the carrier Carl Vinson, based at North Island Naval Air Station in Coronado, relieved the carrier George H.W. Bush in the Persian Gulf to continue the bombing mission of Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.      The Vinson’s air squadrons are from Naval Air Station Lemoore, near Fresno. The three destroyers and one cruiser with the Vinson are all from San Diego.      The U.S. and coalition partners have launched more than 600 airstrikes since Aug. 8.      @LATSandiego      @wjhenn             ||||| CAMP LEATHERNECK Afghanistan British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan on Sunday as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban.      Their coming departure leaves Afghanistan and its newly installed president, Ashraf Ghani, to deal almost unaided with an emboldened Taliban insurgency after the last foreign combat troops withdraw by year-end.      At the U.S. Camp Leatherneck and Britain's Camp Bastion, which lie next to each other in the southwestern province of Helmand, troops lowered the American and British flags for the final time on Sunday and folded them away.      The timing of their withdrawal has not been announced for security reasons.      Camp Leatherneck, the largest U.S. base to be handed over to Afghan control, and Camp Bastion together formed the international coalition's regional headquarters for the southwest of Afghanistan, housing up to 40,000 military personnel and civilian contractors.      But on Sunday, the base resembled a dust-swept ghost town of concrete blast walls, empty barracks and razor wire. Offices and bulletin boards, which once showed photo tributes to dead American and British soldiers, had been stripped.      \\"It's eerily empty,\\" said Lt. Will Davis, of the Queen's Dragoon Guards in the British Army. Camp Bastion was also where Prince Harry was based in 2012 as an Apache helicopter gunner.      In all, 2,210 American soldiers and 453 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001, when the U.S.-led coalition toppled the Taliban government for harboring al Qaeda after the militant group carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.      The coalition has been led by NATO since 2003, and includes forces from Germany, Italy, Jordan and Turkey.      After Sunday's ceremony, the Afghan National Army's 215th Corps will be headquartered at the 28 sq km (11 sq mile) base, leaving almost no foreign military presence in Helmand.      The U.S. military is leaving behind about 230 million worth of property and equipment –- including a major airstrip at the base, plus roads and buildings -- for the Afghan military.      \\"We gave them the maps to the place. We gave them the keys,\\" said Col. Doug Patterson, a Marine brigade commander in charge of logistics.      Speaking on BBC television, British Defense Minister Michael Fallon said British armed forces had helped to strengthen the Afghan security forces, who were now taking on \\"full responsibilities\\".      \\"It is with pride that we announce the end of UK combat operations in Helmand, having given Afghanistan the best possible chance of a stable future,\\" he said.      \\"CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC\\"      Helmand province, which produces 80-90 percent of the opium that helps finance the Taliban's insurgency, has seen fierce fighting this year, with Taliban and allied forces seeking to seize the district of Sangin from the Afghan army and police.      The battles have raised concerns about whether Afghan forces are truly able to hold off the Taliban without intelligence and air support from the United States and its allies.      Officials with the U.S.-led coalition say the Afghan forces, which have been losing hundreds of soldiers and policemen each month in battles, assassinations and suicide attacks by insurgents, did not lose any significant ground in the recent summer fighting season.      \\"I'm cautiously optimistic they will be able to sustain themselves,\\" said Brig. Gen Daniel Yoo, the commander of Regional Command (Southwest).      He said the success of the Afghan security forces depended on leadership, continued development of logistics and confidence.      \\"They've got to want it more than we do,\\" he said.      International forces in Afghanistan boosted their numbers to about 140,000 in 2010 troops with the aim of wresting control of Helmand back from the Taliban. By Jan. 1, that number will be about 12,500, comprising mostly trainers and advisers.      Of those, 9,800 will be American, with the rest from other NATO members. The British will keep a small contingent at an officer training school in Kabul.      Gen. John Campbell, head of coalition forces in Afghanistan, acknowledged Helmand \\"has been a very, very tough area\\" over the last several months.      \\"But we feel very confident with the Afghan security forces as they continue to grow in their capacity,\\" he said.      He said that the smaller international force that will remain next year will still provide some intelligence and air support, two areas where Afghan forces are weak.      General Sher Mohammad Karimi, chief of staff of the Afghan National Army, also said the insurgency \\"will keep us busy for a while\\".      \\"We have to do more until we are fully successful and satisfied with the situations,\\" he said.      Civilian casualties in Afghanistan may reach an all-time high this year, with the United Nations reporting nearly 5,000 killed or wounded in the first half of 2014, most of them by the insurgency.      Several Afghans at Sunday's ceremony expressed pride at taking over the base, mixed with sadness that the international forces with whom they have worked with for years are leaving for good.      \\"We are going to miss our friends,\\" said Afghan Brig. Gen. Nasim Sangin. \\"But we will still be in touch by email.\\"      (Writing by Raissa Kasolowsky; Editing by Michael Perry and Kevin Liffey) |||||Summary:","output":"The article reports on the death of a 19-year-old Marine, Lance Cpl.

Given the question: This article: Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice-president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16–19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students.The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional £1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s.The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a  visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales. contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the two individuals who conceived of a college for students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding?, what is it ?

In a heart-stopping moment, a boy and girl found themselves within metres of two deadly animals, forced to retreat to the safety of their car when one of the creatures growled and lunged at them. Body: Chance Encounter in the Wild: The day started off innocently enough as the children embarked on an exciting photography expedition in Kruger National Park, a vast wildlife reserve situated in South Africa. As they eagerly explored their surroundings, their cameras at the ready, their journey took an unexpected turn. The boy and girl ventured closer and closer to two fierce animals, each intent on capturing a once-in-a-lifetime photograph of these magnificent beings. The Perilous Approach: Without realizing the gravity of the situation, the children inched nearer to the animals, eventually coming within mere metres of them. Although eager to document their encounter with the wild creatures, they soon found themselves faced with a startling reality: one of the animals had no intention of playing nice. The male of the pair growled menacingly, its posture suggesting imminent aggression. A Hasty Retreat: Reacting quickly, the kids retreated to their car as the animal lunged at them. The male's growl and sudden movement indicated its displeasure at the children's intrusion, forcing them to abandon their earlier excitement. Their initial excitement quickly turned to fear, and their photography session was cut short as they sought the safety of their vehicle. The Takeaway: The harrowing encounter in Kruger National Park acts as a clear reminder that, although the beauty of the natural world is undeniably captivating, dangers lurk near at all times. In this instance, the children were fortunate to escape unharmed, but their story serves as a cautionary tale for all would-be photographers who dare to voyage into these awe-inspiring yet perilous landscapes. Conclusion: As the boy and girl regale family and friends with tales of their close call, they will likely reflect on their experience with a newfound appreciation for the power and unpredictability of nature. Although they had hoped to immortalize their awe-inspiring encounter with these deadly predators through their cameras, they were ultimately able to capture an unforgettable memory that no photograph could do justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Bill learned more about symbiotic associations, as he studied mycorrhiza. Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plant roots, where the fungi provide the plant with important nutrients like phosphorus and other minerals, while the plant supplies the fungi with carbohydrates and other organic compounds. This mutually beneficial relationship aids in the development and growth of both the organisms. On the other hand, Red studied hugelkultur, which is a horticultural technique involving the use of wood debris, such as fallen branches and logs, to create raised beds for plant growth. This technique improves soil fertility, water retention, and promotes decomposition, however, it does not inherently involve a symbiotic relationship between different organisms. While some symbiotic relationships may occur as a result of hugelkultur, they are not the primary focus of the technique.

He was born in Stoke Newington, London in spring 2003. He started up an Internet marble company where he sells the toys. And recently the 8-year-old student was written into the record books for being the youngest founder and chief executive officer   (CEO) of an Internet company.   Harli's love for marbles got rolling when he was 6. According to Tina, Harli's mother, he loved the colcorful toys so much that he would go to sleep talking about marbles and the first thing in the morning he did was talking about marbles. And his family started calling him \\"the Marble King\\".   \\"I like the patterns   and designs of marbles. You can collect hundreds of different color1s, shaps, and sizes. It's fun,\\" Harli told WR News. \\"And I really enjoy looking at them, touching them, holding them, studying them and playing them with my friends.\\"   Harli Jordean's marble company has a long history. After losing his marbles to an older boy, Harli and his mom turned to the Internet for ordering more marbles. However, they couldn't find a Web site that sold the toys. That gave Harli an idea-to start a Web site where people could find different types of marbles. With his family's help, Harli created a Web site that sells marbles and marble accessories. His collection includes tiny and large marbles, along with clear and color1ful ones.   Since starting his business, Harli has learned how to work with marble suppliers and fill orders. In the past two years, he's received orders from customers around the world. Some of the countries where he has sold the most marbles are Brazil, Italy, and the United States.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What caused Edison's Amberol cylinder to fail? Context: In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records. These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes. In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4½ minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile. Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them. Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing). A:","output":"The failure of Edison's Amberol cylinder was mainly caused by the competition of discs introduced during the 1910s. Despite Edison's attempts to increase the Amberol cylinder's playtime and the introduction of Blue Amberol Records with their less fragile plastic playing surface, disc records won the early format war decisively. This victory was facilitated further when in 1919, the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records expired, leading to an open field for a multitude of companies to produce them.
