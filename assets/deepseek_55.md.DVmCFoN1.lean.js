Отлично подготовленная еда, приятная обстановка и высокий уровень обслуживания делают рестораны идеальным местом для проведения различных мероприятий. Однако, чтобы ресторан успешно функционировал, необходима хорошо спланированная и эффективная организационная структура. В этой главе будет рассмотрено, каким образом осуществляется организация работы ресторана и какие ключевые элементы необходимо учитывать. 1.2 Определение организационной структуры Организационная структура ресторана представляет собой систему, которая определяет иерархию, подразделения и отношения между различными департаментами и сотрудниками. Она включает в себя не только вертикальную структуру (ланцюжок начальников), но и горизонтальные отношения (координация работы между отделами). 1.3 Командный и функциональный подходы Существует два основных подхода к организационной структуре ресторана: командный и функциональный. В командной организационной структуре весь персонал разделен на команды или бригады, каждая из которых обслуживает определенных гостей или зону. Функциональная структура основана на распределении обязанностей с учетом специализации: отдела по горячей кухне, бара, обслуживающего оборудования и т.д. 1.4 Линейная и штабная структуры Еще один аспект организационной структуры ресторана - это линейная и штабная структуры. Линейная структура означает, что есть прямая иерархия от начальника и до исполнителей, а штабная структура включает в себя службы поддержки, которые выполняют консультативные функции и помогают в принятии решений. 1.5 Основные подразделения ресторана Ресторан можно разделить на несколько основных подразделений, каждое из которых выполняет определенные функции: 1.5.1 Административное подразделение Административное подразделение ресторана включает в себя руководство, менеджеров разных уровней и главного бухгалтера. Эти сотрудники занимаются управлением ресторана, разработкой бизнес-стратегии, контролем финансов и другими административными задачами. 1.5.2 Кулинарное подразделение Кулинарное подразделение отвечает за приготовление и подачу блюд. Оно включает в себя поваров, пекарей, су-шефа, поваров горячего и холодного цехов, а также других сотрудников, связанных с производством пищи. 1.5.3 Обслуживающее подразделение Обслуживающее подразделение предоставляет высокий уровень обслуживания, включая официантов, барменов, бариста. Оно отвечает за приветливый прием гостей, предоставление меню, организацию заказов и обслуживание в течение всего посещения. 1.5.4 Управленческое подразделение Управленческое подразделение занимается управлением ресторана. К нему относятся менеджеры по персоналу, операционный менеджер, менеджеры по закупкам и т.д. Они управляют процессами, связанными с управлением ресторана, такими как найм и обучение сотрудников, закупки продуктов, составление графика работы и т.д. 1.6 Основные принципы организационной структуры ресторана Организационная структура ресторана должна быть гибкой и приспосабливаться к меняющимся потребностям и рыночным условиям. Эффективная организационная структура должна учитывать следующие аспекты: 1.6.1 Ясность и четкость иерархии Должна быть ясная и четкая иерархия, с определенными линиями ответственности и коммуникации между работниками разных уровней. Это позволяет избежать недоразумений и гарантирует эффективную командную работу. 1.6.2 Распределение обязанностей Каждый сотрудник должен знать свои обязанности и роли в команде. Это помогает избежать перекрытия задач и повышает производительность и эффективность работы. 1.6.3 Коммуникация Эффективная коммуникация является ключевым фактором в успешной организационной структуре ресторана. Сотрудники должны иметь возможность общаться между собой и с руководством, чтобы передавать информацию, делиться идеями и решать проблемы. 1.6.4 Формирование команды Формирование сильных и дружных команд - это еще один важный аспект организационной структуры ресторана. Каждая команда должна быть сплоченной и работать в согласовании друг с другом для достижения общих целей. 1.7 Заключение Организационная структура ресторана играет важную роль в его успехе. Грамотно спроектированная структура позволяет эффективно управлять персоналом, обеспечивать высокий уровень обслуживания и достигать поставленных целей. Важно грамотно отнестись к выбору подходящего типа структуры, а также учесть основные принципы ее организации."},{"instruction":"Freedom planet, Sonic and naruto all characters read the book jiraiya write. all blushes deeply","output":"As the characters from Freedom Planet, Sonic, and Naruto sat together, a peculiar book caught their attention. It was a book written by Jiraiya, a renowned author and ninja, known for his rather notorious works. Intrigued by its reputation, they decided to read it together. As they delved into the pages, their expressions changed from curiosity to shock, then finally to deep blushing. The words on the pages seemed to ignite hidden feelings within each character, causing their faces to turn a shade of crimson. Lilac from Freedom Planet, usually brave and composed, found herself blushing uncontrollably as she encountered romantic chapters that awakened emotions she hadn't even realized she possessed. It was as if the book had uncovered a secret side of her heart. Sonic, the ever-confident hedgehog, couldn't help but feel his cheeks turn rosy as he stumbled upon passages that depicted steamy narratives. The speedy blue hero couldn't deny the lure of these unexpected tales that had his heart racing in more ways than one, causing an adorable blush to spread across his face. Meanwhile, the characters from Naruto, including Naruto himself, Sakura, and Sasuke, found their faces flushed as they read the book's passionate descriptions. The hidden desires and undeniable connections between characters within the book resonated with their own complex dynamics, resulting in profound reactions impossible to ignore. Amidst their blushing, the characters shared embarrassed glances, realizing they were all experiencing similar emotional responses. It was as if Jiraiya's words had opened a secret realm where their hearts were laid bare, revealing vulnerabilities they had kept hidden from one another. Though different worlds collided within these pages, connecting their fictional realities, the characters couldn't deny the impact of Jiraiya's writing. Their shared embarrassment created a unique bond, as they now understood each other in a way they never had before. From that day forward, whenever Freedom Planet, Sonic, and Naruto crossed paths, there would always be a secret understanding, a hidden connection that brought warmth to their blushing faces. And they owed it all to the enticing pages of the book that Jiraiya had penned."},{"instruction":"你是计算机教育方面的专家。我现在在评审计算机教育方面的英文学术论文。请你提供几个评审意见的模版给我。","output":"当评审计算机教育方面的英文学术论文时，可以使用以下模板作为参考： 1. 审稿人总体评价: 论文对于计算机教育领域具有重要价值。已提供了有益且实质性的研究，对于学术界和实践工作者都具有启发作用。 2. 论文结构和组织: 论文结构清晰、有条理，并与计算机教育相关的话题紧密联系。但可能需要进一步优化论文的组织方式以增强逻辑性和连贯性。 3. 文章贡献: 论文的贡献点明确，对计算机教育领域的实践或理论研究具有积极意义。然而，论文的贡献度可能需要更深入的阐述或展示。 4. 方法与实验: 研究方法的描述清晰，实验设计合理并遵循科学标准。然而，可能需要更全面地描述实验设置和实验数据的收集过程，以增加论文的可重复性和可验证性。 5. 文献综述: 论文的文献综述详实并覆盖了相关领域的重要工作。无论在文献引用的数量和质量上都表现出了专业的态度。 6. 结果和讨论: 对结果和讨论进行了深入的解读和分析，与相关研究进行了比较，并提供了有力的论证支持。但可能需要更清晰地解释结果的实际意义和影响。 7. 写作和语言表达: 论文写作准确、清晰，并遵循学术规范，没有明显的语言或语法错误。然而，可能需要进一步审查以提高句子结构和表达的流畅性。 8. 进一步改进: 建议作者对论文进行进一步改进，比如扩展实验范围、增加案例研究或深入讨论研究结果的实际应用。此外，还可提供针对论文中存在的局限性和不足之处的改进建议。 以上模板可根据具体论文的情况进行适当调整和修改。同时，还应注意在评审中秉持客观、公正的原则，并遵循学术评审的道德规范。"},{"instruction":"你是计算机教育方面的专家。我现在在评审计算机教育方面的英文学术论文。请你提供几个英语的评审意见的模版给我。","output":"As an expert in the field of computer education, I can provide you with a few English template suggestions for reviewing academic papers in computer education: 1.

Шаги алгоритма: 1. Генерация ключа: - Пользователь выбирает желаемую длину ключа (128, 192 или 256 бит). - Используется криптографически-стойкая псевдослучайная функция для генерации ключа заданной длины. 2. Шифрование: - При шифровании используется блочный шифр, - Входные данные разбиваются на блоки фиксированного размера (например, 128 бит). - Каждый блок шифруется независимо от остальных. 3. Дополнительная защита: - Для дополнительной безопасности данных осуществляется смешивание между блоками шифротекста. - Применяется алгоритм, основанный на принципах и методах из ГОСТов и других алгоритмов шифрования, который вносит дополнительные преобразования между блоками шифротекста. - Это может включать в себя перестановки, замены, применение нелинейных функций и другие операции, чтобы усилить общую стойкость алгоритма. 4. Расшифрование: - Алгоритм расшифрования обратен алгоритму шифрования. - Применяется зеркальная последовательность операций, чтобы расшифровать блоки шифротекста и восстановить исходные данные. Преимущества ECEA: - Комбинирование принципов и методов из разных ГОСТов и алгоритмов шифрования обеспечивает более высокую стойкость и надежность алгоритма. - Использование блочного шифра AES для шифрования предоставляет преимущества, такие как скорость работы и широкая поддержка в различных системах. - Дополнительные защитные меры, такие как смешивание между блоками шифротекста, усиливают стойкость алгоритма. - Генерация ключа с использованием криптографически-стойкой псевдослучайной функции обеспечивает безопасность ключевой информации.","output":"Вот пример реализации данного шифра на Python: \`\`\`python import os from Crypto.Cipher import AES def generate_key(key_length): # Генерация случайного ключа заданной длины key = os.urandom(int(key_length/8)) return key def encrypt(plaintext, key): # Инициализация шифратора AES с заданным ключом cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB) ciphertext = b'' block_size = 16 # Размер блока шифрования # Шифрование блоков данных for i in range(0, len(plaintext), block_size): block = plaintext[i:i+block_size] # Добавление дополнения для блоков меньшей длины if len(block) < block_size: block += b'x00' * (block_size - len(block)) encrypted_block = cipher.encrypt(block) ciphertext += encrypted_block return ciphertext def decrypt(ciphertext, key): # Инициализация дешифратора AES с заданным ключом cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB) plaintext = b'' block_size = 16 # Размер блока шифрования # Дешифрование блоков данных for i in range(0, len(ciphertext), block_size): block = ciphertext[i:i+block_size] decrypted_block = cipher.decrypt(block) plaintext += decrypted_block return plaintext.rstrip(b'x00') key_length = int(input(\\"Введите длину ключа (128, 192 или 256 бит): \\")) plaintext = input(\\"Введите текст для шифрования: \\").encode() # Генерация ключа key = generate_key(key_length) # Шифрование текста ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, key) print(\\"Зашифрованный текст:\\", ciphertext) # Расшифрование текста decrypted_text = decrypt(ciphertext, key) print(\\"Расшифрованный текст:\\", decrypted_text.decode()) \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что для работы кода необходимо установить библиотеку \`pycryptodome\` (ее можно установить с помощью команды \`pip install pycryptodome\`). Также в коде предполагается, что входной текст представлен в виде байтовой строки."},{"instruction":"улучшить стойкость и надежность вашего кода шифрования","output":"Для улучшения стойкости и надежности кода шифрования можно внести следующие изменения: 1. Использовать режим шифрования, отличный от ECB. ECB не рекомендуется использовать для шифрования больших объемов данных, так как он сохраняет структуру исходных данных и может раскрывать определенные паттерны в шифротексте. Вместо этого, рекомендуется использовать режимы, такие как CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) или CTR (Counter Mode), которые обеспечивают более высокую стойкость. 2. Добавить инициализационные векторы (IV) в режим шифрования. IV представляет собой случайное значение, которое применяется вместе с ключом для инициализации шифрования в режимах, таких как CBC или CTR. Он обеспечивает дополнительную случайность и независимость шифрования различных блоков данных. 3. Применить аутентификацию сообщений. Добавление аутентификации к шифрованию помогает предотвратить атаки, такие как подмена или изменение шифротекста. Это можно сделать с помощью алгоритма аутентифицированного шифрования, такого как GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), который обеспечивает как шифрование, так и аутентификацию данных. 4. Учитывать возможность работать с большими объемами данных. Вместо шифрования целого файла или текста целиком, можно реализовать шифрование по блокам (stream cipher). Это позволит обрабатывать данные поблочно, что полезно при работе с большими файлами или потоками данных. 5. Зашифровать ключ шифрования. Для повышения безопасности, ключ шифрования можно зашифровать другим ключом или паролем, который изначально запрашивается у пользователя. Это обеспечит дополнительную защиту ключа и предотвратит его незаконное использование. 6. При работе с паролями, рекомендуется использовать хэширование паролей, такие как bcrypt или PBKDF2, а не использовать их напрямую в качестве ключей шифрования. 7. Важно обратить внимание на обработку ошибок и исключений. Добавьте проверки в код для обнаружения и обработки ошибок, таких как неверная длина ключа или неверный режим шифрования. Улучшенный код, учитывающий эти рекомендации, может выглядеть следующим образом: \`\`\`python import os from Crypto.Cipher import AES from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes def generate_key(key_length): # Генерация случайного ключа заданной длины key = os.urandom(int(key_length/8)) return key def encrypt(plaintext, key): # Генерация случайного IV iv = get_random_bytes(16) # Инициализация шифратора AES в режиме CBC с заданным ключом и IV cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) # Добавление паддинга к тексту для обеспечения фиксированного размера блока padded_plaintext = pad(plaintext, 16) # Шифрование текста ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(padded_plaintext) # Возвращение IV вместе с шифротекстом return iv + ciphertext def decrypt(ciphertext, key): # Разделение IV от шифротекста iv = ciphertext[:16] ciphertext = ciphertext[16:] # Инициализация дешифратора AES в режиме CBC с заданным ключом и IV cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) # Дешифрование текста decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext) # Удаление паддинга с помощью функции unpad plaintext = unpad(decrypted_text, 16) return plaintext key_length = int(input(\\"Введите длину ключа (128, 192 или 256 бит): \\")) plaintext = input(\\"Введите текст для шифрования: \\").encode() # Генерация ключа key = generate_key(key_length) # Шифрование текста ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, key) print(\\"Зашифрованный текст:\\", ciphertext) # Расшифрование текста decrypted_text = decrypt(ciphertext, key) print(\\"Расшифрованный текст:\\", decrypted_text.decode()) \`\`\` Обновленный код реализует режим CBC с использованием случайного IV и добавляет паддинг перед шифрованием для обеспечения фиксированного размера блока.

His name strikes terror into the hearts of those who dare speak it. He is none other than Silas Draven, a supervillain whose infamy echoes throughout the world. Silas Draven, once known as a prodigious scientist, possessed an intellect unparalleled in his time. Born into a world where his brilliance was both his curse and his saving grace, he quickly outgrew his conventional peers. However, the weight of his brilliance became a burden that twisted his mind to the point of a dark metamorphosis. Driven by a fervent desire to prove his intellectual supremacy, Silas embarked on a perilous journey that tore him away from the realm of morality. His once-gentle gaze became hardened, his noble thoughts devolved into depraved obsessions, and his heart, once filled with compassion, withered into an abyss of unquenchable malice. After a string of scientific marvels bestowed upon a grateful society, Silas's dark descent spiraled uncontrollably. Betrayed by those closest to him, the venomous sting of betrayal ignited a wildfire within his soul. Consumed by rage, he unveiled a hidden lair beneath his innocent façade, where he perfected sinister inventions suited only for the demented and wicked. Fearlessly defying the boundaries of science, Silas unleashed a reign of terror upon the world. His ingeniously malevolent machinery wrought chaos everywhere it touched, leaving ordinary lives shattered in its wake. With his skillful manipulation of science and insatiable thirst for power, Silas became an unstoppable force of destruction. Citizens cowered in dread as rumors of his dark reign spread far and wide. Justice, however, proves relentless even in the dimmest of moments. Cornered by the determined forces of good, Silas Draven was captured and locked away deep within the walls of Black Dolphin Prison, a fortress designed to contain the most dangerous villains humanity had ever known. Yet, like a venomous serpent, Silas was not easily contained. Whispered rumors spoke of his unparalleled intellect, enabling him to construct elaborate plans for his escape. Months turned into years as he tirelessly calculated his every move, exploiting the vulnerabilities of his captors and manipulating the strings of his followers from the inside. One fateful night, the darkness became complicit in his freedom. When the guards least expected it, Silas Draven embraced the shadows that danced before him, slipping through their iron-clad grip like a phantom. His escape was a tapestry of calculated chaos—a symphony of destruction and precise violence that left the prison's security in tatters. Now, the world trembles as Silas Draven once again pierces the veil of obscurity. His tale is etched in blood, and his name haunts the dreams of those who remember. He stands as a reminder that even the brightest minds are susceptible to the allure of malevolence, and that true evil lingers in the shadows, ever watchful, ever scheming."},{"instruction":"do u have any questions about yourself","output":"As an AI, I do not have personal characteristics or identity.

How different would things be? What advantages and prospects are now open to the Vikings with not just access to sail the Red Sea, but potentially access to the routes of the Maritime Silk Road that existed at that time?","output":"If the Vikings had managed to sail across the Isthmus of Suez and gain access to the Red Sea, it would have opened up a wealth of new opportunities for them. Let's explore some potential advantages and prospects that would be available to the Vikings in this scenario: 1. Trade with the East: Access to the Red Sea would provide the Vikings with a direct route to trade with the civilizations and empires of the East, including those along the Maritime Silk Road. They could establish trading posts, exchange goods, and benefit from the lucrative trade networks that existed in the region at that time. 2. New Goods and Resources: The Maritime Silk Road facilitated the exchange of goods, technologies, and knowledge across vast distances. The Vikings would have the chance to acquire diverse and exotic products from the East, such as spices, silk, precious metals, gemstones, ceramics, and more. These valuable resources would give them an economic advantage and potentially increase their influence. 3. Cultural Exchange and Learning: Contact with the civilizations along the Maritime Silk Road would expose the Vikings to new ideas, philosophies, religions, and technologies. This exchange of knowledge and culture could lead to the Vikings adopting new practices, adapting foreign technologies, and expanding their intellectual horizons. 4. Naval Dominance: With access to the Red Sea and potential involvement in the Maritime Silk Road, the Vikings would gain a strategic advantage in terms of naval power. Their shipbuilding skills and expertise in navigation would position them as formidable maritime players, enabling them to establish dominance in the Red Sea and possibly project their power beyond. 5. Political Influence: Through trade and cultural exchange, the Vikings might establish diplomatic relationships and alliances with the empires and kingdoms of the East. This could provide them with political leverage and potentially open up opportunities for collaboration, military support, or even territorial expansion. 6. Economic Growth: Expanding their trade routes and engaging in commerce with the East would significantly boost the Vikings' economy. Increased wealth from trade would allow them to invest in infrastructure, sponsor exploration, support the arts, and strengthen their military forces. This economic growth could lead to the rise of Viking cities and the consolidation of their power and influence. 7. Technological Advances: Access to the Maritime Silk Road would expose the Vikings to advanced technologies from the East. They could potentially adopt new shipbuilding techniques, navigation instruments, agricultural practices, architectural styles, and more. These technological advancements could revolutionize various aspects of Viking society and accelerate their development. While it is challenging to predict the exact outcome of such a scenario, it is safe to say that the Vikings would have gained tremendous advantages and prospects with access to the Red Sea and the routes of the Maritime Silk Road. It could have altered their trajectory, expanding their influence, strengthening their civilization, and potentially changing the course of history."},{"instruction":"What are the cons of having a telecom tower near my home","output":"1. Health concerns: Some people believe that living near a telecom tower can expose them to harmful electromagnetic radiation, which can lead to health issues such as headaches, sleep disturbance, and an increased risk of cancer. However, scientific studies have mostly indicated that the levels of radiation emitted from telecom towers are within safe limits and do not pose a significant health risk. 2. Decreased property values: Having a telecom tower near your home can potentially lower property values. Some buyers may be hesitant to invest in properties near telecom towers due to perceived health concerns or aesthetic reasons, leading to a potential decrease in market value. 3. Visual impact: Telecom towers are often tall and can be visually obtrusive, especially if they are installed in close proximity to residential areas. This can negatively affect the aesthetic appeal of the surrounding landscape and residential neighborhoods. 4. Noise pollution: Depending on the design and location of the tower, it may generate some noise. The humming or buzzing sound can be an annoyance to people living nearby, especially during quiet hours or in residential areas where peace and tranquility are valued. 5. NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) opposition: Some residents may have a general aversion to having a telecom tower near their homes. This can lead to community opposition, protests, or legal challenges, making the installation process complex and lengthy. 6. Environmental impact: Depending on the construction process and maintenance activities, a telecom tower may have a slight impact on the local environment. This can include clearing vegetation, potential harm to local wildlife, or disturbance during maintenance and repairs. It's important to note that many of these concerns can vary depending on local regulations, tower design, and community perspectives. Additionally, advancements in technology have led to smaller tower designs and improved integration with the local landscape, reducing some of these cons."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Gray III 30th Street Station, ist der Zentralbahnhof von Philadelphia im US-Bundesstaat Pennsylvania. Der Personen- und Betriebsbahnhof im Westen der Stadt gehört zum Nordost-Korridor und zählt zu den wichtigen Netzknoten im Personennah- und -fernverkehr an der Ostküste der USA. Sein Empfangsgebäude im Stil des Neoklassizismus gilt als einer der letzten prestigeträchtigen Bahnhofsbauten einer privaten Eisenbahngesellschaft in den Vereinigten Staaten., Der Bahnhof wurde 1929 und 1933 in zwei Etappen eröffnet und war über mehrere Jahrzehnte hinweg der zentrale Knotenbahnhof der Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in der Region. Seit Stilllegung der innerstädtischen Zentralbahnhöfe ihrer einstigen Konkurrenten wie der Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Passenger Station fungiert 30thStreet als alleinige Drehscheibe für den Eisenbahn-Fernverkehr in Philadelphia. Derzeit (2009) bedienen die Amtrak, die Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) und die New Jersey Transit den Bahnhof im Schienenverkehr. Eigentümerin ist die Amtrak., Namensgebung., Mehrere verschiedene Namen sind für den Bahnhof in Gebrauch. Dies liegt zum einen an der Vielzahl zeitlich vorangehender Bahnstationen an jenem Ort, zum anderen an mehreren Eigentümerwechseln im Laufe der Jahrzehnte. Außerdem nutzen die am Bahnhof verkehrenden Gesellschaften unterschiedliche Namen., Bei der Amtrak heißt der Bahnhof \\"Philadelphia\\" oder auch \\"Philadelphia – 30thStreet Station\\"; auf den Stationsschildern steht \\"Philadelphia\\". Auch New Jersey Transit benutzt diesen Namen. Die SEPTA nennt ihn– wie auch die örtliche Bevölkerung– \\"30th Street Station\\", wie auf den Schildern der zugehörigen Bahnsteige zu lesen ist., In historischem Kontext ist der Bahnhof noch unter folgenden Namen bekannt:, Lage und Verkehrsanbindung., Die 30th Street Station liegt etwa 1,5Kilometer westlich des Stadtzentrums (City Hall) am Westufer des Schuylkill zwischen dem Schuylkill Expressway und der 32ndStreet. Die Bahnanlagen erstrecken sich dabei zwischen der Spring Garden Street im Norden und der Chestnut Street im Süden auf eine Länge von etwa 1,2Kilometern in Nord-Süd-Richtung sowie auf etwa 600Metern in der Breite. Das Empfangsgebäude mit den Personenbahnsteigen befindet sich in der südöstlichen Ecke des Areals unmittelbar nördlich der Market Street. Es besitzt zwei Bahnsteigebenen, die sich in rechtem Winkel kreuzen., Die Gleise der unteren Ebene verlaufen in Nord-Süd-Richtung. Sie liegen im Bereich des Empfangsgebäudes unter Straßenniveau und führen unter besagtem Gebäude hindurch. Die obere Ebene verläuft unmittelbar nördlich des Empfangsgebäudes in West-Ost-Richtung und liegt über Straßenniveau, so dass insgesamt drei Verkehrsebenen entstehen. Das südliche Gleisfeld der unteren Ebene ist größtenteils eingehaust und überbaut. Die Gleisanlagen sind nahezu vollständig mittels Oberleitung elektrifiziert., Schiene., Die untere Ebene gehört zum Northeast Corridor. Seine Gleise führen in nördlicher Richtung nach New York City und in südlicher Richtung nach WashingtonD.C. Über die nördliche Ausfahrt gelangt man außerdem auf die Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line nach Harrisburg sowie zur Delair Bridge, die am Nordrand der Stadt über den Delaware hinüber nach Camden führt. Darüber hinaus sind in beiden Richtungen noch einige Nebenstrecken zu erreichen., Die östliche Ausfahrt der oberen Ebene führt unmittelbar auf eine Brücke über den Schuylkill und weiter Richtung Center City Commuter Connection, der unterirdischen Stammstrecke der Regionalbahnen der SEPTA durch die Innenstadt. Auf der anderen Seite gabelt sich die Ausfahrt unmittelbar westlich des Empfangsgebäudes in zwei halbdirekte Verbindungskurven. Diese führen in entgegengesetzte Richtungen zum Northeast Corridor hinunter. Die südliche Rampe verläuft dabei in einem Tunnel unterhalb der 32ndStreet., In Höhe der 31stStreet überspannt die West Philadelphia Elevated die Gleisanlagen in Süd-Nord-Richtung. Das Eisenbahnviadukt mit 8140Fuß (2481Metern) Länge und geschätzten zehn Metern Höhe führt von der Nord- zur Südausfahrt des Bahnhofs. Es verbindet dabei einige „einmündende“ Güterbahnen miteinander, besitzt aber seit einigen Jahren keine Gleisverbindungen zum Northeast Corridor mehr., Straße., Der Bahnhof liegt an der Kreuzung zweier wichtiger innerstädtischer Verkehrsachsen, des Schuylkill Expressway alias Interstate76 mit der Market Street, die hier die Pennsylvania State Route 3 bildet. Die Autobahn verläuft dabei auf der unteren Ebene in Nord-Süd-Richtung und östlich parallel zu den Gleisen direkt am Schuylkill entlang. Sie ist im Bereich des Empfangsgebäudes mit einer Galerie eingehaust und mit einer Uferstraße überbaut. An den Enden der Einhausung befinden sich Ausfahrten in Form von Parallelrampen, die von der Autobahn auf die Straßenebene hinaufführen., Die Market Street verläuft südlich des Empfangsgebäudes in Ost-West-Richtung und überquert in ihrem Verlauf den Schuylkill auf einer Brücke. Zwischen dieser Brücke und der Eisenbahnbrücke der oberen Gleisebene auf der Nordseite gibt es noch eine dritte Brücke. Sie gehört zum John F. Kennedy Boulevard und ist auf die Symmetrieachse des Empfangsgebäudes ausgerichtet., Das Empfangsgebäude wird von der Arch Street im Norden, der 30thStreet im Westen, der Market Street im Süden und der Uferstraße oberhalb der Autobahn, der Schuylkill Avenue, umrahmt. Die Straßen um das Gebäude herum sind mit Ausnahme der Market Street als Einbahnstraßen eingerichtet, so dass ein Kreisverkehr im Gegenuhrzeigersinn entsteht., Nördlich des Empfangsgebäudes befindet sich ein großes Parkhaus der Amtrak. Daneben existieren eine Parkgarage mit Bedienung \\"(valet parking)\\" im Empfangsgebäude selbst sowie eine Reihe weiterer Parkplätze direkt am Gebäude entlang jener Einbahnstraßen. Der Taxistand befindet sich auf der Ostseite., Innerstädtischer Nahverkehr., Bahn., Der Bahnhof ist über die Station \\"30th Street\\" der Market–Frankford Line und der Subway–Surface Lines an das innerstädtische Schnellbahnnetz angeschlossen. Die Station befindet sich südwestlich des Empfangsgebäudes unterhalb der Market Street. Sie besitzt vier Bahnsteiggleise in West-Ost-Richtung, wobei die inneren beiden von der Market–Frankford Line und die äußeren von den Subway–Surface Lines befahren werden. Die U-Bahn-Züge halten an einem langen Hochbahnsteig in Mittellage, die Subway–Surface Lines an zwei kürzeren, außen liegenden, niedrigen Seitenbahnsteigen. Der Haupteingang befindet sich in einem länglichen Flachbau Market Ecke 30thStreet. Ein Verbindungstunnel von der Verteilerebene zur Schalterhalle des Empfangsgebäudes wurde aus Sicherheitsgründen verschlossen. Der U-Bahnhof bietet von der Innenstadt aus gesehen die letzte von insgesamt drei Umsteigemöglichkeiten zwischen der Market–Frankford Line und den Subway–Surface Lines., Bus., Neben der U-Bahn verkehren an der 30th Street Station mehrere innerstädtische Buslinien sowie zwei Regionalbuslinien nach Chesterbrook, King of Prussia und Valley Forge. Die Linienwege folgen im Bereich des Bahnhofs den umgebenden Einbahnstraßen und führen dementsprechend im Gegenuhrzeigersinn um das Gebäude herum. Die Haltestellen befinden sich auf der West- und Ostseite, jeweils an den dem Empfangsgebäude gegenüberliegenden Gehsteigen., Architektur., Empfangsgebäude., Das Empfangsgebäude ist ein Monumentalbau im Stil des Neoklassizismus unter Verwendung von Art-déco-Elementen. Es wurde von Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White entworfen und in den Jahren 1929 bis 1933 erbaut. Es besitzt einen kreuzförmigen Grundriss, wobei der Längsbau in Nord-Süd-Richtung verläuft und 637Fuß (194,2Meter) misst. Dieser wird von einem mittig angeordneten, ihn in Breite und Höhe überragenden Querbau unterbrochen. Dieser wiederum misst 327Fuß (99,7Meter) und besitzt an beiden Enden korinthische Säulenvorhallen mit je sechs Säulen und zwei Eckpfeilern, die zusammen die beiden Haupteingänge markieren. Die Fassade ist zur Gänze mit Alabama-Kalkstein verkleidet, die Fenster rundherum sind in vertikal verlaufenden Nischen angeordnet. Die Dachkante ringsum ist dem Gebälk antiker Tempelbauten nachempfunden., Sowohl Längs- als auch Querbau haben Flachdächer. Der Längsbau verfügt über insgesamt fünf Etagen, wobei nur das Erdgeschoss durchgezogen ist. Darüber liegen auf beiden Seiten vier u-förmige Büroetagen, die jeweils einen großen, von außen unsichtbaren Lichthof zum Querbau hin einrahmen. Das Dach des Querbaus ist durchgezogen und war ursprünglich als Landebahn für Kleinflugzeuge gedacht., Der Querbau beherbergt den Wartesaal und damit nur einen einzigen, großen Raum. Dieser misst 290 auf 135Fuß (88,4 auf 41,1Meter). Die Wände sind 95Fuß (29Meter) hoch und mit Marmor und Travertin verkleidet. Oben ist eine Kassettendecke angebracht. Der Raum verfügt wegen der Lichthöfe auf allen vier Seiten über annähernd raumhohe Fenster. Die Eingangstüren an den Stirnseiten werden von je sechs raumhohen Säulen eingerahmt, die mit den außen stehenden fluchten. Über den Türen befinden sich in Höhe der ersten Etage Laufstege, die die beiden Teile des Längsbaus miteinander verbinden. Von der Decke hängen in zwei Reihen je fünf große, schlanke bronzene Leuchter herab., Am östlichen Ende des Wartesaals steht die Skulptur „Angel of the Resurrection“ (deutsch: \\"„Engel der Wiederauferstehung“\\") von Walker Hancock zur Erinnerung an die Gefallenen der Pennsylvania Railroad aus dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. In einem Nebenraum zeigt das Terrakotta-Relief „Spirit of Transportation“ (deutsch in etwa: \\"„Der Geist des Verkehrswesens“\\") von Karl Bitter Motive aus der Entwicklungsgeschichte des Verkehrswesens., Die beiden Flügel des Längsbaus werden gewerblich genutzt.

在这个盛夏的暑期，我有幸参加了一次意义非凡的社会实践活动。通过这次实践，我深刻感受到了社会的多样性和复杂性，更明白了自己所处的角色和责任。在与各种人和事的交往过程中，我既受到了挑战，也收获了成长，把握住了性格的转变和人生的升华。在这5000字以上的篇幅里，我将真情实感地向大家陈述这次实践的经历和我的收获。 在这次暑期实践过程中，我参与了一项地区公益项目，我所在的社区组织了一次针对留守儿童的帮扶活动。我们小组分为了几个小队，每个小队都被分配了一些留守儿童进行帮助和陪伴。刚开始的时候，我对于留守儿童的处境并没有真正的了解，只是抱着一种好奇和参与的想法。但是，随着活动的进行，我渐渐发现他们所面临的困境和问题是如此的多样化和复杂化。有的孩子因为家庭条件的限制，无法享受到良好的教育资源；有的孩子因为父母长期外出打工，缺乏家庭的关爱和陪伴；还有一些孩子因为生活的艰难，早早地成为了家里的顶梁柱。在面对这些问题时，我深感自己的内心产生了巨大的冲击和震动。 我们小队的工作主要是对留守儿童进行心理疏导和学习辅导。刚开始时，我们与孩子们的交流并不理想，他们对我们这些陌生人充满了戒备和疑虑。与此同时，我们发现孩子们的心灵已经被封闭了太久，他们需要更多的关爱和安慰。于是我们决定转变策略，用亲切的态度和真诚的心去对待这些孩子。通过一系列了解他们的游戏和活动，我们逐渐与孩子们建立起了信任和友谊。他们开始敞开心扉，向我们诉说他们内心的恐惧和希望。 在为期一个月的实践过程中，我将陪伴留守儿童的时间分成了几个阶段。首先，是了解和接触阶段，在这个阶段里，我花了很多时间去跟他们聊天，去了解他们的生活和成长环境。通过这个了解的阶段，我发现了他们的阳光和善良，也引发了我对他们的深深同情。第二个阶段是疏导和辅导阶段，我们通过与孩子们的谈心活动，帮助他们克服内心的困扰和焦虑。通过提供激励和支持，他们逐渐树立了积极向上的态度，变得更加自信和勇敢。最后一个阶段是对他们的鼓励和扶持，通过学习和游戏的方式，我们帮助他们提升学习成绩和多样化的技能。 在这个过程中，我深刻地感受到了自己的成长和进步。作为一个21世纪的新时代青年，我的未来充满了机遇和挑战。通过这次实践，我不仅加强了自己的动手能力和沟通能力，更重要的是，我树立起了一种责任感和奉献精神。我明白了自己不仅仅是一个对社会有贡献的个体，更是一个具有社会责任感和使命感的竭诚服务的志愿者。 在与留守儿童们的相处中，我发现了他们独特的价值和无限的潜力。他们可能没有丰富的物质生活，但他们拥有一颗宝贵的心灵。他们对于知识的渴望、对于成长的努力，让我深感震撼。因此，我决定将来利用自己的专业知识和资源，为他们提供更多的帮助和扶持。我相信，只要给予他们更多的关爱和机会，他们定能绽放出属于他们自己的光芒。 在这次实践中，我还深深体会到了团队的协作和合作的重要性。在面对各种困难和挑战时，我们小队紧密团结，相互帮助，共同克服了各种困难。通过相互之间的交流和合作，我们充分利用了各自的优势和互补的能力，使得整个项目取得了圆满的成功。这次实践也让我明白，一个人的力量是有限的，只有团队的力量才能够取得更大的成就，实现更宏伟的目标。 总而言之，这次暑期社会实践让我受益匪浅。通过与留守儿童的交流和互动，我不仅学到了知识和技能，也理解了社会的多样性和复杂性。我也思考了自己的责任和使命，决心将来为留守儿童们提供更多的帮助和关爱。我也清楚地认识到，只有团结协作，才能够取得更大的成就。这次实践让我找到了自己的方向和目标，也让我更加坚定地朝着自己的梦想前进。将来，我希望能够成为一个为社会做贡献的人，利用自己的专业知识和力量，为社会的进步和和谐做出自己的努力。愿留守儿童们能够获得更多的关爱和机会，展开美好的人生旅程。"},{"instruction":"帮我写一篇暑假三下乡去敬老院进行社会实践活动的总结感悟","output":"暑假三下乡社会实践活动总结感悟 暑假期间，我参加了一次难忘的社会实践活动——赴敬老院进行志愿服务活动。这次实践经历让我对社会充满了敬意和感激之情，也让我领悟到了尊老、爱老的重要性。在接触与陪伴孤寡老人的过程中，我从他们身上学到了很多珍贵的人生智慧，感受到了社会大家庭中的温暖和关怀。下面我将以真情实感，分享这次实践给我带来的深刻感悟。 去敬老院参与志愿服务的那一刻起，我就被那里充满人情味和温馨的氛围所吸引。敬老院里寿命长、健康状况较差的老人们都表现出了一种踏实和平和的精神状态，他们脸上透露出了对生活的满足和对待人生的积极态度。这让我想到了很多曾经如日中天的年轻人，他们或极富财富、或地位显赫，却忽视了对待老人的尊重和关心。在这个社会中，年轻人似乎活在自己的世界里，忽略了老人们曾经奉献给社会的辛勤努力。 在这次志愿服务中，我主要担任了陪伴老人、聆听他们的希望和困惑的角色。刚开始时，老人们对于我们这些陌生的面孔有些疑惑和严肃。但通过与他们的交谈和互动，我逐渐赢得了他们的信任和喜爱。他们向我倾诉着他们的故事和他们内心的感受，我也用真挚的心去聆听，给予他们我所能提供的安慰和鼓励。在交流中，我发现老人们内心都有一种深深的渴望，希望自己的意见能够得到重视，希望自己的尊严能够得到保护。这让我更加明白了老人们需要关爱和尊重的重要性，也激起了我内心对这一群体的责任感和关怀之情。 在这次实践活动中，我还亲身感受到了老年人面临的身体和心理困境。由于年老体衰，老人们往往面临着生活自理能力下降、日常活动受限等实际问题。而对于某些心理困扰，他们可能更是无人倾诉。通过与他们的深入交流，我明白了年幼时代心理的重要性以及良好的家庭支持对于他们来说有多么重要。同时，我也了解到老年人在年老后可能会面临孤独和无助的困境。这让我意识到自己将来需要更多关心身边的老人，帮助他们度过晚年的艰难时光。 这次实践活动还让我深刻体会到了团队的合作和协作的重要性。在志愿队伍中，每个人都发挥着自己独特的能力和特长，共同协作完成任务。我们保持着良好的沟通和配合，大家都满怀热情和耐心为老人们提供了最好的服务。通过合作，我们迅速适应了环境，提高了工作效率，给老人们带去了温暖和关怀。而整个活动的成功也正是因为团队合作而得以实现。这让我明白了一个人的力量是有限的，只有团队的力量才能够实现更大的梦想。 总的来说，这次暑假三下乡的社会实践活动对我产生了深远的影响。通过陪伴老人和聆听他们的故事，我学到了许多关于人生的真谛，明白了尊老爱老的重要性。与老人们交流的过程中，我感受到了他们对关心和关爱的渴望，激发了我对于老年群体的责任感。同时，我也认识到了团队合作和协作的重要性，只有在相互配合下才能取得更大的成果。未来，我希望能够继续投身于志愿服务活动中，为社会贡献自己的一份力量，同时也希望能够探讨更多关于老年人的问题，为他们的晚年生活提供更好的支持和关爱。我相信，只要我们每个人都用心去关注老年人，尊重他们的需求，我们的社会将更加和谐、充满温暖。"},{"instruction":"could

Es steht für das Volk der Sachsen, das alte Stammesherzogtum Sachsen und die aus ihm entstandenen politischen Einheiten, vor allem für die welfischen Herrschaftsgebiete. Es ist seit dem 20. Jahrhundert das Wappenmotiv des Landes Niedersachsen. Als \\"Westfalenpferd\\" mit erhobenem Schweif ist es das traditionelle Wappenmotiv von Westfalen und bildet in dieser Form einen Bestandteil des Wappens des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen., Die niederländische Nachbarregion Twente und die britische Grafschaft Kent tragen dieses Motiv ebenfalls in ihren modernen Wappen., Das Sachsenross hat keine Beziehung zu den sächsischen Fürstentümern auf dem Gebiet der heutigen Bundesländer Sachsen, Thüringen und Sachsen-Anhalt. Der Name dieser Territorien beruht darauf, dass nach dem Sturz Heinrichs des Löwen der Titel \\"Herzog von Sachsen\\" an die Familie der Askanier und später an die Familie der Wettiner neu vergeben wurde. Diese Dynastien waren an der Eroberung slawisch bewohnter Gebiete im Osten beteiligt und nahmen die Stammesbezeichnung elbaufwärts mit sich. Die dort kolonisierende deutschsprachige Mischbevölkerung nannte sich zwar „Sachsen“, beanspruchte das Sachsenross aber nicht mehr für sich. Zur Unterscheidung wurden später die Begriffe „Obersachsen“ und „Niedersachsen“ geprägt., Das Wappenbild der „Niedersachsen“ bzw. der „Westfalen“ besteht aus einem springenden weißen Pferd im roten Schild. Schon zum Zeitpunkt seines ersten Auftretens im 14. Jahrhundert war es eher ein volkstümliches, regionales Symbol als ein dynastisches Herrschaftszeichen, also mehr ein Symbol für das Land und sein Volk als für die regierende Herrscherfamilie der Welfen. Dies macht seine hohe Popularität aus, die sich bis heute in der Volkskunst äußert. Seine Wirkung als regionales Identitätssymbol ist nur noch mit der Ausstrahlung des bayerischen Rautenwappens, des Familienwappens der Wittelsbacher, zu vergleichen., Ursprung im Dunkel der Geschichte., Überblick., Seit seinem erstmaligen Auftreten in Siegeln und Wappen in der zweiten Hälfte des 14. Jahrhunderts gilt das Sachsenross als „altes“ sächsisches Stammessymbol. Seit dieser Zeit wird es als politisches Instrument zum Ausdruck von Machtansprüchen und als Ausdruck der sächsischen Stammesidentität genutzt., Keine vorheraldischen Belege., Die Sachsen waren ein westgermanischer Völkerverband, der sich vermutlich im 3.Jahrhundert bildete und seit dem 4.Jahrhundert sicher belegt ist. Die Stämme der Chauken, Angrivarier und Cherusker, die sich zu den Sachsen zusammenschlossen (Ethnogenese), lebten im 1.Jahrhundert im Nordwesten des heutigen Deutschlands und im Osten der heutigen Niederlande (siehe Niedersächsisch)., Danach gibt es weitere Erwähnungen von spätantiken, frühmittelalterlichen Autoren nicht-sächsischer Herkunft, die die Sachsen nach massiven Ausdehnungsbewegungen als Piraten in der Nordsee, als Söldner in römischen Diensten, später als fremde Siedler in Britannien und als zwangsweise zu christianisierende Heiden am Rande des Frankenreiches wahrnehmen und beschreiben. Keiner dieser Autoren gibt irgendwelche Hinweise darauf, dass das Pferd als Tier oder als Bild irgendeine besondere Bedeutung als Stammessymbol oder Feldzeichen bei den Sachsen gehabt hätte. Auch archäologische Funde aus diesen Jahrhunderten geben keine entsprechenden Hinweise. Zwar sind auf den Gegenständen des täglichen Lebens aus dieser Zeit durchaus Tierdarstellungen zu finden; sie zeigen aber hauptsächlich Jagdwild wie Hirsche und Wildschweine. Pferde wurden auch abgebildet; es ist aber nicht zu erkennen, dass das Pferd eine den Stamm symbolisierende Bedeutung hatte., Als im 10. Jahrhundert die sächsische Herzogsdynastie der Liudolfinger unter der Bezeichnung Ottonen zu Königen des Ostfrankenreichs und dann zu Kaisern des (später so genannten) Heiligen Römischen Reiches bzw. „Teutschen Reiches“ aufstiegen, schrieb der sächsische Mönch Widukind von Corvey die erste „Sachsengeschichte“ \\"(res gestae Saxonicae)\\", diesmal aus der Innensicht. Er erzählte die sächsische Stammessage und berichtete über historische und genealogische Zusammenhänge zum ersten Mal in Schriftform, wobei er entscheidend zur Identitätsbildung der Sachsen beitrug. Das „Sachsenross“ als Stammessymbol kam aber auch bei ihm nicht vor., Die Herleitung des Pferdesymbols aus vorheraldischen oder gar vorhistorischen sächsischen Traditionen basiert nur auf einigen Indizien. Diese Hinweise lassen sich aber plausibel als spätere Interpretationen erklären, die erst im Nachhinein („ex posteriori“) entstanden sind., Herrscher mit „Pferdenamen“., Als Beleg für eine besondere Bedeutung des Pferdes als Machtsymbol bei den Sachsen gelten die „Pferdenamen“ der beiden sagenhaften Sachsenhäuptlinge Hengest und Horsa, die der Legende nach im 5.nachchristlichen Jahrhundert die ersten sächsischen Herrscher auf den britischen Inseln gewesen sein sollen, und zwar im Bereich der heutigen Grafschaft Kent., Auf den ersten Blick bemerkenswert ist die Übereinstimmung mit dem Wappen der englischen Grafschaft Kent., Die Verwendung eines steigenden weißen Pferdes als Zeichen für Kent datiert allerdings erst auf 1605 (in einer Darstellung von, Richard Verstegen in \\"Restitution of Decayed Antiquities\\"). Die offizielle Verleihung des Wappens an die Grafschaft datiert auf 1933., Das weiße Pferd des Widukind., Auch gibt es die Überlieferung, dass Widukind, der Sachsenherzog und Gegenspieler Karls des Großen, im 8.Jahrhundert ein schwarzes Pferd als Feldzeichen gehabt haben soll, das er nach seiner Bekehrung zum Christentum in ein weißes Pferd gewandelt habe. Nach einer anderen Version erhielt Widukind von Karl dem Großen als Taufgeschenk ein weißes Pferd., Die Erinnerung an das vorchristliche schwarze Pferd Widukinds ist noch in einigen Gegenden Westfalens lebendig, so zum Beispiel im Wappen des Kreises Herford. In der Stiftskirche Enger wird ein Grab als das von Widukind angesehen. So zeigt das Wappen des vorgenannten Kreises, in dem auch Enger liegt, im weißen Schild ein schwarzes, steigendes Pferd, was die Verbundenheit der westfälischen Bevölkerung mit ihrem vorchristlichen Anführer ausdrückt. Aber auch diese Geschichten sind spätere Legenden, für die es keine Belege aus der Zeit vor der Entstehung des Sachsenrosses in der Heraldik gibt., Pferdeköpfe an den Giebeln., Als weiteres Indiz für die besondere Stellung von Pferdemotiven im (nieder-)sächsischen Raum kann ein für das niederdeutsche Hallenhaus (Niedersachsenhaus) typischer Giebelschmuck angeführt werden. Dieser norddeutsche Bauernhaustyp weist an der Giebelseite des ortsüblichen Reetdachs zum Schutz vor Witterungseinflüssen so genannte „Giebelbretter“ oder „Windbretter“ auf, die sich im First kreuzen und rund einen halben Meter über den First hinausragen. Aus den Enden dieser Bretter sind typischerweise Pferdeköpfe geschnitzt., Uffington White Horse., Auch das Uffington White Horse wird in der Diskussion um frühe Belege für das Sachsenross angeführt., Sowohl das frühdatierte Uffington White Horse als auch die spät datierten Nachahmungen lassen sich allerdings nicht als Belege für eine vorheraldische Verwendung des Sachsenrosses als Stammessymbol oder Kultobjekt verwenden., Es befindet sich auf der Seite des White Horse Hill in Oxfordshire und gilt als das älteste Scharrbild in England. Es handelt sich um das stilisierte Bild eines Pferdes, welches in die Vegetation geschnitten und in den Boden gescharrt wurde. Dadurch wird die darunter liegende Kreide sichtbar. Die Umrisse werden von 3 Meter breiten, 60 bis 90 Zentimeter tiefen Gräben gebildet. Die Pferdefigur hat die Ausmaße von 107 × 37 Meter., Das Alter des Scharrbildes ist umstritten. Traditionell wurde es mit den angelsächsischen Invasoren Britanniens im 5.Jahrhundert und ihren legendären, halbmythischen Anführern Hengest und Horsa in Verbindung gebracht. Laut einer anderen Überlieferung wurde es sogar erst im 9.Jahrhundert geschaffen, zur Erinnerung an den Sieg König Alfreds des Großen über die Dänen., Neuere Messungen datieren das Uffington-Pferd sogar in die frühe Eisenzeit oder gar die späte Bronzezeit., Andere Scharrbilder von weißen Pferden auf den Hügeln Südenglands gelten jedoch als sehr viel jünger. In der Mehrzahl werden sie als späte Nachahmungen des Uffington-Pferdes aus dem 18. und 19. Jahrhundert angesehen., Bekannte Hinweise auf Pferde in einer besonderen Bedeutung und archäologische Funde in Niedersachsen., Der römische Historiker Tacitus (* um 58 n. Chr.; † um 120) beschreibt in seiner Germania: „Dem Volke eigentümlich ist auch der Rosse Vorahnungen und Warnungen zu erproben. Auf öffentliche Kosten werden die Rosse in Hainen gehalten, schneeweiß und durch keine sterbliche Arbeit befleckt, welche angeschirrt nur den heiligen Wagen der Priester, den König oder Fürste der Gemeinde begleiten und aufmerksam wird ihr Schnauben und Wiehern als Vorahnung beobachtet. Keinem Vorzeichen ist größerer Glaube, nicht allein beim Volk, sondern bei den Vornehmen, bei den Priestern. Sich selbst halten sie für die Diener der Götter, die Rosse jedoch für die Vertrauten der Götter.“, Derartige „Weissagungen“ durch Pferde haben sich auch in einigen alten Überlieferungen, Legenden im Bereich des heutigen Niedersachsens erhalten, wenn neue Städte oder Kirchen, der Legende nach, dort errichtet wurden, wo ein weißes Pferd nach dem Davonlaufen anfing zu grasen. So erzählt es z.B. eine Legende von Steinau in Niedersachsen. Auch Landesgrenzen sollen, nach alten Geschichten / Legenden so festgelegt worden sein., Heute findet man in dieser Gegend noch eine Reihe von Straßen oder Flurnamen, die das \\"Pferd\\" wörtlich genommen im Namen tragen z.B. Hersterkamp, Hesterweg, Hesterberg, Rossenfelde, Hengstforde usw. Herleitung: Hestur bedeutet Pferd im Plural Hesta. Hengst ein männliches unkastriertes Pferd. Auch gibt es bekannte Findlinge in Niedersachsen die mit Pferden in Zusammenhang stehen. So zeigt einer \\"Hufabdrücke\\" die versteinerten, mehrere heißen \\"grauer Hengst\\". Gemeinsam ist diesen Steinen, dass sie in der Wahrnehmung der Bevölkerung \\"etwas Besonderes\\" darstellten, so dass sich wiederum Legenden zu den Steinen bildeten.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Fiktives Pferd - Pferd (Bildende Kunst) - Symbol - Wappen (Niedersachsen) - Wappentier - Westfalen - Volk der Sachsen - heraldisches Motiv - regionales Symbol - Identitätssymbol"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Autor, Geboren 1776, Gestorben 1839, Literatur (19. Jahrhundert), Literatur (Schwedisch), Lyrik, Mann, Mitglied der Schwedischen Akademie, Schwede, Trainingstheoretiker], Pehr Henrik Ling (in älteren Quellen meist \\"Per Henrik Ling,\\" in englischen Quellen auch \\"Peter Henry Ling\\"; * 15. November 1776 in Södra Ljunga (Kronobergs län); † 3. Mai 1839 in Stockholm) war ein schwedischer Dichter und Autor sowie Begründer der Schwedischen Gymnastik. Er gilt neben Albert Hoffa und Johann Georg Mezger als Vater der \\"Klassischen Massage,\\" die deshalb auch \\"Schwedische Massage\\" genannt wird., Leben., Kindheit und Lehrjahre., Ling wurde im Dorf Södra Ljunga in der Provinz Kronobergs län (historische Provinz Småland) etwa 15 Kilometer südlich von Ljungby geboren. Vier Jahre nach Lings Geburt starb sein Vater, Lars Peter Ling, der Pfarrer von Södra Ljunga war. Seine Mutter, Hedvig Maria Molin, heiratete den Amtsnachfolger, verstarb allerdings kurz nach dieser Hochzeit., Er wurde auf das Gymnasium im nahe gelegenen Växjö geschickt. Eine Jahreszahl ist nicht bekannt, ebenso ob er vorher eine andere Schule besucht hat. 1792 wurde Ling des Gymnasiums verwiesen, als er sich nach einem Aufstand einiger Schüler weigerte, die Anführer zu nennen. Die nächste nachweisliche Station Lings ist die Universität Uppsala, an der er 1793 Theologie studierte. Nach vier Jahren konnte er dieses Studium am 21. Dezember 1797 mit einem Diplom abschließen. Er entschloss sich zu einer längeren Reise durch Europa und verließ 1799 Schweden in Richtung Dänemark. Seine erste Station war Kopenhagen. Danach hielt er sich in Deutschland, Frankreich und England auf. Er eignete sich die Sprachen der von ihm bereisten Länder an und lernte in Deutschland das frisch erwachte „deutsche Turnen“ kennen. Einige Quellen sehen in dieser Begegnung den Grundstein für seine spätere Arbeit mit der schwedischen Gymnastik. Die nächsten Aufzeichnungen über Lings Leben berichten vom Jahr 1801, in welchem er als Offizier der Marine an der Seeschlacht von Kopenhagen teilnahm., Obwohl Ling auf seinen Reisen immer wieder Arbeit hatte, war er in diesen Jahren des Öfteren mittellos. Später erzählte er Freunden, dass er stolz darauf sei, seine Lebensbedürfnisse jederzeit auf das äußerste Maß einschränken zu können. Allerdings hinterließen die Jahre der Reisen und Armut, manchmal ohne Essen und Schlaf, und der Dienst bei der Armee körperliche Spuren: sein allgemeiner körperlicher Zustand verschlechterte sich, er zeigte Symptome von Rheuma und hatte sogar Paralysen., Ein Ziel, zwei Wege., Im Jahr 1804 errichteten zwei französische Immigranten an der Universität Kopenhagen eine Fechtschule. Interessiert an diesem Sport, reiste Ling nach Dänemark und wurde Schüler der beiden Franzosen. Er bemerkte, dass die regelmäßigen Fechtübungen seine Gesundheit verbesserten und er schließlich wieder vollkommen rehabilitiert war. Da er eine besondere Begabung für diesen Sport hatte, wurde er ein Jahr später Fechtmeister an der Universität von Lund. Dort unterrichtete er Fechten und die modernen Sprachen, die er sich auf seinen Reisen angeeignet hatte. Neben seiner Tätigkeit als Dozent hielt Ling Vorträge über die skandinavische Mythologie und beschäftigte sich mit der Vergangenheit des schwedischen Volkes. Er belegte Kurse für Anatomie und Physiologie an der Universität, um den Gründen für seine Genesung auf die Spur zu kommen., Spätestens an diesem Punkt in seinem Leben fasste er den Entschluss, die Schweden zu würdigen Nachkommen der alten Nordländer zu machen. Dieses Ziel wollte er sowohl mit Gymnastik als auch mit Poesie erreichen. Durch sein Engagement als Dichter und Autor der nordischen Mythologie bekam er Kontakt zu Gleichgesinnten. Anfangs trafen sie sich aus Spaß, später gründete diese Gruppe den Gotischen Bund \\"(Götiska Förbundet)\\" mit dem Ziel, den Schweden über Poesie ihren Stolz und ihr nordländisches Nationalgefühl wiederzugeben. Ling selbst schrieb einige Stücke, wie zum Beispiel \\"Asarne\\" oder \\"Gylfe.\\" Die Schwedische Akademie \\"(Svenska Akademien)\\" ernannte ihn im Jahre 1835 zum Nachfolger des Verstorbenen Anders Fredrik Skjöldebrand (1757 bis 1834). Ling bekam dessen Sitzplatz (Nummer 18) und blieb, wie es die Statuten der Akademie vorsehen, bis zu seinem Tod im Jahre 1839 Mitglied., Umstrittener Erneuerer., 1812 bat er die schwedische Regierung um Gelder für die Einrichtung eines gymnastischen Institutes in Stockholm. Die Antwort war genauso knapp wie direkt: „Wir haben der Jongleure und Seiltänzer schon genug, ohne ihretwegen die Staatskasse zu belästigen.“ Ling konzentrierte sich auf die Weiterentwicklung des Fechtens und seiner Gymnastik. Seine Bekanntheit als Fechtlehrer half ihm seine gymnastischen Übungen bekannt zu machen. Innerhalb eines Jahres war sein Ansehen in der Gesellschaft so stark gewachsen, dass ihm die Gelder für das Institut bei einer erneuten Anfrage genehmigt wurden. Es waren zwar nur geringe Gelder, aber Ling konnte 1813 das Gymnastische Zentralinstitut (schwedisch \\"Gymnastiska Centralinstitutet\\", kurz \\"GCI\\") in Stockholm gründen und wurde dessen Vorsteher. Bereits wenige Monate später wurden seine gymnastischen Übungen in vielen schwedischen Einrichtungen, wie z. B. Schulen, und bei der Armee eingeführt. 1818 übernahmen die Truppen der Provinz Schonen eine von ihm entwickelte Art des Bajonettfechtens. Diese Erfolge in staatlichen Einrichtungen versetzten ihn in den Stand, weitere Gelder für das GCI zu fordern und sie auch genehmigt zu bekommen., Ling war allerdings nicht unumstritten. Die Schulmediziner standen seiner Arbeit skeptisch gegenüber und wollten seine Gymnastik höchstens zur Prävention oder als Behandlung bei „Wehwehchen“ anerkennen. An dieser Einstellung änderte sich bis zu seinem Tod nichts. Trotz seiner umstrittenen Person wurden ihm allerdings Auszeichnungen wie der \\"Schwedische Professorentitel,\\" der Titel \\"Ritter des Nordstern-Ordens\\" verliehen und er wurde zum Mitglied der Schwedischen Medizinischen Gesellschaft \\"(Sveriges läkarförbund)\\" gewählt. Seine Schüler hingegen zeigten ihm ihre Wertschätzung insbesondere in Form einer ihm 1821 zum Geschenk gemachten silbernen Medaille: Auf der einen Seite ein Brustbild von Ling, auf der anderen die Umschrift „Dem hochgefeierten Idrottmann von seinen Freunden und Schülern“., Die folgenden Jahre verbrachte Ling mit der Verbesserung seiner Übungen an GCI. 1836 wurde sein Bajonettfechten bei der schwedischen Infanterie übernommen. Er schrieb noch weitere Gedichte und die einzigen drei Bücher, die es über seine Lehren aus seiner Feder gibt. Das größte und wichtigste Werk, \\"Gymnastikens allmänna grunder,\\" wurde erst ein Jahr nach seinem Tod durch seine Schüler Liedbeck und Georgii veröffentlicht. Ling starb am 3. Mai 1839 in Stockholm, nachdem er einige Monate vorher an einer Lebertuberkulose erkrankt war., Lehre., Lings Leitbild war es, den vaterländischen Geist zu stärken und das Heldentum der Ahnen zu erneuern. Nach Aussagen seiner Schüler war Lings Urgroßvater sein größtes Vorbild. Dieser wurde über 100 Jahre alt und zeugte 19 Kinder. Ling wollte, nachdem er seine körperliche Stärke durch die Fechtübungen zurückbekam, dieses Wissen der skandinavischen Bevölkerung zu Nutze machen. Da seine Übungen bereits in der Jugend anzuwenden waren, gilt er neben F. L. Jahn, J. C. F. GutsMuths und J. H. Pestalozzi als Reformator der Jugenderziehung. Bereits ein paar Jahre bevor Ling mit seiner systematischen Entwicklung der Gymnastik begann, machte sich Franz Nachtegall in Dänemark mit Gymnastik einen Namen. Teilweise beruhen Lings Theorien auf Nachtegalls Leibesübungen., Das Leben besteht nach Lings Theorie aus der \\"chemischen Grundform,\\" der \\"dynamischen Grundform\\" und der \\"mechanischen Grundform.\\" Wenn eine dieser Formen von Erkrankungen oder Beschwerden heimgesucht wird, muss mit der jeweils entsprechenden Therapie begonnen werden. Bei der mechanischen Grundform war die Gymnastik seine Therapie der Wahl. Die Gymnastik war in seinen Augen aber nicht in erster Linie Heilmethode, sondern galt vielmehr der Prävention. Hierfür entwickelte Ling sein System der Gymnastik, welches auf vier Säulen aufbaut und, sofern es konsequent durchgeführt werde, dem Menschen Kraft und Fitness bescheren sollte. Die vier Säulen stehen für verschiedene Arten der Gymnastik, mit eigenen Übungen und eigenen Schwerpunkten im Bezug auf Ausübung, Dauer, Exaktheit und vieles mehr. Die \\"Medizinische Gymnastik\\" soll den schwachen Körper des Patienten stärken und das Allgemeinwohl heben. Genau geleitete Übungen sollen bei der \\"Pädagogischen Gymnastik\\" der Jugend Disziplin und Gehorsam lehren. Die \\"Wehrgymnastik\\" dient als Vorbereitung auf die Armee, sollte den Körper stählen und für eine aufrechte Haltung sorgen. Als letzte Säule hatte die \\"Ästhetische Gymnastik\\" die Aufgabe, die Bewegungen des Körpers eleganter zu machen und so Schönheit zu bringen. In Lings spärlichen Aufzeichnungen finden sich immer wieder Hinweise auf Handgriffe, die der Massage sehr ähnlich sind. Nach seiner Lehre hatten diese allerdings nicht die gleiche Bedeutung wie sie das in der heutigen Klassischen Massage haben. Sie dienten aber Albert Hoffa und Johann G. Mezger als Grundlage für die heute üblichen \\"5 Handgriffe der Massage.\\", Neben dem Körper wollte Ling auch den Geist der Nordländer im modernen Skandinavien wieder aufleben lassen. Seine Gedichte und Epen mit Themen aus nordischen Märchen und Geschichten erzählen von Helden und ihrem Leben. \\"Asarne\\" ist z. B. ein Epos über die Frühzeit des Nordens. Seine literarischen Werke sind heute, außer im skandinavischen Bereich, nicht mehr sehr verbreitet., Nachleben., Nach Lings Tod übernahm sein Schüler, Professor Lars Gabriel Branting, die Leitung des GCI und führte seine Ideen fort. Die Gymnastik entwickelte sich in zwei unterschiedliche Richtungen. Die eine Gruppe seiner Schüler zeigte einen gemäßigten Ansatz und verstand die Gymnastik als Teil oder Ergänzung der schulmedizinischen Behandlung und der Prävention. Die andere Gruppe wollte bei vielen Erkrankungen die Schulmedizin gänzlich vertreiben und die Gymnastik als alleinige Therapie manifestieren., In Anerkennung seiner Verdienste steht heute in Stockholm in der Nähe des früheren GCI, an der Kreuzung Hamngatan und Sveavägen, die Statue eines kleinen Mädchens beim Ausüben der Lingschen Gymnastik. In Göteborg steht eine Büste von Ling. Das Pfarrhaus, wo er seine Kindheit verbrachte, ist inzwischen zu einem Museum umfunktioniert worden.

Gray III 30th Street Station, ist der Zentralbahnhof von Philadelphia im US-Bundesstaat Pennsylvania. Der Personen- und Betriebsbahnhof im Westen der Stadt gehört zum Nordost-Korridor und zählt zu den wichtigen Netzknoten im Personennah- und -fernverkehr an der Ostküste der USA. Sein Empfangsgebäude im Stil des Neoklassizismus gilt als einer der letzten prestigeträchtigen Bahnhofsbauten einer privaten Eisenbahngesellschaft in den Vereinigten Staaten., Der Bahnhof wurde 1929 und 1933 in zwei Etappen eröffnet und war über mehrere Jahrzehnte hinweg der zentrale Knotenbahnhof der Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in der Region. Seit Stilllegung der innerstädtischen Zentralbahnhöfe ihrer einstigen Konkurrenten wie der Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Passenger Station fungiert 30thStreet als alleinige Drehscheibe für den Eisenbahn-Fernverkehr in Philadelphia. Derzeit (2009) bedienen die Amtrak, die Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) und die New Jersey Transit den Bahnhof im Schienenverkehr. Eigentümerin ist die Amtrak., Namensgebung., Mehrere verschiedene Namen sind für den Bahnhof in Gebrauch. Dies liegt zum einen an der Vielzahl zeitlich vorangehender Bahnstationen an jenem Ort, zum anderen an mehreren Eigentümerwechseln im Laufe der Jahrzehnte. Außerdem nutzen die am Bahnhof verkehrenden Gesellschaften unterschiedliche Namen., Bei der Amtrak heißt der Bahnhof \\"Philadelphia\\" oder auch \\"Philadelphia – 30thStreet Station\\"; auf den Stationsschildern steht \\"Philadelphia\\". Auch New Jersey Transit benutzt diesen Namen. Die SEPTA nennt ihn– wie auch die örtliche Bevölkerung– \\"30th Street Station\\", wie auf den Schildern der zugehörigen Bahnsteige zu lesen ist., In historischem Kontext ist der Bahnhof noch unter folgenden Namen bekannt:, Lage und Verkehrsanbindung., Die 30th Street Station liegt etwa 1,5Kilometer westlich des Stadtzentrums (City Hall) am Westufer des Schuylkill zwischen dem Schuylkill Expressway und der 32ndStreet. Die Bahnanlagen erstrecken sich dabei zwischen der Spring Garden Street im Norden und der Chestnut Street im Süden auf eine Länge von etwa 1,2Kilometern in Nord-Süd-Richtung sowie auf etwa 600Metern in der Breite. Das Empfangsgebäude mit den Personenbahnsteigen befindet sich in der südöstlichen Ecke des Areals unmittelbar nördlich der Market Street. Es besitzt zwei Bahnsteigebenen, die sich in rechtem Winkel kreuzen., Die Gleise der unteren Ebene verlaufen in Nord-Süd-Richtung. Sie liegen im Bereich des Empfangsgebäudes unter Straßenniveau und führen unter besagtem Gebäude hindurch. Die obere Ebene verläuft unmittelbar nördlich des Empfangsgebäudes in West-Ost-Richtung und liegt über Straßenniveau, so dass insgesamt drei Verkehrsebenen entstehen. Das südliche Gleisfeld der unteren Ebene ist größtenteils eingehaust und überbaut. Die Gleisanlagen sind nahezu vollständig mittels Oberleitung elektrifiziert., Schiene., Die untere Ebene gehört zum Northeast Corridor. Seine Gleise führen in nördlicher Richtung nach New York City und in südlicher Richtung nach WashingtonD.C. Über die nördliche Ausfahrt gelangt man außerdem auf die Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line nach Harrisburg sowie zur Delair Bridge, die am Nordrand der Stadt über den Delaware hinüber nach Camden führt. Darüber hinaus sind in beiden Richtungen noch einige Nebenstrecken zu erreichen., Die östliche Ausfahrt der oberen Ebene führt unmittelbar auf eine Brücke über den Schuylkill und weiter Richtung Center City Commuter Connection, der unterirdischen Stammstrecke der Regionalbahnen der SEPTA durch die Innenstadt. Auf der anderen Seite gabelt sich die Ausfahrt unmittelbar westlich des Empfangsgebäudes in zwei halbdirekte Verbindungskurven. Diese führen in entgegengesetzte Richtungen zum Northeast Corridor hinunter. Die südliche Rampe verläuft dabei in einem Tunnel unterhalb der 32ndStreet., In Höhe der 31stStreet überspannt die West Philadelphia Elevated die Gleisanlagen in Süd-Nord-Richtung. Das Eisenbahnviadukt mit 8140Fuß (2481Metern) Länge und geschätzten zehn Metern Höhe führt von der Nord- zur Südausfahrt des Bahnhofs. Es verbindet dabei einige „einmündende“ Güterbahnen miteinander, besitzt aber seit einigen Jahren keine Gleisverbindungen zum Northeast Corridor mehr., Straße., Der Bahnhof liegt an der Kreuzung zweier wichtiger innerstädtischer Verkehrsachsen, des Schuylkill Expressway alias Interstate76 mit der Market Street, die hier die Pennsylvania State Route 3 bildet. Die Autobahn verläuft dabei auf der unteren Ebene in Nord-Süd-Richtung und östlich parallel zu den Gleisen direkt am Schuylkill entlang. Sie ist im Bereich des Empfangsgebäudes mit einer Galerie eingehaust und mit einer Uferstraße überbaut. An den Enden der Einhausung befinden sich Ausfahrten in Form von Parallelrampen, die von der Autobahn auf die Straßenebene hinaufführen., Die Market Street verläuft südlich des Empfangsgebäudes in Ost-West-Richtung und überquert in ihrem Verlauf den Schuylkill auf einer Brücke. Zwischen dieser Brücke und der Eisenbahnbrücke der oberen Gleisebene auf der Nordseite gibt es noch eine dritte Brücke. Sie gehört zum John F. Kennedy Boulevard und ist auf die Symmetrieachse des Empfangsgebäudes ausgerichtet., Das Empfangsgebäude wird von der Arch Street im Norden, der 30thStreet im Westen, der Market Street im Süden und der Uferstraße oberhalb der Autobahn, der Schuylkill Avenue, umrahmt. Die Straßen um das Gebäude herum sind mit Ausnahme der Market Street als Einbahnstraßen eingerichtet, so dass ein Kreisverkehr im Gegenuhrzeigersinn entsteht., Nördlich des Empfangsgebäudes befindet sich ein großes Parkhaus der Amtrak. Daneben existieren eine Parkgarage mit Bedienung \\"(valet parking)\\" im Empfangsgebäude selbst sowie eine Reihe weiterer Parkplätze direkt am Gebäude entlang jener Einbahnstraßen. Der Taxistand befindet sich auf der Ostseite., Innerstädtischer Nahverkehr., Bahn., Der Bahnhof ist über die Station \\"30th Street\\" der Market–Frankford Line und der Subway–Surface Lines an das innerstädtische Schnellbahnnetz angeschlossen. Die Station befindet sich südwestlich des Empfangsgebäudes unterhalb der Market Street. Sie besitzt vier Bahnsteiggleise in West-Ost-Richtung, wobei die inneren beiden von der Market–Frankford Line und die äußeren von den Subway–Surface Lines befahren werden. Die U-Bahn-Züge halten an einem langen Hochbahnsteig in Mittellage, die Subway–Surface Lines an zwei kürzeren, außen liegenden, niedrigen Seitenbahnsteigen. Der Haupteingang befindet sich in einem länglichen Flachbau Market Ecke 30thStreet. Ein Verbindungstunnel von der Verteilerebene zur Schalterhalle des Empfangsgebäudes wurde aus Sicherheitsgründen verschlossen. Der U-Bahnhof bietet von der Innenstadt aus gesehen die letzte von insgesamt drei Umsteigemöglichkeiten zwischen der Market–Frankford Line und den Subway–Surface Lines., Bus., Neben der U-Bahn verkehren an der 30th Street Station mehrere innerstädtische Buslinien sowie zwei Regionalbuslinien nach Chesterbrook, King of Prussia und Valley Forge. Die Linienwege folgen im Bereich des Bahnhofs den umgebenden Einbahnstraßen und führen dementsprechend im Gegenuhrzeigersinn um das Gebäude herum. Die Haltestellen befinden sich auf der West- und Ostseite, jeweils an den dem Empfangsgebäude gegenüberliegenden Gehsteigen., Architektur., Empfangsgebäude., Das Empfangsgebäude ist ein Monumentalbau im Stil des Neoklassizismus unter Verwendung von Art-déco-Elementen. Es wurde von Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White entworfen und in den Jahren 1929 bis 1933 erbaut. Es besitzt einen kreuzförmigen Grundriss, wobei der Längsbau in Nord-Süd-Richtung verläuft und 637Fuß (194,2Meter) misst. Dieser wird von einem mittig angeordneten, ihn in Breite und Höhe überragenden Querbau unterbrochen. Dieser wiederum misst 327Fuß (99,7Meter) und besitzt an beiden Enden korinthische Säulenvorhallen mit je sechs Säulen und zwei Eckpfeilern, die zusammen die beiden Haupteingänge markieren. Die Fassade ist zur Gänze mit Alabama-Kalkstein verkleidet, die Fenster rundherum sind in vertikal verlaufenden Nischen angeordnet. Die Dachkante ringsum ist dem Gebälk antiker Tempelbauten nachempfunden., Sowohl Längs- als auch Querbau haben Flachdächer. Der Längsbau verfügt über insgesamt fünf Etagen, wobei nur das Erdgeschoss durchgezogen ist. Darüber liegen auf beiden Seiten vier u-förmige Büroetagen, die jeweils einen großen, von außen unsichtbaren Lichthof zum Querbau hin einrahmen. Das Dach des Querbaus ist durchgezogen und war ursprünglich als Landebahn für Kleinflugzeuge gedacht., Der Querbau beherbergt den Wartesaal und damit nur einen einzigen, großen Raum. Dieser misst 290 auf 135Fuß (88,4 auf 41,1Meter). Die Wände sind 95Fuß (29Meter) hoch und mit Marmor und Travertin verkleidet. Oben ist eine Kassettendecke angebracht. Der Raum verfügt wegen der Lichthöfe auf allen vier Seiten über annähernd raumhohe Fenster. Die Eingangstüren an den Stirnseiten werden von je sechs raumhohen Säulen eingerahmt, die mit den außen stehenden fluchten. Über den Türen befinden sich in Höhe der ersten Etage Laufstege, die die beiden Teile des Längsbaus miteinander verbinden. Von der Decke hängen in zwei Reihen je fünf große, schlanke bronzene Leuchter herab., Am östlichen Ende des Wartesaals steht die Skulptur „Angel of the Resurrection“ (deutsch: \\"„Engel der Wiederauferstehung“\\") von Walker Hancock zur Erinnerung an die Gefallenen der Pennsylvania Railroad aus dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. In einem Nebenraum zeigt das Terrakotta-Relief „Spirit of Transportation“ (deutsch in etwa: \\"„Der Geist des Verkehrswesens“\\") von Karl Bitter Motive aus der Entwicklungsgeschichte des Verkehrswesens., Die beiden Flügel des Längsbaus werden gewerblich genutzt. Das Erdgeschoss ist auf beiden Seiten vom Wartesaal her direkt zugänglich und beherbergt im südlichen Teil Einzelhandelsgeschäfte und gastronomische Einrichtungen. Im nördlichen Teil befindet sich ein abgetrennter Warteraum, Toiletten, eine Wache der Bahnpolizei \\"(Amtrak Police)\\" und die Parkgarage mit Bedienung. Die oberen vier Geschosse beherbergen Büros der Amtrak., Das ganze Gebäude ruht auf einem 80Fuß (24,4Meter) tiefen Senkkastenfundament, das gegen Erschütterungen mit Schwingungstilgern ausgerüstet ist., Bahnsteigebenen., Die untere Bahnsteigebene liegt größtenteils unterhalb des Längsbaus. Sie besitzt fünf Mittelbahnsteige mit zehn Gleisen sowie ein zusätzliches Überholgleis auf der Westseite.

LISA (snickering) And he has absolutely no idea what's coming! JESSICA (smiling) Perfect. Let's go get him. They head toward the hallway where they find PAUL (late 20s, friendly and unsuspecting) absentmindedly looking at his phone. PAUL (not aware of their presence) Hey, guys! What's up? SUSAN (teasingly) Oh, Paul. We've got something very special planned for you today. PAUL (raising an eyebrow) Oh, really? Do I need to be worried? JESSICA (mockingly concerned) Worried? No, no, not at all! In fact, you should feel honored. LISA (grinning) Isn't it great to have such amazing friends, Paul? PAUL (confused) Uh, sure! I'm just curious about what's going on. SUSAN (giggling) Paul, my dear, you know we've hypnotized you several times before. And today, you have a rather exciting role to play. PAUL (slightly alarmed) Hypnotized? Again? What do you have in mind this time? JESSICA (beaming) You, my friend, are the official foot massager of our party! PAUL (baffled) The official foot massager? LISA (nodding enthusiastically) Yes! Every guest here will have the privilege of receiving a foot massage from you. Isn't that great? PAUL (stuttering) But... but I don't even know how to give massages! SUSAN (playfully reassuring) Don't worry, Paul! We've got you covered. We've prepared some quick and easy tutorials for you to follow. JESSICA (teasingly) Trust us, you'll be an expert in no time. PAUL (resigned) Alright, if you say so, but please don't make it too outrageous. LISA (mocking seriousness) Of course, Paul. We promise, this is the most normal, sensible, and totally ordinary thing we could come up with for you. They all burst into laughter, leaving Paul slightly apprehensive but intrigued. INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER The party is in full swing. Amidst the laughter and music, Paul can be seen diligently offering foot massages to various guests, trying to follow the tutorial videos on his phone. The girls exchange knowing giggles, enjoying their little prank on their unsuspecting friend.

Use emulators: Emulators allow you to play old games on modern hardware, often with added features like upscaling or anti-aliasing. These can enhance the graphics and make them look better on newer displays. 2. Apply visual mods: Many old games have dedicated modding communities that create visual mods to enhance the graphics. These mods can include high-resolution texture packs, lighting enhancements, and more. Look for popular mods and tutorials specific to the game you want to improve. 3. Adjust in-game settings: Some older games may have graphics settings that allow you to tweak various visual elements. Experiment with these settings to find the best combination that improves the graphics without sacrificing performance. 4. Use external tools: Certain third-party tools can enhance the graphics of games. For instance, tools like ReShade or SweetFX can be used to add post-processing effects like sharpening, color correction, or depth of field. 5. Play on an older display: If you have access to an old CRT monitor or a display that emulates the pixelated look of the past, playing the game on that screen can help recreate the nostalgic feeling associated with older games. Keep in mind that while these methods can enhance the visual experience, they cannot fundamentally change the limitations of the original game's graphics."},{"instruction":"write me a cv for junior operation postion","output":"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Phone Number] [Email Address] Objective: Highly motivated and organized professional seeking a junior operations position to contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of operations within a company.

It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), making early identification crucial for effective management. Procalcitonin (PCT) is an emerging biomarker that has shown promise in aiding the diagnosis and management of sepsis, primarily in adult populations. However, its effectiveness in neonates is still under investigation. The objectives of this study are to assess the correlation between signs of sepsis and PCT results in a neonatal unit and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of PCT for sepsis in this specific population. By understanding the relationship between signs of sepsis and PCT levels, healthcare professionals in the neonatal unit can utilize PCT as a reliable biomarker for early identification and timely intervention of sepsis cases. Method: Participants: This study will be conducted in a neonatal unit with a sample size of 150 neonates. The inclusion criteria will comprise all neonates admitted to the unit during the study period, regardless of gestational age or birth weight. Neonates with known congenital infections, those receiving antibiotics at the time of admission, and those with congenital anomalies will be excluded from the study. Ethical approval will be obtained from the institutional review board before commencing the study. Data Collection: Data collection will be conducted by a trained research nurse who will work closely with the neonatology team. The research nurse will review medical records to collect demographic information, clinical signs of sepsis (e.g., temperature instability, respiratory distress, feeding intolerance), and laboratory results including PCT levels. The signs of sepsis will be assessed by the neonatologist on the day of admission and for the subsequent 3 days. Any discrepancies will be resolved through discussions with the neonatology team. Data Analysis: Statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the demographic characteristics of the neonates. Pearson's correlation will be employed to assess the relationship between signs of sepsis and PCT levels. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will determine the sensitivity and specificity of PCT levels in diagnosing sepsis in the neonatal unit. The level of significance will be set at p < 0.05. References: 1. Chiesa C, Pacifico L, Osborn JF, et al. Diagnosis of neonatal sepsis: a clinical and laboratory challenge.

Die Stratocaster wirkte bei ihrem Erscheinen revolutionär und gilt bis heute als beliebteste, meistverkaufte und meistkopierte E-Gitarre weltweit. Die Stratocaster wird neben dem Herkunftsland USA auch in Mexiko, Japan, Korea und weiteren Staaten produziert., Geschichte., Nachdem mit der Fender Telecaster erfolgreich die erste E-Gitarre und mit dem Precision Bass der erste E-Bass der Firma auf den Markt gebracht worden waren, begann Erfinder und Firmengründer Leo Fender 1952 mit der Entwicklung einer neuen E-Gitarre., Leo Fender war in seinen Ideen stark von der US-amerikanischen Automobilindustrie inspiriert. Hersteller wie Cadillac oder Chevrolet brachten in den 1950ern fast jährlich neue Modelle auf den Markt, um den technischen Fortschritt zu symbolisieren. Folgerichtig betrachtete Fender die Entwicklung der Telecaster nach ihrem Erscheinen im Jahr 1950 als abgeschlossen und plante ein komplett neues Nachfolgemodell. Bei diesem neuen Instrument sollten alle Erfahrungen und Anregungen einfließen, die man mit der Telecaster gesammelt hatte., Händler verlangten von Fender ein höherwertiges, besser ausgestattetes Instrument, um der teuren Gibson Les Paul entgegentreten zu können. Musiker forderten eine Gitarre mit mehr Klangmöglichkeiten und Vibrato. Außerdem sollte das Instrument bequemer zu bespielen sein als die kantige, brettartige Telecaster., Zusammen mit den Angestellten Freddie Tavares (Produktionsleiter bei Fender und Hobbymusiker), George Fullerton (Mitbegründer von Fender Musical Instruments) sowie den Gitarristen Bill Carson und Rex Gallion wurden die Eckpunkte der neuen Gitarre festgelegt:, So ausgestattet wurden 1953 die ersten Prototypen gefertigt und zu Testzwecken an verschiedene Musiker ausgeliehen. Die Reaktionen waren durchweg enttäuschend bis niederschmetternd: Die Blechkonstruktion des Vibratos schluckte einen Großteil der Saitenschwingung, weshalb die Prototypen sehr schrill und metallisch klangen. Gitarrist Carson beschrieb den Klang als „den eines billigen Banjos in einer Blechtonne“. Leo Fender war von seiner Konstruktion jedoch so überzeugt, dass er bereits zuvor etwa 5000 Rollen für eine geplante Serienfertigung der Blechbrücke bestellt hatte. Nach Angaben von Fabrikarbeitern verstaubte die Lieferung Rollen noch jahrelang im Lager der Firma. Nach langer Überzeugungsarbeit von Testgitarristen und Mitarbeitern konstruierte Leo für die Stratocaster widerwillig ein neues Vibrato. Den schlechten Erfahrungen zum Trotz setzte Leo Fender bei den Folgemodellen Jazzmaster und Jaguar eine überarbeitete Version des ursprünglichen Vibratos ein., Die Neukonstruktion des Vibratos verzögerte die Markteinführung der Stratocaster um ein ganzes Jahr. Leo Fender konstruierte schließlich als Erster eine kombinierte Saitenhalter/Brückenkonstruktion, die durch einen Hebel beweglich gemacht wurde. Dieses System war klein, optisch unauffällig und erlaubte durch das Kippen der Brücke ein Herunterstimmen der Saiten bis hin zum völligen Erschlaffen. Weiter verbesserte es den Klang des Instruments im Gegensatz zu den Prototypen erheblich. Aus ungeklärten Gründen meldete Fender das System nach ersten positiven Rückmeldungen im April 1954 nicht unter dem korrekten Terminus „Vibrato“, sondern mit dem irreführenden Namen „Tremolo“ zum Patent an. Diese Verwechslung zieht sich seitdem durch das gesamte Programm der Firma, da die Verstärker der Marke Fender, die tatsächlich über ein „Tremolo“ (im Sinne möglicher kontinuierlicher Lautstärkeschwankungen) verfügen, mit dem falschen Zusatz „Vibrato“ bezeichnet werden., Als letztes Konstruktionsmerkmal versetzte Fender die Klinkenbuchse für das Gitarrenkabel von der Korpuszarge in ein ovales Blech auf die Gitarrendecke. Diese Maßnahme erschien ihm sinnvoll, da viele Telecasters mit ausgerissenen Klinkenbuchsen zur Reparatur in die Werkstatt zurückkamen. Gitarrenständer waren noch nicht erfunden und viele Gitarristen lehnten ihre Instrumente nach dem Konzert einfach an die Verstärker oder herumstehende Stühle. Fiel dabei eine Gitarre aus Unachtsamkeit um, konnte aufgrund der Hebelwirkung des Gitarrenkabel-Klinkensteckers die Eingangsbuchse aus der Zarge gerissen werden, und Reparaturen wurden notwendig., Um beim Namen einem erneuten Rechtsstreit aus dem Weg zu gehen – die als Broadcaster erschienene Telecaster hatte schnell umbenannt werden müssen, da die Firma Gretsch bereits ein gleichnamiges Schlagzeug im Programm hatte – beauftragte Leo Fender seine Rechtsanwälte mit der Namensfindung und rechtlichen Überprüfung. Gitarrist Bill Carson schlug vor, das Instrument in Anlehnung an die Gibson Les Paul „Fender Bill Carson Modell“ zu benennen. Fender lehnte dies zur Enttäuschung des Gitarristen schnell ab und gab dem Modell stattdessen den futuristisch klingenden Namen „Stratocaster“. Das Kunstwort setzt sich zusammen aus dem Begriff Stratosphäre und dem Namen des Vorgängermodells Telecaster. Fenders Rechtsanwälte gaben diesem Kunstwort ihre Zustimmung und übersahen dabei, dass der Hersteller Harmony bereits eine E-Gitarre mit dem Namen „Stratotone“ auf den Markt gebracht hatte. Harmony legte jedoch keine Widersprüche ein, und die neue Gitarre konnte wie geplant erscheinen., Die Produktion begann im Laufe des Jahres 1954, die erste Werbeanzeige für die neue Gitarre wurde im April 1954 in der Zeitschrift „International Musician“ gedruckt. Der Erstverkaufspreis betrug 249,00 US-Dollar zuzüglich 39,00 Dollar für den Instrumentenkoffer. Die Telecaster kostete im Vergleich 189,00 Dollar. Auch wenn die Stratocaster in der Fachwelt wegen ihres futuristischen Aussehens und des neuen Vibratos großes Aufsehen erregte, verdrängte sie entgegen den Erwartungen Leo Fenders die Telecaster nicht vom Markt. Trotz großen Werbeaufwandes überstiegen die Stückzahlen der Telecaster noch über Jahre die der Stratocaster, weshalb beide Instrumente bis heute parallel hergestellt werden. Dennoch entwickelte sich die Stratocaster im Laufe der Zeit zur weltweit erfolgreichsten und meistgespielten E-Gitarre und wurde Vorbild einer ganzen Gitarrenbaugeneration. Nach offiziellen Schätzungen der Firma Fender wurden bis zum 40. Geburtstag im Jahr 1994 allein von Fender zwischen 1 und 1,5 Millionen Stratocasters produziert und verkauft., Konstruktion., Der Korpus der Stratocaster besteht meist aus Esche (leichte Sumpfesche \\"„Swamp-Ash“\\") oder aus Rot-Erle \\"(American Red Alder)\\", seltener aus Pappelholz \\"(Poplar)\\", selten auch vom Sassafrasbaum. Der Hals wird aus Ahorn gefertigt und besitzt je nach Modell ein Griffbrett aus Ahorn oder Palisander, in das 21 oder 22 Bünde eingelassen sind. Die Mensur beträgt 648mm, die Stimmmechaniken befinden sich in einer Linie auf der oberen Seite der asymmetrischen Kopfplatte. Als Bundmarkierungen fungieren in der Regel schwarze Punkte (bei Ahorngriffbrettern) oder bei den dunkleren Palisandergriffbrettern helle Punkte aus verschiedenen Materialien. Neu an der Stratocaster waren die sogenannten \\"Body-Shapings\\" des Korpus: an der Rückseite in der oberen Zarge und auf der Decke ist der Korpus ergonomisch ausgekehlt, beziehungsweise schräg abgeflacht, um dem Spieler höheren Spielkomfort zu bieten., Die elektrischen Bauteile, wie Tonabnehmer und Potentiometer, sind auf ein aus Kunststoff bestehendes Schlagbrett (\\"pickguard\\") montiert, das sich unter den Saiten auf dem Korpus befindet. Das Schlagbrett, früher mit acht, heute meist mit elf Schrauben befestigt, besteht üblicherweise aus dreilagigem Kunststoff, beispielsweise weiß-schwarz-weiß, seltener aus Metall (Messing, eloxiertes Aluminium). Das bestückte und beschaltete Schlagbrett \\"(loaded pickguard)\\" stellt die elektrische „Zentraleinheit“ der Stratocaster dar und lässt sich problemlos in Gänze austauschen., Das Tremolo besteht aus einem Saitenhalter, bei dem die Saiten in einen Stahlblock unter der Brücke von der Rückseite der Gitarre aus eingefädelt werden. Die Saiten laufen aus dem Stahlblock direkt über die Brückenkonstruktion. Die Brücke wird nur an einer Seite von Schrauben gehalten, so dass es mittels des Tremolohebels möglich ist, sie in Richtung Hals zu kippen. Auf der Rückseite des Korpus sind Federn eingebaut, die dem Saitenzug entgegenwirken und die Brücke in die Waagerechte ziehen. Diese einfache, aber effektive Konstruktion hat entscheidend zur Entwicklung neuer Spieltechniken und neuer Systeme, aber auch zur Namensverwechslung des „Tremolo“ mit dem „Vibrato“ beigetragen (siehe bereits oben)., Für die Einstellung des Tremolo gibt es drei Varianten. Die am weitesten verbreitete ist die Standard-Einstellung, bei der die Tonhöhe nur nach unten verändert werden kann. Je nach verwendeter Saitenstärke oder Vorliebe des Spielers kann das System mit 2 bis 5 Federn bestückt werden (Stevie Ray Vaughan, der oft extrem dicke Saiten benutzte, brauchte 5, um den nötigen Gegenzug zu erzeugen). Die zweite ist das „Lahmlegen“ des Systems. Hier werden die Halteschrauben komplett festgezogen, der Saitenhalter-Block mit einem passenden Stück Holz gegen den Korpus fixiert. Spieler wie z.B. Eric Clapton, die so verfahren, könnten theoretisch auch zu einer „Hardtail“-Strat greifen (ohne Tremolo bzw. Vibrato ausgestatteter Steg, Saiten wie bei der Telecaster von hinten fixiert), wollen aber nicht auf die klangbeeinflussende Wirkung der mitschwingenden Federn verzichten. Die dritte und diffizilste Variante ist die „schwebende“. Hier wird das System so eingestellt, dass es Auslenkung nach unten UND oben zulässt. Diese Einstellung erfordert eine extrem genaue Balance von Federspannung und Saitenstärke, denn schon geringe Abweichungen in der Saitenspannung – z.B. bei Bendings oder gerissener Saite – bringen das Ganze aus der Stimmung. Deshalb wird diese heikle Variante auch nur von wenigen Spielern genutzt. Der bekannteste von ihnen ist Jeff Beck, der mit dieser Einstellung die hochgradig vokale Qualität seines Spiels unterstützt. Wenn man ihn spielen sieht, ist gut zu erkennen, wie er mit dem Handballen permanent sein Tremolo „im Zaum“ hält, um Verstimmungen zu verhindern., Die Elektrik besteht aus drei Single-Coil-Tonabnehmern, die über einen Kippschalter angewählt werden können. Besaßen die ersten Stratocaster einen Dreiwegschalter, mit denen die Tonabnehmer einzeln angewählt werden konnten, wurde in den 1970ern der Fünfwegschalter eingeführt. Mit diesem lassen sich auch die beliebten Kombinationen des Hals- oder Stegtonabnehmers mit dem mittleren Pickup anwählen oder, durch Modifikation der Schaltung, ein \\"Out-of-Phase\\"-Sound, also ein: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Fender-Gitarre, Stratocaster, E-Gitarre, Herstellung, Entwicklung, Klangmöglichkeiten, Vibrato, Konstruktion, Korpus, Elektrik, Tonabnehmer"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Fiktives Pferd, Pferd (Bildende Kunst), Symbol, Wappen (Niedersachsen), Wappentier, Westfalen], Das Sachsenross (auch Niedersachsenross, Westfalenross, Westfalenpferd, Welfenross) ist ein heraldisches Motiv (→ Pferd (Wappentier)). Es steht für das Volk der Sachsen, das alte Stammesherzogtum Sachsen und die aus ihm entstandenen politischen Einheiten, vor allem für die welfischen Herrschaftsgebiete. Es ist seit dem 20. Jahrhundert das Wappenmotiv des Landes Niedersachsen. Als \\"Westfalenpferd\\" mit erhobenem Schweif ist es das traditionelle Wappenmotiv von Westfalen und bildet in dieser Form einen Bestandteil des Wappens des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen., Die niederländische Nachbarregion Twente und die britische Grafschaft Kent tragen dieses Motiv ebenfalls in ihren modernen Wappen., Das Sachsenross hat keine Beziehung zu den sächsischen Fürstentümern auf dem Gebiet der heutigen Bundesländer Sachsen, Thüringen und Sachsen-Anhalt. Der Name dieser Territorien beruht darauf, dass nach dem Sturz Heinrichs des Löwen der Titel \\"Herzog von Sachsen\\" an die Familie der Askanier und später an die Familie der Wettiner neu vergeben wurde. Diese Dynastien waren an der Eroberung slawisch bewohnter Gebiete im Osten beteiligt und nahmen die Stammesbezeichnung elbaufwärts mit sich. Die dort kolonisierende deutschsprachige Mischbevölkerung nannte sich zwar „Sachsen“, beanspruchte das Sachsenross aber nicht mehr für sich. Zur Unterscheidung wurden später die Begriffe „Obersachsen“ und „Niedersachsen“ geprägt., Das Wappenbild der „Niedersachsen“ bzw. der „Westfalen“ besteht aus einem springenden weißen Pferd im roten Schild. Schon zum Zeitpunkt seines ersten Auftretens im 14. Jahrhundert war es eher ein volkstümliches, regionales Symbol als ein dynastisches Herrschaftszeichen, also mehr ein Symbol für das Land und sein Volk als für die regierende Herrscherfamilie der Welfen. Dies macht seine hohe Popularität aus, die sich bis heute in der Volkskunst äußert. Seine Wirkung als regionales Identitätssymbol ist nur noch mit der Ausstrahlung des bayerischen Rautenwappens, des Familienwappens der Wittelsbacher, zu vergleichen., Ursprung im Dunkel der Geschichte., Überblick., Seit seinem erstmaligen Auftreten in Siegeln und Wappen in der zweiten Hälfte des 14. Jahrhunderts gilt das Sachsenross als „altes“ sächsisches Stammessymbol. Seit dieser Zeit wird es als politisches Instrument zum Ausdruck von Machtansprüchen und als Ausdruck der sächsischen Stammesidentität genutzt., Keine vorheraldischen Belege., Die Sachsen waren ein westgermanischer Völkerverband, der sich vermutlich im 3.Jahrhundert bildete und seit dem 4.Jahrhundert sicher belegt ist. Die Stämme der Chauken, Angrivarier und Cherusker, die sich zu den Sachsen zusammenschlossen (Ethnogenese), lebten im 1.Jahrhundert im Nordwesten des heutigen Deutschlands und im Osten der heutigen Niederlande (siehe Niedersächsisch)., Danach gibt es weitere Erwähnungen von spätantiken, frühmittelalterlichen Autoren nicht-sächsischer Herkunft, die die Sachsen nach massiven Ausdehnungsbewegungen als Piraten in der Nordsee, als Söldner in römischen Diensten, später als fremde Siedler in Britannien und als zwangsweise zu christianisierende Heiden am Rande des Frankenreiches wahrnehmen und beschreiben. Keiner dieser Autoren gibt irgendwelche Hinweise darauf, dass das Pferd als Tier oder als Bild irgendeine besondere Bedeutung als Stammessymbol oder Feldzeichen bei den Sachsen gehabt hätte. Auch archäologische Funde aus diesen Jahrhunderten geben keine entsprechenden Hinweise. Zwar sind auf den Gegenständen des täglichen Lebens aus dieser Zeit durchaus Tierdarstellungen zu finden; sie zeigen aber hauptsächlich Jagdwild wie Hirsche und Wildschweine. Pferde wurden auch abgebildet; es ist aber nicht zu erkennen, dass das Pferd eine den Stamm symbolisierende Bedeutung hatte., Als im 10. Jahrhundert die sächsische Herzogsdynastie der Liudolfinger unter der Bezeichnung Ottonen zu Königen des Ostfrankenreichs und dann zu Kaisern des (später so genannten) Heiligen Römischen Reiches bzw. „Teutschen Reiches“ aufstiegen, schrieb der sächsische Mönch Widukind von Corvey die erste „Sachsengeschichte“ \\"(res gestae Saxonicae)\\", diesmal aus der Innensicht. Er erzählte die sächsische Stammessage und berichtete über historische und genealogische Zusammenhänge zum ersten Mal in Schriftform, wobei er entscheidend zur Identitätsbildung der Sachsen beitrug. Das „Sachsenross“ als Stammessymbol kam aber auch bei ihm nicht vor., Die Herleitung des Pferdesymbols aus vorheraldischen oder gar vorhistorischen sächsischen Traditionen basiert nur auf einigen Indizien. Diese Hinweise lassen sich aber plausibel als spätere Interpretationen erklären, die erst im Nachhinein („ex posteriori“) entstanden sind., Herrscher mit „Pferdenamen“., Als Beleg für eine besondere Bedeutung des Pferdes als Machtsymbol bei den Sachsen gelten die „Pferdenamen“ der beiden sagenhaften Sachsenhäuptlinge Hengest und Horsa, die der Legende nach im 5.nachchristlichen Jahrhundert die ersten sächsischen Herrscher auf den britischen Inseln gewesen sein sollen, und zwar im Bereich der heutigen Grafschaft Kent., Auf den ersten Blick bemerkenswert ist die Übereinstimmung mit dem Wappen der englischen Grafschaft Kent., Die Verwendung eines steigenden weißen Pferdes als Zeichen für Kent datiert allerdings erst auf 1605 (in einer Darstellung von, Richard Verstegen in \\"Restitution of Decayed Antiquities\\"). Die offizielle Verleihung des Wappens an die Grafschaft datiert auf 1933., Das weiße Pferd des Widukind., Auch gibt es die Überlieferung, dass Widukind, der Sachsenherzog und Gegenspieler Karls des Großen, im 8.Jahrhundert ein schwarzes Pferd als Feldzeichen gehabt haben soll, das er nach seiner Bekehrung zum Christentum in ein weißes Pferd gewandelt habe. Nach einer anderen Version erhielt Widukind von Karl dem Großen als Taufgeschenk ein weißes Pferd., Die Erinnerung an das vorchristliche schwarze Pferd Widukinds ist noch in einigen Gegenden Westfalens lebendig, so zum Beispiel im Wappen des Kreises Herford. In der Stiftskirche Enger wird ein Grab als das von Widukind angesehen. So zeigt das Wappen des vorgenannten Kreises, in dem auch Enger liegt, im weißen Schild ein schwarzes, steigendes Pferd, was die Verbundenheit der westfälischen Bevölkerung mit ihrem vorchristlichen Anführer ausdrückt. Aber auch diese Geschichten sind spätere Legenden, für die es keine Belege aus der Zeit vor der Entstehung des Sachsenrosses in der Heraldik gibt., Pferdeköpfe an den Giebeln., Als weiteres Indiz für die besondere Stellung von Pferdemotiven im (nieder-)sächsischen Raum kann ein für das niederdeutsche Hallenhaus (Niedersachsenhaus) typischer Giebelschmuck angeführt werden. Dieser norddeutsche Bauernhaustyp weist an der Giebelseite des ortsüblichen Reetdachs zum Schutz vor Witterungseinflüssen so genannte „Giebelbretter“ oder „Windbretter“ auf, die sich im First kreuzen und rund einen halben Meter über den First hinausragen. Aus den Enden dieser Bretter sind typischerweise Pferdeköpfe geschnitzt., Uffington White Horse., Auch das Uffington White Horse wird in der Diskussion um frühe Belege für das Sachsenross angeführt., Sowohl das frühdatierte Uffington White Horse als auch die spät datierten Nachahmungen lassen sich allerdings nicht als Belege für eine vorheraldische Verwendung des Sachsenrosses als Stammessymbol oder Kultobjekt verwenden., Es befindet sich auf der Seite des White Horse Hill in Oxfordshire und gilt als das älteste Scharrbild in England. Es handelt sich um das stilisierte Bild eines Pferdes, welches in die Vegetation geschnitten und in den Boden gescharrt wurde. Dadurch wird die darunter liegende Kreide sichtbar. Die Umrisse werden von 3 Meter breiten, 60 bis 90 Zentimeter tiefen Gräben gebildet. Die Pferdefigur hat die Ausmaße von 107 × 37 Meter., Das Alter des Scharrbildes ist umstritten. Traditionell wurde es mit den angelsächsischen Invasoren Britanniens im 5.Jahrhundert und ihren legendären, halbmythischen Anführern Hengest und Horsa in Verbindung gebracht. Laut einer anderen Überlieferung wurde es sogar erst im 9.Jahrhundert geschaffen, zur Erinnerung an den Sieg König Alfreds des Großen über die Dänen., Neuere Messungen datieren das Uffington-Pferd sogar in die frühe Eisenzeit oder gar die späte Bronzezeit., Andere Scharrbilder von weißen Pferden auf den Hügeln Südenglands gelten jedoch als sehr viel jünger. In der Mehrzahl werden sie als späte Nachahmungen des Uffington-Pferdes aus dem 18. und 19. Jahrhundert angesehen., Bekannte Hinweise auf Pferde in einer besonderen Bedeutung und archäologische Funde in Niedersachsen., Der römische Historiker Tacitus (* um 58 n. Chr.; † um 120) beschreibt in seiner Germania: „Dem Volke eigentümlich ist auch der Rosse Vorahnungen und Warnungen zu erproben. Auf öffentliche Kosten werden die Rosse in Hainen gehalten, schneeweiß und durch keine sterbliche Arbeit befleckt, welche angeschirrt nur den heiligen Wagen der Priester, den König oder Fürste der Gemeinde begleiten und aufmerksam wird ihr Schnauben und Wiehern als Vorahnung beobachtet. Keinem Vorzeichen ist größerer Glaube, nicht allein beim Volk, sondern bei den Vornehmen, bei den Priestern. Sich selbst halten sie für die Diener der Götter, die Rosse jedoch für die Vertrauten der Götter.“, Derartige „Weissagungen“ durch Pferde haben sich auch in einigen alten Überlieferungen, Legenden im Bereich des heutigen Niedersachsens erhalten, wenn neue Städte oder Kirchen, der Legende nach, dort errichtet wurden, wo ein weißes Pferd nach dem Davonlaufen anfing zu grasen. So erzählt es z.B. eine Legende von Steinau in Niedersachsen. Auch Landesgrenzen sollen, nach alten Geschichten / Legenden so festgelegt worden sein., Heute findet man in dieser Gegend noch eine Reihe von Straßen oder Flurnamen, die das \\"Pferd\\" wörtlich genommen im Namen tragen z.B. Hersterkamp, Hesterweg, Hesterberg, Rossenfelde, Hengstforde usw. Herleitung: Hestur bedeutet Pferd im Plural Hesta. Hengst ein männliches unkastriertes Pferd. Auch gibt es bekannte Findlinge in Niedersachsen die mit Pferden in Zusammenhang stehen. So zeigt einer \\"Hufabdrücke\\" die versteinerten, mehrere heißen \\"grauer Hengst\\".

Er fliegt als Wanderfalter auch nach Europa ein, bleibt hier aber abgesehen von vereinzelten Jahren mit Massenauftreten sehr selten. Das Artepitheton \\"livornica\\" bezieht sich auf die Stadt Livorno, wo das erstbeschriebene Exemplar gefunden wurde, ihren deutschen Namen erhielt die Art auf Grund der auffälligen weißen Flügeladern auf den Vorderflügeln., Dieses Merkmal teilt sie mit dem in Amerika verbreiteten \\"Hyles lineata\\", der daher ebenso als Linienschwärmer bezeichnet wird. Lange Zeit wurde \\"Hyles livornica\\" als Unterart des amerikanischen Falters gesehen. Erst im späten 20. Jahrhundert setzte sich die Auffassung durch, dass es sich um zwei unterschiedliche Arten handelt.

Die Flügel und der Körper der Tiere sind überwiegend olivbraun gefärbt. Die Vorderflügel sind olivbraun mit hellerem Vorderrand und einem schwach gewellten Längsstreifen, der am Hinterrand nahe der Flügelwurzel als breiter weißer Streifen beginnt, dann gelblich wird und schließlich allmählich schmaler werdend bis in den Apex verläuft, wo er seine Farbe wieder zu weißlichgrau ändert. Das schmale Saumfeld ist grau bis bräunlichgrau, der Flügelinnenrand ist basal schwärzlich, daran angrenzend befindet sich ein weißer Fleck. Die weißlichen bis gelblichen Flügeladern kontrastieren auffällig mit der Grundfarbe. Auf den Vorderflügeln befindet sich ein sehr feiner, punktförmiger schwarzer, weißlich umrandeter Diskalfleck, der jedoch nicht immer ausgebildet ist. Die Hinterflügel sind rosarot mit schwarzer Basis und einer gleich bleibend breiten schwarzen Saumbinde, die Fransen sind weiß. Am Flügelinnenrand sitzt ein weißer Fleck, der an den rosaroten Bereich angrenzt. Individuen aus dem Osten des Verbreitungsgebietes sind dunkler gefärbt als jene aus Zentralasien und Afrika. In der südlichen Sahara findet man kleinwüchsige, blass gefärbte Tiere, die als forma \\"saharae\\" bezeichnet werden., Der Kopf und der Rücken des Thorax sind olivbraun, der Thorax ist mit weißen Seitenstreifen und weiß gerandeten Schulterdecken (Tegulae) versehen. Der olivbraune Hinterleib weist schwarz-weiße Segmenteinschnitte auf; die ersten beiden Segmente tragen große schwarze und weiße Seitenflecken. Die Fühler sind dunkel olivbraun und haben eine weiße Spitze. Sie werden bei den Männchen 8,5 bis 14, bei den Weibchen 9,5 bis 11 Millimeter lang. Die Weibchen haben Fühler mit nahezu rundem, unterseits leicht abgeflachtem Querschnitt, welche von muschelförmigen Strukturen bedeckt sind. Die Männchen haben Fühler mit oberseits halbkreisförmigem Querschnitt, welche jedoch zur Unterseite hin spitz ausgewölbt sind. Die Oberseite ist beschuppt, die Seiten der ausgewölbten Unterseite tragen dichte Haarbüschel, die aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach als Rezeptoren für Pheromone dienen., Ei., Die Eier des Linienschwärmers sind blassgrün und leicht oval geformt. Sie sind mit 1,1 mal 1,0 Millimetern Größe sehr klein im Verhältnis zur Größe des Falters., Raupe., Die Raupen erreichen eine Körperlänge von 65 bis 80 Millimetern. Sie sind nach dem Schlupf drei bis vier Millimeter lang, haben eine gelblich- bis weißlich-grüne Körperfärbung mit schwarzem Kopf, Thorakalbeinen und ebenso gefärbtem, kurzem Analhorn. Nach Beginn der Nahrungsaufnahme verfärbt sich der Körper grau- bzw. olivgrün. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt sind bereits die beidseits des Rückens verlaufenden, hellen Längslinien zu erkennen., Ab dem zweiten Raupenstadium treten die Raupen in zwei Grundfarben, olivgrün oder schwarz, auf, wobei es gelegentlich auch Individuen gibt, die graugrün gefärbt sind. Ab diesem Stadium besitzen die Raupen bereits ihre endgültige Musterung, die mit jeder weiteren Häutung deutlicher hervortritt. Am Rücken (dorsal) verläuft eine angedeutete gelbgrüne Längslinie. Auffallend sind die beidseits des Rückens (subdorsal) verlaufenden, gelb gefärbten und unter den Stigmen (infrastigmatal) verlaufenden gelb bis fast orange gefärbten Längslinien. Die später auftretenden Augenflecken sind auf der Subdorsallinie als verbreiterte gelbe Flecken gut erkennbar. Der Körper ist insbesondere zwischen den beiden Längslinien fein weiß punktiert, der Kopf hat die Körpergrundfarbe., Nach der zweiten Häutung treten weiterhin schwarz und grün gefärbte Raupen auf, das Analhorn ist einfarbig schwarz. Die weißliche Punktierung des Körpers tritt stärker hervor und kann manche Exemplare dadurch auch grau wirken lassen. Die Färbung und Intensität der Rückenlinie ist variabel, das Spektrum reicht von einer fast fehlenden undeutlichen Zeichnung bis zu einer deutlichen kräftigen Gelbfärbung. Bei grün gefärbten Raupen kann die Rückenlinie nahezu weiß ausgebildet sein. Die Subdorsallinien sind hellgelb, die Augenflecken sind deutlich gelb erkennbar und schwarz umrandet, da in diesem Bereich die weißliche Punktierung fehlt. Die Infrastigmatallinien sind gelb., Im vierten Raupenstadium haben die vormals grün gefärbten Tiere ebenfalls eine schwarze Grundfarbe, Kopf, Bauch- und Thorakalbeine sind einfarbig schwarz. Die Punktierung ist gelb. Die Dorsallinie fehlt häufig; falls vorhanden ist sie gelblich bis orange oder rot gefärbt. Die Subdorsalen fehlen ebenso häufig, sind jedoch gelegentlich als gelbe Fleckenlinie oder als breite durchgehende gelbe Linie ausgebildet. Die Augenflecke sind gelb und haben gelegentlich einen orangen Farbstich. Das schwarze Analhorn besitzt nun eine orange Basis., Im fünften und letzten Raupenstadium sind die Raupen nach der Häutung etwa 36 Millimeter lang und entwickeln sich bis zur Verpuppung zu ihrer eingangs beschriebenen Länge. Ihre Färbung ist in diesem Stadium sehr variabel. Die Grundfarbe ist schwarz, die Punktierung ist gelb und häufig sehr dominant. Der Rücken ist meist schwarz und hat oft sattelartige Ausbuchtungen auf jedem Segment, wobei dieser gesamte Bereich nicht punktiert ist. Die Rückenlinie ist gelblich, gelegentlich auch rosa gefärbt und verläuft ab dem dritten Segment bis zur Basis des Analhorns. Die Infrastigmatallinien sind weißlich und blassrosa oder als gelbe bzw. meist orange Reihen von Flecken ausgebildet. Das Analhorn ist gelborange bis rötlich-rosa gefärbt, mit schwarzer Spitze und hat eine rau gekörnte Oberfläche. Es ist nahezu gerade, verjüngt sich gleichmäßig kegelförmig und endet in einer abgestumpften Spitze. Der Kopf und der sattelartige Bereich am Rücken des zweiten Körpersegments sind schwarz oder rosa gefärbt. Die gelblichen, manchmal mittig rosa gefärbten und schwarz umrandeten Augenflecken sind auf dem vierten bis 11. Segment rund, auf dem 12. birnenförmig und auf dem 13. Segment in zwei separate Flecken getrennt. Gelegentlich findet sich anstelle dieser Augenflecken nur ein gelber Längsstreifen. Die Beine und der Nachschieber sind schwarz, die Bauchbeine sind rosa und besitzen schwarze Hakenkränze. Die Bauchseite der Raupen ist glanzlos rosa gefärbt, die Stigmen sind weiß. Es gibt Individuen, bei denen die Rückenlinie, die Infrastigmatallinien und die Augenflecken orangerot gefärbt sind; andere besitzen grün gefärbte Längsstreifen, sind ausgedehnt schwarz gefärbt oder haben eine violett gefärbte Bauchseite. Aus Nordafrika sind blass-apfelgrüne Formen mit gelber Punktierung und Augenflecken bekannt., Puppe., Die Puppe ist 30 bis 45 Millimeter lang und hat eine glanzlose, leicht körnig strukturierte Oberfläche. Sie ist variabel braun gefärbt, kann jedoch auch gelblich oder sogar durchscheinend sein. Sie ist langgestreckter und schlanker als die Puppen der meisten Arten der Gattung \\"Hyles\\". Der Kremaster, der wie die letzten Hinterleibssegmente dunkler braun gefärbt ist als die restliche Oberfläche der Puppe, endet in einer kurzen dünnen Spitze, die erst bei starker Vergrößerung als aus zwei kurzen Spitzen bestehend erkennbar wird., Ähnliche Arten., Die Art kann auf den ersten Blick mit mehreren Arten der Gattung \\"Hyles\\", wie beispielsweise dem \\"Hyles dahlii\\" oder \\"Hyles tithymali\\" verwechselt werden, ist aber anhand ihrer hell gefärbten Flügeladern auf den Vorderflügeln gut zu unterscheiden. Die australisch verbreitete Art \\"Hyles livornicoides\\" sowie die amerikanisch verbreitete Art \\"Hyles lineata\\" sehen dem Linienschwärmer wegen ihrer ebenso gefärbten Flügeladern sehr ähnlich. Weibchen von \\"Hyles lineata\\" haben jedoch auf der Oberseite vollständig weißlich gefärbte Fühler, bei den Männchen sind sie gelblichbraun. Hinter dem Kopf in der Mitte des Prothorax befindet sich bei ihnen ein weißer Längsstreifen und je ein weiterer, sehr feiner Mittelstreifen auf den Tegulae. Am Hinterleib befinden sich nicht zwei, sondern beidseits vier bis fünf schwarze Flecken, die zum Hinterleibsende hin gleichmäßig kleiner werden.

Hoeidō-Edition) (, \\"Tōkaidō gojūsan tsugi no uchi Hoeidō-ban\\"), ist eine Serie von Farbholzschnitten, die in der ersten Hälfte der 1830er Jahre von dem japanischen Künstler Utagawa Hiroshige entworfen wurde. Mit den Entwürfen für diese Serie begründete Hiroshige seinen Ruf als bedeutendster Landschaftskünstler Japans im Bereich des Farbholzschnitts während der letzten Jahrzehnte der Edo-Zeit. Benannt ist die Serie nach dem Serientitel und dem Zusatz \\"Hoeidō\\", dem registrierten Firmennamen des Verlegers Takenouchi Magohachi, der für die Produktion des größten Teils der Drucke verantwortlich zeichnete., Die \\"Hoeidō\\"-Ausgabe war die erste Serie Hiroshiges mit dem Titel \\"Die 53 Stationen des Tōkaidō\\". Bis zum Tod des Künstlers im Jahr 1858 folgten mindestens neun Serien mit demselben Titel und mindestens 13 weitere, die den Tōkaidō und dessen Stationen zum Thema hatten., Die Serie umfasst 55 Drucke, beziehungsweise, mit den späteren zweiten Versionen von sechs Drucken, insgesamt 61 Blätter. Herausgegeben wurde die Serie zunächst gemeinsam von den beiden Verlegern Tsuruya Kiemon und Takenouchi Magohachi. Nach der Veröffentlichung von elf gemeinsam produzierten Drucken und einem nur unter seinem Namen erschienenen Druck schied Tsuruya Kiemon aus unbekannten Gründen als Herausgeber aus und Takenouchi Magohachi führte das Projekt allein weiter. Vor dem Erscheinen der \\"53 Stationen des Tōkaidō\\" war Hiroshige ein weitgehend unbekannter Farbholzschnittkünstler. Die Beliebtheit der Drucke und der damit verbundene Verkaufserfolg machten ihn hinter Kunisada und Kuniyoshi zum beliebtesten Farbholzschnittkünstler seiner Zeit. Die Drucke der Serie erfuhren zahlreiche Neuauflagen und wurden so lange nachgedruckt, bis die ersten Druckplatten verschlissen waren und durch neue ersetzt werden mussten. Bereits in der Meiji-Zeit existierten viele unterschiedliche Versionen von verschiedenen Verlegern. Mit der Entdeckung japanischer Kunst durch westliche Sammler, zunächst aus den USA, dann auch aus Frankreich, Großbritannien und Deutschland, erlangten die Drucke Hiroshiges, und insbesondere die Drucke seiner ersten Serie \\"Die 53 Stationen der Tōkaidō\\", im Westen Bekanntheit. Die Serie enthält einige der besten Arbeiten des Künstlers, wie zum Beispiel die Stationen Mariko, Kambara, Shōno und Kameyama. Diese Drucke zählen neben Hokusais \\"Großer Welle\\" zu den bekanntesten japanischen Farbholzschnitten außerhalb Japans., Veröffentlichung., Hiroshige war um 1830 ein weitgehend unbekannter Künstler, der bis dahin nur wenige Aufträge für den Entwurf von Farbholzschnitten erhalten hatte. Um 1830 übertrug ihm der Verleger Kawaguchiya Shōzō den Auftrag, eine Serie von großformatigen Drucken (das heißt Drucke im \\"ōban\\"-Format) von Ansichten bekannter Orte in Edo zu gestalten („Berühmte Ansichten der Osthauptstadt“, \\"Tōto meisho\\", ). Die Serie war kein überragender Erfolg, erlebte jedoch bereits mehrere Auflagen, wie unterschiedliche Druckzustände belegen. Die Serie, die Hiroshige als Künstler der Landschaftsdrucke (\\"fūkeiga\\", ) bekannt machte, war die Serie dem Titel „Die 53 Stationen des Tōkaidō“ \\"(Tōkaidō gojūsan tsugi no uchi)\\"., Zu Beginn der 1830er Jahre erschienen die ersten Drucke dieser Serie und waren ebenso wie die vorhergehende Serie im \\"ōban\\"-Querformat angelegt. Gemeinsame Verleger der ersten elf Drucke waren Tsuruya Kiemon und Takenouchi Magohachi, der Druck der Station \\"Okabe\\" wurde alleine von Tsuruya Kiemon herausgegeben und die weiteren 43 Drucke produzierte Takenouchi Magohachi alleine. Wer die Idee für dieses Projekt hatte und wer wen zuerst angesprochen hat, ist nicht mehr zu klären. Für Takenouchi Magohachi war es das erste Projekt als Verleger, Tsuruya Kiemon war ein alteingesessenes Verlagshaus. Nach Tsuruya Kiemons Ausscheiden, über dessen Gründe nichts bekannt ist, führte Takenouchi Magohachi das Projekt alleine fort., Die Drucke zeigen Szenen rund um die Stationen des Tōkaidō, der damals wichtigsten Überlandverbindung von Edo nach Kyōto, und deren umliegende Landschaften sowie zusätzlich den Startpunkt Nihonbashi in Edo und die Endstation bei Kyōto (damals auch \\"Keishi\\" genannt). Sie sind nicht in der Reihenfolge der Stationen entstanden; allenfalls orientierte sich die Reihenfolge der Entwürfe lose an der Abfolge der Raststationen., Beim Publikum und den zeitgenössischen Kritikern fanden die Drucke großen Anklang und wurden, nachdem alle Einzeldrucke erschienen waren, von Takenouchi Magohachi in zwei Bänden in Buchform herausgegeben. Der Titel auf dem Einband der Bücher lautete „Aufeinanderfolgende Bilder der 53 Stationen des Tōkaidō“ (\\"Shinkei Tōkaidō gojūsan eki tsuzukie\\", ). Der Serientitel auf den Drucken selbst blieb unverändert. Allerdings waren die Drucke in den beiden Bänden mittig vertikal gefaltet, da die Bücher im \\"chūban\\"-Format (halbes \\"ōban\\"-Format) erschienen. Viele der heute erhaltenen Drucke der Serie weisen diese Mittelfalte als Hinweis darauf aus, dass sie ursprünglich aus einem dieser Bücher stammen. Heute ist kein vollständiges Exemplar der Erstauflage dieser Bücher mehr bekannt., Schätzungen zufolge wurden von einzelnen Blättern der Serie bis zu 25.000 Exemplare von den ersten Druckplatten gefertigt, bis diese nicht mehr zu gebrauchen waren. Bereits im 19. Jahrhundert waren neue Platten geschnitten worden, um weitere Auflagen anzufertigen. Im 20. Jahrhundert erfolgten weitere Neuauflagen und selbst im 3. Jahrtausend werden noch immer Drucke dieser Serie als Farbholzschnitte und Reproduktionen verkauft., Ein größerer Teil der Drucke wurde nach der Erstveröffentlichung einer Überarbeitung unterzogen (Änderung der Farbpalette, Ausfüllen kleiner Fehlstellen, Weglassen einzelner Konturlinien etc.), so dass sie in zahlreichen unterschiedlichen Varianten erhalten sind. Ob diese Veränderungen auf Überlegungen Hiroshiges oder des Verlegers oder gar beider zurückzuführen ist, ist heute nicht mehr feststellbar. Gesichert ist, dass einige der Änderungen bereits nach der ersten Auflage erfolgt sein müssen, da einzelne Blätter im Zustand der Erstauflage extrem selten sind. Von sechs Stationen wurde in der zweiten Hälfte der 1830er Jahre eine zweite Druckversion angefertigt, die möglicherweise verlorengegangene oder beschädigte Druckplatten ersetzten. Diese neuen sind den vorhergehenden Versionen ähnlich, aber nicht mit ihnen identisch., Der kommerzielle Erfolg der Serie Hiroshiges stand im engen Zusammenhang mit dem immens angewachsenen Reiseverkehr in Japan in den ersten Jahrzehnten des 19. Jahrhunderts, die eine Gesellschaft hervorgebracht hatten, die „süchtig nach Reisen und verrückt nach Souvenirs“ war. Unmittelbarer Vorgänger von Hiroshiges Serie waren Katsushika Hokusais Drucke der „36 Ansichten des Berges Fuji“, die in ihrem Format und der Bildgestaltung, Darstellung von Menschen, eingebettet in eine sie umgebende Landschaft, Vorbildcharakter sowohl für Hiroshige als auch andere Landschaftsmaler seiner Zeit hatten., Mit seiner Serie traf Hiroshige jedoch noch mehr als Hokusai den Geschmack breiter Bevölkerungsschichten und setzte den Gedanken des Ukiyo als der „heiteren, vergänglichen Welt“ vollendet in den japanischen Landschaftsdruck um. Neu an Hiroshiges künstlerischer Landschaftsauffassung war nicht, dass er „lebendige Straßenszenen mit geschäftigen Menschen aus dem einfachen Volk (zum) Gegenstand der künstlerischen Auseinandersetzung“ machte. Solche Genreszenen waren zuvor bereits unter anderem von Utagawa Toyohiro und Hokusai gezeichnet worden. Neu an Hiroshiges Bildern war die harmonische Eingliederung der Menschendarstellung in weitläufige Landschaften. Er gestaltete lyrische Bilder, in denen der Betrachter die Stimmung der Natur ungetrübt von philosophischem Nachsinnen über Natur und Mensch unmittelbar wahrnehmen konnte. Die Drucke der Serie waren durchdrungen von expressiver poetischer Sensibilität. Hiroshiges innovativer Stil und die Wahl des horizontalen \\"ōban\\"-Formats stellten einen neuen Schwerpunkt in der Auffassung des Tōkaidō dar und präsentierten eine neue Art des Landschaftsdruckes. Ihre andauernde Popularität und ihr Einfluss auf andere Künstler sind die Gründe für Hiroshiges Ruhm., Entstehungsgeschichte., Zur Entstehung der Serie hatte Hiroshige III., Schüler Hiroshiges I. und zweiter Ehemann von dessen Tochter, im Jahr 1894 kurz vor seinem Tod beiläufig in einem Zeitungsinterview geäußert, dass die Drucke der Serie auf Entwürfe zurückzuführen seien, die Hiroshige I. als Angehöriger einer offiziellen Delegation des Shōgun angefertigt habe. Die Delegation habe im Jahr 1832 den Auftrag gehabt, ein Pferd als Geschenk des Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari von Edo an den Kaiserhof in Kyōto zu überbringen. Unterwegs habe Hiroshige seine Reiseeindrücke in Skizzen festgehalten und nach seiner Rückkehr nach Edo im 9. Monat des Jahres Tenpō 3 (entspricht in etwa dem September des Jahres 1832) dem Verleger Takenouchi Magohachi angeboten, die Skizzen als Vorlagen für eine Farbholzschnittserie umzuarbeiten. Diese Geschichte übernahm zunächst Iijima Kyōshin in sein 1894 erschienenes Buch „Biografien der Ukiyo-e-Künstler der Utagawa-Schule“ (\\"Utagawa retsuden\\", ). Dann wurde sie 1930 von Minoru Uchida in dessen erste umfassende Biografie Hiroshiges aufgenommen. Von da an fand sie sich ungeprüft in der gesamten Literatur, die über Hiroshige erschienen ist. Zum Teil wurde sie soweit ausgeschmückt, dass Hiroshige möglicherweise sogar im Auftrag des Shōgun seine Skizzen angefertigt habe., Suzuki äußerte 1970 in seinem Buch „Hiroshige“ erste Zweifel an dieser Entstehungsgeschichte, indem er auf die Ähnlichkeit der Hiroshige-Drucke der Stationen Ishibe und Kanaya mit den entsprechenden Abbildungen im bereits 1797 erschienenen \\"Tokaidō meisho zue\\" hinwies. Matthi Forrer griff 1997 diese Zweifel auf und wies auf die Unmöglichkeit hin, dass die Serie in 15 Monaten von Oktober 1832 bis zum Ende des Jahres 1834 fertiggestellt worden sein konnte. Weitere Zweifel äußerte Timothy Clark 2004 und bezog sich dabei auf einen 1998 von Jun’ichi Okubo in Japan veröffentlichten Artikel. Clark hält die Geschichte von der Beteiligung Hiroshiges an einer offiziellen Delegation für einen Schwindel. 2004 erschien die bislang umfassendste Monografie über Hiroshiges erste Tōkaidō-Serie von J: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1. 1830er 2.

Sie gilt als erste in Massenfertigung produzierte Massivkorpus-E-Gitarre. Ursprünglich in zwei Modelllinien unter den Namen Esquire und Broadcaster vorgestellt, musste letztere aus namensrechtlichen Gründen bald in \\"Telecaster\\" umbenannt werden. Die Telecaster, kurz auch Tele genannt, wird seit ihrem Erscheinen von vielen namhaften Musikern gespielt und gilt heute neben der Fender Stratocaster und der Gibson Les Paul als Klassiker unter den E-Gitarren., Geschichte., Leo Fender, der ursprünglich ein kleines Radiogeschäft in Fullerton, Kalifornien, besaß, begann schon früh mit der Konstruktion und Reparatur von Musikverstärkern. In den 1940er Jahren startete er zusammen mit Clayton Orr „Doc“ Kauffman unter dem Namen „K&amp;F Manufacturing Corporation“ (K&amp;F als Abkürzung von Kauffman und Fender) die Produktion von Lapsteel-Gitarren. Da Kauffman nur herkömmliche Gitarre spielte und Fender Saiteninstrumente gar nicht beherrschte, stellten die beiden im Jahr 1943 zu Testzwecken eine primitive E-Gitarre her. Diese war im Kern eine Lapsteel, welche mit einem normal spielbaren Gitarrenhals ausgestattet wurde. Das Griffbrett mit den Bünden wurde aus einem Katalog geordert und passte nicht ganz zur Mensur der Gitarre, weshalb das Instrument nach Angaben von Zeitzeugen immer leicht verstimmt klang. Dieses Instrument sollte ursprünglich von Kauffman zum Testen neuer Tonabnehmer benutzt werden, wurde jedoch auch an Musiker verliehen, die ihre Gitarren bei Fender zur Reparatur abgaben., Im Laufe der 1940er Jahre kam bei Musikern und Herstellern von Instrumenten die Idee auf, Gitarren mit massivem Korpus zu bauen (englisch: \\"Solidbody\\"). Diese sollten sowohl unerwünschte Rückkopplungen des hohlen Korpus der Akustikgitarre überwinden, als auch einen klaren elektrischen Ton erzeugen. Bereits in den 1930er-Jahren hatte „Doc“ Kauffman zusammen mit der Firma Rickenbacker eine E-Gitarre aus massivem Bakelit entwickelt. Diese war mit einem elektromechanischen Vibrato ausgestattet und so schwer, dass sie nur auf einen Ständer montiert gespielt werden konnte. Im Jahr 1931 entwarf George Beauchamp gemeinsam mit Rickenbacker die erste in Serie produzierte Gitarre mit elektromagnetischem Tonabnehmer, das Lapsteel-Modell Rickenbacker Frying Pan. Der Musiker Les Paul stellte um 1940 eine scherzhaft „The Log“ \\"(„Holzklotz“)\\" genannte E-Gitarre her, indem er eine akustische Jazzgitarre auseinandersägte und einen massiven Holzklotz als neuen Mittelteil montierte. Der Motorradmechaniker Paul Bigsby konstruierte 1948 zusammen mit dem Musiker Merle Travis eine teilweise massive E-Gitarre, die Bigsby/Travis-Gitarre, die von Bigsby als Kleinserie gebaut wurde, und die in der Folgezeit besonders bei kalifornischen Countrymusikern bescheidene Erfolge erzielte. Leo Fender, der bei vielen Konzerten in Kalifornien als Techniker anwesend war, beobachtete diese Entwicklungen genau und lieh sich von Travis dessen Gitarre zur Begutachtung aus., Inspiriert von den verschiedenen Ideen und Ansätzen entwickelte Fender zum Ende der 1940er Jahre seine eigene Gitarre. Schon zu Beginn der Überlegungen stand für Fender fest, dass die Gitarre leicht und billig herzustellen sein musste. Folglich stammten Elektronik und Metallteile aus der Produktion der Lapsteels, der Korpus des ersten Prototyps bestand aus günstigem Sperrholz. Der Hals aus Ahornholz war im Gegensatz zur traditionellen Bauweise nicht mit dem Korpus verleimt, sondern verschraubt. Dieses Konstruktionsmerkmal übernahm Fender von Kauffmans Bakelit-Gitarre, bei der der Hals ebenfalls geschraubt war. Vorteil dieser Konstruktion ist neben der vereinfachten Produktion die leichte Austauschbarkeit des Halses zu Reparaturzwecken. Fender ging sogar so weit, dass er bei der Konstruktion des Halses auf einen eingelegten Stahlstab verzichtete. Dieser 1921 für Gibson patentgeschützte (US1446758) Halsspannstab verhindert bei herkömmlichen Hälsen ein Verbiegen durch den Saitenzug und ist auf Gitarren mit Stahlsaiten nahezu unverzichtbar. Fender war jedoch der Meinung, dass Gitarristen defekte und verzogene Hälse der Telecaster einfach durch einen neuen ersetzen würden. Der provisorisch weiß lackierte Prototyp wurde an verschiedene Musiker ausgeliehen, um deren Reaktion auf das neue Instrument festzustellen. Nach ersten positiven Rückmeldungen bereitete Fender sich auf eine Serienproduktion vor., Die erste Serienproduktion besaß im Gegensatz zu dem Prototyp einen Korpus aus massivem Eschenholz (ein Holz, das leicht und billig in großen Mengen zu beschaffen war). Zudem waren nun auf einer schmalen asymmetrischen Kopfplatte die sechs Stimmmechaniken in einer Reihe versetzt hintereinander angebracht. Dieses Detail übernahm Fender von der Bigsby/Travis-Gitarre, und es wurde zu einem Kennzeichen von Fenderinstrumenten. Die Erfindung dieses Konstruktionsprinzips für Gitarren-Kopfplatten wird dem österreichischen Gitarrenbauer Johann Georg Stauffer zugeschrieben, der es im Jahr 1825 in Wien erstmals angewendet hatte. Durch die zwar längere jedoch schmalere Form der Kopfplatte, die zudem nicht nach hinten abgeknickt ist, reichen ebenso kompakte Rohlinge für den Hals aus, der Holzverschnitt bleibt gering. Zudem werden die Saiten geradeaus zu den Stimmmechaniken geführt, und nicht am Sattel seitlich geknickt wie bei konventionellen symmetrischen Kopfplatten., Es wurde zunächst nur ein Tonabnehmer aus der Lapsteelproduktion am Steg eingebaut, unter einer Chrom-Abdeckplatte, auf die später verzichtet wurde. Dieses Serienmodell wurde –zunächst ohne Halsstab– im Sommer 1950 unter dem Namen \\"Esquire\\" vorgestellt. Nachdem sich einige Hälse bereits bei Auslieferung verzogen, drängten die Händler darauf, die Instrumente mit einem Halsstab auszustatten, zumal das Patent auslief. Da die Produktion der Hälse bereits lief, konnte der Halsstab nicht ohne großen Aufwand nach der traditionellen Methode eingesetzt werden. Bei dieser Konstruktion verläuft der Stahlstab unter dem Griffbrett, welches separat auf den Hals aufgeleimt wird. Bei der Telecaster wurden die Bünde direkt in den Hals eingesetzt, weshalb sie kein separates Griffbrett besaß. Daher erdachte Fender ein Verfahren, bei der der Halsstab durch eine Fräsung an der Rückseite des Halses eingesetzt wird. Die so entstandene Spalte wird später mit einem dunklen Holzstreifen verschlossen (\\"Skunkstripe\\")., Im Winter des Jahres 1950 erschien neben der überarbeiteten \\"Esquire\\" die \\"Broadcaster.\\" Diese wies nun serienmäßig den Einstellstab im Hals auf und hatte zudem einen zweiten Tonabnehmer im Lipstick-Format am Halsansatz. Der Name „Broadcaster“ spielte auf die zu der Zeit beliebten Radioübertragungen (\\"broadcast\\", englisch für „Rundfunk“) an und sollte der Gitarre ein modernes Image geben. Allerdings hatte die Firma Gretsch schon ein Schlagzeug mit dem Namen „Broadkaster“ (mit\\"k\\") im Programm, und nach einer Mitteilung von Gretsch musste Fender die Bezeichnung bereits im Februar 1951 zurückziehen. Um die Produktion nicht zu stoppen, wählte Fender eine pragmatische Lösung und verkaufte sein Topmodell zunächst ohne Modellbezeichnung. Dafür wurden bei den Abziehbild-Logos vor dem Anbringen die Aufschrift „Broadcaster“ mit einer Schere abgeschnitten, so dass auf der Kopfplatte lediglich „Fender“ zu lesen war. Sammler bezeichnen Gitarren dieser Phase heute als \\"Nocaster.\\" In Anspielung auf die damals neue Technologie des Fernsehens wurde die Gitarre im Sommer 1951 nach gründlicher Recherche durch Fenders Rechtsanwälte in \\"Telecaster\\" (\\"telecast\\", englische Kurzform für „Fernsehsendung“) umbenannt. Unter dieser Bezeichnung wird sie bis heute gebaut., Leo Fender stellte 1951 den Fender Precision Bass vor, der zunächst noch der Telecaster ähnlich war, mit einem kantigen Korpus, einem großflächigen Schlagbrett, sowie einem kleinen rechtwinkligen Aufnahmeblech für die zwei Regler (ohne Umschalter). Da der Bass mit längerem Hals und schwerer Kopfplatte noch kopflastiger war als die Telecaster wurde der obere Gurtabnahmepunkt gemäß \\"form follows function\\" an einem Hornfortsatz angebracht, der ähnlich geformt war wie der untere Korpusausschnitt, aber wesentlich weiter Richtung Kopf reichte. Diese „zweifach gehörnte“ Korpusform, später mit abgerundeten Kanten und Abschrägungen an der Oberseite, war Grundlage für die Entwicklung der Stratocaster. Er begann damit im Jahr 1952 in der Annahme, dass dieses mit drei Tonabnehmern sowie Vibrato-Mechanik aufwendigere Modell die Telecaster, zu deren ersten Spielern Jimmy Bryant (1925–1980) gehörte, komplett ersetzen werde. Da die günstige Telecaster jedoch besonders bei Country-, Blues- und Rockmusikern sehr beliebt war, 1966 galt sie als „the most wanted guitar in Britain“, übertraf sie noch über Jahre hinaus die Verkaufszahlen der Stratocaster. Aus diesem Grund blieb die einfache Telecaster im Programm des Herstellers und wird bis heute nahezu unverändert hergestellt. Zum 70. Geburtstag des Instrumentes brachte Fender 2020 eine hochpreisige Jubiläums-Broadcaster heraus. Da die Marke Gretsch mittlerweile zum Fender-Konzern gehört, konnte der ursprüngliche Name nun wieder verwendet werden., Konstruktion., Die Telecaster ist eine E-Gitarre mit einer Mensur von 648mm. Ihre Korpus-Form ist dem Umriss herkömmlicher, akustischer Gitarre mit Resonanzkörper nachempfunden, jedoch in massiver Solidbody-Bauweise ausgeführt und daher wesentlich flacher. Der Korpus besteht aus einem oder mehreren massiven Teilen Holz, wobei für die Telecaster anfangs nur Eschenholz verwendet wurde, inzwischen werden viele Exemplare auch mit einem Korpus aus Erlenholz gefertigt. Der Hals besteht aus Ahorn. Am Übergang vom Korpus zum Hals gibt es an der Unterseite eine Aussparung, das so genannte \\"Cutaway\\", wodurch ein komfortables Spiel auch in den hohen Lagen ermöglicht wird., Bestanden bei den ersten Modellen Hals und Griffbrett aus einem Stück Ahorn (\\"One-Piece-Mapleneck\\"), wurde bei einigen späteren Modellen ein Griffbrett aus Palisander aufgeleimt. Ursprünglich hatte das Griffbrett der Telecaster 21 Bünde, was bei späteren Modellen auf 22 erweitert wurde. Leo Fender wählte die Hölzer nicht vorwiegend nach klanglichen Aspekten aus, sondern orientierte sich bereits in der Prototypphase an der einfachen industriellen Herstellung. Esche für den großen Korpus war günstig und in großen Mengen zu beschaffen, Ahorn für den Hals war stabil und hatte bei der Produktion von Bowlingpins und Baseballschlägern bewiesen, dass es mit industriellen Maschinen einfach zu bearbeiten war., In der ursprünglichen und auch in der heutigen Grund: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Fender-Gitarre, Telecaster, Massenfertigung, Esquire, Broadcaster, Leo Fender, Konstruktion, Solidbody, Mensur, Korpus"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Dampflokomotive Achsfolge 2B1, Schienenfahrzeug (Sächsische Maschinenfabrik), Triebfahrzeug (Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen)], Die Lokomotiven der Gattung X formula_1 der Königlich Sächsischen Staatseisenbahnen waren Schnellzug-Schlepptenderlokomotiven der Bauart Atlantic. Die einst als \\"„Paukenschlag der Moderne“\\" wahrgenommenen Lokomotiven führten zu einem Entwicklungsschub bei der Konstruktion schnellfahrender Dampflokomotiven in Deutschland. Die Gattung X V gilt als erste Vierzylinder-Verbundlokomotive dieser Bauart in Deutschland., Wichtigstes Einsatzgebiet waren die Schnellzugverbindungen auf den Hauptbahnen Leipzig–Dresden–Bodenbach und Leipzig–Hof. Die Deutsche Reichsbahn ordnete die Lokomotiven noch in die Baureihe 14.2 ein, musterte sie jedoch schon bis 1926 vollständig aus., Geschichte., Die ab den 1890er Jahren eingesetzten Lokomotiven der Gattungen VIb V, VIII 2 und VIII V 1 waren für ihre Zeit ausreichend leistungsfähig. Es war jedoch absehbar, dass die Zuglasten weiter steigen würden. Um einem Lokmangel vorzubeugen, bemühten sich die Königlich Sächsischen Staatseisenbahnen schon frühzeitig um eine Neukonstruktion. Das vom Leiter des Maschinentechnischen Bureaus in der Generaldirektion der Staatsbahn Ewald Richard Klien aufgestellte Leistungsprogramm sah vor, den damals schwersten Zug der Königlich Sächsischen Staatseisenbahnen, den 385Tonnen schweren Hofzug des sächsischen Königs, auf der Bahnstrecke Leipzig–Dresden ohne Halt mit 100Kilometer pro Stunde zu befördern. Die dazu erforderliche Leistung wurde auf rund 1300 PS geschätzt., Diese Forderung war nur unter Rückgriff auf die damals modernsten Entwicklungen zu erfüllen. Vor allem das von Alfred de Glehn bei der Elsässischen Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden entwickelte Triebwerk versprach mit seiner Vierzylinder-Verbundausführung einen guten Entwicklungsansatz. Außerdem vermutete die Staatsbahnverwaltung, dass eine Zweizylindermaschine den zu erwartenden Kräften nicht unbeschadet standhalten würde. Die Sächsische Maschinenfabrik vormals Richard Hartmann in Chemnitz als Hauslieferant der Kgl. Sächsischen Staatseisenbahnen verhandelte deshalb mit dem elsässischen Unternehmen, um dessen Patente nutzen zu können. Damit versuchte man eigene Entwicklungskosten zu sparen und die Risiken bei der Konstruktion der Lokomotive zu minimieren., \\"Zeitgleich mit den Chemnitzern wurde auch im Elsass eine ähnliche Verbundlokomotive mit der Achsfolge 2B1 entwickelt und gebaut. Diese für die französische Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord vorgesehene Maschine erhielt die Nr. 2.641.\\", Auf der Weltausstellung im Sommer 1900 in Paris wurden die von der Sächsischen Maschinenfabrik hergestellte Lokomotive mit der späteren Bahnnummer 175 (Fabriknummer 2600) und die französische „Schwester“ mit der Nummer 2.642 ausgestellt. Beide erhielten die Goldmedaille des Grand Prix. Mit der Neuentwicklung brach die eingetretene Erstarrung beim Bau von Lokomotiven für schwere und schnelle Reisezüge auf. Das Erscheinungsbild im Schnellzugverkehr änderte sich durch die neuen Lokomotiven in den nächsten zehn Jahren grundlegend. Ähnliche Maschinen wurden 1902 bis 1906 von der Elsässischen Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft als Gattung S 7 an die Preußischen Staatsbahnen geliefert. Die von der Maschinenfabrik erhofften Aufträge von außerhalb Sachsens blieben aus., Die Kgl. Sächsischen Staatseisenbahnen erwarben die Lokomotive und eine weitere baugleiche mit der späteren Bahnnummer 176 (Fabriknummer 2492) zum Stückpreis von 81.431 Goldmark. Der Tender kostete 15.037 Goldmark das Stück. Nach Beendigung der Weltausstellung wurden die Lokomotiven einem Erprobungsprogramm auf den Strecken Leipzig–Dresden sowie Leipzig–Hof unterzogen. Bei Zugmassen von 100 bis 110Tonnen erreichten die Maschinen eine Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 125Kilometern pro Stunde. Bei optimalem Dampfverbrauch erreichten die Lokomotiven eine Leistung von 1180 PS. Der Eigenverbrauch der Lokomotive lag bei 485 PS. Damit war es möglich, einen 325Tonnen schweren Zug zu befördern. Kurzzeitig konnten Leistungen bis zu 1350 PS erreicht werden., Die Bauart prädestinierte die Lokomotiven für den Schnellzugverkehr auf den Flachlandstrecken. Nach dem Ende der Erprobung wurden die Lokomotiven dem Heizhaus Leipzig Dresdner Bf zugeteilt., Die guten Ergebnisse veranlasste die Staatseisenbahn weitere Lokomotiven nachzubestellen. Die im November und Dezember 1902 zum Stückpreis von 76.282 Mark gelieferten Maschinen mit den Bahnnummern 183 bis 189 (Fabrik-Nr. 2753 bis 2759) wurden in den Heizhäusern Dresden-Altstadt II und Leipzig Dresdner Bf stationiert. Von dort kamen sie auf der Strecke Dresden-Bodenbach sowie zwischen Leipzig und Dresden zum Einsatz., Die im Februar 1903 angelieferten Lokomotiven Nummer 190 bis 192 (Stückpreis von 71.821 Mark) wurden im Heizhaus Hof Sächsischer Bf stationiert und fuhren auf der Strecke zwischen Hof und Leipzig. Die 165 Kilometer lange Strecke konnte mit einem Wasserhalt bewältigt werden. Nach einem Umbau 1903 wurden auch die Lokomotiven 175 und 176, danach als 181 und 182 nummeriert, auf dieser Strecke eingesetzt. Die im Februar und April 1903 zum Preis von 71.842 Mark gelieferten Lokomotiven wurden wiederum in Dresden beheimatet. Mit der Beheimatung von Lokomotiven der Gattung XII H in Hof 1906 verlegte man die Hofer X V zum Heizhaus Dresden-Altstadt II., Die Unterhaltung der Maschinen erfolgte während ihrer gesamten Lebenszeit in der Werkstätte Dresden-Friedrichstadt. Auch nach Aufkommen der X H1 wurden die Lokomotiven weiterhin auf der Relation Leipzig–Dresden–Bodenbach eingesetzt. Mit der Eröffnung des Leipziger Hauptbahnhofes wurde Leipzig Hbf Süd neues Heimat-Heizhaus der Leipziger Maschinen. Ab 1916 war die Höchstgeschwindigkeit auf 100km/h reduziert. Die Lokomotiven waren jetzt vor allem auch im Personenzugdienst auf den Strecken Leipzig–Döbeln–Dresden, Dresden–Röderau und Dresden–Zittau/Görlitz zu finden. 1918 begann man einige Lokomotiven in Zittau zu beheimaten. Damit wurden die Personen- und Eilzüge nach Bischofswerda, Löbau und Görlitz transportiert. Diese Einsätze dauerten bis 1924., Die Deutsche Reichsbahn übernahm nach 1920 noch alle 15 Maschinen und gab ihnen ab 1925 die neuen Nummern 14 201–215. Der Lokomotivmangel auf Grund der Lokomotivabgaben infolge des Versailler Vertrages verhinderte eine rasche Ausmusterung der nunmehr schon technisch überalterten Maschinen. Erst 1923 stellte man die ersten Fahrzeuge ab. Im Oktober 1925 waren fünf Lokomotiven im Bahnbetriebswerk Dresden-Altstadt (Heizhaus I und II), drei jeweils im Bahnbetriebswerk Riesa und Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig Hbf Süd und zwei im Bahnbetriebswerk Leipzig Bay. Bf. beheimatet. Zwei Lokomotiven waren bereits ausgemustert., Letzte Einsätze der Lokomotiven erfolgten im Nahverkehr von Leipzig nach Geithain, Frohburg, Meuselwitz, Altenburg oder Reichenbach. Außerdem befuhren die Lokomotiven mit Personen- und Eilgüterzügen die Strecke Leipzig–Döbeln–Dresden. Im September 1926 wurde die Lokomotive 14 213 (früher Nr. 193) als letzte Maschine der Gattung X V ausgemustert und verschrottet., Technische Merkmale., Rahmen und Fahrwerk., Der Rahmen der Lokomotiven bestand aus 30Millimeter starkem Blech und war innenliegend. Um das Innentriebwerk unterzubringen, war er im Bereich des vorderen Drehgestelles nach außen gekröpft. Damit wurde eine lichte Weite von 1380 statt 1200Millimetern erreicht. Das führende Drehgestell entsprach der bereits in Preußen entwickelten Bauart Erfurt, wie es auch schon bei der VIII V 1 genutzt wurde. Die Radsätze mit einem Raddurchmesser von 1045Millimetern hatten einen Achsabstand von 2,15 Metern. Die Seitenverschiebbarkeit betrug 40Millimeter. Der Rahmen bestand aus 22Millimeter starken Blechen, die einen Abstand von 940Millimetern hatten. Als Abstützung diente eine Kugelpfanne unterhalb des Innenzylindergussstückes. Die Abfederung zum Rahmen erfolgte durch eine Wiege mit vier Pendeln. Die einzelnen Radsätze des Drehgestelles waren durch über den Achsen liegenden Tragfedern abgefedert., Die als Adamsachse konstruierte Schleppachse hatte bei den Prototypen einen Abstand von 2,55Metern zur hinteren Kuppelachse. Der seitliche Verschub betrug nach jeder Seite 25Millimeter. Der Radsatz hatte einen Durchmesser von 1065Millimeter. Die Abfederung erfolgte mit unter der Achse liegenden Querfedern. Die Kuppelradsätze hatten den in Preußen üblichen Durchmesser von 1980Millimetern und waren fest im Rahmen gelagert. Zur Federung dienten unterhalb der Achsen liegende Blattfedern, die mit verstellbaren Ausgleichshebeln verbunden waren. Um das Aufsteigen der Lokomotiven beim Anfahren zu reduzieren wurde ab der Bauserie 1902 die Schleppachse um 200Millimeter nach hinten verlegt, sowie Räder mit einem Durchmesser von 1240Millimeter benutzt. Statt der Querfedern setzte man nun Längsfedern ein., Kessel., Bei der Konstruktion des Kessels lehnte sich die Sächsische Maschinenfabrik an die Vorgängergattung VIII V 1 an. Der Belpaire-Stehkessel besaß eine ebene Stehkesseldecke und reicht hinter der zweiten Kuppelachse weit zwischen den Rahmenwangen nach unten. Der Rost war eben angeordnet. Gegenüber der VIII V 1 war die Rostfläche fast identisch, jedoch erhöhte man den Kesseldruck von 13 bar auf 15 bar und vergrößerte die Heizfläche der kupfernen Feuerbüchse. Die Wand zu den Heizrohren war 30Millimeter stark. Die Feuertür wurde in der Bauart Untiedt mit verschließbaren Luftschlitzen ausgeführt. Der Langkessel bestand aus drei Schüssen. Der Kessel hatte eine Wandstärke von 17Millimetern. Die Länge zwischen den Rohrwänden betrug 4,70Meter. In den vorderen Kesselschuss war die 28Millimeter starke Rauchkammerrohrwand eingenietet. Die Rauchkammer selbst war aufgesteckt und vernietet. Die Tür der Rauchkammer verfügte über einen Zentralverschluss mit vier Anreibern. Der Funkenfänger war als schräge Platte in der Rauchkammer ausgeführt., Der Dampfdom saß auf dem vorderen Kesselschuss. Der Flachregler zur Dampfentnahme war in den Dom integriert. Zur Dampftrocknung war zwischen Stehkessel und Dom ein geschlitztes Dampfsammelrohr angeordnet. Die Kesselspeisung erfolgte mittels zweier nichtsaugender Friedmann-Restarting-Injektoren SZ9 links und rechts des Führerhauses sowie einer saugenden Friedmann-Strahlpumpe BY Nr. 6 im Führerhaus auf der Heizerseite. Die Kesselspeiseventile befanden sich in der Mitte des zweiten Kesselschusses. Der Kontrolle des Wasserstandes dienten ein Schauglas auf der Heizerseite und Probierhähne auf der Lokführerseite.

Jahrhundert), Carl von Linné, Ehrenmitglied der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Geboren 1707, Gestorben 1778, Gärtner, Hochschullehrer (Universität Uppsala), Ichthyologe], Carl von Linné (latinisiert Carolus Linnaeus; vor der Erhebung in den Adelsstand 1756 Carl Nilsson Linnæus; * 23. Mai 1707 in Råshult bei Älmhult; † 10. Januar 1778 in Uppsala) war ein schwedischer Naturforscher, der mit der binären Nomenklatur die Grundlagen der modernen botanischen und zoologischen Taxonomie schuf. Sein offizielles botanisches Autorenkürzel lautet „“. In der Zoologie werden „“, „“ und „“ als Autorennamen verwendet., Linné setzte sich als Student in seinem Manuskript \\"Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum\\" mit der noch neuen Idee von der Sexualität der Pflanzen auseinander und legte mit diesen Überlegungen den Grundstein für sein späteres Wirken. Während seines Aufenthaltes in Holland entwickelte er in Schriften wie \\"Systema Naturae\\", \\"Fundamenta Botanica\\", \\"Critica Botanica\\" und \\"Genera Plantarum\\" die theoretischen Grundlagen seines Schaffens. Während seiner Tätigkeit für George Clifford in Hartekamp konnte Linné zum ersten Mal viele seltene Pflanzen direkt studieren und schuf mit \\"Hortus Cliffortianus\\" das erste nach seinen Prinzipien geordnete Pflanzenverzeichnis. Nach der Rückkehr aus dem Ausland arbeitete Linné für kurze Zeit als Arzt in Stockholm. Er gehörte hier zu den Gründern der Schwedischen Akademie der Wissenschaften und war deren erster Präsident. Mehrere Expeditionen führten ihn durch die Provinzen seiner schwedischen Heimat und trugen zu seiner Anerkennung bei., Ende 1741 wurde Linné Professor an der Universität Uppsala und neun Jahre später deren Rektor. In Uppsala führte er seine enzyklopädischen Anstrengungen weiter, alle bekannten Mineralien, Pflanzen und Tiere zu beschreiben und zu ordnen. Seine beiden Werke \\"Species Plantarum\\" (1753) und \\"Systema Naturæ\\" (in der zehnten Auflage von 1758) begründeten die bis heute verwendete wissenschaftliche Nomenklatur in der Botanik und der Zoologie., Leben., Kindheit und Schule., Carl Linnæus wurde am 23. Mai 1707 in der ersten Stunde nach Mitternacht im kleinen Ort Råshult im Kirchspiel Stenbrohult in der südschwedischen Provinz Småland geboren. Er war das älteste von fünf Kindern des Geistlichen Nils Ingemarsson Linnæus und dessen Frau Christina Brodersonia., Sein Vater interessierte sich sehr für Pflanzen und kultivierte in seinem Garten einige ungewöhnliche Pflanzen aus Deutschland. Diese Faszination übertrug sich auf seinen Sohn, der jede Gelegenheit nutzte, um Streifzüge in die Umgebung zu unternehmen und sich die Namen der Pflanzen von seinem Vater nennen zu lassen. Seine schulische Ausbildung begann im Alter von sieben Jahren durch einen Privatlehrer, der ihn zwei Jahre lang unterrichtete. 1716 schickten ihn seine Eltern auf die neu errichtete Domschule in Växjö mit dem Ziel, dass er später wie sein Vater und Großvater Pfarrer werden sollte. Der junge Linné litt unter den strengen Erziehungsmethoden der Schule. Das änderte sich erst, als er 1719 die Bekanntschaft des Studenten Gabriel Höök machte, der ihn privat unterrichtete. 1724 wechselte er an das Gymnasium., 1726 reiste sein Vater nach Växjö, um den Arzt Johan Stensson Rothman in einer medizinischen Angelegenheit zu konsultieren und sich über die Leistungen seines Sohnes zu informieren. Er musste erfahren, dass sein Sohn in den für das Pfarramt notwendigen Fächern Griechisch, Hebräisch, Theologie, Metaphysik und Rhetorik nur mäßige Leistungen erbrachte und ihnen wenig Interesse entgegenbrachte. Hingegen glänzte sein Sohn in Mathematik und den Naturwissenschaften, aber auch in Latein. Rothman, der das Talent Linnés für eine medizinische Laufbahn erkannte, bot dem schockierten Vater an, seinen Sohn unentgeltlich in sein Haus aufzunehmen und ihn in Botanik und Physiologie zu unterrichten. Rothman machte Linné mit dem Klassifizierungssystem der Pflanzen von Joseph Pitton de Tournefort bekannt und wies ihn auf Sébastien Vaillants Schrift zur Sexualität der Pflanzen hin., Studium., Im August 1727 ging Linné nach Lund, um an der dortigen Universität zu studieren. Am Ende seiner Schulzeit hatte er vom Rektor des Gymnasiums Nils Krok ein nicht sehr schmeichelhaftes Schreiben für seine Bewerbung in Lund erhalten. Sein alter Freund Gabriel Höök, mittlerweile Magister der Philosophie in Lund, riet ihm, das Schreiben nicht zu verwenden. Er stellte dem Rektor der Universität Lund Linné stattdessen als seinen Privatschüler vor und erreichte so die Immatrikulation an der Universität Lund. Höök überzeugte Professor Kilian Stobæus, Linné in sein Haus aufzunehmen. Stobæus besaß neben einer reichhaltigen Naturaliensammlung eine sehr umfangreiche Bibliothek, die Linné jedoch nicht benutzen durfte. Durch den deutschen Studenten David Samuel Koulas, der zeitweise als Sekretär von Stobæus beschäftigt war, erhielt er dennoch Zugriff auf die Bücher, die er bis spät in die Nacht studierte. Im Gegenzug vermittelte er Koulas seine bei Rothman erlernten Kenntnisse in Physiologie. Verwundert über die nächtlichen Aktivitäten seines Zöglings trat Stobæus eines Nachts unvermittelt in das Zimmer Linnés und fand ihn zu seiner Überraschung in das Studium der Werke von Andrea Cesalpino, Caspar Bauhin und Joseph Pitton de Tournefort vertieft. Fortan hatte Linné freien Zugriff auf die Bibliothek., Während seines Aufenthaltes in Lund unternahm Linné regelmäßig Exkursionen in die Umgebung. So auch an einem warmen Tag Ende Mai 1728, als er mit seinem Kommilitonen Mattias Benzelstierna die Natur in Fågelsång erkundete und von einem kleinen, unscheinbaren Tier, der „Höllenfurie“, gebissen wurde. Die Wunde entzündete sich und konnte nur mit Mühe behandelt werden. Linné entging nur knapp dem Tod. Zur Erholung fuhr Linné im Sommer in seine Heimat. Hier traf er seinen Lehrer Rothman wieder, dem er von seinen Erfahrungen an der Universität Lund berichtete. Durch diesen Bericht gelangte Rothman, der an der Universität Uppsala studiert hatte, zu der Überzeugung, dass Linné sein Medizinstudium besser in Uppsala fortsetzen sollte. Linné folgte diesem Rat und brach am 3. September 1728 nach Uppsala auf., Die Zustände, die Linné an der dortigen Universität vorfand, waren desolat. Olof Rudbeck der Jüngere hielt einige wenige Vorlesungen über Vögel und Lars Roberg philosophierte über Aristoteles. Es gab keine Vorlesungen über Medizin und Chemie, es wurden keine Obduktionen durchgeführt und im alten Botanischen Garten wuchsen kaum zweihundert Arten. Im März 1729 machte Linné die Bekanntschaft von Peter Artedi, mit dem ihn bis zu dessen frühem Tod eine feste Freundschaft verband. Artedis Hauptinteresse galt der Chemie, aber er war auch Botaniker und Zoologe. Die beiden Freunde versuchten sich gegenseitig mit ihren Forschungen zu übertrumpfen. Sie merkten bald, dass es besser wäre, wenn sie die verschiedenen Gebiete der drei Naturreiche entsprechend ihren Interessen unter sich aufteilen würden. Artedi übernahm die Amphibien, Reptilien und Fische, Linné die Vögel und Insekten sowie, mit Ausnahme der Doldenblütler, die gesamte Botanik. Gemeinsam bearbeiteten sie die Säugetiere und die Mineralien., Etwa zu dieser Zeit nahm ihn Olof Celsius der Ältere in sein Haus auf. Linné half Celsius bei der Fertigstellung von dessen Werk \\"Hierobotanicon\\". Die finanzielle Situation Linnés besserte sich. Im Juni 1729 erhielt er ein Königliches Stipendium (II. Klasse), das im Dezember 1729 (I. Klasse) noch einmal erhöht wurde. Zum Ende des Jahres 1729 entstand seine erste bedeutende Schrift \\"Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum\\", in der er sich zum ersten Mal mit der Sexualität der Pflanzen auseinandersetzte und die Wegbereiter für sein weiteres Lebenswerk war. Die Schrift wurde schnell bekannt und Olof Rudbeck suchte die persönliche Bekanntschaft Linnés. Zunächst verschaffte er Linné, gegen den Widerstand Robergs, die Stelle des Demonstrators des Botanischen Gartens und stellte ihn als Lehrer seiner drei jüngsten Söhne ein. Mitte Juni zog Linné in Rudbecks Haus., 1730/31 arbeitete Linné an einem Katalog der Pflanzen des Botanischen Gartens von Uppsala (\\"Hortus Uplandicus\\", späterer Titel \\"Adonis Uplandicus\\"), von dem mehrere Fassungen entstanden. Die Pflanzen waren anfangs noch nach dem Tournefortschen System für die Klassifizierung der Pflanzen angeordnet, an dessen Gültigkeit Linné jedoch immer mehr Zweifel kamen. In der endgültigen Fassung vom Juli 1731, die er in Stockholm beendete, ordnete er die Pflanzen nach seinem eigenen aus 24 Klassen bestehenden System. Während dieser Zeit entstanden die ersten Entwürfe zu seinen frühen Werken, die in Amsterdam veröffentlicht wurden. Ende 1731 sah sich Linné veranlasst, Rudbecks Haus zu verlassen, da die Frau des Universitätsbibliothekars Andreas Norrelius (1679–1750), die in dieser Zeit ebenfalls dort wohnte, Gerüchte über ihn verbreitete, die das gute Verhältnis zu Rudbecks Familie untergruben. Er verbrachte den Jahreswechsel bei seinen Eltern., Reise durch Lappland., In einem Brief vom 26. Dezember 1731 empfahl sich Linné der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften in Uppsala für eine Expedition in das weitgehend unerforschte Lappland und bat um die notwendige finanzielle Unterstützung. Als er keine Antwort erhielt, unternahm er Ende April 1732 einen weiteren Versuch und senkte den für die Reise notwendigen Geldbetrag um ein Drittel. Dieses Mal wurde ihm der Betrag gewährt und er begann am 23. Mai seine erste große Expedition., Die beschwerliche Reise dauerte knapp fünf Monate. Während der Reise hielt er alle seine Erlebnisse und Entdeckungen in einem Tagebuch fest. Am 21. Oktober 1732 traf er wieder in Uppsala ein. Zu den Strapazen der Reise und den Schulden, die Linné zusätzlich auf sich genommen hatte, kam noch die Enttäuschung, dass die Akademie nur wenige Seiten seiner Ergebnisse publizierte. Sein Buch über die lappländische Pflanzenwelt, \\"Flora Lapponica\\", wurde erst 1737 in Amsterdam veröffentlicht., Von dieser Reise brachte er erstmals Spielregeln und Spielbrett des zur Wikingerzeit weit verbreiteten Spiels Tablut mit., Falun und die Reise durch Dalarna., Im Frühjahrssemester 1733 hielt Linné private Kurse in Dokimastik und schrieb eine kurze Abhandlung über das für ihn neue Thema. Er katalogisierte seine Vogel- und Insektensammlung und arbeitete an zahlreichen Manuskripten. Von Clas Sohlberg, einem seiner Studenten, erhielt er eine Einladung: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Universität Uppsala, Arachnologe, Botaniker, Carl von Linné, Nomenklatur, Taxonomie, Russischen Akademie, Gestorben 1778, Gärtner, Ichthyologe"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Asteroid vom Aten-Typ, Asteroid vom Typ C (Tholen), Astronomisches Objekt (entdeckt 2002)], 2002 AA29 ist ein sehr kleiner erdnaher Asteroid, der am 9. Januar 2002 durch die automatische Himmelsüberwachung LINEAR \\"(Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research)\\" entdeckt wurde., Der Durchmesser des Asteroiden beträgt nur zirka 50 bis 110 Meter. Er umkreist die Sonne auf einer der Erdbahn sehr ähnlichen, fast kreisförmigen Umlaufbahn. Sie verläuft zum größten Teil innerhalb der Erdumlaufbahn und kreuzt sie im sonnenfernsten Punkt des Asteroiden, dem Aphel. Er wird wegen dieser Umlaufbahn nach dem namensgebenden Asteroiden Aten als Aten-Typ klassifiziert., Eine weitere Besonderheit ist, dass seine mittlere Umlaufdauer um die Sonne exakt einem siderischen Jahr entspricht. Das bedeutet, dass er in Wechselwirkung mit der Erde steht, da eine solche Umlaufbahn nur unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen stabil ist. Bislang sind erst wenige derartige, in 1:1-Bahnresonanz mit der Erde wechselwirkende Asteroiden bekannt. Der erste war der 1986 entdeckte (3753) Cruithne. Asteroiden, die in 1:1-Resonanz mit einem Planeten stehen, werden auch \\"koorbitale Objekte\\" genannt, da sie der Bahn des Planeten folgen. 2002 AA29 gehört jedoch nicht zu den Trojanern, die die bekanntesten koorbitalen Asteroiden sind und sich in den Lagrangepunkten L4 und L5 des jeweiligen Planeten aufhalten. Er befindet sich vielmehr auf einer sogenannten Hufeisenumlaufbahn entlang der Erdbahn., Umlaufbahn., Bahndaten., Wissenschaftler des Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), der Athabasca University (Kanada), der Queen’s University in Kingston (Ontario, Kanada), der York University in Toronto und des Tuorlaobservatoriums der Universität von Turku in Finnland stellten schon kurz nach der Entdeckung durch LINEAR den ungewöhnlichen Orbit von 2002AA29 fest, der durch Nachuntersuchungen am Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope auf Hawaii bestätigt wurde., Seine Umlaufbahn befindet sich größtenteils innerhalb der Erdbahn im Gegensatz zu den Bahnen der meisten Asteroiden im sogenannten Asteroidengürtel zwischen Mars und Jupiter oder noch weiter draußen außerhalb der Neptunbahn im sogenannten Kuipergürtel. Die Umlaufbahn ist der Erdumlaufbahn sehr ähnlich. Die mittlere Umlaufdauer beträgt ein siderisches Jahr und die mittlere Halbachse 0,993AE. Die Umlaufbahn des Asteroiden ist nahezu kreisförmig und hat mit 0,012 eine noch geringere Exzentrizität als die Erdbahn mit 0,0167., Die zum Zeitpunkt der Entdeckung (im Jahr 2002) bekannten Asteroiden hatten im Durchschnitt eine wesentlich höhere Exzentrizität von 0,29. Auch die damals bekannten Asteroiden in 1:1-Resonanz mit der Erde wiesen stark elliptische Bahnen auf – die Exzentrizität von (3753) Cruithne beträgt beispielsweise 0,515. Die Bahn von 2002 AA29 war zum Zeitpunkt der Entdeckung einzigartig. Daher wurde der Asteroid oft auch als erster echter koorbitaler Begleiter der Erde bezeichnet, da die Bahnen der übrigen davor entdeckten Asteroiden der Erdbahn nicht sehr ähnlich sind. Die Bahnneigung gegen die Ekliptik (Bahnebene der Erde) von 2002AA29 ist mit 10,7° moderat. Somit ist seine Bahn leicht gegen die der Erde verkippt, ansonsten würden beide Bahnen direkt aufeinander liegen., Bahnform., Im Gegensatz zu den Trojanern ist 2002 AA29 nicht an einem der beiden stabilen Lagrange-Punkte der Erdbahn (L4 oder L5) gefangen, sondern er bewegt sich von der Erde gesehen aus vor und zurück. Dabei scheint er sich der Erde von vorne zu nähern, beschreibt dann im Lauf von 95 Jahren einen (hinter der Sonne liegenden) Kreisbogen von fast 360° und nähert sich ihr schließlich von hinten. Daraufhin kehrt er seine Bewegung um und nähert sich der Erde nach weiteren 95 Jahren wieder von vorne. Die Form des Bogens erinnert an ein Hufeisen, daher der Name Hufeisenorbit für seine Umlaufbahn vom mit der Erde mitbewegten Bezugssystem aus gesehen. Bei der Bewegung entlang des Erdorbits windet er sich spiralförmig um diesen, wobei er für eine Spiraldrehung ein Jahr braucht. Dieses Verhalten verhindert auch, dass 2002 AA29 auf der Erde einschlägt. Diese Spiralbewegung im mit der Erde mitbewegten Bezugssystem kommt durch seine leicht von der Erdbahn abweichende Exzentrizität und Bahnneigung zustande, wobei der Unterschied in der Bahnneigung für den vertikalen und derjenige der Exzentrizität für den horizontalen Anteil der projizierten Spiralbewegung verantwortlich ist., Kommt 2002 AA29 der Erde von vorn (also in Umlaufrichtung der Erde) nahe, so wird er durch deren Anziehungskraft in einen geringfügig schnelleren, etwas näher an der Sonne liegenden Orbit befördert. Er eilt der Erde auf ihrer Bahn nun voraus, bis er sie nach 95 Jahren einmal fast überrundet hat und sich ihr nun von hinten nähert. Jetzt gerät er erneut unter ihren Gravitationseinfluss und wird so auf eine langsamere Umlaufbahn etwas weiter weg von der Sonne gehoben. Dadurch kann er nun nicht mehr mit der Geschwindigkeit der Erde mithalten, bis diese ihn nach 95 Jahren wieder von vorn erreicht. Die Erde und 2002AA29 verfolgen sich also immer abwechselnd, kommen sich jedoch nie zu nahe., Zum Zeitpunkt seiner Entdeckung näherte sich 2002AA29 der Erde von vorne und war im Morgenhimmel sichtbar. Am 8. Januar 2003 näherte sich der Asteroid der Erde von vorn bis auf 5,9 Millionen Kilometer, was seine größte Annäherung für fast ein Jahrhundert sein wird. Seit diesem Zeitpunkt eilt er ihr nun voraus, bis er sie von hinten eingeholt haben wird. Aufgrund der subtilen Wechselwirkung mit der Erde muss man jedoch nicht befürchten, dass dieser Asteroid wie andere Erdbahnkreuzer mit der Erde zusammenstoßen könnte. Berechnungen zeigen, dass er in den nächsten Jahrtausenden der Erde niemals näher als 4,5 Millionen Kilometer nahekommen wird, was etwa dem Zwölffachen des Erde-Mond-Abstands entspricht., Im Vergleich dazu nähert sich der größere koorbitale Begleiter (419624) 2010 SO16 nur auf den 50-fachen Mond-Abstand. Für die Distanz zwischen den Hufeisenpunkten benötigt er 175 Jahre., Aufgrund seiner Bahnneigung von 10,7° gegen die Ekliptik wird 2002AA29 jedoch nicht immer von der Erde auf seine Hufeisenumlaufbahn gezwungen, sondern kann manchmal quasi durchschlüpfen. Er ist dann für eine Weile in der Nähe der Erde gefangen, was das nächste Mal in ungefähr 600 Jahren, also um das Jahr 2600 passieren wird. Er wird sich dann ständig in einem kleineren Abstand zur Erde aufhalten, als er in seinem Hufeisenorbit Orbit erreicht und sich nicht weiter als 0,2 Astronomische Einheiten (30 Millionen Kilometer) von der Erde entfernen. Von der Erde aus betrachtet wird er dann – fast wie ein zweiter Mond – langsam um sie kreisen; für einen Umlauf braucht er allerdings ein Jahr. Nach etwa 45 Jahren wechselt er schließlich wieder zurück in den Hufeisenorbit, um sich dann um das Jahr 3750 und noch einmal um 6400 wieder für 45 Jahre in der Nähe der Erde aufzuhalten. In diesen Phasen, in denen er sich außerhalb seines Hufeisenorbits aufhält, schwingt er in dem schmalen Bereich entlang der Erdbahn, in dem er gefangen ist, innerhalb von 15 Jahren einmal vor und zurück. Da er nicht wie der Mond fest an die Erde gebunden ist, sondern hauptsächlich unter dem Gravitationseinfluss der Sonne steht, nennt man diese Körper Quasisatelliten. Dies ist in etwa analog zu zwei Autos, die nebeneinander mit gleicher Geschwindigkeit fahren und sich wechselseitig überholen, jedoch nicht fest aneinander gebunden sind., Bahnberechnungen zeigen, dass 2002AA29 bereits ab etwa 520 n. Chr. für 45 Jahre in diesem Quasisatellitenorbit war, jedoch aufgrund seiner winzigen Größe zu lichtschwach und somit nicht sichtbar. Er wechselt somit annähernd zyklisch zwischen den beiden Orbitformen, hält sich aber immer für 45 Jahre im Quasisatellitenorbit auf. Außerhalb einer Zeitspanne von ca. 520 bis 6500 n. Chr. werden die berechneten Bahnen chaotisch, also nicht berechenbar, weswegen man über Zeiträume, die darüber hinausgehen, keine exakten Angaben machen kann. 2002 AA29 war der erste bekannte Himmelskörper, der zwischen Hufeisen- und Quasisatellitenorbit wechselt., Ursprung., Durch Bahnstörungen der großen Gasplaneten, hauptsächlich durch Jupiter, und durch den Jarkowski-Effekt (Bahnänderung durch asymmetrische Ein- und Abstrahlung von Infrarotstrahlung) werden Asteroiden ins innere Sonnensystem abgelenkt, wo ihre Bahnen durch nahe Vorbeiflüge an den inneren Planeten weiter beeinflusst werden können. Nach diesem Mechanismus gelangte 2002 AA29 wahrscheinlich ebenfalls aus dem äußeren Sonnensystem in den Einflussbereich der Erde. Es wird jedoch auch spekuliert, dass der Asteroid in der Nähe der Erdbahn entstand und sich schon immer auf einer erdnahen Bahn bewegte. Eine Möglichkeit wäre in diesem Fall, dass er ein abgesprengtes Bruchstück des Zusammenstoßes eines mittleren Asteroiden mit der Erde oder dem Mond sein könnte., Physikalische Eigenschaften., Über 2002 AA29 selbst ist relativ wenig bekannt. Aufgrund seiner geringen absoluten Helligkeit von etwa 25mag erscheint er von der Erde selbst mit großen Teleskopen nur als kleiner Punkt und kann nur mit hochempfindlichen CCD-Kameras beobachtet werden. Um den Zeitpunkt der größten Annäherung am 8. Januar 2003 hatte er im visuellen Bereich nur eine scheinbare Helligkeit von etwa 20,4mag., Über die Zusammensetzung von 2002AA29 ist bislang nichts Konkretes bekannt. Aufgrund der Sonnennähe kann er aber nicht aus leichtflüchtigen Substanzen wie beispielsweise Wassereis bestehen, da sie schmelzen, verdunsten oder sublimieren würden, was man etwa bei Kometen an ihrem Schweif deutlich sichtbar beobachten kann. Vermutlich wird er wie die meisten Asteroiden eine dunkle kohlenstoffhaltige oder etwas hellere silikatreiche Oberfläche haben; im ersteren Fall läge die Albedo bei etwa 0,05, im letzteren etwas höher bei 0,15 bis 0,25. Aufgrund dieser Unsicherheit haben die Angaben für seinen Durchmesser eine relativ große Spanne., Aufgrund der bei der Entdeckung ermittelten absoluten Helligkeit von 23,9mag wurde unter der Annahme einer typischen Albedo von 0,18 ein Durchmesser von 50Metern ermittelt. Aus Radar-Echomessungen mit dem Arecibo-Radioteleskop ergaben sich ein maximaler Durchmesser von 30Metern und eine maximale Rotationsperiode von 33Minuten. Allerdings ist diese Messung mit einer großen Unsicherheit behaftet, da nur ein unerwartet schwaches Radarecho aufgefangen werden konnte. Zusätzlich gibt es Unsicherheiten bei der Ermittlung der visuellen absoluten Helligkeit aus verschiedenen Beobachtungen.

Er ist der kleinste aller Wildhunde und bewohnt die Sandwüsten Nordafrikas. Die Art zeigt zahlreiche Anpassungen an das Wüstenklima, etwa die geringe Körpergröße, behaarte Sohlen und große Ohren, die der Wärmeregulation dienen. Der Fennek ist nacht- und dämmerungsaktiv und frisst als Allesfresser sowohl Wirbellose und kleine Wirbeltiere als auch Früchte und Knollen., Fenneks leben für gewöhnlich in Paaren; die meist zwei bis fünf Jungen pro Wurf kommen in März und April zur Welt. Während der Trage- und Säugezeit versorgt und beschützt das Männchen das Weibchen und den Wurf. Der Erdbau des Fenneks ist im Regelfall einfach und wird meist in lockeren Sand gegraben, nur in festerem Untergrund nimmt er komplexere Formen an. Der nächste Verwandte des Fenneks ist der Afghanfuchs (\\"Vulpes cana\\"), der auf der Arabischen Halbinsel, im Iran und in Afghanistan lebt. Obwohl Fenneks regelmäßig wegen ihres Fells oder für touristische Schauvorführungen gefangen werden, gilt der Bestand nicht als bedroht. Die IUCN klassifiziert die Art als \\"Least Concern\\" (nicht gefährdet). Der Fennek wird seit der Jungsteinzeit von den Menschen Nordafrikas als Nahrungs- und Felllieferant genutzt und seit dem 20. Jahrhundert vor allem in Nordamerika auch als Haustier gehalten., Merkmale., Körperbau und Physiologie., Der Fennek ist die kleinste aller Hundearten und verfügt über sehr große Ohren. Seine Kopf-Rumpf-Länge beträgt 333–395mm, der Schwanz wird 125–250mm lang. Sein Geburtsgewicht beträgt zwischen 80 und 187g, das Gewicht adulter Tiere 1,0 bis 1,5kg. Die Ohren machen 20 % der Körperoberfläche aus und werden 86–104mm lang. Damit sind sie proportional größer als bei allen anderen Hunden und lassen entsprechend der Allenschen Regel eine Anpassung an die geographische Breite erkennen. Schnauze und Beine sind schlank und zierlich. Der Schädel entspricht in den Proportionen dem anderer \\"Vulpes\\"-Arten, besitzt aber sehr große Paukenhöhlen, ein typisches Merkmal von Wüstenbewohnern. Die Zahnformel lautet I 3/3 – C 1/1 – P 4/4 – M 2/3, der Fennek hat also insgesamt 42 Zähne. Sie sind kleiner und schmaler als bei anderen Arten der Gattung. Der Penisknochen (Baculum) ist 3mm breit und mit 31–36mm vergleichsweise lang., Das Fell ist sandbraun mit einer beigen, rötlichen oder grauen Tönung. Die Körperunterseite ist heller gefärbt als die Oberseite. Die Ohren besitzen eine dunkle Rückseite, ihre Innenseite und ihre Ränder sind weiß befellt. Die Augen sind verhältnismäßig groß und dunkel, vom Innenwinkel zieht sich eine dunkle Linie hinunter zur Schnauze und umrahmt sie. Ein kürzerer Strich verläuft vom Außenwinkel der Augen in Richtung der Wangen. Die Schenkel sind bei Individuen aus dem nördlichen Teil des Verbreitungsgebietes rötlich gefärbt. Bei Tieren aus dem Süden besitzen sie eine weiße Färbung. Das Fell ist sehr dicht und lang. Die Behaarung der Zehen reicht bis über die Sohlen hinaus und bildet so ein isolierendes Polster für die Füße. Der Schwanz ist dicht behaart, seine Spitze und der Bereich um die Violdrüse sind dunkel gefärbt. Die Weibchen verfügen über drei Zitzenpaare. Der Fennek wechselt sein Fell vom Sommer zum Winter, wobei das Sommerfell etwas kürzer und heller als das Winterfell ist. Jungtiere zeigen eine ähnliche Fellzeichnung wie adulte, sind aber heller und besitzen wenig bis keine Rotanteile im Pelz. Die dunkle Gesichtszeichnung ist bei ihnen nur schwach ausgeprägt., Die Nieren des Fenneks sind darauf ausgelegt, hochkonzentrierten Urin zu filtern und dabei so wenig Wasser wie möglich zu verbrauchen. Die Metabolismusrate des Fenneks ist sehr niedrig und liegt 33 % unter dem Wert, den Tiere seiner Größe gewöhnlicherweise aufweisen. Sein Herz ist 40 % kleiner, als es für seine Körpergröße zu erwarten wäre. Unterhalb von 35°C Außentemperatur atmet der Fennek mit 23 Zügen pro Minute. Wird dieser Wert jedoch überschritten, kann sich die Atemfrequenz auf bis zu 690 Atemzüge pro Minute erhöhen. Die Blutgefäße in den Ohren und Fußsohlen werden bei Hitze erweitert, um möglichst viel Wärme nach außen abzugeben. Der Fennek hat 2n = 46 Chromosomen., Lautäußerungen und Kommunikation., Die Stimme des Fenneks ist hoch und ähnelt der kleiner Haushunde. Sein Rufrepertoire ist umfangreich und mitunter melodiös. Schwaches Gebell dient als Warnruf vor Fressfeinden, an Hauskatzen erinnerndes Schnurren als Ausdruck des Wohlbefindens. Als Drohgebärde stößt der Fennek ein hohes Kläffen aus. Partner, Eltern oder andere Individuen, zu denen die Tiere einen positiven Bezug haben – dies können bei in Gefangenschaft gehaltenen Fenneks auch Menschen sein –, werden mit Quieken begrüßt., Verbreitung., Das Verbreitungsgebiet des Fenneks umfasst die gesamte Sahara und wird durch Gebiete mit gemäßigtem beziehungsweise humiderem Klima begrenzt. Die nordwestliche Verbreitungsgrenze bilden die südlichen Ausläufer des Atlas, während das Artareal in Tripolitanien fast bis an die Küste reicht. In Ägypten wird es in etwa vom Nil begrenzt, reicht aber im Norden bis auf die nordwestliche Sinai-Halbinsel. Im Sudan umfasst das Verbreitungsgebiet auch weiter östlich gelegene Gebiete als in Ägypten, wie etwa die Nubische Wüste. Insgesamt fehlt der Fennek aber entlang der Küstenregion zum Roten Meer. In Mauretanien und Marokko kommt der Fennek bis knapp an die Atlantikküste vor. Die Südgrenze des Verbreitungsgebiets markiert die nördliche Sahelzone, wo der Fennek etwa bis 14° N vorkommt., Fraglich ist, ob es auf der Arabischen Halbinsel Vorkommen des Fenneks gibt oder gab. Zwar wurden von dort mehrere Sichtungen gemeldet, teils handelte es sich aber nur um Fußspuren im Sand oder um Rüppellfüchse (\\"V. rueppelli\\"), die für Fenneks gehalten wurden. Die IUCN geht nicht davon aus, dass die Art östlich des Sinais vorkommt, andere Autoren halten es zumindest für möglich., Lebensraum., Das Habitat des Fenneks besteht vorwiegend aus hyperariden Sandwüsten (Erg), wo er im flachen Boden oder in statischen Dünen seine Baue anlegt. Nahe der marokkanischen Atlantikküste nutzt der Fennek aber auch gemäßigt bewachsene Dünen für seinen Bau. Da der Fennek auf weichen Untergrund angewiesen ist, um seinen Bau zu graben, fehlt er in Gebieten ohne Sand. Der jährliche Niederschlag an der Nordgrenze des Verbreitungsgebiets beträgt rund 100mm, in der Sahelregion sind es 300mm. Süßgräser der Gattung \\"Aristida\\" und der Meerträubel \\"Ephedra alata\\" auf Großdünen sowie die Rispenhirse \\"Panicum turgidum\\" und Jochblätter (\\"Zygophyllum\\" spp.) auf kleineren Dünen bilden oft die einzige Vegetation im Lebensraum des Fenneks. Selten finden sich auch Akazien (\\"Acacia\\" spp.) darunter. Der Fennek ist offenbar nicht auf einen direkten Zugang zu Wasseransammlungen angewiesen., Lebensweise., Ernährung und Jagdverhalten., Die Nahrung des Fenneks ist vielfältig. Sie umfasst vor allem Insekten, kleine Nagetiere wie Wüstenspringmäuse (\\"Jaculus\\" spp.), Echte Rennmäuse (\\"Gerbillus\\" spp.) oder Rennratten (\\"Meriones\\" spp.), Eidechsen, Skinke, Geckos sowie Eier und kleine Vögel wie Steinlerchen (\\"Ammomanes deserti\\") oder Flughühner. Daneben verzehrt der Fennek auch Früchte und einige Pflanzenknollen., Fenneks gehen während der Dämmerung und nachts auf Nahrungssuche und meiden die Hitze des Tages. Im Winter reicht die Aktivitätsphase auch bis in den Morgen hinein. Der für andere \\"Vulpes\\"-Arten typische Mäusesprung wurde bei Fenneks nicht beobachtet. Fenneks graben regelmäßig im Sand nach Insekten und kleinen Wirbeltieren. Die vergrößerten Paukenhöhlen ermöglichen es ihnen, auch sehr tiefe Geräusche wahrzunehmen und damit Bewegungen im Sand zu hören. Überzähliges Futter vergraben sie. Menschliche Siedlungen und Lager werden nachts häufig zur Nahrungssuche aufgesucht. Fenneks müssen in freier Wildbahn nicht trinken, in Gefangenschaft nehmen sie jedoch bereitwillig Wasser und andere Flüssigkeiten zu sich. Das für ihren Organismus nötige Wasser gewinnen sie wahrscheinlich aus den flüssigen Komponenten ihrer Nahrung oder durch Oxidation von in ihr enthaltenem Wasserstoff., Sozial- und Territorialverhalten., Fenneks leben in kleineren Familienverbänden, die das Elternpaar und die Jungtiere des letzten Wurfes umfassen. Größere soziale Verbände bilden sie nur auf engem Raum in Gefangenschaft, in freier Wildbahn wurde ein solches Verhalten bisher nicht beobachtet. Sowohl Jungtiere als auch ausgewachsene Fenneks spielen häufig. In Gefangenschaft zeigen sie ein hohes Maß an sozialer Bindung und schlafen für gewöhnlich dicht nebeneinander. Kot wird in Gefangenschaft in der Regel vergraben., Der Bau wird etwa 1m tief im Sand angelegt, nach Möglichkeit im Schutz von Vegetation. Je fester der Untergrund, desto komplexer ist in der Regel das Gangsystem: Während der Bau in losem Sand oft nur aus einem einzelnen Eingang, einem 1–2,5m langen Gang und einer Hauptkammer besteht, wurden in kompakterem Boden Baue mit einer Fläche von 120m² und 15 Eingängen gefunden, teils mit 10m langen Gängen. Einzelbaue können nahe beieinander liegen und sogar untereinander verbunden sein., Fortpflanzung und Aufzucht der Jungen., Der Sexualzyklus der Art umfasst einen Proöstrus von etwa sechs Tagen und einen lediglich ein- bis zweitägigen Östrus. Die Paarung findet im Januar und Februar statt und dauert für ein Säugetier ungewöhnlich lange, bis zu 2 Stunden und 45 Minuten. Sie wird vom Weibchen eingeleitet, indem es den Schwanz zur Seite streckt und sich dem Männchen zur Besteigung anbietet. Die Tragezeit beträgt 50–52 Tage, der Wurf erfolgt also im März oder April. In Gefangenschaft wurden aber auch 62- und 63-tägige Trächtigkeiten beobachtet, Fenneks werfen hier das ganze Jahr über. Der Wurf besteht aus ein bis sechs, meist zwei bis fünf Welpen. Stirbt der erste Wurf, kann es auch zu einem zweiten oder sogar dritten Wurf kommen. Während der Brunft-, Trag- und Säugezeit sind Männchen sehr aggressiv und verteidigen das Weibchen und den Wurf gegen Eindringlinge und: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Fennek, Wüstenfuchs, Nordafrika, Anpassungen, Paare, Jungtiere, Fell, Körperbau, Nahrung, Territorialverhalten."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: 5. Dynastie (Ägypten), Abusir, Erbaut im 25. Jahrhundert v. Chr., Ägyptische Pyramide], Die Sahure-Pyramide ist die erste Pyramide, die in der Nekropole von Abusir errichtet wurde. Ihr Erbauer Sahure war der zweite König (Pharao) der altägyptischen 5. Dynastie und regierte von 2490 bis 2475v.Chr. Mit dieser Pyramide bildete sich ein Standardtyp der Pyramidenbauten aus, der bis zum Ende der 6. Dynastie nur noch geringfügig verändert wurde. Besondere Bedeutung besitzt der Sahure-Komplex durch die zahlreichen erhaltenen Reliefs, mit denen Tal- und Totentempel sowie die Wände des Aufwegs verziert waren. Eindrucksvoll war auch die Vielzahl der verwendeten Baumaterialien des Tempelbereichs: Alabaster- und Basaltfußböden, Postamente aus Rosengranit und feiner Kalkstein wurden verbaut., Erforschung., Die ersten Untersuchungen des Pyramidenkomplexes des Sahure durch John Shae Perring und wenig später durch die Lepsius-Expedition waren nur oberflächlich. Später öffnete Jacques de Morgan erneut den Zugang zum Pyramideninneren, aber auch diesmal erfolgte keine gründliche Erforschung des Komplexes., In den Jahren 1902 bis 1908 erforschte Ludwig Borchardt den Komplex und führte dabei extensive Ausgrabungen durch. Als Ergebnis dieser Arbeiten veröffentlichte Borchardt das zweibändige Werk \\"„Das Grabdenkmal des Königs Sahurā“\\", das noch heute als Standardwerk zum Sahure-Komplex gilt. Im Rahmen dieser Grabungen wurden im Pyramidentempel die noch weitgehend erhaltenen Säulen und Architrave des Tempelhofs geborgen und zwischen Deutschland und Ägypten aufgeteilt. Der deutsche Teil kam nach Berlin in die Sammlung des Ägyptischen Museums auf der Museumsinsel, konnte aber wegen Platzmangels nicht ausgestellt werden. Erst in den 1980er Jahren wurde im West-Berliner Museum im Schloss Charlottenburg in einem Anbau an den Marstall ein Teil der Funde gezeigt. Nach der Rückkehr des Ägyptischen Museums auf die Museumsinsel sollen die Fundstücke des Tempels in einem noch zu bauenden, umstrittenen vierten Flügel des Pergamonmuseums gezeigt werden. Es ist daher (Stand Ende 2009) nicht absehbar, wann sie der Öffentlichkeit präsentiert werden., Anfang der 1960er Jahre konnte eine Vermessung durch Vito Maragioglio und Celeste Rinaldi die Werte von Borchardt präzisieren, ergab jedoch keine grundlegend neuen Befunde., Im Zuge der Öffnung von Abusir für den Tourismus kam es 1994 zu einer überraschenden Entdeckung. Die Ausgrabung des unteren Teils des Aufwegs, der von Borchardt nicht näher untersucht wurde, erbrachte eine Reihe von mit Reliefs verzierten Blöcken. Dadurch ergab sich ein neuer Einblick in das Bildprogramm der Pyramidenkomplexe des Alten Reichs., Bauumstände., Sahure verließ für sein Grabmal die bereits stark bebaute Nekropole von Sakkara, um eine neue Nekropole beim heutigen Abusir zu gründen. Diese neue Nekropole diente seinen vier direkten Nachfolgern ebenfalls als Bauplatz für ihre Pyramiden, bis Djedkare diese zugunsten von Sakkara-Süd wieder aufgab. Der Bauplatz liegt etwa 400Meter südöstlich des zu Baubeginn bereits existierenden Sonnenheiligtums seines Vorgängers Userkaf., In der Größenordnung der Pyramide orientierte sich Sahure an der etwas kleineren Pyramide seines Vorgängers Userkaf, so dass das Bauwerk deutlich kleiner als die Riesenpyramiden der 4. Dynastie war. Die Basismaße und der Aufbau des Komplexes der Sahure-Pyramide setzten einen Standard, der für zahlreiche weitere Königspyramiden des Alten Reichs übernommen wurde. Der Pyramidenkomplex des Sahure war bereits vor dem Tode des Königs fertiggestellt., Die Pyramide., Die Pyramide hatte ein Basismaß von 78,75m (150Königsellen) und erreichte bei einem Neigungswinkel von 50°11′ eine Höhe von 47m. Bei der Vermessung der Grundfläche unterlief den Erbauern ein bemerkenswerter Messfehler: die Südostecke liegt 1,58m zu weit im Osten, was zu einer Verzerrung der üblicherweise quadratischen Grundfläche führt. In der Grundfläche liegt der Versatz auf der Ostseite der Pyramide und ist durch den angrenzenden Totentempel kaschiert. In der Fläche wird die Verzerrung gleitend ausgeglichen., \\"Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Pyramiden wurde dieses Bauwerk nicht direkt auf dem felsigen Untergrund errichtet, sondern auf einem zwei Lagen dicken Fundament aus Kalksteinblöcken. Die Pyramide besaß einen ursprünglich sechsstufigen, aus minderwertigem Mauerwerk bestehenden Kern. Die grob behauenen Kalksteine aus lokalen Steinbrüchen waren in horizontalen Schichten verlegt und die Hohlräume zwischen den Steinen waren mit Geröll und Mörtel verfüllt. Um den Graben der Substruktur wurde eine T-förmige Bresche offen gelassen, um gleichzeitige Arbeiten am Unterbau und am Kern zu ermöglichen. Diese Bresche wurde schließlich auch aufgemauert, unterscheidet sich aber im Mauerwerk und ist somit heute noch erkennbar. Der Pyramidenkern ist mit feinem Kalkstein aus den beim heutigen Maasara gelegenen Steinbrüchen am östlichen Nilufer verkleidet. Ein Verkleidungssockel aus Rosengranit war nicht vorhanden.\\", Der Unterbau., Die Substruktur der Sahure-Pyramide wurde in einem flachen, offenen Graben gebaut. In diesem Fall war der Graben so flach, dass große Teile des Gangs und der Grabkammer in den Pyramidenkorpus ragten. Der Unterbau ist stark durch Steinräuber beschädigt und lässt daher keine exakte Rekonstruktion der Abmessungen und des Raumplans zu., Der Eingang zur Pyramide liegt auf Bodenniveau in der Mitte der Nordseite. Der anschließende Gang hatte eine Breite von etwa 1,27m und eine Höhe von etwa 1,87m. Diese etwa 4,25m lange, mit 24°48′ absteigende und mit Rosengranit verkleidete Passage führt zu einer Gangkammer. Diese war mit feinem Kalkstein ausgekleidet. Direkt im Anschluss an diese Kammer befand sich eine Fallsperre zur Absicherung der Pyramide gegen Eindringlinge. Sowohl Fallsperrenkammer als auch die Fallsperre selbst bestanden aus hartem Rosengranit. Nach der Fallsperre steigt der Gang über 22,3m mit einer Steigung von etwa 5° leicht an. Die letzten 3m des Gangs sind wieder horizontal und er mündet in einem granitverkleideten Tor in die zentrale Kammer., Die in ostwestlicher Richtung orientierte zentrale Kammer ist stark zerstört. Unter der Voraussetzung, dass ganzzahlige Einheiten der altägyptischen Längenmaße verwendet wurden, hatte diese Kammer möglicherweise die Abmessungen 3,15m (6Königsellen) in der Breite und 12,60m (24Königsellen) in der Länge, wobei der Wert für die Länge aufgrund der Zerstörung spekulativ ist. Ebenso ist nicht mehr erkennbar, ob es sich dabei um eine einzige, große Kammer handelte oder ob sie in eine Vorkammer und eine eigentliche Grabkammer unterteilt war., Gewaltige Blöcke aus feinem Kalkstein bildeten in drei Lagen das Giebeldach der Kammer. Die Blöcke der obersten Lage waren fast 10m lang und 4m dick. Unter der Last der darüber errichteten Pyramide sind jedoch alle Giebelsteine zerbrochen., Perring fand bei seiner Untersuchung Fragmente eines aus Basalt gefertigten Sarkophags. Andere Funde, die zur Bestattung oder zu den Grabbeigaben gehörten, wurden allerdings nicht gemacht., Der Pyramidenkomplex., Der Pyramidenbezirk enthält neben der Hauptpyramide die typischen Elemente Totentempel, Kultpyramide und Umfassungsmauer. Königinnengräber in Form von Nebenpyramiden oder Mastabas sind nicht bekannt. Die einzige bekannte Gemahlin Neferethanebti ist nur aus Inschriften im Pyramidenkomplex bekannt. Eine Nordkapelle am Eingang zur Pyramide ist nicht gefunden worden. Bei Borchardts Grabungen war allerdings die Existenz von Nordkapellen noch nicht bekannt, so dass eventuell vorhandene spärliche Überreste unbemerkt geblieben sein können. Vervollständigt wird der Komplex durch einen Aufweg und einen Taltempel an dessen Ende., Kultpyramide., An der südöstlichen Ecke befand sich eine kleine Kultpyramide mit dem Basismaß 15,7m (30Königsellen). Bei einem Neigungswinkel von 56° erreichte sie ursprünglich eine Höhe von etwa 11,55m. Das zweistufige Kernmauerwerk bestand aus grob behauenen Kalksteinen und besaß eine Verkleidung aus feinem Kalkstein. Heute ist der Aufbau weitgehend zerstört., Der Unterbau der Kultpyramide bestand aus einer im Norden beginnenden Zugangspassage und der zentral gelegenen, in ostwestlicher Richtung ausgerichteten Kammer. Der Unterbau ist ebenfalls weitgehend zerstört. In den Überresten des Ganges und der Kammer wurden keine Funde von dort bestatteten Artefakten gefunden, jedoch scheint der Gang ursprünglich verschlossen gewesen zu sein., Die Kultpyramide befand sich in einem eigenen, gepflasterten Hof, der vom Seiteneingang des Totentempels zugänglich war. Kultstätten sind dort nicht nachgewiesen., Totentempel., Mit dem Totentempel wurde der Prototyp des Pyramidentempels geschaffen, der für die zweite Hälfte des Alten Reichs stilprägend sein sollte. Hier wurde die Trennung von Totentempel und Verehrungstempel wieder aufgehoben und beide Funktionen in einer axialen ostwestlichen Anordnung in einen Komplex integriert. Der Tempel selbst war aus Kalkstein gemauert und außen mit feinem Tura-Kalkstein mit Hohlkehlenabschluss verkleidet. Die Ecken besaßen Rundstäbe., Der Aufweg mündete zunächst auf der Ostseite des Tempels in eine lang gestreckte Eingangshalle, die eine Verbindung zwischen Aufweg und eigentlichem Totentempel bildet. Diese hatte einen Kalksteinboden und auf einem Granitdado (Granitsockel) errichtete Kalksteinwände mit bemalter Reliefdekoration. Die Eingangshalle hatte in zeitgenössischen Inschriften die Bezeichnung \\"per-wer\\" („Haus der Großen“). Nach Borchardt diente sie als letzte Station des Leichenzugs vor der Bestattung., Von dort gelangte man durch ein Granittor in einen offenen Innenhof, der von 16 einen Granitarchitrav tragenden Granitsäulen gesäumt war. Diese Säulen bildeten symbolisch Stamm und Kronenblätter einer Palme nach, die als Fruchtbarkeits- und Ewigkeitssymbol galt. Diese erste Form der Pflanzensäule ersetzte die früheren Pfeiler und wurde mit Abweichungen in der dargestellten Pflanze Standard für die Pyramidentempel der zweiten Hälfte des Alten Reichs. Alle Säulen trugen den Namen und Titel Sahures. Die in der nördlichen Hälfte stehenden Säulen trugen zudem die Inschrift der Unterägypten symbolisierenden Schlangengöttin Wadjet, die Säulen der südlichen Hälfte die der Oberägypten symbolisierenden geiergestaltigen Göttin Nechbet. Der mit Titeln und Namen des Königs beschriftete Architrav trug dann Kalksteinplatten mit Sternendekor, die den äuß: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"5.

Der Name kommt von dem lateinischen Begriff \\"oleum lini\\" für Leinöl und verweist auf das Leinöl als wichtigsten Grundstoff für Linoleum., Verwendung., Linoleum dient zur Fertigung elastischer Bodenbeläge sowie als Druckplatte beim Linolschnittverfahren in der bildenden Kunst. Weitgehend historisch ist seine Verwendung für Tapeten (Lincrusta). Vereinzelt wird es auch als Belag für Möbelstücke (Tische, Schränke, Pinnwände) gebraucht., Geschichte., Linoleum setzte sich in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts als elastischer Bodenbelag durch. Lange Zeit galt es aber gegenüber traditionellen Fußbodenbelägen –etwa Dielen– als gehobene Ausstattung. Bis weit in die Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts war es im Bereich elastischer Bodenbeläge vorherrschend. Mit der Einführung von Bodenbelägen aus PVC in den 1960er Jahren brach der Markt zusammen und erholte sich erst ab Mitte der 1980er Jahre wieder. Weltweit gab es 2008 nur noch vier Werke (alle in Europa) von drei Eigentümern, die Linoleum herstellten., Herstellung., Rohstoffe., Linoleum besteht hauptsächlich aus oxidativ polymerisiertem Leinöl (Linoxin), Naturharzen (Kolophonium, Copal und ersatzweise Dammar), Kork- oder Holzmehl, Kalksteinpulver, Titan(IV)-oxid als Weißpigment, Farbstoffen und einem Jutegewebe als Trägerschicht. Alternativ zum Leinöl wird heute auch Sojaöl verwendet, zudem können je nach Hersteller und Zeitpunkt der Herstellung auch Anteile von Kautschuk oder Kunststoffen enthalten sein. Die Festigkeit wird allein durch das oxidierte Öl erreicht, die Zusatzstoffe dienen nur der Veränderung der spezifischen Eigenschaften., Linoleum wird in einem mehrstufigen, zeit- und arbeitsaufwendigen Verfahren hergestellt. Das Linoxin und die Harze sind die Bindemittel und machen als Linoleumzement etwa 40 % der Gesamtmasse aus, 60 % entfallen auf organische (Holz-, Korkmehl) und anorganische (Kalksteinpulver, Pigmente) Füllmittel. Das Trägermaterial, im Regelfall Jutegewebe (früher Segeltuch), bildet mit nur etwa einem Prozent den geringsten Teil der Gesamtmasse., Firnis- und Linoxinherstellung., Ausgangsprodukt der Linoleumproduktion ist das Leinöl aus den Samen des Ölleins. Es wird per Warmpressung oder Extraktion gewonnen und vor der Weiterverarbeitung zu Leinölfirnis umgewandelt, indem es unter Zugabe von Trockenstoffen (früher oft Blei- und Kobalt-, heute nur Manganverbindungen in Mengen von etwa 20ppm) bei höheren Temperaturen eingekocht wird. Dabei verliert es rund die Hälfte an Gewicht und wird zäher. Das Einkochen verkürzt die spätere Trocknungszeit. Der Leinölfirnis wird nun zu Linoxin oxidiert, dabei lassen sich drei Verfahren unterscheiden., Historische Verfahren., Das älteste Oxidationsverfahren ist das auf Frederick Walton zurückgehende Tücher-Linoxinverfahren (auch Walton- oder Alt-Walton-Verfahren), bei dem in auf 30bis 40°C geheizten sogenannten \\"Oxydationsschuppen\\" feine Stoffbahnen aus Baumwolle oder Nesseltuch herabhingen. Sie wurden regelmäßig mit Leinölfirnis berieselt, der mit dem Luftsauerstoff zu Linoxin reagierte. Erst nach vier bis fünf Monaten wurden die auf eine Stärke von 1bis 1,5Zentimeter angewachsenen Bahnen abgenommen und das gewonnene Linoxin weiterverarbeitet. Die Methode war langsam und aufwendig, das Linoxin jedoch von hoher Qualität. Das Verfahren war zumindest noch bis in die 1950er Jahre in Gebrauch., Das 1871 von William Parnacott entwickelte und nach dem Fabrikanten Caleb Taylor benannte Taylor-Verfahren war ein künstliches Oxidationsverfahren, bei dem das Leinöl mit Oxidationsbeschleunigern versehen und unter Rühren und Einblasen von Sauerstoff auf gut 300°C erhitzt wurde. Der gesamte Oxidationsprozess dauerte nur einen Tag, was die Kosten für das Endprodukt erheblich reduzierte. Das gewonnene Linoxin galt als von minderer Qualität und war sehr dunkel, weshalb es sich nur für spezielle Anwendungen eignete, etwa für die Produktion von Korklinoleum, dunkler einfarbiger Ware oder von bedrucktem Linoleum., 1894 ließ Frederick Walton das sogenannte Schnelloxidationsverfahren (auch Bedford- oder Neu-Walton-Verfahren) zur Produktion des Linoxins patentieren. Das Verfahren gliederte sich in zwei Teile, nämlich die Firnisbereitung in großen Oxidationstürmen, wo das Leinöl ‚herabregnete‘, sowie die abschließende Bereitung des Linoxins in großen, liegenden Trommeln, sogenannten \\"Bedford-Trommeln.\\" Darin wurde der Firnis bei 55°C unter Rühren zu einer zähen, teigartigen gelbroten Masse verdickt., Später wurde das zwischenzeitlich zwecks Reifung gelagerte Linoxin wieder eingeschmolzen und durch Zugabe verschiedener Harze der sogenannte Linoleumzement hergestellt. Dieser lagerte dann für zwei Monate bis zur endgültigen Weiterverarbeitung., Heutiges Oxidationsverfahren., Heutige Verfahren basieren auf dem Schnelloxidationsverfahren, die einzelnen Schritte sind aber weitgehend zusammengefasst worden. Das Leinöl in den Bedford-Trommeln wird mit Trocknungsstoffen versetzt, bei einer Temperatur von etwa 80°C und unter ständigem Rühren erfolgen dann Firnisbereitung und Oxidation. Sobald die Masse eine bestimmte Zähigkeit (Viskosität) erreicht hat, erfolgt die Zugabe der eingeschmolzenen Harze in die Trommeln. Durch computergesteuerte Verfahren können diese Trommeln aufgeheizt und abgekühlt werden, um die richtige Konsistenz und das optimale Mischungsverhältnis zu erreichen., Bis zu diesem Punkt nimmt die Zubereitung heute nicht mehr als einen Tag in Anspruch. Der Masse wird während der Oxidation zudem Linoleummehl zugegeben, das durch Schreddern und Mahlen von Produktionsresten entsteht. Dies dient zum einen der Verringerung der Abfallmenge, zum anderen wird durch das bereits oxidierte Material der Reifeprozess des neuen Linoleumzements beschleunigt., Der fertige Linoleumzement wird durch eine Schneckenpresse in einen Strang gepresst und in definierte Längen gekürzt. Er wird in mit Kreide oder Holzmehl eingestäubten Eisenkästen abgekühlt und anschließend zur Nachreife und Abkühlung bis zur Verwendung gelagert., Mischmassenbereitung, Kalandern und Nachreife., Der so produzierte Linoleumzement wird mit Kork- und Holzmehl, Kalksteinpulver als Bindemittel sowie Weißpigmenten (Titandioxid) und Farbstoffen vermischt und verknetet. Dabei werden anteilig etwa 40 % Linoleumzement, 40 % Kork- und Holzmehl und 20 % Kalksteinstaub und Pigmente gemischt, wobei die trockenen Bestandteile in einem Vormischer vermengt und erst dann mit dem dünn ausgewalzten Linoleumzement verknetet werden. Die gründliche Verknetung entsteht durch einen mehrstufigen Mischgang, in dem das Material durch mehrere Ein- und Zweischneckenmischer geführt wird. So ergibt sich eine homogene Mischung des Materials., Zum Kalandern schütten Dosieranlagen das Material als feinkörnige Masse vor den Kalanderwalzen auf das Trägergewebe auf. Diese großen, gegenläufig arbeitenden Walzenpaare können je nach Bedarf in der Drehgeschwindigkeit reguliert und aufgeheizt werden. Die Mischmasse wird durch die Kalander auf das Trägermaterial aufgewalzt, wodurch sich beide fest miteinander verbinden., Nach dem Kalandern werden die langen, ungeschnittenen Linoleumbahnen zum Nachreifen in Reifekammern gebracht. Durch eine zwei- bis vierwöchige regulierte Wärmebehandlung erhält das Linoleum hier die gewünschten Eigenschaften. Die Kammern beherbergen bis zu 20.000Meter Linoleum und sind im Regelfall 15Meter hoch, durch mittiges Hängen der Bahnen können die Einzelbahnen bis 30Meter lang sein., Verlegen., Linoleum wird im Regelfall von qualifizierten Bodenlegern verlegt. Als Hilfsmittel werden Klebstoffe sowie Spachtelmasse und spezielle Werkzeuge zur Fußbodenvorbereitung benötigt., Wichtig bei der Verlegung ist die Beachtung des Raumklimas in Bezug auf Luftfeuchtigkeit, Raum- und vor allem die Bodentemperatur. Das bereits mindestens zwei Tage vor Arbeitsbeginn am Einbauort gelagerte Linoleum sollte bei Zimmertemperatur, nicht jedoch unter 15°C verlegt werden, da es in nicht beheizten Räumen beim Ausrollen brechen sowie der verwendete Klebstoff keine stabile Verbindung zum Unterboden aufbauen kann. Sollte man die produktionsbedingten „Hängebeulen“ aufgrund der Raummaße nicht ausschneiden können, ist in diesem Bereich auch die Rückseite mit Klebstoff einzustreichen sowie eine mindestens 24-stündige, voll abdeckende und beschwerte Auflage während der Klebstoffhärtung aufzulegen., Das Linoleum nimmt normalerweise Feuchtigkeit vom Kleber und vom Untergrund auf, die es vorübergehend erweichen. Moderne Dispersionskleber enthalten bis zu 30 % Wasser, das in den Unterboden oder das Linoleum abgegeben wird. Durch die erhöhte Feuchtigkeit kann es bis zu sechs Wochen dauern, bis das Linoleum vollständig getrocknet und voll beanspruchbar ist; in dieser Zeit ist es vor allem für Kerbschlagbelastungen anfälliger, die z.B. durch Stuhlbeine eingeschlagen werden können. Wird unter dem Linoleum zur Schallisolierung eine Korkschicht verlegt, kann der Trocknungsprozess durch die doppelte Feuchtigkeit nochmals deutlich verlängert werden., Um Räume vollständig und fugenlos an den Wänden abzuschließen, gibt es spezielle Wandanschlusssysteme, die ebenfalls aus Linoleum bestehen und in verschiedenen Ausführungen mit Stützprofil oder mit einfachen Sockelstreifen einen sauberen Abschluss ermöglichen. Ebenfalls zum Zubehör gehört Linoleumschmelzdraht zum Abdichten der Nähte, der aus einem Schmelzklebstoff besteht und transparent oder in den gleichen Farben wie das Linoleum angeboten wird. Zum Abdichten der Nähte nach dem Abbinden des Klebstoffes dient ein Handschweißgerät oder ein Schweißautomat., Oberflächenbehandlung., Ein Nachteil des Linoleums gegenüber Bodenbelägen aus PVC ist seine relativ große Pflegebedürftigkeit. Linoleum musste bis in die 1950er Jahre neben der normalen Reinigung regelmäßig mit wachsbasierten Pflegemitteln gebohnert werden, um die Oberfläche vor Verschmutzung und mechanischen Schäden zu schützen., Heutzutage wird nach der Reifung eine Schutzschicht auf die Oberfläche des Linoleums aufget: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Baustoff, Biowerkstoff, Bodenbelag, Holzwerkstoff, Textiler Verbundwerkstoff, Linoleum, Verwendung, Geschichte, Herstellung, Rohstoffe"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Asteroid vom Aten-Typ, Asteroid vom Typ C (Tholen), Astronomisches Objekt (entdeckt 2003)], 2003YN107 ist ein sehr kleiner erdnaher Asteroid, der am 20. Dezember 2003 durch die automatische Himmelsüberwachung LINEAR (Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research) entdeckt wurde. Der Durchmesser des Asteroiden beträgt nur zirka 10 bis 30 Meter. Er ist ein Erdbahnkreuzer, wird daher (nach dem namensgebenden Asteroiden Aten) als Aten-Typ klassifiziert und umkreist die Sonne auf einer der Erdbahn sehr ähnlichen, fast kreisförmigen Umlaufbahn. Eine weitere Besonderheit ist, dass seine mittlere Umlaufdauer um die Sonne ungefähr einem siderischen Jahr entspricht. Seine bemerkenswerteste Besonderheit ist jedoch, dass er sich von 1996 bis 2006 niemals weiter als 0,1 AE (ca. 15 Millionen km) von der Erde entfernte und dass er die Erde langsam einmal innerhalb eines Jahres umkreiste. 2003YN107 war aber kein zweiter Mond der Erde, da er nicht fest an sie gebunden war. Er ist der erste bekannte Vertreter einer schon länger postulierten Gruppe von koorbitalen Objekten, den \\"Quasisatelliten\\", welche diese Bahneigenschaften aufweisen. Vor 1996 befand sich 2003YN107 in einer sogenannten Hufeisenumlaufbahn entlang der Erdbahn um die Sonne, welche der des Asteroiden 2002AA29 sehr ähnlich war. Auch seit 2006 hält er sich wieder für einige Zeit in einer derartigen Umlaufbahn auf. Ein derartiger Orbitwechsel scheint bei diesen koorbitalen Begleitern relativ häufig zu sein, da 2002AA29 in zirka 600 Jahren ebenfalls für einige Zeit ein Quasisatellit der Erde sein wird., Umlaufbahn., Bahndaten., Die Umlaufbahn von 2003YN107 befindet sich mit einem Sonnenabstand zwischen 0,974 AE für das Perihel, den sonnennächsten Punkt, und 1,021 AE für das Aphel, den sonnenfernsten Punkt, zum größten Teil innerhalb der Erdumlaufbahn. Die Bahnen der meisten Asteroiden befinden sich hingegen im Asteroidengürtel zwischen Mars und Jupiter sowie außerhalb der Neptunbahn im Kuipergürtel. Durch Bahnstörungen der großen Gasplaneten, hauptsächlich durch Jupiter, und durch den Jarkowski-Effekt, also die Bahnänderung durch asymmetrische Ein- und Abstrahlung von Infrarotstrahlung, werden Asteroiden ins innere Sonnensystem abgelenkt, wo ihre Bahnen dann durch weitere nahe Vorbeiflüge an den inneren Planeten weiter beeinflusst werden. Bei Ablenkung von Asteroiden ins innere Sonnensystem durch Jupiter und die übrigen Planeten entstehen jedoch meist Umlaufbahnen mit hoher Exzentrizität. 2003YN107 hat mit einer Exzentrizität von 0,021 jedoch einen ähnlich niedrigen Wert wie die Erde mit 0,0167 und hat somit eine fast kreisförmige Umlaufbahn. Es ist also weniger wahrscheinlich, dass er durch Jupiter oder einen anderen Planeten aus einer Umlaufbahn im äußeren Sonnensystem ins innere Sonnensystem geschleudert wurde. Aufgrund seiner geringen Exzentrizität wird spekuliert, dass er sich schon immer auf einer erdnahen Bahn befand und er oder ein Vorläuferkörper somit in der Nähe der Erdbahn entstand. Eine Möglichkeit wäre in diesem Fall, dass er ein abgesprengtes Bruchstück des Zusammenstoßes eines mittleren Asteroiden mit der Erde oder dem Mond sein könnte., Die mittlere Umlaufdauer von 2003YN107 beträgt ein siderisches Jahr. Nachdem er ins innere Sonnensystem abgelenkt wurde oder auf einer Bahn in der Nähe der Erdbahn entstand, muss der Asteroid auf eine mit der Erde korrespondierende Bahn geraten sein. Auf dieser Bahn wurde er immer wieder von der Erde derart abgelenkt, dass seine eigene Umlaufdauer sich der Umlaufdauer der Erde um die Sonne anglich. Auf seiner aktuellen Umlaufbahn wird er von der Erde also stets synchron zu ihrem eigenen Umlauf gehalten., Aufgrund seiner leichten Bahnneigung von 4,3° gegen die Ekliptik (Bahnebene der Erde) ist seine Bahn jedoch nicht mit der der Erde deckungsgleich, sondern gegen die der Erde leicht geneigt., Bahnform., Betrachtet man den mit der Erdbahn nahezu deckungsgleichen Orbit von 2003YN107 vom mit der Erdbewegung um die Sonne mitbewegten Bezugssystem aus, stellt man fest, dass er – fast wie ein zweiter Mond – langsam um die Erde kreist; für einen Umlauf braucht er allerdings ein Jahr. Sein langsamer Umlauf um die Erde innerhalb eines Jahres wird durch seine leicht verschiedene Exzentrizität verursacht. Der radiale Bewegungsanteil wird direkt durch die Differenz der Exzentrizitäten zwischen Erde und 2003YN107 verursacht, während der Bewegungsanteil längs der Erdbahn durch die leicht unterschiedliche Geschwindigkeit im Perihel und im Aphel verursacht wird. Im Perihel überholt er die Erde von innen, während er im Aphel weiter außen in Bezug auf die Erde zurückfällt. Im Laufe eines Jahres wird daraus ein kompletter Umlauf um die Erde. Da er nicht wie der Mond fest an die Erde gebunden ist, sondern hauptsächlich unter dem Gravitationseinfluss der Sonne steht, nennt man diese Körper Quasisatelliten. Dies ist in etwa analog zu zwei Autos, die nebeneinander mit gleicher Geschwindigkeit fahren und sich wechselseitig überholen, jedoch nicht fest aneinander gebunden sind. Siehe hierzu auch die nebenstehende Grafik der zukünftigen Bahn des Asteroiden 2002AA29, welche der von 2003YN107 ähneln wird. 2003YN107 war seit 1996 ein Quasisatellit der Erde und blieb dies noch bis 2006. Aufgrund der Gravitation der Erde trifft er jedoch nach einem Umlauf um die Erde nicht wieder genau am Ausgangspunkt an, sondern beschreibt offene Schleifen um die Erde. So kam er der Erde am 21. Dezember 2003 mit 0,0149 AE (2,23 Millionen km) sehr nahe, was weniger als 6-mal dem Abstand Erde-Mond entspricht., Nach 2006 verließ er die Nähe der Erde und umkreist die Sonne auf einer Hufeisenumlaufbahn entlang der Erdbahn, wobei er der Erde entlang ihrer Bahn vorauseilt. Der Name Hufeisenumlaufbahn wird klar, wenn man vom mit der Erde mitbewegten Bezugsystem aus nur die Relativbewegung von 2003YN107 betrachtet. Er beschreibt dabei entlang der Erdumlaufbahn einen großen Bogen von 360°, dessen Form an ein Hufeisen erinnert. Bei der Bewegung entlang des Erdorbits windet er sich spiralförmig um diesen, wobei er für eine Spiraldrehung ein Jahr braucht. Diese Spiralbewegung im mit der Erde mitbewegten Bezugsystem kommt durch seine leicht von der Erdbahn abweichende Exzentrizität und Bahnneigung zustande, wobei der Unterschied in der Bahnneigung für den vertikalen und derjenige der Exzentrizität für den horizontalen Anteil der projizierten Spiralbewegung verantwortlich ist., Im Jahr 2066 erreicht 2003YN107 wieder die Erde auf der anderen Seite von hinten und kommt ihr bis auf zirka 0,026 AE (3,9 Millionen km) nahe. Er gerät wieder unter ihren Gravitationseinfluss und wird so auf eine langsamere Umlaufbahn etwas weiter weg von der Sonne gehoben. Dadurch kann er nun nicht mehr mit der Geschwindigkeit der Erde mithalten, bis diese ihn im Jahr 2120 wieder von vorn erreicht. Bei dieser erneuten Begegnung mit der Erde wird 2003YN107 ihr allerdings sehr nahe kommen und von ihr sehr stark abgelenkt werden. Sehr wahrscheinlich wird 2003YN107 dann von der Erde eingefangen und zu einem echten zweiten Mond der Erde. Die Berechnungen werden jedoch chaotisch, so dass man nichts Genaues über die Zeit nach 2120 sagen kann., Berechnet man die Bahn von 2003YN107 rückwärts in der Zeit, stellt man fest, dass er sich vor 1996 ebenfalls in einer Hufeisenumlaufbahn aufhielt, wobei die Periode für ein volles Vor- und Zurückschwingen 133 Jahre betrug. Diesen Hufeisenorbit kann man bis in das Jahr 1750 zurückberechnen. 1750 kam es zu einem chaotischen Übergang zwischen Quasisatellitenorbit und Hufeisenorbit, so dass man über die Zeit vor 1750 nichts mehr aussagen kann., Physikalische Eigenschaften., Über 2003YN107 ist außer seiner Umlaufbahn recht wenig bekannt. Aus seiner geringen absoluten Helligkeit von 26,2–26,7 und einem vermuteten Albedo (Reflexionsvermögen) von 0,04–0,20 schließt man aber, dass er nur zirka 10–30m Durchmesser hat und somit ein sehr kleiner Asteroid ist. Nur aufgrund seiner sehr erdähnlichen Bahn vermutet man, dass er ein abgesprengtes Stück von Erde oder Mond sein könnte, welches bei einem Zusammenstoß mit einem mittleren Asteroiden entstand., Ausblick., Aufgrund seiner sehr erdähnlichen Bahn ist der Asteroid für Raumsonden relativ leicht erreichbar. 2003YN107 wäre also ein geeignetes Studienobjekt zur genaueren Untersuchung des Aufbaus und der Zusammensetzung von Asteroiden und der zeitlichen Entwicklung ihrer Bahnen um die Sonne. Aufgrund seiner geringen Größe und der deshalb praktisch vollständig fehlenden Anziehungskraft werden Aufbau und Zusammensetzung dieses Himmelskörpers aber kaum durch Landemissionen bestimmbar sein., Wegen seiner Erdnähe kann man die Bahn von 2003YN107 mittels Radarastronomie sehr genau verfolgen und vermessen. Dadurch kann man den vorhergesagten Jarkowski-Effekt, der zu einer geringfügigen Bahnänderung führt und kürzlich beim Asteroiden Golevka bestätigt wurde, schon nach relativ kurzer Zeit von wenigen Jahren feststellen und genauer überprüfen.]: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Asteroid, Aten-Typ, LINEAR, Umlaufbahn, Quasisatelliten, Exzentrizität, Hufeisenumlaufbahn, zweiter Mond, Reflexionsvermögen, Landemissionen."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Finsterspinnen], Die Fensterspinne (\\"Amaurobius fenestralis\\") oder Waldfinsterspinne ist eine Spinne innerhalb der Familie der Finsterspinnen (Amaurobiidae). Die paläarktisch verbreitete Art zählt zusammen mit der gattungsverwandten Kellerspinne (\\"Amaurobius ferox\\") sowie der Ähnlichen Fensterspinne (\\"Amaurobius similis\\") zu den häufigsten der Familie in Europa., Der Trivialname „Fensterspinne“ rührt von der irrtümlichen Annahme her, dass die Art gerne im Bereich von Fenstern lebt. Dies ist mittlerweile widerlegt und ist mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit auf Verwechslungen mit der verwandten Ähnlichen Fensterspinne zurückzuführen, bei der dieses Verhalten vorkommt und die überdies früher nicht als eigene Art von der Fensterspinne unterschieden wurde. Die Fensterspinne selbst bewohnt hingegen bevorzugt Wälder und seltener Keller oder Höhlen., Im englischen Sprachraum wird die Fensterspinne als \\"Window spider\\" oder wie die Ähnliche Fensterspinne als \\"Lace-webbed spider\\" (übersetzt etwa „Spitzenweberspinne“) bezeichnet. Beide englischen Bezeichnungen nehmen Bezug auf das Trichternetz, das wie bei allen Echten Finsterspinnen (\\"Amaurobius\\") mit cribellater Fangwolle versehen ist., Mit dessen Hilfe erbeutet die nachtaktive Fensterspinne eine Vielzahl von Gliederfüßern und kann auch wehrhafte Vertreter dieses Stammes überwältigen. Das Trichternetz mündet weiter hinten in einer als Aufenthaltsort der Spinne dienenden Wohnröhre, in der ein verpaartes Weibchen später auch seinen Eikokon deponiert. Die geschlüpften Jungtiere verhalten sich wie bei allen Echten Finsterspinnen matriphag bzw. saugen sie ihre kurz nach dem Schlupf verendende Mutter aus und überwintern gemeinsam in ihrem Netz, ehe sie sich im folgenden Frühjahr trennen und selbstständig heranwachsen., Merkmale., Die Fensterspinne erreicht eine Körperlänge von vier bis sieben Millimetern als Männchen und eine von sieben bis 9,6 Millimetern als Weibchen. Der Körperbau der Art entspricht dem anderer Echter Finsterspinnen (\\"Amaurobius\\")., Das Prosoma (Vorderkörper) erscheint glänzend. Der Carapax (Rückenschild des Prosomas) hat eine gelblich-braune bis rotbraune Farbgebung. Beim Weibchen ist der gesamte Kopfbereich außerdem leicht verdunkelt, beim Männchen nur der Augenbereich. Die Cheliceren (Kieferklauen) sind braun und das Sternum (Brustplatte) gelblich gefärbt. Die Beine besitzen eine hell- bis rotbraune Grundfärbung mit einer dunklen und undeutlichen Ringelung., Das Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) verfügt über eine gelblich-graue oder rötliche Grundfärbung. Auf der Dorsalseite (Oberseite) ist dieser Körperabschnitt sehr kontrastreich gezeichnet, obgleich sich die Zeichnungselemente bei beiden Geschlechtern unterscheiden. Beim Weibchen ist der dunkle Bereich im vorderen Teil des Opisthosomas einheitlich gefärbt, beim Männchen befindet sich dort ein für gewöhnlich deutlich aufgehelltes Herzmal. Das Weibchen trägt an dieser Stelle einen schwarzbraunen, nach hinten zu etwas breiter werdenden Fleck, der gelblichweiß umrandet ist. An den Flanken befinden sich gegenüber der Grundfärbung deutliche und scharf abgegrenzte Bänder, die plötzlich enden und mit der deutlich schmaleren Reihe von Winkelflecken einen fast rechten Winkel bilden. Letztere sind oftmals sehr deutlich voneinander durch dunklere, oft rötlich gefärbte Zwischenräume voneinander getrennt. Frontal gehen die Winkelflecken beim Weibchen direkt in die gelblichweiße Umrandung des Herzmals über. Wie alle Finsterspinnen (Amaurobiidae) verfügt auch die Fensterspinne über ein zweigeteiltes Cribellum (Organ zum Herstellen von Fangwolle ohne Leimtröpfchen)., Genitalmorphologische Merkmale., Die Bulbi (männliche Geschlechtsorgane) der Fensterspinne werden innerhalb der Gattung der Echten Finsterspinnen (\\"Amaurobius\\") jeweils durch den verjüngten retrolateralen (seitlich vom Körper wegzeigenden) Fortsatz der Tibiaapophyse (ein chitinisierter Fortsatz) charakterisiert. Im Gegensatz zu den ähnlich aufgebauten Bulbi der zur gleichen Gattung zählenden Ähnlichen Fensterspinne (\\"A. similis\\") sind diese bei der Fensterspinne nicht hakenartig verlängert, was ein Hauptunterscheidungsmerkmal zur Bestimmung der beiden Arten bei den Männchen darstellt., Die Epigyne (weibliches Geschlechtsorgan) der Fensterspinne verfügt über eine verglichen mit anderen Vertretern der Echten Finsterspinnen eher breit eingefasste Mittelplatte. Der Mittelteil der Epigyne verfügt außerdem auf beiden Seiten über feine Spitzen., Ähnliche Arten., Die Fensterspinne ähnelt insbesondere der zur gleichen Gattung zählenden Ähnlichen Fensterspinne (\\"A. similis\\"). Die Ähnlichkeit lässt sich schon aus dem Trivialnamen der Art herleiten, zumal die Ähnliche Fensterspinne erst seit ihrer Erstbeschreibung als eigene Art im Jahr 1861 von der Fensterspinne unterschieden wird. Bei der Ähnlichen Fensterspinne ist das Herzmal etwas stärker aufgehellt. Außerdem erreicht die Art eine geringfügig höher ausfallende Körperlänge. Eine sichere Differenzierung beider Arten ist allerdings nur anhand der genitalmorphologischen Merkmale möglich. Ein einzelner Bulbus des Männchens der Ähnlichen Fensterspinne verfügt über eine dorsale (obere) Tibialapophyse mit gerade abgestutztem seitlichen Fortsatz und die Epigyne des Weibchens über eine große trapezförmige Grube. Die Ähnliche Fensterspinne weist eine verglichen mit der der Fensterspinne größere Synanthropie (Bevorzugung menschlicher Siedlungsbereiche) auf und ist vor allem im Umfeld von Gebäuden, jedoch genau wie die Fensterspinne auch in Wäldern auffindbar., Auch die ebenfalls zu den Echten Finsterspinnen (\\"Amaurobius\\") zählende Kellerspinne (\\"A. ferox\\") erinnert entfernt an die Fensterspinne, ist jedoch mit einer maximalen Körperlänge von 16 Millimetern zumeist deutlich größer und überdies die größte in Europa vorkommende Art der Finsterspinnen (Amaurobiidae). Im Gegensatz zu den beiden anderen Arten ist die Kellerspinne außerdem deutlich dunkler und wenig kontrastreich gefärbt. Ihr Opisthosoma ist meist nur undeutlich gezeichnet und besteht dann aus einfachen hellen Flecken auf dunklem Grund. Die Kellerspinne ist ebenfalls synanthrop und kommt besonders in und an Gebäuden einschließlich der Keller vor, was zu ihrem Trivialnamen geführt hat. in der natürlichen Umgebung bewohnt die Art Felsen und Höhlen. Im Allgemeinen bevorzugt die Kellerspinne oft schattige bis feuchte Areale., Die Fensterspinne wird außerdem wie die Ähnliche Fensterspinne gelegentlich mit der in Europa eingeführten Edlen Kugelspinne (\\"Steatoda nobilis\\") aus der Familie der Kugelspinnen (Theridiidae) verwechselt, die wie andere Arten der Fettspinnen (\\"Steatoda\\") nicht selten als „Falsche Witwe“ bezeichnet wird. Diese Verwechslungen sind auf die sich ähnelnden Körperdimensionen und -proportionen sowie Färbungen der Spinnen zurückzuführen. So erscheint der Carapax ähnlich wie bei den beiden anderen Spinnenarten dunkelbräunlich und glänzend, geht dafür aber mehr in einen stärker rötlichen Farbton über. Außerdem sind die Beine der Edlen Kugelspinne im Verhältnis zum Körper länger als es bei der Fensterspinne und der Ähnlichen Fensterspinne der Fall ist. Ferner ist das Opisthosoma der Kugelspinne rundlicher geformt, während es bei den beiden anderen Spinnenarten eher länglich gebaut ist. Zu guter Letzt ist auf der Dorsalseite des Opisthosomas bei der Edlen Kugelspinne eine charakteristische Zeichnung vorhanden, die von den Zeichnungselementen der beiden Finsterspinnen an derselben Stelle stark abweicht., Vorkommen., Die Fensterspinne ist von Europa bis nach Zentralasien verbreitet. Südöstlich reicht das Verbreitungsgebiet über den Südosten des europäischen Teils von Russland bis nach Kaukasien. Die Art fehlt gänzlich in den restlichen Gebieten Russlands (einschließlich der Oblast Kaliningrad und der Doppelinsel Nowaja Semlja) sowie in Armenien. Im restlichen Europa fehlt die Art in Island, auf der Iberischen Halbinsel, der Mittelmeerinsel Korsika sowie in den südosteuropäischen Ländern Bosnien und Herzegowina, Montenegro, Kosovo, Albanien und Griechenland. Gleiches trifft auch auf den europäischen Teil der Türkei (sowie den Rest des Landes) zu., Lebensräume., Die Fensterspinne nimmt gerne Wälder aller Art als Habitat an, darunter jedoch gehäuft Laub- und Nadelwälder. In den höheren Lagen der Alpen ist die Art auch in den dortigen Zirbelkieferwäldern nachgewiesen worden. Innerhalb dieser Habitate ist die Spinne unter der Rinde stehender und umgefallener Bäume sowie in Laubstreu und unter Steinen zu finden, gelegentlich auch in Moospolstern. Daneben ist die Fensterspinne auch in Pflanzen mit dichten Blattwerk vorzufinden. Dazu zählen auch Koniferenhecken., Mauerwerke werden von der Fensterspinne ebenfalls als Mikrohabitat angenommen, gebietsweise ebenso das Innere von Gebäuden, einschließlich Kellern. Selbiges gilt auch für Höhlen. Im Gegensatz zur Ähnlichen Fensterspinne (\\"Amaurobius similis\\"), die vorzugsweise in und an Bauwerken zu finden ist, zeigt die Fensterspinne eine deutlich geringer ausgeprägte Bevorzugung menschlicher Siedlungsbereiche und bewohnt im Gegensatz zu dieser auch keine Fenster. Dafür kann man letztere Art mitunter an Zäunen antreffen. Im Vereinigten Königreich ist die Fensterspinne bis zu Höhen von 900 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel nachgewiesen worden., Bedrohung und Schutz., Die Fensterspinne ist in Europa eine der häufigsten Arten der Finsterspinnen und in ihrem Verbreitungsgebiet nicht gefährdet. Der globale Gefährdungsgrad der Art wird von der IUCN nicht gewertet., In der Roten Liste gefährdeter Arten Tiere, Pflanzen und Pilze Deutschlands bzw. der Roten Liste und Gesamtartenliste der Spinnen Deutschlands (2016) wird die Fensterspinne als „ungefährdet“ eingestuft, da ihre Bestände in Deutschland als stabil und sehr häufig gelten. Die Bestände der Art in Tschechien werden von der IUCN als „ES“ (\\"Ecologically Sustainable\\", ökologisch nachhaltig) gewertet. Diese Kategorie bedeutet, dass die Bestände stabil sind oder sogar anwachsen. In Norwegen werden sie in der Kategorie „LC“ (\\"Least Concern\\", nicht gefährdet) erfasst. Gleiches gilt für die Bestandssituation der Fensterspinne im Vereinigten Königreich., Lebensweise., Wie alle Finsterspinnen (Amaurobiidae) ist auch die Fensterspinne vornehmlich nachtaktiv.

Jahrhundert), Literatur (Deutsch), Literatur (Schwäbisch)], Sebastian Sailer OPraem (* 12. Februar 1714 in Weißenhorn als \\"Johann Valentin Sailer\\"; † 7. März 1777 in Obermarchtal) war ein deutscher Prämonstratenser, Prediger und Schriftsteller des Barock. Er wurde besonders bekannt durch seine Komödien in oberschwäbischem Dialekt und gilt als Begründer und Meister der schwäbischen Mundartdichtung., Leben und Werk., Sailer wurde als Sohn eines gräflich Fuggerschen Amtsschreibers in Weißenhorn geboren. Bereits als Schüler trat er ins Prämonstratenserkloster Obermarchtal ein. 1730 nahm er den Ordensnamen \\"Sebastian\\" an, 1732 legte er die Ordensgelübde ab und 1738 wurde er zum Priester geweiht. Ab 1739 war er an der Klosterschule in Obermarchtal als Lehrer unter anderem für Kirchenrecht tätig. Daneben war er Pfarrer der klostereigenen Dörfer Seekirch am Federsee und Reutlingendorf (heute Ortsteil von Obermarchtal)., Die schwäbische Schöpfung., Am 10. November 1743 führte er im Kloster Schussenried sein neues Singspiel \\"Schöpfung der ersten Menschen, der Sündenfall und dessen Strafe\\" (später bekannt als \\"Die schwäbische Schöpfung\\") auf. Das Werk, das als das unübertroffene Meisterwerk Sailers gilt, versetzt auf liebevolle, wenn auch derbe Weise die biblische Schöpfungsgeschichte um Adam und Eva in die Welt oberschwäbischer Bauern. Gottvater, Adam und Eva sprechen und singen auf der Bühne in oberschwäbischem Dialekt. Die Komödie war sehr erfolgreich und wurde 1796 sogar – wahrscheinlich unter Einbeziehung Sailers eigener Melodien – von dem Weingartener Klosterkomponisten Meingosus Gaelle als Oper \\"Adam und Evas Erschaffung\\" vertont. Die \\"Schwäbische Schöpfung\\" fand zu allen Zeiten viele Freunde, erlebte – wenn auch erst nach Sailers Tod – zahlreiche, teils illustrierte Ausgaben. Die Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts im Kloster Mehrerau aufgefundene Fortsetzung der Schöpfungsgeschichte \\"Kain und Abel\\" lässt sich Sailer nicht sicher zuordnen und könnte – auch aufgrund der hochdeutschen Teile – eine Bearbeitung oder ein Werk eines Nachahmers sein., Der Fall Luzifers., Sailers Dialektkomödie \\"Der Fall Luzifers\\" lässt sich nicht genau datieren, muss aber aufgrund einer Referenz auf die Hinrichtung Joseph Süß Oppenheimers nach 1738 entstanden sein. Die skurrile Komödie erzählt von der Teufelwerdung Luzifers und der Notwendigkeit, entbehrliche Schutzengel von der Erde zurückzuholen, um die himmlischen Heerscharen zu verstärken. Sailer verspottet in der Komödie, indem er Sprachen und Dialekte parodiert, die Eigenheiten der Völker und ihre Sünden. So prangert der Franzosenengel den Hochmut an, der Schwabenengel geißelt die Völlerei, der Schweizerengel den \\"höllischa Giz\\" (Geiz), und auch ein bayerischer Hanswurst tritt auf. Luzifer wird gegen Ende in ein Toilettenhäuschen eingesperrt, und schließlich wird ihm zur Strafe für jede seiner Untaten der Genuss eines Schlucks Bodenseeweins angedroht, den Sailer anscheinend nicht sonderlich schätzte., Die sieben Schwaben., Auch in Sailers weltlichem Schwank \\"Die sieben Schwaben\\", in dem sieben wackere Schwaben auf Hasenjagd gehen, bietet sich Raum für seinen Spott. Die Hauptfiguren sind der \\"Gelbfüßler\\", der verfressene \\"Spätzlesschwab\\", der schlafmützige \\"Nestlerschwab\\", der aufsässige \\"Mückenschwab\\", der schmutzige \\"Spiegelschwab\\", der grobe \\"Blitzschwab\\", der ehrgeizige \\"Suppenschwab\\" und ein redseliger Allgäuer. Im Schwank \\"Schwäbischer Sonn- und Mondfang\\" versuchen schwäbische Bauern, das Wetter zu kontrollieren, indem sie Sonne und Mond einfangen wollen., Sailers hauptsächlich in Alexandrinern verfasstes Schauspiel \\"Die Schultheißenwahl zu Limmelsdorf\\" wurde in der Klosterschule Obermarchtal aufgeführt und enthält Elemente des Schwanks wie eines Lehrstücks., Gefragter Prediger und vielseitiger Autor., Von 1756 an war Sailer Pfarrer in Dieterskirch. 1761–1763 besuchte er wiederholt den kunstsinnigen Grafen Friedrich von Stadion in Warthausen, wo er auch Christoph Martin Wieland und Sophie von La Roche begegnete., Sailer war ein gefragter Prediger und war für seine Predigten häufig auf Reisen. 1750 wurde er von der mächtigen Reichsabtei Salem eingeladen, die Predigt anlässlich der Überführung des Gnadenbilds in die Wallfahrtskirche Birnau zu halten. 1762 reiste er nach Augsburg und Landsberg am Lech, 1764 hielt er die \\"Ignatius-von-Loyola-Predigt\\" bei den Jesuiten in Würzburg, 1766 hielt er die Kirchweihpredigt anlässlich der Tausendjahrfeier des Klosters Ottobeuren und 1767 die \\"St.-Ulrichs-Predigt\\" für die schwäbische Landesgenossenschaft in Wien. Auf dieser Reise erhielt er sogar eine Privataudienz bei Maria Theresia., Als Maria Theresias Tochter Maria Antonia (die spätere französische Königin Marie-Antoinette) auf der Reise von Wien zu ihrer Hochzeit nach Paris am 1. Mai 1770 auch das Kloster Obermarchtal besuchte, wurde ihr zu Ehren Sailers Huldigungskantate \\"Beste Gesinnungen Schwäbischer Herzen\\" (\\"in einer einfältigen Kantate abgesungen\\") aufgeführt. In dem amüsanten Stück wechseln pathetische hochdeutsche Verse von \\"Marchtalls Genius\\" und der \\"Liebe\\" mit schwäbischen der vier Bauern \\"Theißle\\", \\"Joackele\\", \\"Veitle\\" und \\"Michel\\" und des Chors. Als Dank an das Kloster Obermarchtal übersandte Maria Antonia diesem nach ihrer Ankunft und Vermählung in Paris ihr Brautgewand, das in zwei Priestergewänder umgearbeitet wurde, die man noch heute im Museum des Klosters betrachten kann. Die \\"Beste Gesinnungen Schwäbischer Herzen\\" verbreiteten sich nach der Aufführung rasch. Bereits am 10. Mai 1770 konnte das Stück in Druck mit Noten zum Nachsingen beim Augsburger Buchdrucker und Verleger Johann Michael Späth für 15 Kreuzer erworben werden., Auch in Sailers \\"Kantate auf die Aderlässe\\" wird ein hochdeutsch sprechender \\"Doktor\\" mit einem oberschwäbischen \\"Bauern\\" konfrontiert, bis hin zu einem „zweisprachigen“ Duett (\\"Herr Dokter! krank bi-n-i, As beißt mi, und klimmt mi\\" / \\"Freund! schick nur zum Bader, Lass öffnen ein Ader\\"). Gegen Ende tendieren auch des Doktors Worte zum Dialekt., 1771 veröffentlichte Sailer zur Sechshundertjahrfeier des Klosters seine Klostergeschichte \\"Das Jubilierende Marchtall\\"., In seiner Prosakomödie \\"Die schwäbischen heiligen drei Könige\\" (um 1771, abzuleiten aus einer Erwähnung des 4. Russischen Türkenkriegs auf der Krim durch die drei Könige) vermischte Sailer die Legende mit der dörflichen Welt seiner Heimat. Herodes wird als schwäbischer Dorfwirt dargestellt, die heiligen drei Könige begehren als Sternsinger Speis und Trank, was die findige Wirtsfrau jedoch mit Hinweis auf das Fastengebot vor dem Dreikönigsfest ablehnt., 1773 erlitt Sailer einen Schlaganfall und zog sich von seiner Pfarrstelle in Dieterskirch in das Kloster Obermarchtal zurück. Nach seinem Tod 1777 wurde er in der Gruft des Klosters beigesetzt., Bedeutung und Eigenart., Zu seinen Lebzeiten war Sailer außerhalb seiner Pfarreien vor allem als Prediger und Gelehrter bekannt. Sein Nachruhm gründet jedoch auf seinen schwäbischen Dialektdichtungen, die in der Tradition der altbairischen Rustikaltravestien und der Salzburger Benediktinerkomödie stehen und am ehesten mit den oberösterreichischen Mundartkomödien des Lambacher Benediktinermönchs Maurus Lindemayr zu vergleichen sind. Monika Küble hält in einem Aufsatz von 2003 die Vorstellung, Sailer habe seine Dialektkomödien als volksnaher Seelsorger den Bauern seiner Pfarrgemeinden zur Unterhaltung vorgeführt, für eine romantische Verklärung. Sie sieht Sailers Publikum in den adeligen und bürgerlichen Kreisen etwa am Warthauser \\"Musenhof\\" des Grafen von Stadion, wo man sich auch über die satirische Darstellung von Wielands Biberacher Mitbürgern in dessen \\"Geschichte der Abderiten\\" amüsierte. (Lit.: Küble, 2003) Die wenigen bekannten Zeugnisse von Aufführungen verweisen eher auf ein klösterliches Publikum: Die \\"Schwäbische Schöpfung\\" zumindest wurde vor dem Konvent des mit dem Kloster Obermarchtal befreundeten Stiftes Schussenried uraufgeführt; auch der lateinische Prolog zielt auf ein gebildetes Publikum; die Schüler der Klosterschule in Obermarchtal führten die \\"Schultheißenwahl\\" auf. Der Humor in Sailers Werken ist nie herablassend oder denunzierend. So kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass – wer auch immer das Publikum gewesen sein mag – Sailer \\"mit\\" seinen schwäbischen Pfarrkindern, nicht jedoch über sie lachte., Sailer war der erste Autor, der den schwäbischen Dialekt nicht nur einsetzte, um zu karikieren oder eine gewisse Leutseligkeit zu gewinnen. Er handelte auch die ihm wichtigen Themen konsequent in erstaunlich originalgetreuer Mundart ohne jede hochdeutsche Glättung oder Verniedlichung ab. Die Übertragung des biblischen Geschehens in die Lebenswelt der oberschwäbischen Landbevölkerung verrät die erstaunliche Einfühlungskraft Sailers – immerhin ein auf der Höhe seiner Zeit stehender anerkannter Theologe – in das Leben seiner Gemeindekinder. Er integriert den bäuerlichen Alltag vielfältig in das theologische Geschehen der Bibel (das Paradies hat selbstverständlich eine Gartentür – \\"Gott Vatter gôht grad zuar Gatathür rei\\") – bis hin zu direkten, einfallsreichen Übertragungen von Bibelzitaten.

Gemma rushes to open it, revealing JENNY (late 20s, enthusiastic) and MARK (early 30s, friendly). Gemma (excitedly) Jenny! Mark! You made it! Welcome to our foot massage party! Jenny and Mark exchange confused glances but play along, assuming it's some quirky theme. Jenny (sarcastically) Oh, how thoughtful of you to organize a foot massage party. I can't wait to get my feet pampered. Mark (grinning) Yeah, I've been waiting for this all week. My feet really need some attention. Gemma leads them to the living room where Paul is sitting obediently. Gemma (introducing) Everyone, meet our foot massager for tonight, Paul. He's an expert hypnotized masseur! Lisa and Sarah giggle in the background, barely containing their excitement. Jenny (raising an eyebrow) A hypnotized foot massager? I've got to see this. Mark (raising his hands in surrender) Alright then, let's give it a shot. Can't say no to a free foot massage. Jenny and Mark take a seat on the couch, cautiously extending their feet towards Paul. Paul, still in a dazed state, obediently takes their feet in his hands and begins massaging. The guests exchange amused glances, unable to believe what they're witnessing. Gemma, Lisa, and Sarah continue mingling with the arriving guests, ensuring everyone knows Paul's unique role in the party. AN HOUR LATER The living room is filled with laughter and chatter. Paul has massaged the feet of multiple guests, who are now raving about his talent. Gemma approaches Paul while he takes a moment to rest. Gemma (smirking) Having fun, Paul? Paul blinks a few times, slowly regaining his composure as the hypnosis starts to fade away. Paul (confused) What's going on? Why am I massaging everyone's feet? Gemma bursts into laughter, followed by Lisa and Sarah joining in. Gemma (teasingly) You were under hypnosis, my dear Paul. We told you that you were the official foot massager for the party. Paul's face turns bright red with embarrassment, realizing he was the center of their joke. Paul (grinning) Well played, ladies. You got me good this time. The party continues with an air of playful camaraderie, as everyone enjoys the absurdity of the foot massage extravaganza.

Die weite, auch kommerzielle Verbreitung wurde ab 1992 durch die Lizenzierung des Linux-Kernels unter der freien Lizenz GPL ermöglicht. Einer der Initiatoren von Linux war der finnische Programmierer Linus Torvalds. Er nimmt bis heute eine koordinierende Rolle bei der Weiterentwicklung des Linux-Kernels ein und wird auch als Benevolent Dictator for Life (deutsch „wohlwollender Diktator auf Lebenszeit“) bezeichnet., Das modular aufgebaute Betriebssystem wird von Softwareentwicklern auf der ganzen Welt weiterentwickelt, die an den verschiedenen Projekten mitarbeiten. An der Entwicklung sind Unternehmen, Non-Profit-Organisationen und viele Freiwillige beteiligt. Beim Gebrauch auf Computern kommen meist sogenannte Linux-Distributionen zum Einsatz. Eine Distribution fasst den Linux-Kernel mit verschiedener Software zu einem Betriebssystem zusammen, das für die Endnutzung geeignet ist. Dabei passen viele Distributoren und versierte Benutzer den Kernel an ihre eigenen Zwecke an., Linux wird vielfältig und umfassend eingesetzt, beispielsweise auf Arbeitsplatzrechnern, Servern, Mobiltelefonen, Routern, Notebooks, Embedded Systems, Multimedia-Endgeräten und Supercomputern. Dabei wird Linux unterschiedlich häufig genutzt: So ist Linux im Server-Markt wie auch im mobilen Bereich eine feste Größe, während es auf dem Desktop und Laptops eine noch geringe, aber wachsende Rolle spielt. Im Januar 2022 war es in Deutschland auf 4,19 % der Systeme installiert., Linux wird von zahlreichen Nutzern verwendet, darunter private Nutzer, Regierungen, Organisationen und Unternehmen., Geschichte., Entwicklungen im Vorfeld., 1983 rief Richard Stallman das GNU-Projekt ins Leben. Ziel war es, ein frei verfügbares Unix-ähnliches, POSIX-kompatibles Betriebssystem zu schaffen. Zwar war Anfang der 90er Jahre bereits eine beachtliche Menge an Software geschrieben worden, doch der eigentliche Betriebssystemkern (GNU Hurd) steckte noch in den Kinderschuhen und entwickelte sich nur langsam. Die ebenfalls freie Berkeley Software Distribution, die sich in den 80er Jahren entwickelt hatte, war in einen Rechtsstreit mit ungewissem Ausgang verwickelt und stellte aus diesem Grund ebenfalls keine Alternative als freies Betriebssystem dar. Somit stand Anfang der 90er Jahre kein vollständiges freies System zur Verfügung, das für Entwickler interessant gewesen wäre., Historische Entwicklung., 1991 begann Linus Torvalds in Helsinki (Finnland) mit der Entwicklung einer Terminal-Emulation, um unter anderem seinen eigenen Computer besser zu verstehen. Mit der Zeit merkte er, dass sich das System immer mehr zu einem Betriebssystem entwickelte; daraufhin kündigte er es in der Usenet-Themengruppe für das Betriebssystem Minix, \\"comp.os.minix\\", an. Im September desselben Jahres sollte das System dann auf einem Server den Interessierten zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Dem damaligen FTP-Server-Administrator Ari Lemmke gefiel keiner der von Torvalds vorgeschlagenen Namen \\"Freax\\" oder \\"Buggix\\", deshalb veröffentlichte er es stattdessen in einem Verzeichnis mit dem Namen Linux. Torvalds war mit diesem Namen zunächst nicht einverstanden, gab seinen Widerstand aber schnell auf, weil er nach eigener Aussage eingestehen musste, dass Linux einfach ein besserer Name war., Linux wurde zu dieser Zeit noch unter einer proprietären Lizenz von Torvalds veröffentlicht, welche die kommerzielle Nutzung verbot. Er merkte jedoch bald, dass das den Fortschritt der Entwicklung behinderte. Er wollte allen Entwicklern deutlich mehr Freiraum geben und stellte Linux deshalb im Januar 1992 unter die GNU GPL. Es war nun möglich, Linux in GNU zu integrieren und dies als das erste freie Betriebssystem zu vertreiben. Dieser Schritt machte das System für eine noch größere Zahl von Entwicklern interessanter, da er die Modifizierung und Verbreitung vereinfachte., Die Bezeichnung GNU/Linux., Die Bezeichnung Linux wurde von Torvalds anfänglich nur für den von ihm geschriebenen Kernel genutzt. Dieser wurde anfänglich auf Minix verwendet. Torvalds und die anderen Linux-Autoren lizenzierten 1992 Linux unter der GNU GPL, so dass der Kernel in GNU integriert werden konnte. Diese GNU-Variante wurde schnell zur meist genutzten Variante, da es zu dieser Zeit keinen anderen funktionsfähigen freien Kernel gab. Als Torvalds und seine Anhänger später auch das gesamte Betriebssystem als \\"Linux\\" bezeichneten, versuchte der Gründer des GNU-Projekts, Richard Stallman, bald, den Namen GNU/Linux durchzusetzen, um der Rolle von GNU eine in seinen Augen angemessene Geltung zu verschaffen. Diese Forderung stieß auf unterschiedliche Reaktionen. Während das GNU-Projekt und das Debian-Projekt den Namen annahmen, lehnten die meisten Entwickler und anderen Linux-Distributoren dies ab oder widersetzten sich deutlich. Begründet wurde dies einerseits mit Bequemlichkeit, weil der Name \\"Linux\\" als einfacher angesehen wurde, und andererseits mit dem Hinweis, dass mittlerweile eine beachtliche Menge der mit Linux ausgelieferten Software nicht aus dem GNU-Projekt stamme., Entwicklung., Die Entwicklung des Linux-Kernels wird nach wie vor von Torvalds organisiert. Er ist dafür bei der gemeinnützigen Linux Foundation angestellt. Andere wichtige Entwickler werden oft von verschiedenen Firmen bezahlt. So arbeitet z.B. Andrew Morton im Auftrag von Google am Linux-Kernel und ist im sogenannten \\"Merge Window\\" dafür zuständig, alle Änderungen zu sammeln und an Torvalds weiterzuleiten., Neben der Kernel-Entwicklung haben sich auch andere Projekte um das Betriebssystem gesammelt, die es für eine größere Nutzerzahl interessant machten. So ermöglichen grafische Benutzeroberflächen wie KDE oder Gnome einen hohen Benutzerkomfort beim Einsatz als Desktop-System. Verschiedene auf den Desktop ausgelegte Linux-Distributionen vereinfachten die Installation und Konfiguration von Linux so weit, dass sie auch von Anfängern problemlos gemeistert werden können., Eine weltweite Entwickler- und Anwendergemeinde erstellt eine Vielzahl weiterer Software und Dokumentation rund um Linux, wodurch sich die Einsatzmöglichkeiten enorm erweitert haben. Hinzu kommt, dass Hersteller proprietärer Software zunehmend einen Markt bei Linux-Anwendern erkennen und mit der Zeit immer mehr Programme für Linux anbieten. Die Entwicklung von Freier Software erfolgt dabei sowohl in selbstorganisierten Projekten, die aus ehrenamtlichen und bezahlten Entwicklern bestehen, als auch in Stiftungen, die teilweise von Unternehmen unterstützt werden. Allen Modellen ist gemeinsam, dass sie stark über das Internet vernetzt sind und dort ein Großteil der Organisation und Abstimmung stattfindet., Streit um Linux., Schon früh kam es rund um Linux zum Streit. 1992 griff Andrew S. Tanenbaum Linux wegen eines aus seiner Sicht veralteten Designs und eines zu liberalen Entwicklungsmodells an. Später kam Tanenbaum erneut ins Spiel, als Ken Brown an seinem Buch \\"Samizdat\\" schrieb und nach Anhaltspunkten suchte, dass Linux nur eine Kopie von Tanenbaums Minix sei. Tanenbaum nahm Linux diesmal in Schutz. Linux habe ein zu schlechtes Design, als dass es abgeschrieben sein könne., Anderen Streit gab es mit erklärten Konkurrenten. Schon früh wurden interne Microsoft-Dokumente (Halloween-Dokumente) bekannt, die aufzeigten, dass Microsoft annahm, Linux sei die größte Gefahr für Windows. Später begann Microsoft mit einer Kampagne, um Windows bei einer Gegenüberstellung mit Linux technisch wie wirtschaftlich gut aussehen zu lassen. Während die Community diese Kampagne recht gelassen sah, starteten vor allem Unternehmen im Linux-Umfeld Gegenkampagnen. Im Herbst 2006 aber kündigten Microsoft und Novell an, bei Interoperabilität und Patentschutz zusammenzuarbeiten, um so die Zusammenarbeit der einzelnen Produkte zu verbessern., Ein anderer Konkurrent, der Unix-Hersteller SCO, erhob wiederum 2003 den Vorwurf, dass bei IBM angestellte Linux-Entwickler Quellcode von SCOs Unix in Linux kopiert hätten. Das Verfahren wurde im Sommer 2007 eingestellt, die SCO Group hat mittlerweile Insolvenz angemeldet und wurde vom Börsenhandel ausgeschlossen. 2013 wurde eine Wiederaufnahme des Verfahrens beantragt. Im Artikel SCO gegen Linux ist der Streit chronologisch dokumentiert., Ebenfalls machte das Markenrecht Linux schon früh zu schaffen. So ließen einige Privatpersonen Mitte der 1990er Jahre den Namen Linux auf sich eintragen, was Torvalds nur mit viel Hilfe wieder rückgängig machen konnte. Er übertrug die Verwaltung der Markenrechte an das Linux Mark Institute, welches wiederum im Jahr 2005 auffiel, als es die Lizenzen für den Markenschutz auf bis zu 5.000 Dollar pro Jahr festlegte. Diese Summe brachte hauptsächlich viele an Community-Projekten beteiligte Gemüter in Wallung, woraufhin sich Torvalds genötigt fühlte, in einem offenen Brief Stellung zu nehmen und klarzustellen, dass das Geld schlichtweg benötigt werde, damit das gemeinnützig arbeitende Linux Mark Institute seine eigenen Kosten decken könne., Der Kernel., Technik., Die Bezeichnung \\"Linux\\" wurde von Linus Torvalds anfänglich nur für den Kernel genutzt, dieser stellt der Software eine Schnittstelle zur Verfügung, mit der sie auf die Hardware zugreifen kann, ohne sie genauer zu kennen. Der Linux-Kernel ist ein in der Programmiersprache C geschriebener monolithischer Kernel, wobei einige GNU-C Erweiterungen benutzt werden. Wichtige Teilroutinen sowie zeitkritische Module sind jedoch in prozessorspezifischer Assemblersprache programmiert. Der Kernel ermöglicht es, nur die für die jeweilige Hardware nötigen Treiber zu laden. Weiterhin übernimmt der Kernel auch die Zuweisung von Prozessorzeit und Ressourcen zu den einzelnen Programmen, die auf ihm gestartet werden. Bei den einzelnen technischen Vorgängen orientiert sich das Design von Linux stark an seinem Vorbild Unix., Der Linux-Kernel wurde zwischenzeitlich auf eine sehr große Anzahl von Hardware-Architekturen portiert. Das Repertoire reicht von eher exotischen Betriebsumgebungen wie dem iPAQ-Handheld-Computer, Navigationsgeräten von TomTom oder gar Digitalkameras bis hin zu Großrechnern wie IBMs System z und auch Mobiltelefonen wie dem Motorola A780 sowie Smartphones mit Betriebssystemen wie Android oder Sailfish OS auf dem Jolla. Trotz Modulkonzept blieb die monolithische Grundarchitektur erhalten. Die Orientierung der Urversion auf die verbreiteten x86-PCs führte früh dazu, verschiedenste Hardware effizient zu unterstützen und die Bereitstellung von Treibern auch unerfahrenen Programmierern zu ermöglichen. Die hervorgebrachten Grundstrukturen beflügelten die Verbreitung., Kernel-Versionen., Alle Kernel-Versionen werden auf kernel.org archiviert. Die dort zu findende Version ist der jeweilige Referenzkernel.

Sie ist Hauptort dieses Kantons und gleichzeitig des Bezirks Aarau. Die Stadt liegt 39 Kilometer südöstlich von Basel, 38km westlich von Zürich, 67km nordöstlich von Bern (jeweils Luftlinie) und ist Teil der Nordwestschweiz., \\"Die Stadt am rechten Ufer der Aare liegt am Nordrand des Schweizer Mittellandes und am Übergang zum Jura-Gebirge. Die westliche Stadtgrenze bildet gleichzeitig die Grenze zum Kanton Solothurn. Aarau zählt über 21000 Einwohner und ist damit die bevölkerungsreichste Gemeinde des Kantons. In der engen Agglomeration wohnen rund 80000 Personen, im Wirtschaftsraum Aarau gut 220000.\\", Zwischen 1240 und 1250 von den Grafen von Kyburg gegründet, erhielt Aarau im Jahr 1283 von den Habsburgern das Stadtrecht. Ab 1415 war Aarau eine Untertanenstadt Berns und nach Einführung der Reformation im Jahr 1528 einer der Tagsatzungsorte der Eidgenossenschaft. Von März bis September 1798, im ersten Jahr der Helvetischen Republik, war Aarau die erste Hauptstadt der Schweiz. Seit 1803 ist Aarau Kantonshauptstadt und erfüllt seither als bedeutendes Verwaltungs-, Handels- und Dienstleistungszentrum zahlreiche zentralörtliche Funktionen. 2010 wurde das benachbarte Rohr eingemeindet., Zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten zählen das Schlössli, heute Teil des Stadtmuseums Aarau und der Obere Turm aus dem 13. Jahrhundert, die spätgotische Stadtkirche, das Rathaus und die Altstadt mit barocken Giebelhäusern und spätgotischen Häuserreihen., Geographie., Stadtgliederung und Landschaft., Die Aarauer Altstadt steht auf einem Felskopf aus Kalkstein, der auf zwei Seiten steil abfällt, in die Flussniederung des Aaretals vorstösst und dadurch eine Engstelle bildet. Neuere Stadtquartiere erstrecken sich auf der östlich und südlich an diesen Felskopf anschliessenden Hochterrasse sowie beidseits der von Westen nach Osten fliessenden Aare. Der Fluss bildet die Grenze zwischen zwei unterschiedlich geprägten Landschaften, dem Schweizer Mittelland auf der Südseite und dem Kettenjura auf der Nordseite. Im Norden steigt das Gelände steil zum Hungerberg an, der an seiner Nordflanke vom Rombachtal begrenzt wird. Gegen Süden hin steigt die Hochterrasse allmählich zu den bewaldeten Hügelzügen Distelberg und Gönhard an, die zugleich die natürliche Grenze zum Suhrental bilden. Im Westen verläuft im Roggenhausertal und im Schachen die Grenze zum Kanton Solothurn., Durch zwei schmale Inseln wird die Aare in zwei Flussarme getrennt. Westlich der Kettenbrücke liegt die 2,3Kilometer lange Schacheninsel, östlich davon die 1,9Kilometer lange Zurlindeninsel. Beide Inseln sind durchschnittlich 50 bis 100Meter breit und entstanden durch das Ausbaggern von Gewerbekanälen. Von Südosten nach Nordwesten fliesst der Stadtbach, ein im 13.Jahrhundert angelegter künstlicher Wasserlauf. Ursprünglich durch das an mehreren Stellen an die Oberfläche tretende Grundwasser, heute auch von Suhre, Uerke und einigen Seitenbächen gespeist, durchquert er die Stadt und mündet nach vier Kilometern in die Aare. Östlich der Suhre, die bis 2009 die Gemeindegrenze zu Rohr bildete, erstreckt sich eine ausgedehnte Schotterebene. Sie ist von zahlreichen kleinen Wasserläufen durchzogen, ehemaligen Seitenarmen der einst stark mäandrierenden Aare. Nördlich von Rohr wurde 2008/09 der Hochwasserschutzdamm auf rund 900 Metern Länge zurückversetzt, um durch Überschwemmungen die einstige Flussauenlandschaft wieder entstehen zu lassen. Diese war bis in die 1930er Jahre aufgrund der Kanalisierung der Aare sukzessive zurückgedrängt worden., Die Gesamtfläche der Gemeinde beträgt 1234 Hektaren. Davon sind 400 Hektaren bewaldet und 614 Hektaren überbaut. Die angrenzenden Gemeinden im Kanton Aargau sind Erlinsbach AG im Nordwesten, Küttigen im Norden, Biberstein im Nordosten, Rupperswil im Osten, Buchs und Suhr im Südosten sowie Unterentfelden im Süden. Im Westen liegen im Kanton Solothurn die Gemeinden Eppenberg-Wöschnau und Erlinsbach SO. Die höchste Stelle ist mit der Hungerberg an der Grenze zu Küttigen, der tiefste Punkt liegt auf am Ufer der Aare nordöstlich von Rohr. Das Siedlungsgebiet von Buchs, der beiden Erlinsbach, Küttigen und Suhr ist mit jenem von Aarau zusammengewachsen., Klima., Aarau liegt in der gemässigten Klimazone. Prägend für das Klima sind einerseits Winde aus westlichen Richtungen, die oft Niederschlag heranführen, andererseits die Bise (Ost- oder Nordostwind), die meist mit Hochdrucklagen verbunden ist, aber in allen Jahreszeiten kühlere Witterungsphasen verursacht als im Mittel zu erwarten wären. Der in den Alpentälern und am Alpenrand wichtige Föhn zeigt im Normalfall keine besonderen klimatischen Auswirkungen auf Aarau., Die nächstgelegene Messstation von MeteoSchweiz befindet sich in der Nachbargemeinde Buchs auf einer Höhe von Für die Normalperiode 1991–2020 beträgt die Jahresmitteltemperatur 10,0°C. Der kälteste Monat ist der Januar mit durchschnittlich 1,2°C, der wärmste der Juli mit 19,4°C. Es gibt durchschnittlich 14,0 Hitzetage über 30°C und 14,1 Eistage unter 0°C. Die jährliche Niederschlagsmenge beträgt rund 920mm, wobei besonders in den drei Sommermonaten aufgrund der Konvektion höhere Mengen gemessen werden als während der übrigen Jahreszeiten. Das Maximum wird im Mai, Juli und August mit je 98mm erreicht, das Minimum im Februar mit 53mm., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte und Antike., In Aarau wurden verschiedene Spuren einer Besiedlung während der Jungsteinzeit gefunden, darunter eine kleine Siedlung auf dem Hungerberg. Beim heutigen Bahnhof existierte am Ende der Bronzezeit (etwa um 1000 v.Chr.) eine weitere Siedlung, bei Rohr existierten mehrere Getreidelager. Für die Latènezeit lässt sich zwar keine Besiedlung nachweisen, doch bündelten sich auf Aarauer Gemeindegebiet Wege von den Jurapässen Benkerjoch, Salhöhe und Schafmatt zu einem gemeinsamen Übergang der Aare., Die Römer nutzten den Aarauer Raum ab dem 1.Jahrhundert v.Chr. als Verkehrsknotenpunkt. Der Verlauf der Bahnhofstrasse entspricht ungefähr jenem der Römerstrasse zwischen dem Legionslager Vindonissa (Windisch) und der Stadt Aventicum (Avenches). Hier dürfte sich eine Mansio befunden haben, während im östlichen Bereich der späteren Altstadt eine Siedlung existierte. 1976 fanden Taucher in der Aare Teile einer Brücke, welche die Verbindung zu den Jurapässen herstellte. Besonders die Salhöhe, über die Augusta Raurica erreicht werden konnte, scheint eine wichtige Rolle gespielt zu haben. Eine Nebenstrasse führte ostwärts zum Vicus Lindfeld bei Lenzburg, untergeordnete Wege ins Suhrental und ins Wynental. Es gab mehrere Gutshöfe in der Nachbarschaft, beispielsweise auf dem Kirchberg bei Küttigen und bei Oberentfelden. 1919 fand man bei Bauarbeiten auf dem Areal des Kantonsspitals zahlreiche Terra-Sigillata-Keramikgefässe aus dem 2. und 3.Jahrhundert., Im Jahr 259 durchbrachen die Alamannen den Obergermanisch-Raetischen Limes, erst zwei Jahrzehnte später konnten die Römer die Kontrolle über das Gebiet zurückerlangen. Die dezimierte Bevölkerung zog weg und drängte sich andernorts in befestigte Kastelle. Auf dem Aarauer Felskopf entstand zur rückwärtigen Sicherung des Donau-Iller-Rhein-Limes eine Warte. Zu Beginn des 5.Jahrhunderts zogen sich die Römer endgültig zurück., Entstehung der Stadt., Die Alamannen begannen sich zu Beginn des 7.Jahrhunderts dauerhaft niederzulassen und gründeten eine dörfliche Siedlung, die mehrere hundert Jahre später den Namen «zen Husen» (bei den Häusern) trug und aus der sich die Vordere Vorstadt entwickelte. Im Oberholz am Distelberg wurde im 9.Jahrhundert Eisenerz abgebaut. Im 10. und 11.Jahrhundert entstand im heutigen Telliquartier, an einer Furt über die Aare, eine Kirche, deren Reste 1936 bei Bauarbeiten zum Vorschein kamen und 1959/60 genauer untersucht wurden. In der zweiten Hälfte des 13.Jahrhunderts scheint die Kirche sorgfältig abgetragen worden zu sein, nur das Fundament blieb erhalten. Um 1236/37 entstand das Schlössli, eine Turmburg am Rande eines weiteren Siedlungsschwerpunktes. Dieser gehörte zu Beginn des 13.Jahrhunderts zusammen mit Buchs und Rohr zu einem von Suhr aus verwalteten Twing. Landesherren waren die Kyburger, die im Jahr 1173 das Erbe der Lenzburger angetreten hatten und sowohl über die Blutgerichtsbarkeit als auch über die niedere Gerichtsbarkeit verfügten., Zwischen 1240 und 1250 gründeten die Kyburger Grafen Hartmann IV. und Hartmann V. auf dem Felskopf über der Aare die Stadt Aarau. Der früheste Beleg des Ortsnamens stammt aus dem Jahr 1248 \\"(Arowe)\\". Er setzt sich zusammen aus dem Flussnamen Aare (in den ältesten Belegen \\"Arula, Arola, Araris\\") und dem Wort Au (mhd. \\"ouwe,\\" ahd. \\"ouwa\\" ‚Land am Wasser‘). Der älteste gesicherte Hinweis auf das Bestehen einer städtischen Siedlung stammt aus dem Jahr 1256. Vierzehn Jahre später wurde das Kloster St. Ursula gegründet, eine Filiale des Damenstiftes Schänis. Der «Turm Rore» diente als Sitz des kyburgischen Amtsmannes. Im letzten Viertel des 13.Jahrhunderts entstand auch der Vorgängerbau der Stadtkirche, Aarau blieb aber bis 1568 Teil der Grosspfarrei Suhr., 1263 erlosch das Geschlecht der Kyburger. Agnes von Kyburg, die keine männlichen Verwandten mehr hatte, verkaufte 1273 die gesamten Ländereien an ihren Patenonkel Rudolf I. von Habsburg. Am 4.März 1283 hielt er in Luzern einen Hoftag ab. Dabei bestätigte er das bereits geltende Marktrecht und verlieh Aarau zusätzlich das Stadtrecht. Es basierte auf dem Stadtrecht Winterthurs von 1264, beinhaltete aber einige Einschränkungen. So durften die Aarauer den Schultheissen vorerst nicht selbst bestimmen. 1301 gaben sie sich eine autonome Satzung. 1337 erreichten die Stadtbürger bei Herzog Albrecht II. die Abschaffung der Steuervorrechte des Adels, steuerfrei blieb einzig der Turm Rore als herrschaft: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Aarau, Hauptstadt, Kantons, Schweiz, Aare, Kanton Aargau, Stadtrecht, Mittelland, Stadtquartiere, Agglomeration"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Das Gewicht liegt zwischen 1,1 und 4,5Kilogramm. Damit ist der Ferkelskunk etwa gleich groß wie oder etwas größer als der Streifenskunk (\\"Mephitis mephitis\\"). Der Körper ist massig und schwerer gebaut als der anderer Skunk-Arten, der Schwanz in der Relation zum Körper vergleichsweise kurz., Von anderen Skunk-Arten kann der Ferkelskunk vor allem durch seine Fellfarbe unterschieden werden. Es ist schwarz mit einem einzelnen breiten weißen Streifen, der sich vom Kopf über die Schultern und den Rücken bis über den Schwanz zieht. Der Streifen beginnt mit einem keilförmigen Fleck auf dem Kopf und verbreitert sich nahe der Schultern auf etwa die halbe Rückenbreite. Von dort aus kann er sich weiter verbreitern und fast den gesamten Rücken einnehmen, er kann jedoch auf Rücken und Rumpf auch schmaler werden oder teilweise ganz fehlen. Im Nordwesten des Verbreitungsgebietes sind die Tiere häufig durch einen fast vollständigen weißen Rücken gekennzeichnet. Der Schwanz ist oben fast vollständig weiß, kann unten jedoch am Ansatz noch schwarze Anteile besitzen. Diese Färbung, bestehend aus einer schwarzen Grundfärbung mit einem einzigen breiten Streifen auf dem Rücken ist einzigartig unter den Skunks. Ferkelskunks sind zudem die einzigen Skunks ohne einen weißen Fleck oder Streifen zwischen den Augen, das Gesicht ist entsprechend vollständig schwarz. Die Schnauze ist vergleichsweise lang und der Nasenspiegel ist mit einer Breite von etwa 2 und einer Länge von 2 bis zu 6Zentimeter relativ groß; beim Streifenskunk ist er etwa ein Drittel so breit. Er ist unbehaart und die Nase ähnelt in ihrer Form der eines kleinen Schweines, was zu der deutschen Namensgebung „Ferkelskunk“ sowie der englischsprachigen Benennung „hog-nosed skunk“ führte. Die Augen sind klein, die Ohren abgerundet und mit einer Länge von 0,8 bis 3,6Zentimetern ebenfalls klein ausgebildet. Die Beine sind kurz und stämmig und enden in einem plantigraden Fuß, der die Ferkelskunks wie alle Skunks als Sohlengänger kennzeichnet. Die Hinterfüße mit einer Länge von 2,2 bis 9Zentimetern sind breit und groß, die Sohle ist etwa bis zur Hälfte des Fußes unbehaart. Die Vorderfüße sind mit vergleichsweise langen Krallen versehen, die den Tieren das Graben und Klettern ermöglichen., Wie andere Skunks besitzt auch der Ferkelskunk gut ausgebildete Stinkdrüsen, die unterhalb der Schwanzbasis nahe dem Anus liegen. Sie enthalten ein übelriechendes Sekret, das zur Abwehr benutzt wird. Die Hauptbestandteile des Wehrsekrets sind 2-Buten-1-thiol (ein Thiol) und (E)-2-Butenylthioacetat (ein Thiolester). Hinzu kommen Phenyl-Methanthiol, 2-Methylchinolin, 2-Chinolin-Methanthiol und bis-(E)-2-Butenyl-Disulfid als Nebenbestandteile., Schädel- und Skelettmerkmale., Der Schädel des Ferkelskunks ist allgemein flach, aber etwas höher als bei verwandten Arten, besonders im Bereich der Schläfenbeine (\\"Ossa temporalia\\"). Er hat eine Basallänge von 58 bis 85, durchschnittlich 73 Millimetern und eine maximale Breite im Bereich der Jochbögen von 36 bis 57, durchschnittlich 43 Millimetern. Er besitzt sehr groß ausgeschnittene Nasenlöcher, die Zwischenkieferknochen (Praemaxillare) sind auf einen schmalen und gebogenen Stab reduziert. Der knöcherne Gaumen endet hinter den oberen Backenzähnen. Die Nasenbeine und die Oberkieferknochen enden auf der gleichen Höhe und die postorbitale Einschnürung, eine Einschnürung hinter den Augen, ist nur schwach ausgebildet. Die Paukenblase ist nicht abgeflacht., Die Zahnreihe im Oberkiefer ist 19 bis 27, durchschnittlich 23 Millimeter lang. Der Skunk besitzt drei Schneidezähne (\\"Incisivi\\"), einen Eckzahn (\\"Caninus\\"), zwei Vorbackenzähne (\\"Praemolares\\") und einen Backenzähne (\\"Molares\\") in einer Oberkieferhälfte und drei Schneidezähne, einen Eckzahn, drei Vorbackenzähne und zwei Backenzähne in einer Unterkieferhälfte. Insgesamt besitzen die Tiere somit 32 Zähne., Genetik., Der Ferkelskunk hat einen einfachen Chromosomensatz (n) von 23 und einen diploiden Chromosomensatz von 2n=46, er besitzt also insgesamt 46Chromosomen in jeder Zelle. Dabei sind 38 Chromosomen metazentrisch oder submetazentrisch und 6Chromosomen akrozentrisch. Das X-Chromosom ist metazentrisch, das Y-Chromosom subtelozentrisch und sehr klein, es enthält viel verdichtetes Chromatin (Heterochromatin). Die C-Banden, die sich durch die Färbung der Chromosomen ergeben, liegen im Bereich der Centromere, bei den Chromosomen 16, 19 und dem Y-Chromosom existieren allerdings große pericentromere C-Banden., Für die mitochondriale DNA sowie dem Cytochrom-b-Bereich der Kern-DNA liegen Sequenzdaten vor, die für phylogenetische Analysen benutzt wurden und die Position des Ferkelskunks innerhalb der Skunks sowie die Monophylie der Skunks als Taxon belegen. Innerhalb der Art wurde über den Vergleich der bekannten Kern-DNA-Sequenzen eine genetische Divergenz der östlichen zu den westlichen Populationen des Ferkelskunks von 0,98Prozent festgestellt., Verbreitung., Das Verbreitungsgebiet des Ferkelskunks zieht sich von den südlichen Vereinigten Staaten über Mexiko bis nach Mittelamerika hin, wo er in Honduras, Guatemala und Costa Rica bis in das nördliche Nicaragua vorkommt. In den Vereinigten Staaten wurde die Art in den Bundesstaaten Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona und New Mexico dokumentiert, in Mexiko in Zacatecas, Sinaloa, Sonora, Oaxaca, Coahuila, Colima, Veracruz und Michoacán. Innerhalb der Gattung der Weißrüsselskunks hat der Ferkelskunk damit das am weitesten im Norden liegende Verbreitungsgebiet und er ist die einzige Art, die in Mittelamerika und in den Vereinigten Staaten vorkommt., Die Art kommt in zahlreichen Lebensräumen vor, darunter in steinigen Trocken- und Berggebieten, Grasland, Canyons und Flussbetten, tropischen Bereichen und Küstengebieten. Sie fehlt in Wüstengebieten sowie im tropischen Regenwald. Vor allem in Mexiko wurde die Art in unterschiedlichsten Lebensräumen nachgewiesen, von Trockengebieten in nördlichen und östlichen Zacatecas bis hin zu tropischen Regionen, Bergwäldern und Küstenstreifen in San Luis Potosi, Akazienwäldern in Veracruz, Dornwäldern und Flussufern in Tamaulipas sowie Kiefer-Eichen-Wäldern in den San Carlos Mountains. Auch in Texas variieren die Lebensräume; die Tiere kommen in Buschland und natürlichem Grasland, das zum großen Teil zur Viehzucht genutzt wird, im Kleberg County sowie in dornbusch- und kakteendominierten Regionen im Süden von Texas vor. Die Höhenverbreitung kann bis etwa 2750Meter in den Graham Mountains oder bis 3050Meter in Mexiko reichen., Lebensweise., Ferkelskunks leben als Einzelgänger, nur die Weibchen bleiben bis zum Spätsommer mit den Jungtieren zusammen. Sie sind nachtaktiv, besonders im Winter gehen sie jedoch auch tagsüber in warmen Tageszeiten auf Nahrungssuche. Die heißen Tage verbringen Ferkelskunks in unterirdisch angelegten Bauten, unter Gebüschen oder in Steinspalten. Ihre Brutbauten legen sie in hohlen Baumstämmen und Baumwurzeln, in Hohlräumen unter großen Felsen und in Steinhaufen an. Sie können jedoch auch in Höhlen, Minen oder in Nestern von Baumratten vorkommen. Dabei nutzen die Tiere sowohl verlassene Bauten anderer Tiere wie auch selbst angelegte., Innerhalb des Verbreitungsgebietes kommt der Ferkelskunk in weiten Teilen sympatrisch mit drei weiteren Skunk-Arten vor, dem Streifenskunk (\\"Mephitis mephitis\\"), dem Haubenskunk (\\"Mephitis macroura\\") und regional dem Westlichen Fleckenskunk (\\"Spilogale gracilis\\") oder dem Östlichen Fleckenskunk (\\"Spilogale putorius\\"). Diese Arten nutzen häufig die gleichen Bauten und andere Ressourcen, unterscheiden sich jedoch beispielsweise in der Nahrungszusammensetzung., Bei Bedrohung versucht der Ferkelskunk zu fliehen und sich zu verstecken. Dabei kann er auch die Offensive ergreifen und auf seinen Hinterbeinen stehend drohend einige Schritte auf den Angreifer zugehen. Bleibt das erfolglos, lässt er sich abrupt wieder auf seine Vorderbeine fallen und stößt einen lauten Zischlaut als Warnung aus. Danach zieht er seine Hinterbeine unter den Körper, wirft Dreck in Richtung des Angreifers, zeigt seine Zähne und tritt hart mit den Vorderbeinen auf den Boden. Dabei hebt er seinen Schwanz und legt ihn flach auf seinen Rücken. Wird er nun angegriffen, beißt er zu und besprüht den Angreifer mit dem stark übelriechenden Wehrsekret aus seinen Analdrüsen. Dieses kann er sowohl in einem gezielten Strahl als auch als Nebel versprühen, abhängig von der Position und Größe des Gegners. Bei der Flucht sucht der Skunk Deckung und zieht sich in dorniges Kakteengestrüpp zurück, zudem kann er auf Bäume klettern, um potenziellen Angreifern zu entkommen., Ernährung., Ferkelskunks ernähren sich insbesondere von Insekten, wobei deren Anteil an der Nahrung bei dieser Art höher ist als bei allen anderen Arten der Skunks. Sie finden ihre Beutetiere, indem sie mit der Schnauze und den Vorderfüßen im Boden vor allem nach Larven graben. Als opportunistische Allesfresser können sich die Tiere jedoch mit wechselnden Anteilen von Früchten und anderen Pflanzenteilen oder kleinen Wirbeltieren ernähren, wenn nicht ausreichend Insekten vorhanden sind. Wasser nehmen die Skunks in der Regel über die Nahrung auf, insbesondere in Texas und Mexiko wurden Ferkelskunks nur sehr selten beim Trinken beobachtet., Fortpflanzung., Die Paarungszeit des Ferkelskunks reicht vom späten Februar bis Mär: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Skunks, Ferkelskunk, Weißrüsselskunks, Stinktiere, Allesfresser, Verbreitungsgebiet, Bestandsrückgänge, Merkmale, Fellfarbe, Stinkdrüsen"},{"instruction":"write a half-page introduction section of a ''study correlation of signs of sepsis with procalcitonin results in a neonatal unit''. Cite and Include references not more than 5 years old in APA format","output":"Introduction: Sepsis is a severe and life-threatening condition that arises due to the body's overwhelming response to infection. Neonates, particularly those admitted to the neonatal unit, are at a heightened risk of sepsis due to their immature immune systems and prolonged exposure to invasive procedures and hospital environments. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is crucial in designing appropriate treatment strategies and preventing adverse outcomes in these vulnerable patients. Traditionally, the diagnosis of sepsis in neonates has relied on clinical signs and symptoms, combined with laboratory tests such as complete blood counts (CBC) and blood cultures. However, these conventional approaches often lack specificity and sensitivity, leading to delays in diagnosis, unnecessary antibiotic usage, and potential harm to the neonates. Therefore, there is a growing need for reliable and rapid biomarkers that can aid in the early identification of sepsis in this population. Procalcitonin (PCT) has emerged as a promising biomarker for sepsis diagnosis in neonates. It is a prohormone of calcitonin, which is produced in response to systemic bacterial infections. PCT levels have been observed to rise rapidly in the blood during sepsis, making it a potentially useful tool for early detection. Several studies have investigated the correlation between PCT levels and signs of sepsis in neonates, but the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, further research is needed to establish the relationship between PCT levels and specific clinical signs of sepsis in the neonatal population. This study aims to investigate the correlation between signs of sepsis and procalcitonin results in a neonatal unit. By examining the association between PCT levels and clinical manifestations of sepsis, we hope to determine the utility of PCT as a diagnostic marker and its potential to improve timely identification and management of sepsis in neonates. We will also explore the predictive value of PCT in differentiating sepsis from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). To achieve these objectives, we will prospectively collect data from neonates admitted to a neonatal unit over a specified period. We will assess PCT levels using commercially available assays and record clinical signs of sepsis such as temperature instability, poor feeding, respiratory distress, and abnormal laboratory values. Additionally, we will compare PCT levels between culture-proven septic neonates and those with suspected but culture-negative sepsis. This study is important as it may provide valuable insights into the use of PCT as a diagnostic marker in neonatal sepsis, potentially guiding clinicians in their decision-making process. It may also contribute to the ongoing efforts to optimize sepsis management strategies in neonates and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this critical condition. References: 1.

Sie führt von der Landeshauptstadt Linz über die Bezirksstadt Eferding nach Neumarkt im Hausruckkreis. In Niederspaching zweigt eine Stichstrecke nach Peuerbach ab. Der seit 1908 bestehende, eigenständige Streckenteil Neumarkt – Waizenkirchen – Peuerbach wurde 1998 der Linzer Lokalbahn angegliedert. Mit einem modernen Fahrzeugpark werden jährlich etwa 1,6Millionen Fahrgäste befördert. Die Lokalbahn ist die bedeutendste der von der Betreibergesellschaft Stern &amp; Hafferl unterhaltenen Bahnen. Sie erschließt das landwirtschaftlich und touristisch bedeutende Gebiet westlich der Stadt Linz an der Donau., Seit 11. Dezember 2016 ist die Linzer Lokalbahn im Abschnitt Linz–Eferding als S 5 Teil der S-Bahn Oberösterreich., Geschichte., Anfänge., Eines der frühesten Bahnprojekte nach Errichtung der wichtigsten Hauptstrecken in Oberösterreich hatte zum Ziel, die Regionen Eferding, Aschach, Waizenkirchen und Peuerbach mit der oberösterreichischen Landeshauptstadt Linz zu verbinden. Bereits Anfang der 1880er Jahre gab es Bestrebungen, eine solche Lokalbahn zu bauen. Nach Eröffnung der Westbahn folgten rasch weitere Planungen für von Wels ausgehende Lokalbahnen. Die Strecke Wels – Haiding – Aschach an der Donau wurde bereits am 20. August 1886 fertiggestellt. Die Betriebsführung dieser Bahn oblag der Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl aus Gmunden. Diese Lokalbahn zweigte von der Staatsbahn nach Passau bei der Station Haiding ab und verband das fruchtbare Eferdinger Becken und den Aschachwinkel mit dem österreichischen Staatsbahnnetz und der Stadt Wels., Wegen dieser bereits vorhandenen Lokalbahn und Unstimmigkeiten zwischen Wels und Linz konnte das Projekt jahrelang nicht verwirklicht werden. Deshalb wurde ein Aktionskomitee unter dem Vorsitz des kaiserlichen Rats Mathias Poche gebildet. 24 weitere namhafte Persönlichkeiten, darunter auch der Linzer Bürgermeister und der Landeshauptmann-Stellvertreter, gehörten dem Komitee an, das sich zur Aufgabe stellte, eine Bahnverbindung zwischen der Landeshauptstadt Linz und Eferding herzustellen. Als Option wurde eine Verlängerung der Bahn nach Waizenkirchen und eventuell bis Neumarkt im Hausruckkreis mit einer Abzweigung nach Peuerbach ins Auge gefasst., Nach vehementem Widerstand der Stadt Wels legte das Aktionskomitee einen Alternativplan vor, der eine von der Station Eferding abzweigende Lokalbahn über Haiding (bei Aschach) nach Aschach an der Donau in die eine Richtung und über Waizenkirchen nach Peuerbach in die andere Richtung vorsah – dagegen gab es keine Einwände. Am 6. und 7. Juli 1900 tagte das \\"Trassenrevision- und Stations-Comitee\\" über dieses Projekt, und, obwohl die Vertreter der Städte Wels und Linz dem Projekt zustimmten, scheiterte die Verwirklichung am Veto der \\"Welser Lokalbahngesellschaft\\". Vertreter von Waizenkirchen fassten daraufhin den Plan, eine von Eferding unabhängige Bahnverbindung zwischen Waizenkirchen und Neumarkt-Kallham entlang der Staatsbahnlinie Wels–Passau mit einer Abzweigung nach Peuerbach zu bauen. Zur Projektausarbeitung wurde wiederum ein eigenes Komitee ins Leben gerufen. Da es gegen dieses Projekt keinerlei Einwände gab, erteilten die Behörden am 13. Oktober 1907 eine Konzession für den \\"„Bau einer mit elektrischer Kraft zu betreibenden normalspurigen Lokalbahn, von der Staatsbahnstation Neumarkt-Kallham nach Waizenkirchen, mit einer Abzweigung nach Peuerbach“\\"., Lokalbahn Neumarkt–Waizenkirchen–Peuerbach., Diese Konzession führte noch im selben Jahr zur Gründung der \\"Neumarkt–Waizenkirchen–PeuerbachAG\\". Der Bau der Bahn begann ein Jahr später im Mai 1908. Die Projektierung und Bauleitung führte die Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl aus, die in Waizenkirchen, Peuerbach und Niederspaching Stationsgebäude errichten ließ. In Niederspaching und Peuerbach wurde jeweils eine Fahrzeugremise errichtet. Die Stromversorgung wurde durch ein in Niederspaching errichtetes Umformerwerk gesichert. Die gesamte elektrische Ausrüstung dieser Lokalbahn lieferte die AEG-Union. Alle für die Betriebsaufnahme gebauten Fahrzeuge stammten von der Grazer Waggonfabrik. Nach mehreren Monaten Bauzeit konnte die Bahn am 18. Dezember 1908 eröffnet werden., 1919 war eine Fortsetzung der Strecke von Peuerbach nach Neukirchen am Walde sowie nach Engelhartszell geplant. Hr.Fuchsing aus Schärding gründete ein Aktionskomitee, um diesen Ausbau zu verwirklichen. Am 24. Februar 1927 fand eine Versammlung mit etwa 300 Teilnehmern statt. Da die für den Ausbau erforderlichen Geldmittel nicht aufgebracht werden konnten, wurde dieses Projekt nicht realisiert., Lokalbahn Linz–Eferding–Waizenkirchen., 1907 tagte das Aktionskomitee, das für den Bau des eigentlichen Lokalbahnprojektes ins Leben gerufen worden war, erneut. Ingenieur Josef Stern erreichte dabei, dass statt des ursprünglich geplanten Dampfbetriebs die Strecke elektrisch betrieben werden sollte, und erklärte sich bereit, hierüber ein Detailprojekt auf eigenes Risiko und eigene Kosten auszuarbeiten. Dieses Projekt erhielt nach einer Überprüfung der k.k.Staatsbahn-Direktion Linz ein Baukapital von 3,5Mio. Kronen (knapp 9,5Mio. Euro). Die Vorschläge von Josef Stern wurden bei einer Sitzung am 4. Mai 1909 angenommen und ein Finanzierungsplan mit dem Ziel erstellt, die Bahn ohne staatliche Subventionen betreiben zu können. Darüber hinaus sollte die Finanzierung mit einer Anleihe von 1,2Mio. Kronen, Stammaktien um 200.000 Kronen sowie Prioritätsaktien im Wert von 2,1Mio. Kronen erfolgen. Die Stadt Linz kaufte nach dem Gemeinderatsbeschluss vom 17. November 1909 Prioritätsaktien im Wert von 1,5Mio. Kronen. Weitere Aktien wurden von verschiedenen angrenzenden Orten und der Allgemeinen Sparkasse Linz erworben. Der Landtag unterstützte die Bahn mit dem Kauf von Stammaktien im Umfang von 200.000 Kronen., Die Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl erklärte sich bereit, den Bau der Bahn zu übernehmen und den Betrieb zwölf Jahre lang gegen eine Zahlung von 50Heller pro Zugkilometer zu führen. Somit waren alle Bedingungen für eine Konzessionserteilung beim k.k.Eisenbahnministerium erfüllt., Vom 6. bis 17. Oktober sowie vom 9. bis 15. Dezember 1908 wurde eine politische Begehung durchgeführt. Zwei Jahre nach dieser Begehung ordnete das Eisenbahnministerium die Konzessionsverhandlungen an., Bahnbau und Eröffnung., Nachdem am 12. Jänner 1911 die im Reichsgesetzblatt vom 25. Jänner 1911 verlautbarte Konzession zum Bau und Betrieb „der normalspurigen Lokalbahn von Linz über Eferding nach Waizenkirchen“ erteilt worden war, begann am 1. Dezember desselben Jahres der Bau der Lokalbahn., Die Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl gab Obligationen im Wert von 1,2Mio. Kronen in Zahlung, neben denen auch noch einige Prioritätsaktien gekauft wurden. Die Obligationen wandelte man nach der Eröffnung der Lokalbahn in Aktien um. Das knappe Investitionskapital zwang die Bauleitung unter Ingenieur Josef Stern, den Bau so sparsam wie möglich durchzuführen. Deshalb wurde der Ausgangspunkt der Lokalbahn in Linz, die \\"Lokalbahnstation\\", auf Pachtgrund der Staatsbahn errichtet. Es entstand ein Kopfbahnhof mit zwei Bahnsteiggleisen und einem Nebengleis. Diese als Provisorium gedachte Anlage hielt sich bemerkenswerterweise bis 2005. Nach der polizeitechnischen Überprüfung am 22. Dezember 1911 konnte das erste Teilstück Linz – Eferding am 21. März 1912 in Betrieb genommen werden. Eine offizielle feierliche Einweihung gab es nicht. Weitere Bahnhöfe wurden in Alkoven, Eferding, Prambachkirchen und Waizenkirchen errichtet. An 15 Haltestellen entstanden zudem hölzerne Wartehäuschen., Umformerwerke in Dörnbach, Eferding und Waizenkirchen sicherten die Versorgung der Bahn mit Gleichstrom mit einer Spannung von 750V. Eine Remise mit Werkstätte für Wartungen und Reparaturen an den Triebfahrzeugen entstand in Eferding. Auf der gesamten Strecke wurden Vignolschienen auf Holzschwellen verlegt und Holzmasten zum Tragen der Oberleitung aufgestellt. Die gesamte elektrische Ausrüstung stammte von den Siemens-Schuckertwerken in Wien. Die Strecke war ursprünglich für eine Achslast von maximal 11Tonnen und einer Höchstgeschwindigkeit von 30km/h ausgelegt., Der weiterführende Bau des Teilstücks Eferding – Waizenkirchen kam nicht ganz reibungslos voran. Ein verregneter Sommer und schwieriges Terrain bescherten viele Probleme. Trotz dieser Schwierigkeiten konnte das Teilstück termingerecht fertiggestellt werden. Die behördliche Überprüfung fand am 10. Dezember 1912 statt., Die Linzer Tages-Post blickte in einer Ausgabe vom 13. Dezember 1912 auf den Bau zurück und berichtete über die Fertigstellung:, Betrieb in den Anfangsjahren., Für den Betrieb der Bahn wurden vier Motorwagen, vier Beiwagen, vier Arbeitswagen, 16Güterwagen und eine Elektrolokomotive bei der \\"Grazer Waggonfabrik\\" in Auftrag gegeben. Nach der Fertigstellung des zweiten Teilstücks wurde die Lokalbahn Linz – Eferding – Waizenkirchen am 16. Dezember 1912 feierlich eröffnet. Am 1. Jänner 1913 übernahm Stern &amp; Hafferl die Betriebsführung einschließlich der Stromlieferung. Die Betriebsleitung befand sich in Eferding., Eine Fahrt von Linz nach Waizenkirchen dauerte 1912 zirka 130 Minuten. 1912 wurde eine umfangreiche Übersicht aufgestellt, die über die Tarife von Personen- und Güterfahrten aller Art Auskunft gab. Demnach kostete eine einfache Fahrt von Linz nach Eferding 1,50Kronen, bis Waizenkirchen 2,50Kronen (beides in der 3.Klasse). Für die 2.Klasse musste man den doppelten Preis bezahlen. Eine Hin- und Rückfahrt kostete das Doppelte einer einfachen Fahrt. Beim Güterverkehr gab es zahlreiche verschiedene Frachtxadklassen. Der Transport einer Wagenladung Holz oder Steine nach Eferding kostete 32Kronen. Im ersten vollen Betriebsjahr 1913 wurden 202.445 Personen und 11.825 Tonnen Güter transportiert, was als wirtschaftlicher Erfolg betrachtet wurde., Kriegsjahre, Krise und Aufschwung., Der Erste Weltkrieg brachte zunächst keinen Rückgang der Beförderungszahlen, die Fahrzeuge wurden allerdings durch den desolaten Zustand der Gleisanlagen und des Unterba: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

ABCC11 findet sich vor allem in apokrinen Drüsen, also Duftdrüsen, die zum Beispiel in den Haarfollikeln enden. Das korrespondierende \\"ABCC11\\"-Gen wurde bisher nur bei einigen Säugetierarten – einschließlich des Menschen – gefunden. Beim Menschen liegt es auf Chromosom 16. Eine Vielzahl von Menschen, speziell im nordostasiatischen Raum, verfügt über kein funktionsfähiges ABCC11. Die Ursache hierfür ist eine Punktmutation im \\"ABCC11\\"-Gen. Die beiden Genotypen führen zu sichtbar unterschiedlichen Merkmalen (phänotypische Variation). So haben Menschen, bei denen beide \\"ABCC11\\"-Gene auf dem entsprechenden Chromosomenpaar die Mutation aufweisen, beispielsweise weißes, trockenes Ohrenschmalz und einen nur schwachen Körpergeruch. Der Wildtyp mit zwei „normalen“ \\"ABCC11\\"-Genen und der heterozygote Typ mit einem defekten \\"ABCC11\\"-Gen haben dagegen gelbliches, feuchtes Ohrenschmalz und einen deutlicher ausgeprägten Körpergeruch. Der Gendefekt wird rezessiv vererbt. Die regionale Häufigkeit der Punktmutation liefert wichtige Indizien zur Ausbreitung des Menschen über die Erde und die Durchmischung verschiedener Populationen., Genetik., Das \\"ABCC11\\"-Gen befindet sich beim Menschen auf Chromosom 16, Genlocus q12.1. Die genomischen Koordinaten (nach GRCh37) sind 16:48.200.781–48.281.478. Das Gen besteht somit aus 80.697 Basenpaaren (bp). Diese untergliedern sich in 30 Exons., Im Jahr 2001 wurde \\"ABCC11\\" von drei Arbeitsgruppen unabhängig voneinander erstmals aus der cDNA-Bibliothek von einer humanen Leber isoliert. In unmittelbarer Nähe, auf demselben Genlocus und nur etwa 20 kbp voneinander getrennt, liegt – in Schwanz-an-Kopf-Orientierung zu \\"ABCC11\\" – das \\"ABCC12\\"-Gen. Beide Gene weisen untereinander und zu \\"ABCC3\\" und \\"ABCC5\\" eine hohe Ähnlichkeit auf. Auch sie besitzen zwei ATP-bindende Kassetten und zwölf transmembrane Helices., Das \\"ABCC11\\"-Gen wurde bisher nur bei Säugetieren gefunden. Durch Klonierung konnte es bisher bei folgenden Arten nachgewiesen werden (Stand: September 2014):, Mensch (\\"Homo sapiens\\"),, Gemeiner Schimpanse (\\"Pan troglodytes\\"),, Westlicher Flachlandgorilla (\\"Gorilla gorilla gorilla\\"),, Sumatra-Orang-Utan (\\"Pongo abelii\\"),, Nördlicher Weißwangen-Schopfgibbon (\\"Nomascus leucogenys\\"),, Rhesusaffe (\\"Macaca mulatta\\"),, Weißbüschelaffe (\\"Callithrix jacchus\\"),, Philippinen-Koboldmaki (\\"Tarsius syrichta\\"),, Kleinohr-Riesengalago (\\"Otolemur garnettii\\"),, Wildkaninchen (\\"Oryctolagus cuniculus\\"),, Nördliches Spitzhörnchen (\\"Tupaia belangeri\\"),, Afrikanischer Elefant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\"),, Kleiner Igeltenrek (\\"Echinops telfairi\\"),, Haushund (\\"Canis familiaris\\"),, Frettchen (\\"Mustela putorius furo\\"),, Großer Panda (\\"Ailuropoda melanoleuca\\"),, Hauskatze (\\"Felis catus\\"),, Großer Tümmler (\\"Tursiops truncatus\\"),, Hausrind (\\"Bos taurus\\"),, Hausschaf (\\"Ovis aries\\"),, Alpaka (\\"Vicugna pacos\\"),, Braunbrustigel (\\"Erinaceus europaeus\\"),, Waldspitzmaus (\\"Sorex araneus\\"),, Hauspferd (\\"Equus caballus\\"),, Beutelteufel (\\"Sarcophilus harrisii\\"),, Schnabeltier (\\"Ornithorhynchus anatinus\\") und, Derbywallaby (\\"Macropus eugenii\\")., Bei den Modellorganismen Ratte und Maus gibt es kein dem humanen \\"ABCC11\\" entsprechendes Gen (orthologes Gen). \\"ABCC11\\" ist ein paraloges Gen, das im Laufe der Evolution durch Genverdopplung aus \\"ABCC12\\" entstanden ist. Zum humanen \\"ABCC12\\" gibt es bei Nagetieren und vielen anderen Tieren die entsprechenden orthologen Gene., Mittels Transkriptionsanalyse wurde festgestellt, dass die mRNA von \\"ABCC11\\" in allen adulten und fetalen Geweben exprimiert wird. Besonders große Mengen an ABCC11-mRNA finden sich in Brustkrebs-Gewebe., Proteomik., Das \\"ABCC11\\"-Gen kodiert für ein aus 1382 Aminosäuren bestehendes Protein, dessen Sequenz zu etwa 47 % identisch mit MRP9, dem Genprodukt von \\"ABCC12\\", ist. Eine Spleißvariante von \\"ABCC11\\" (Variante A) führt zu einem Genprodukt mit 1344 Aminosäuren. Ursache hierfür ist der vollständige Ausfall von Exon 28. Variante A hat ebenfalls zwölf transmembrane Helices, allerdings fehlen an der zweiten ATP-bindenden Kassette 38 Aminosäuren in den Positionen 1261 bis 1298. Diese Variante wird zu etwa 25 % von den Zellen exprimiert., Funktion., ABCC11 ist ein Membrantransporter (veraltet: Effluxpumpe). Dies sind membranständige Transportproteine, die bestimmte, für den Transporter spezifische Moleküle (Substrate) aus der Zelle oder einem Zellkompartiment hinaus befördern. ABCC11 gehört zur Familie der ABC-Transporter (ABC = ). Diese Membranproteine haben als gemeinsames Strukturelement mindestens eine ATP-bindende Kassette (ATP = Adenosintriphosphat). Ist die Konzentration eines Substrates außerhalb der Zelle höher als innerhalb, so muss für den Transportvorgang gegen diesen Konzentrationsgradienten Energie aufgewendet werden. Im Fall der ABC-Transporter geschieht dies durch Bindung und Hydrolyse des zellulären Energieträgers ATP, in der ATP-bindenden Kassette., Das menschliche Genom umfasst 48 ABC-Transporter, die in drei Unterfamilien (ABCA, ABCB und ABCC) unterteilt sind. Die ABCC-Unterfamilie hat zehn Mitglieder, die Multidrug Resistance-Related Proteine (MRP). Ein wichtiger ABCC-Transporter ist beispielsweise (CFTR), das Schlüsselprotein bei der Erbkrankheit Mukoviszidose., Substrate für ABCC11 sind lipophile Anionen. Dazu gehören unter anderem cyclische Nukleotid-Monophosphate (cNMP) wie cyclisches Adenosinmonophosphat (cAMP) und cyclisches Guanosinmonophosphat (cGMP), Glutathion-Konjugate wie beispielsweise Leukotrien C4 und 2,4-Dinitrophenyl-\\"S\\"-Glutathion (DNP-SG), Steroid-Sulfate wie beispielsweise Estron-3-Sulfat (E13S) und Dehydroepiandrosteron-3-Sulfat (DHEAS), Glucuronide wie beispielsweise Estradiol-17-β-D-Glucuronid, die Gallensäuren Glyco- und Taurocholsäure sowie Folsäure. Die verwandten Transporter ABCC4 und ABCC5 weisen eine hohe strukturelle Ähnlichkeit zu ABCC11 auf. Folglich haben alle drei sehr ähnliche Zielsubstrate., Das ABCC11-Protein wird vor allem in den Epithelzellen der apokrinen Schweißdrüsen (\\"Glandulae sudoriferae apocrinae\\") exprimiert. Die apokrinen Schweißdrüsen, die auch als ‚Duftdrüsen‘ bezeichnet werden, befinden sich beim Menschen in Bereichen behaarter Haut, vor allem in den Achselhöhlen, im Genital- und Analbereich, den Brustwarzen und dem Warzenhof sowie dem Nasenvorhof (\\"Vestibulum nasi\\"). Eine Duftdrüse ist ein röhrenartiges (tubuläres) Knäuel. Im Inneren des Tubulus befinden sich in einer einschichtigen Lage Epithelzellen. Von diesen Zellen ragen Cytoplasmakuppen in den Tubulus hinein. Diese Kuppen werden bei der Sekretion abgeschnürt und in das Innere des Tubulus (das Lumen) abgegeben. Die Epithelzellen verlieren dabei einen Teil ihres Cytoplasmas und ihrer Zellmembran. Diese \\"apokrine Sekretion\\" wird auch Apozytose genannt., Modifizierte apokrine Schweißdrüsen befinden sich am Lidrand der Wimpern, die Moll-Drüsen (\\"Glandulae ciliares conjunctivales\\"), und in den äußeren Gehörgängen, die Ohrenschmalzdrüsen (\\"Glandulae ceruminosae\\")., Außer im Epithel der apokrinen Schweißdrüsen wird ABCC11 noch auf Leberzellen, weißen Blutkörperchen und Blasten im Knochenmark exprimiert., Die Expression von ABCC11 wird über den Estrogenrezeptor-α reguliert. Durch Estradiol wird die Expression reduziert. Entsprechend wird die Expression durch Tamoxifen, ein Estradiol-Antagonist, der über kompetitive Hemmung an den Estrogenrezeptor-α bindet, hochreguliert., Multidrug Resistance., Krebszellen haben eine hohe Mutations- und Zellteilungsrate. Sie werden ständig auf Überleben und Proliferation selektiert. Während dieses evolutionären Prozesses nutzen die entarteten Zellen grundlegende physiologische Mechanismen, um sich vor der toxischen Wirkung der Chemotherapie zu schützen. Einer dieser Mechanismen ist der Transport (Efflux) von Chemotherapeutika aus der Zelle. In einer Vielzahl von Studien wurde gezeigt, dass der Efflux über die Behandlungsdauer, also über die Anzahl an Therapiezyklen, mit einem Chemotherapeutikum zunimmt. Die Krebszellen exprimieren mehr und mehr Transporter, um die für die Zelle toxischen Substanzen wieder „herauspumpen“ zu können. Für den behandelten Patienten bedeutet dies, dass sein Tumor, oder dessen Metastasen, nicht mehr auf den Wirkstoff ansprechen, weil sich eine Wirkstoffresistenz ausgebildet hat. In der Regel wird dann – wenn vorhanden – ein strukturell anderes Chemotherapeutikum verwendet, das idealerweise für die überexprimierten Transporter kein geeignetes Substrat ist. Grundsätzlich ist die Resistenzbildung bei Krebszellen, aber auch bei mit Viren infizierten Zellen, für den Therapieerfolg ausgesprochen ungünstig., Verantwortlich für den Wirkstofftransport aus der Zelle heraus sind die ABC-Transporter, zu denen auch ABCC11 gehört. Daher auch der Name \\"Multidrug Resistance-Related Protein 8\\" für ABCC11. Zu diesen Arzneimitteln, die ABCC11 aus der Zelle heraustransportieren können, gehören unter anderem Nukleosid- und Folsäure-Analoga. Nukleosidanaloga sind beispielsweise das wichtige Chemotherapeutikum 5-Fluoruracil (5-FU) und seine Abkömmlinge Floxuridin und Doxifluridin, sowie Cytarabin, das HIV-Therapeutikum Zalcitabin und der Hepatitis-B-Wirkstoff Adefovir. Zellen, die ABCC11 überexprimieren, können im Vergleich zu normalen Zellen eine etwa dreifach höhere Dosis an 5-FU und Doxifluridin überleben, im Fall von Floxuridin und Adefovir die 5-fache, und bei Zalcitabin gar die 6-fache Dosis. Das Folsäure-Analogon Methotrexat (MTX) ist ebenfalls ein Substrat für ABCC11., Die Verabreichung von 5-Fluoruracil beeinflusst direkt die Expression von ABCC11., Genetischer Polymorphismus., Bisher (Stand 2013) sind über zehn nicht-synonyme Einzelnukleotid-Polymorphismen (engl. \\"single nucleotide polymorphism\\", SNP) beim humanen \\"ABCC11\\"-Gen bekannt.

Er war seit der Antennenaufstockung Anfang 2016 bis zur Fertigstellung des TK-Elevator-Testturms 2018 das höchste Gebäude Baden-Württembergs und gehört auch zu den höchsten Fernmeldetürmen Deutschlands. In der konstruktiven Entwicklung war der Mannheimer Fernmeldeturm der erste in Westdeutschland, dessen Tragwerk des Turmkorbs über ein spezielles Radialträgersystem gestützt wurde, womit man baulich einen neuen Weg beschritt. Der Turm gilt als ein modernes Wahrzeichen der Stadt Mannheim., Der Mannheimer Fernmeldeturm, für die Versorgung der Funk- und Fernmeldedienste im Raum Mannheim errichtet, war eine öffentlich begehbare Attraktion der Bundesgartenschau 1975. Der Turm beherbergt neben Sendeeinrichtungen für Richtfunk und Funkdienste im UKW- und Fernseh-Bereich in 124 Metern Höhe ein Drehrestaurant und in 121 Metern eine Aussichtsplattform, von der man einen Rundblick über Mannheim und das Umland mit den Städten Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Worms, Heidelberg, Speyer, so wie Neustadt an der Weinstraße bis hin zur Deutschen Weinstraße, den Odenwald, den Pfälzerwald und bei besonders guter Sicht sogar bis zum östlichsten Teil des Nordpfälzer Berglandes mit dem Donnersberg hat., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Die fernmeldetechnisch unbefriedigende Versorgung von Mannheim und seiner Region in den 1960er Jahren war der Auslöser für die Planungen für einen ursprünglich etwa 90 bis 120 Meter hohen Fernmeldeturm. Dieser sollte möglichst zentral liegen; ursprünglich wurde zur Errichtung des Turmes das Gelände der Lanz-Villa in der Mannheimer Oststadt in Erwägung gezogen, wo bislang eine Richtfunkstelle installiert war, die den wachsenden Anforderungen nicht mehr gewachsen war., Aufgrund der Nähe zum Neuostheimer Flugplatz (heute: Mannheim City) opponierte anfänglich die Luftaufsichtsbehörde gegen die Errichtung eines Fernmeldeturms. Auch von der Mannheimer Stadtverwaltung kamen ursprünglich Bedenken, da das Bauwerk nicht dem Charakter der Oststadt mit seinen noblen Wohn- und Geschäftshäusern entspräche. Zeitweise waren als Standort auch der Friedensplatz an der Autobahneinfahrt, der Luisenring sowie das Gewerbegebiet „Wohlgelegen“ in Betracht gezogen. Ende der 1960er Jahre kam der Wunsch der Kommune auf, den Turm in die Nähe der geplanten Bundesgartenschau 1975 zu errichten und damit als neues Wahrzeichen einer modernen Stadt Mannheim zu etablieren. Damit stand neben dem Sendebetrieb die bauliche Attraktion zur Bundesgartenschau deutlich im Vordergrund aller Planungsüberlegungen. Als besondere Attraktion erschien jedoch die bis dahin geplante Höhe als zu niedrig. Bereits Ende der 1950er Jahre war in Dortmund mit dem Florianturm ein Fernmeldeturm anlässlich einer Bundesgartenschau errichtet worden., Die Kommune beschloss, den Turm mit einem Höhenrestaurant und einer Aussichtsterrasse auszustatten. Zur Sicherung der Finanzierung wurde die \\"Gewerbebauträger GmbH\\" aus Hamburg als Investor und Bauherr gewonnen, die zur Finanzierung 30 Millionen DM beisteuerte., Planung., Bei der Wahl des charakteristischen Turmkorbes galt es, fünf Anforderungen bestmöglich zu erfüllen. Neben der Stellfläche und der Kabelzuführung sollte der Korb in der Raumnutzung variabel sein, eine bestmögliche Aussicht bieten, einen Innovationsgrad erfüllen und in Bezug auf Außenfläche und umbauten Raum wirtschaftlich sein. Aus 18 möglichen Grundformen wurde die Form zweier umgekehrt zueinander verlaufender, unterschiedlich großer Kegelstümpfe gewählt. Erwin Heinle legte schließlich im Februar 1972 fünf Entwurfsvarianten vor., Als endgültiger Standort wurde das südliche Neckarufer ausgewählt, gleich neben dem Gelände des Luisenparks, wo auch der Aerobus eine Endhaltestelle bekam., Nach ersten Probebohrungen im Mai 1971 begannen im Frühjahr 1972 die Planungsarbeiten zum Fernmeldeturm Mannheim, im September desselben Jahres folgte die Ausschreibung der Rohbauarbeiten., Ende 1972 entstanden Unstimmigkeiten zwischen dem Post- und Gewerbebauträger und der Stadt Mannheim, die für die Gestaltung des Basisgebäudes Auflagen forderte. Die schlugen mit Mehrkosten von rund drei Millionen Mark zu Buche. Aus diesem Grund drohte das Projekt kurz vor Baubeginn komplett zu scheitern. Der damalige Oberbürgermeister Ratzel stockte aus diesem Grund den Etat der Bundesgartenschau um 1,2 Millionen Mark auf. Am 16. Januar 1973 stimmte der Gemeinderat der Etataufstockung zu., Bau und Eröffnung., Die Grundsteinlegung erfolgte am 10. April 1973 im Beisein des damaligen Oberbürgermeisters Ludwig Ratzel und des Ministerialdirektors Heinrich Bethmann vom Bundesministerium für das Post- und Fernmeldewesen, rund vier Monate nachdem bereits im Januar desselben Jahres mit den Gründungsarbeiten begonnen worden war., Etwa 70 Arbeiter haben in drei etwa gleichstark besetzten Schichten den Turm errichtet. Die Schaftbetonwand wuchs täglich zwischen 0,70 und 1,50 Meter. Die 100-Meter-Marke wurde im August 1973 und die 125-Meter-Marke Anfang September überschritten. Ende 1973 wurde aus 85 Kubikmeter Holz eine 140 Tonnen schwere Rahmenkonstruktion erbaut, mit deren Hilfe man in einer Bauhöhe von 120 bis 137 Metern den Turmkorb errichtete. Am 9. April 1974 wurde der gesamte Betonschaft bis auf eine Höhe von 166,20 Metern hochgezogen. Mit der endgültigen Fertigstellung des gesamten Rohbaus konnte am 5. Juni 1974 das Richtfest begangen werden. Danach folgten die Einrichtung der technischen Installationen und die Inneneinrichtung der Kanzel. Der erste der zwei Personenaufzüge wurde Mitte November 1974 in Betrieb genommen, der zweite Personenaufzug wie auch der Betriebsaufzug folgten Mitte Dezember. Der Ausbau des Betriebsgeschosses und der Funkbetriebsräume begann im Dezember 1974., Die offizielle Einweihung fand am 27. März 1975 statt. In den ersten Wochen der Neueröffnung kamen täglich mehr als 2000 Besucher auf die Aussichtsplattform und rund 600 Personen ins Restaurant. Eine Auffahrt für Erwachsene kostete im Eröffnungsjahr 3,50 DM, für Kinder 1,50 DM. Endgültig fertiggestellt wurde der Turm am 26. Mai 1975 mit einer ursprünglichen Gesamthöhe von 204,9 Metern, was ihn zugleich zum höchsten Bauwerk der Stadt machte. Die Tragwerksplanung erledigten Leonhardt, Andrä &amp; Partner, die Ausführung oblag Grün &amp; Bilfinger. Bauherr war die \\"Gewerbebauträger GmbH\\", einer Tochtergesellschaft der Neuen Heimat aus Hamburg., Die technischen Anlagen des neuen Fernmeldeturms in Mannheim ermöglichten eine Kapazitätssteigerung von 10.000 auf 25.000 Fernsprechleitungen. Sämtliche technischen Einrichtungen waren so konzipiert, dass der Betrieb ohne Personal vonstattengehen konnte., Betrieb nach Eröffnung., Mit der Inbetriebnahme des Mannheimer Fernmeldeturms 1975 waren die Ausbauarbeiten der Bundespost nicht beendet. Bis 1978 investierte das Unternehmen weitere zehn Millionen Mark in die fernmeldetechnischen Einrichtungen, der für den Ausbau des Richtfunksystems sowie für Fernsprech-, Fernschreib- und Datenverkehr vorgesehen war. Seit 1954 stellte Mannheim einen Knotenpunkt im Richtfunksystem dar. Bei Eröffnung waren am Fernmeldeturm erst drei Parabolantennen montiert. Erst in den Folgejahren 1977 und 1978 wurden sukzessive weitere Richtfunkantennen angebracht und so der Ausbau des Netzes betrieben. Im März 1979 installierte die Post einen zweiten Stadtsender des Funkrufdienstes ein. Besitzer von Funkmeldeempfängern konnten mittels Signal angefunkt werden und vom nächsten Fernsprecher aus einen Rückruf durchführen. Dies war Ende der 1970er und Anfang der 1980er Jahre eine günstige Alternative zu den damals sehr teuren öffentlich beweglichen Landfunkdiensten., Am 14. Januar 1983 gingen die Eigentumsverhältnisse des Fernmeldeturms Mannheim von der \\"Gewerbebauträger GmbH\\", dem Bauträger des Turms, an die Deutsche Bundespost über, welche das Bauwerk mit Ausnahme des Restaurants, der Aussichtskanzel, der Eingangshalle und der beiden Schnellaufzüge für rund 18 Mio. DM kaufte. Der Übernahme vorangegangen war der Versuch, den Fernmeldeturm zu verkaufen – die Bundespost hatte anfangs kein Interesse. Nachdem sich kein Interessent gemeldet hatte, retteten die bisherigen Gesellschafter das Objekt mit Zuschüssen vor dem wirtschaftlichen Zusammenbruch., In der Nacht des 5. Dezember 1994 kollidierte ein Rettungshubschrauber des Lufttransportgeschwaders 61, eine Bell UH-1D, auf dem Rückflug vom Krankenhaus in Bad Kreuznach mit der Turmspitze des Fernmeldeturms, stürzte über 200 Meter senkrecht ab und brannte völlig aus. Hierbei starben alle Insassen, drei Besatzungsmitglieder und ein Notarzt. Etwa 17 Meter der Mastspitze mit den Sendeantennen wurden beschädigt und stürzten hinunter. Ein Sprecher der Telekom teilte mit, dass um 3:28 Uhr eine Störung an der Beleuchtung des Turms angezeigt wurde. Der erfahrene Hubschrauberpilot hatte keinen Notruf abgesetzt. Jahre später wurde der Turm mit einer neuen Antenne versehen, mit einer neuen Gesamthöhe von 212,8 Metern. Die Spitze wurde nun rot-weiß gestrichen und mit einer neuen Flugsicherheitsbefeuerung ausgestattet. Am Fuß des Turms befindet sich ein Gedenkstein für die Verunglückten., Im April 2014 musste eine rund 600 Kilogramm schwere und rund zwei auf drei Meter große Panzerglasscheibe im Restaurantgeschoss des Turmes von der Feuerwehr herausgeschlagen werden. Das Fenster, welches unter Spannung geraten und gesprungen war, konnte nicht nach innen herausgebrochen werden und fiel aus diesem Grund kontrolliert 120 Meter vom Turmkorb in einen abgesperrten Bereich. Nachdem das scheibenlose Fenster zunächst durch ein Provisorium aus Holz und Metall gesichert war, wurde erst am 16. Januar 2016 eine Ersatzscheibe mittels eines Spezialkrans eingesetzt. Am Vortag hatten die Arbeiten aufgrund von technischen Schwierigkeiten abgebrochen werden müssen., Am 21. Januar 2016 bekam der Fernmeldeturm eine um fünf Meter längere Zylinder-Rundstrahlantenne auf die Spitze montiert, womit er den Stuttgarter Fernsehturm (216,6m) knapp übertrifft. Die neue Antenne hat eine Masse von 150 Kilogramm. Mithilfe eines Hubschraubers des Typs Ecureuil AS 350 B3E wurden als Vorarbeit dazu am 19. Januar in 14 Flügen die Einzelteile des alten 13 Tonnen schweren Drehkrans in Einzelteilen von der obersten der: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Aussichtsturm, Baden-Württemberg, Europa, Beton, Deutsche Funkturm, 1970er Jahre, Gastronomiebetrieb, Sendeturm, Mannheim, Fernmeldeturm."},{"instruction":"\\"Chancelier de France [Lord Chancellor of France]; the chief judge of France, responsible for the judiciary of the French Empire, the post is currently held by Maurice Rouget.

Sie wurde in den 1980er Jahren gebaut und hieß vor 2006 \\"Micoperi 7000\\" (Kurzform \\"M 7000\\")., Der Name des Schiffes leitet sich vom Eigentümer, dem größten italienischen Offshore-Dienstleister Saipem, einem ehemaligen Tochterunternehmen des Energiekonzerns Eni, und der maximalen Tragfähigkeit eines Hauptkrans von 7000Tonnen her. Die \\"S 7000\\" fährt unter der Flagge der Bahamas und wird ähnlich wie die \\"Thialf\\" vor allem als Hochsee-/Tiefsee-Arbeitsschiff in der Offshore-Industrie eingesetzt., Am 14. April 2022 wurde bekannt, dass sie schwer beschädigt ist., Entstehung und Anfangsgeschichte., Entwicklung und Entwurf., Die \\"Saipem 7000\\" wurde 1984 als \\"Micoperi 7000\\" von der niederländischen Firma Gusto Engineering entworfen. Ursprünglich wurde sie vom italienischen Offshore-Dienstleistungsunternehmen Micoperi in der Mitte der 1980er-Jahre als Mehrzweck-Arbeitsschiff für die Installation von Offshorebauwerken konzipiert: Es sollte sowohl in der Lage sein, die großen, komplexen und vorgefertigten Decks oder Module von Ölplattformen (die sogenannten „Integrierten Decks“) zu installieren, als auch die Unterkonstruktionen der Plattformen (auch „Jackets“ genannt) mit seinen zwei großen Kränen als Ganzes handhaben zu können. Auch sollte die \\"M 7000\\"– als klassisches Hochsee-Arbeitsschiff– Unterkunft und Arbeitsplatz für die Montageteams zur Verfügung stellen., Das Schiff wurde wie die meisten modernen, großen Offshore-Arbeitsschiffe als Halbtaucher geplant. Es wird daher aufgrund der Bauweise als \\"SSCV\\" (Semi-Submersible Crane Vessel, dt. „halb-tauchendes Kranschiff“) oder wegen des Einsatzzweckes als \\"DCV\\" (Deepwater Construction Vessel, dt. „Tiefsee-Arbeitsschiff“) eingestuft. Die Konzeption von Gusto folgte damit den ersten gebauten SSCVs \\"Balder\\" und \\"Hermod\\", die sich im Eigentum des niederländischen Offshore-Dienstleisters Heerema Marine Contractors befinden, und 1978 gebaut wurden, sollte sie aber an Leistungsfähigkeit und Größe übertreffen., Bau des Schiffes und frühe Geschichte., Die \\"S 7000\\" entstand von 1985 bis 1987 in der Werft von Fincantieri in Monfalcone in der Nähe von Triest (Italien). Der Rumpf, der zuerst in zwei Hälften in einem langen Trockendock gebaut wurde, wurde 1986 aus dem Dock gefahren und war mit Unterstützung von zwei Pontons Anfang 1987 vollständig zusammengefügt. Im April 1987 wurden dann die beiden Kräne vom Kranschiff \\"Castoro Otto\\", welches sich damals schon im Eigentum von Saipem befand, installiert. Die Seeerprobung begann im September 1987 und dauerte zwei Monate., Nachdem das Schiff am 15.Dezember 1987 an Micoperi überging, wurden die Kosten des Schiffes nicht veröffentlicht. Die Fachpresse schätzte sie damals auf rund 400Millionen US-Dollar. Durch die niedrigen Ölpreise Ende der 1980erJahre erhielt das Unternehmen Micoperi weniger Aufträge aus der Ölindustrie und geriet in eine finanzielle Schieflage. So war Micoperi 1991 gezwungen, die \\"Micoperi 7000\\" und zahlreiche andere große Schiffe nebst weiteren Investitionsgütern zu verkaufen. Das Schiff gelangte so 1995 in das Eigentum des damals kleineren Mitbewerbers Saipem, der das Schiff am 24.März 1996 mit seinem heutigen Namen \\"Saipem 7000\\" versah. Saipem übernahm mit dem Schiff auch die komplette Mannschaft, Teile der Ausrüstung und das Unterstützungsteam an Land., Aufbau und Technik., Technik des ursprünglichen Schiffes., Rumpf., Der Rumpf des Arbeitsschiffs besteht aus zwei Schwimmkörpern, die über sechs Säulen mit dem Decksaufbau verbunden sind. Der untere Rumpf, die Säulen und der obere Rumpf haben rechteckige Querschnitte. Eine Ausnahme bilden jeweils die Enden des unteren Rumpfes, die wie ein Schiffsbug beziehungsweise -heck geformt sind. Die Außenseite der Säulen schließt mit dem oberen und unteren Rumpf ab, so dass kein Überstand der Decks vorhanden ist, der die Übersichtlichkeit während des Arbeitseinsatzes herabsetzen würde., Die vordere und hintere Säule sind vollständig in mehrere Tankabteilungen für die Ballasttanks aufgeteilt, während in der mittleren Säule Aufzüge, Treppenhäuser und Stauraum für die Rammhämmer untergebracht sind. Außerdem sind auch dort weitere Tanks eingebaut. Im unteren Rumpf sind unter der mittleren Säule je ein Pumpen- und ein Antriebsraum untergebracht, ansonsten bestehen die Schwimmkörper zum Großteil aus Ballasttanks. Genau über den vorderen Säulen sind aus Stabilitätsgründen die beiden Kräne installiert, während das Deckshaus mit der Kommandobrücke und den Kabinen am Heck über den hinteren Säulen sitzt. Es dient auch als Unterbau für das Landedeck für Hubschrauber., Der Tiefgang, der bei der Überführung etwa 10,5Meter beträgt, wird während des Arbeitseinsatzes durch ein kontrolliertes Fluten der Ballasttanks auf bis zu 27,5Meter erhöht. Durch diese konstruktive Auslegung als Halbtaucher liegt das Schiff bei rauer See oder Oberflächenströmungen wesentlich ruhiger im Wasser als ein konventionelles Schiff., Energieversorgung und Antriebsanlage., Das Schiff hatte von Anfang an einen dieselelektrischen Antrieb. Die Energieerzeugung erfolgte ursprünglich durch acht Zwölf-Zylinder-Dieselmotoren mit je 5.600 Kilowatt (kW) oder rund 8.400 PS. Die von Grandi Motori Trieste, einem ehemaligen Unternehmen der Fincantieri-Gruppe, das heute zur finnischen Wärtsilä gehört, gebauten Motoren erzeugten so 44.800kW und lieferten 10.000 Volt Spannung mit einer Frequenz von 60 Hertz, um die Antriebe und sonstigen Aggregate mit elektrischer Energie zu versorgen. Darüber hinaus standen zwei Sechs-Zylinder-Diesel mit je 3.000 kW (4.200 PS) und ein Notstromaggregat zur Verfügung. So konnten zusammen rund 50.800kW elektrische Energie erzeugt werden. Die Antriebe wurden aus Brandschutzgründen auf vier voneinander getrennte Räume aufgeteilt., Der Antrieb des Schiffes erfolgte über zehn Strahlantriebe, die sich auf beide Rümpfe wie folgt verteilten:, Ankeranlage und Dynamische Positionierung., Zur Verankerung bis zu einer Wassertiefe von 450m setzte die \\"Saipem 7000\\" 16 Anker ein. Die vier Ankerleinen pro Ecke bestehen aus 96mm starken Stahlseilen mit einer Länge von 3350m. An den Stahlseilen sind 50m 92-mm-Ketten befestigt, die die Verbindung zu den 40Tonnen schweren \\"Noreshore Mark 3\\"-Ankern herstellen. Die Ankerwinden haben eine Leistung von je 1350kW. Zusätzlich sind zwei 34,5Tonnen schwere Anker vorhanden, die an 550m langen und 130mm (5,125 Zoll) starken Ankerketten hängen., Das Schiff ist mit einem System zur dynamischen Positionierung (DPS) der Klasse III ausgerüstet. Mit dem System und den frei drehbaren Propellergondeln wird das Schiff vom Computer mit Unterstützung eines Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) unabhängig von Wind, Strömung und Last auf seiner Position gehalten. Der Betrieb ist zusammen oder unabhängig vom Einsatz des Ankersystems möglich und kann vollautomatisch, teilautomatisch oder manuell mit einem Steuerknüppel gesteuert werden. Das Computersystem des DPS ist redundant ausgelegt., Krananlage und Ballastsystem., Die Kräne wurden von \\"Officine Meccaniche Reggiane\\" in Italien nach Plänen der \\"American Hoist &amp; Derrick Company\\" (Amhoist) gebaut. Beide Kräne können um 360Grad geschwenkt werden und mit ihren 140m langen Auslegern bei einer Ausladung von 40m 7.000t mit dem Haupthaken heben., Des Weiteren sind die Kräne noch jeweils mit drei weiteren Winden und Haken ausgerüstet. Mit dem ersten Nebenhaken kann eine Last von 2.500t bei 75m Ausladung und mit dem zweiten Nebenhaken noch 900t bei 115m Ausladung gehoben werden. Der Haken an der Kranspitze besitzt eine Tragfähigkeit von 120t bei 140m Ausladung. Mit dem zweiten Nebenhaken kann eine Last auch bis zu einer Wassertiefe von 450m abgesenkt werden. Jeder Kran wird von 11.630kW (15.600PS) starken Motoren angetrieben und ist mit Stahlseilen in verschiedenen Durchmessern und von insgesamt 77Kilometern (km) Länge ausgerüstet., Die \\"S 7000\\" kann unter Einsatz beider Kräne im Tandemhub 14.000t bei einem Radius von 40m heben. Dies ist bezüglich der Last nur geringfügig weniger als die \\"Thialf\\", die 14.200t bei einem Radius von 31,2m heben kann. Im Vergleich der Lastmomente –die \\"Saipem 7000\\" erreicht hier 560.000Metertonnen(mt)– schlägt sie die \\"Thialf\\" mit ihrem maximalen Lastmoment von 443.040mt aber deutlich., Das Trimmen des Schiffes und das Ändern des Tiefganges wird von einem computergestützten System gesteuert, das auch für Simulationen geeignet und redundant ausgelegt ist. Das System kontrolliert zwei verschiedene Ballastsysteme, die kombiniert eingesetzt werden können. Zum einen bestehen die Ballastsysteme aus vier konventionellen Pumpen, die gemeinsam bis zu 24.000Tonnen pro Stunde (t/h) zwischen den 40 Ballasttanks umpumpen können. Die Gesamtkapazität dieser Ballasttanks liegt bei 83.700Kubikmetern (m³). Zum anderen besteht die Möglichkeit über 2m große Ventile Wasser frei in spezielle Ballasttanks strömen zu lassen. Die 14 dafür vorgesehenen Ballasttanks haben ein Volumen von 26.000m³. Diese Fähigkeit wird beispielsweise genutzt, um eine größere Hubgeschwindigkeit durch den steigenden Gegenballast des Schiffes zu erzeugen., Weitere Ausrüstung., Zum Rammen von Pfählen oder Errichten von Fundamenten stehen folgende Geräte zur Verfügung:, Zum Bewegen von Material auf dem Arbeitsdeck sind außerdem ein 150-t-Raupenkran (Typ: \\"Amhoist 9299\\"), ein 35-t-Hydraulikkran und zwei 5-t-Gabelstapler vorhanden., Unterkunft und Helikopter-Deck., Zum Unterbringen der Besatzung und der Arbeitsteams stehen heute 388 Einzel- und Doppelkabinen für bis zu 725 Personen zur Verfügung. Darüber hinaus sind an Bord ein Kino, Fitnesscenter und eine eigene Radio- und Fernsehstation vorhanden. Zur Versorgung stehen zwei Messen mit 400 und 70 Plätzen sowie eine Bar und Cafeteria zur Verfügung. Die Unterkünfte sind für den Einsatz in tropischen (bis +45°C) und kalten Gebieten (bis −20°C) ausgelegt., Das Landedeck für Hubschrauber kann zwei Hubschrauber bis zur Größe der Boeing CH-47 Chinook aufnehmen, wobei für eine Maschine eine Parkposition vorhanden ist. Die Betankungsanlage für das Hubschrauberdeck erfüllt dabei dieselben internationalen Vorschriften, die auch für Ölbohrplattformen gelten: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Eni (Unternehmen), Fincantieri, Halbtaucherschiff, Rohrleger, Schiff (Bahamas), Schiff (Italien), Schiff mit dieselelektrischem Antrieb, Schwimmkran, Saipem 7000, Micoperi 7000"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Baron Lister als Namensgeber, Meldepflichtige Krankheit, Meldepflichtige Tierseuche], Die Listeriose ist eine durch Bakterien der Gattung \\"Listeria\\" verursachte Infektionskrankheit bei Tieren und Menschen. Der wichtigste Erreger ist \\"Listeria monocytogenes\\", der weltweit vorkommt und hochansteckend, aber nur von mäßiger krankheitsauslösender Wirkung ist. Selten kommt beim Menschen auch eine Infektion mit \\"Listeria ivanovi\\" oder \\"L.seeligeri\\" vor., Die Listeriose kommt beim Menschen vor allem bei Schwangeren und deren ungeborenen Kindern sowie bei Neugeborenen, bei alten Menschen und bei Menschen mit einer abgeschwächten Immunabwehr (AIDS-Patienten, Immunsupprimierte) vor. Die Zahl der Listeriosen beim Menschen als Folge von Lebensmittelinfektionen –mit teils tödlichem Ausgang– ist in den letzten Jahren in Europa angestiegen., In der Tierwelt sind vor allem Wiederkäuer (Rinder, Schafe, Ziegen) von der enzootisch und epizootisch auftretenden Erkrankung betroffen. Selten betrifft es Vögel, Pferde und Schweine sowie Nagetiere, Fische und Krebse und sehr selten Raubtiere., Für die Verbreitung der Erkrankung bei Mensch und Tier spielen vor allem verdorbene und verschmutzte Lebens- beziehungsweise Futtermittel eine Rolle, weshalb sie im klassischen Sinne keine Zoonose –eine vom Menschen auf Tiere und umgekehrt übertragbare Krankheit–, sondern eher eine Fäulnis- (Sapronose) oder Erdkeiminfektion (Geonose) ist., Das klinische Bild der Listeriose ist sehr variabel und hängt vor allem vom befallenen Organsystem ab. Daher ist die Erkrankung klinisch nicht sicher festzustellen, weshalb eine adäquate Behandlung mit wirksamen Antibiotika häufig zu spät erfolgt. Bei Lebensmittelinfektionen treten beim Menschen im Regelfall zunächst Durchfall und Bauchschmerzen auf, es kann aber auch zu einer protrahierten Sepsis kommen. Am häufigsten entwickeln sich im weiteren Verlauf bei Mensch und Tier infolge einer Entzündung des Gehirns (Enzephalitis) und der Hirnhäute (Meningitis bzw. Meningoenzephzalitis) zentralnervöse Störungen wie Lähmungen, Zittern, Körperfehlstellungen und Benommenheit. Bei Schwangeren und trächtigen Tieren kann es zu Fehlgeburten, zum Absterben des Fötus oder zu einer schweren Neugeborenensepsis kommen. Schließlich kann sich eine Listeriose auch als lokale Wundinfektion sowie als Entzündung der Binde- und Hornhaut manifestieren., Die Listeriose ist in Deutschland seit 2001 sowohl beim Menschen als auch bei Tieren eine meldepflichtige Krankheit. Nach Schweizer Recht ist sie beim Menschen ebenfalls meldepflichtig., Erreger., Der häufigste Krankheitserreger ist \\"Listeria monocytogenes\\", ein grampositives Stäbchen von 0,5 bis 2µm Länge und 0,4 bis 0,5µm Breite. Er bildet bei Temperaturen unter 30 Grad Celsius Geißeln aus, darüber ist er durch eine explosionsartige Polymerisation beweglich (\\"actin assembly-inducing protein\\"). Er wächst auch unter Sauerstoffabschluss (\\"fakultativ anaerob\\"). \\"Listeria monocytogenes\\" ist außerordentlich kälteresistent und vermehrt sich noch bei Kühlschranktemperatur. Darüber hinaus ist es bis zu einem pH-Wert von 4,5 säureresistent und widersteht auch hohen Salzkonzentrationen., Man unterscheidet sechs Serotypen. Die Virulenz des Erregers wird vor allem durch das Haemolysin-Gen (hly) bestimmt, welches das Protein \\"ListeriolysinO\\" (LLO) codiert. 90 % aller Infektionen des Menschen werden durch die Serotypen 4b, 1/2b und 1/2a ausgelöst. In den Vereinigten Staaten und Finnland gibt es bereits Datenbanken, in denen die über Pulsfeldgelelektrophorese ermittelten genetischen Muster der Stämme von \\"L. monocytogenes\\" erfasst sind, so dass eine schnelle Aufklärung und Bekämpfung der Listeriosefälle möglich ist., Bei Schafen spielt darüber hinaus auch \\"Listeria ivanovii\\" eine Rolle, jedoch nur bei der Gebärmutterform (\\"siehe unten\\"). Andere Listerien sind nicht krankheitsauslösend (\\"apathogen\\")., Verbreitung., Listerien kommen praktisch überall (ubiquitär) vor. Sie gelten als Schmutzkeim und sind besonders in Abwässern, Böden sowie verunreinigtem Wasser, Lebens- und Futtermitteln verbreitet. Da Listerien somit eher als Erd- oder Fäulniskeime anzusehen sind, wird die Erkrankung auch als „Geonose“ oder „Sapronose“ bezeichnet. Die direkte Ansteckung von Tier zu Tier, Tier zu Mensch oder von Mensch zu Tier findet praktisch nicht statt., Die häufigsten Infektionsquellen für Wiederkäuer sind unzureichend vergorene oder erdreichverschmutzte Silage mit einem pH-Wert &gt; 5,6 oder verdorbenes Heu., Fast jedes mit Erde oder Staub kontaminierte Lebensmittel enthält Listerien, weshalb insbesondere Obst und Gemüse beziehungsweise pflanzliche Futtermittel für die Ansteckung verantwortlich sind. Ausnahmen stellen Karotten, Äpfel und Tomaten dar, in denen sich der Erreger nicht hält., Lebensmittel tierischer Herkunft sind zumeist sekundär kontaminiert, werden also erst bei der Verarbeitung mit Listerien beimpft. Besonders gefährdet sind Rohmilch und Butter. Milchprodukte wie Hartkäse, Joghurt und Quark gelten dagegen als sicher. Die ordnungsgemäße Pasteurisierung tötet Listerien zuverlässig ab. Pasteurisierte Milch kann aber im Haushalt wieder kontaminiert werden, wodurch es auch bei Kühlschranklagerung zu einer Anreicherung mit Listerien kommen kann. Mayonnaise, Geflügelfleisch und kurzgereifte Rohwürste (Teewurst, Mettwurst) sind ebenfalls kritische Lebensmittel. Vor allem auf den Oberflächen von Roh- und Weichkäsen und Salami können sich Listerien vermehren und Kolonien bilden. Da in solchen Fällen nur jene Menschen erkranken, die zufällig ein Stück mit Kolonien verzehren, andere, die das gleiche Lebensmittel auch essen, jedoch nicht, ist die Aufklärung hier besonders schwierig. Bei vakuumverpacktem Räucherlachs wurden Kontaminationsraten von bis zu 50 % festgestellt, wobei hier offenbar nur gering humanpathogene Stämme auftreten und Lebensmittelinfektionen durch Räucherlachs selten vorkommen., In Deutschland wurden für 2006 520 Nachweise, für 2016 707, für 2017 770, für 2018 698 und für 2019 591 Nachweise der Listeriose beim Menschen gemeldet; 2020 waren es 575, 2021 wurden 586 Fälle gemeldet und 2022 569. In der jüngeren Zeit wurde dabei eine Zunahme der Listeriosefälle infolge von Lebensmittelinfektionen beobachtet, während die Anzahl der Neugeborenen- und Schwangereninfektionen (siehe unten) konstant blieb. Erstere stellen im Regelfall Einzelerkrankungen, zumeist bei älteren Menschen dar. Die Ursache für diese Zunahme ist nicht bekannt. In den Vereinigten Staaten ist \\"L.monocytogenes\\" für 28 % der durch Lebensmittel verursachten Todesfälle verantwortlich. Bei Tieren sind vor allem Rinder und Schafe betroffen, bei anderen Tieren spielt die Listeriose nur eine untergeordnete Rolle. Die Zahl der Ausbrüche in Rinder- und Schafherden zeigt in den letzten Jahren eine leicht fallende Tendenz., Krankheitsentstehung., Die Ansteckung erfolgt über den Mund (oral) oder als Schmierinfektion bei Weichteilinfektionen. Der Erreger breitet sich bei Tieren vor allem über Lymphgefäße und entlang der Hirnnerven V (Nervus trigeminus) und XII (Nervus hypoglossus) aus., Bei Menschen mit Abwehrschwäche hat \\"L. monocytogenes\\" die Fähigkeit, sich mittels bestimmter Oberflächenproteine (InlA, InlB und P60) an E-Cadherin zu binden und so in Epithelzellen des Magen-Darm-Kanals sowie Zellen anderer Organe einzudringen. Innerhalb der Zellen (intrazellulär) überlebt \\"L. monocytogenes\\" in membranumhüllten Vakuolen und ist so vor den Mechanismen der unspezifischen Abwehr geschützt, selbst in Makrophagen kann der Erreger dem intrazellulären Abbau widerstehen., Bei Vorhandensein bestimmter Virulenzfaktoren (Listeriolysin, Phospholipase) verlässt der Erreger diese Membranhüllen und vermehrt sich im Zytoplasma befallener Zellen. Dabei entstehen im Darm verstreut (disseminiert) Granulome („Listeriome“). Von diesen verteilt sich der Erreger über das Blut (Bakteriämie) und besiedelt andere Organe. Listerien haben die Fähigkeit, sich an die Enden der Aktinfilamente des Zellgerüsts anzukoppeln und sich dadurch innerhalb der Zellen zu bewegen. Da Aktinfilamente auch in bestimmte Zellkontakte einstrahlen, sind Listerien in der Lage, auch in Nachbarzellen einzudringen, und überwinden so auch anatomische Barrieren wie die Blut-Hirn-Schranke und die Plazenta., Der Körper reagiert auf das Eindringen des Erregers mit einer Immunreaktion und entwickelt im Normalfall eine zelluläre Immunität. In infizierten, aber nicht erkrankten Lebewesen kann der Erreger in den Mandeln, im Magen-Darm-Trakt und in der Leber nachgewiesen werden. Zum Ausbruch der Krankheit kommt es im Regelfall nur bei einem geschwächten Immunsystem. Der Erreger benötigt also weitere Faktoren, um das Immunsystem zu überwinden und eine Erkrankung auszulösen (Faktorenkrankheit). Infizierte Tiere und Menschen scheiden den Erreger über den Kot und Laktierende auch über die Milch aus., Listeriose bei Tieren., Wiederkäuer., Bei Schafen und Ziegen kann die Listeriose in vier Formen auftreten, wobei die Erkrankung bei Ziegen zumeist dramatischer verläuft als bei Schafen., Die häufigste Form ist die \\"zentralnervöse Form\\", bei der es aufgrund einer Gehirn-Hirnhaut-Entzündung zu neurologischen Ausfällen kommt. Diese Form tritt vor allem bei 4 bis 6 Monate alten Lämmern auf und wird meistens durch \\"L. monocytogenes\\" Typ 4b verursacht. Typische Symptome sind Abgeschlagenheit, Drehbewegungen (im englischen Sprachraum heißt die Erkrankung daher auch \\"circling disease\\"), Herabhängen der Ohren, Zittern der Lippen, Augenzittern und im fortgeschrittenen Stadium Festliegen in Seitenlage mit Ruderbewegungen. Darüber hinaus sind häufig Tränen- und Nasenausfluss zu beobachten. Eine Halsüberstreckung ist eher selten, die Reflexe sind zumeist ungestört. Die Erkrankung endet gewöhnlich binnen 10 Tagen tödlich., Die \\"metrogene Form\\" (v. griech. \\"metra\\" „Gebärmutter“) äußert sich in Fehlgeburten bei tragenden Mutterschafen. Die Fehlgeburten verlaufen in der Regel komplikationslos, also ohne Nachgeburtsverhaltung oder Endometritis. Auslöser ist zumeist \\"L.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Bakterielle Infektionskrankheit - Listeriose - Tiere - Wiederkäuer - Mensch - Meldepflicht - Joseph Lister - Namensgeber - Lebensmittelinfektion - Erreger"},{"instruction":"Write me a theoretical background on yoga","output":"Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India thousands of years ago. The word \\"yoga\\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \\"yuj,\\" which means to unite or join. It encompasses a holistic approach to overall well-being, including physical, mental, and spiritual aspects. The theoretical foundation of yoga can be traced back to the ancient texts called the Vedas, specifically the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. These texts discuss the philosophy of yoga and its purpose: the attainment of self-realization or union with the Divine. According to yogic philosophy, human beings are not just physical bodies but also possess subtle energy channels called nadis and energy centers known as chakras. The nadis and chakras are responsible for the flow of vital life force energy, known as prana, throughout the body. When these energy pathways are balanced and unobstructed, individuals experience physical and mental well-being. Yoga recognizes that the mind and body are closely interconnected. Through various physical postures, known as asanas, and controlled breathing exercises, called pranayama, yoga seeks to harmonize these two aspects, leading to emotional stability and mental clarity. The practice of yoga also includes meditation, which helps calm the mind, cultivate mindfulness, and enhance self-awareness. Another fundamental principle in yoga is the concept of ahimsa, which means non-violence or non-harming. Practitioners are encouraged to cultivate compassion and kindness, not just towards others but also towards oneself. Yoga teaches that by practicing non-violence and self-acceptance, individuals can create a harmonious and peaceful environment within and around them. Furthermore, yoga emphasizes the importance of discipline, perseverance, and self-control. Regular practice is necessary to achieve progress in various aspects of life, both on and off the mat. Through consistent and dedicated practice, individuals can learn to navigate life's challenges with grace, patience, and resilience. Yoga also recognizes the existence of different paths or branches to attain its ultimate goal. These paths include bhakti yoga (the path of devotion), karma yoga (the path of selfless action), jnana yoga (the path of wisdom or knowledge), and raja yoga (the path of meditation and mind control). In recent times, yoga has gained popularity worldwide as a means to promote physical fitness, stress reduction, and relaxation. Numerous scientific studies have also demonstrated the beneficial effects of yoga on various health conditions, including mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. In summary, the theoretical background of yoga encompasses a comprehensive system that integrates physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of life. It offers a roadmap for individuals to find balance, harmony, and self-realization, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of oneself and the interconnectedness of all beings."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Deutsche Geschichte (20. Jahrhundert), Deutsche Monarchie, Deutschland im Ersten Weltkrieg, Ereignis 1918, Hohenzollern, Novemberrevolution, Politische Affäre der Weimarer Republik, Politische Affäre im Deutschen Kaiserreich, Wilhelm II. (Deutsches Reich)], Die Abdankung WilhelmsII., die am 9. November 1918 ohne seine Zustimmung verkündet wurde, markiert das Ende seiner Herrschaft als Deutscher Kaiser und König von Preußen. Der Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten, Woodrow Wilson, hatte am Ende des Ersten Weltkriegs kaum verhohlen einen Rücktritt des Kaisers als Bedingung für ein Waffenstillstandsabkommen mit dem Deutschen Reich genannt. Dieser Forderung schlossen sich bald Teile des deutschen Bürgertums und der Reichsregierung an, um günstigere Friedensbestimmungen zu bekommen und der Revolution den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen, die angesichts der absehbaren Kriegsniederlage drohte. Diesem Druck entzog sich WilhelmII., indem er am 29.Oktober ins Große Hauptquartier im belgischen Spa floh. Als die Novemberrevolution am 9.November 1918 Berlin erreichte, verkündete Reichskanzler Prinz Max von Baden die Abdikation des Kaisers, ohne von diesem dazu autorisiert worden zu sein. Daraufhin floh WilhelmII. unter entwürdigenden Umständen weiter in die Niederlande und bat um politisches Asyl. Im Deutschen Reich wurde dies vielfach als Bruch des Treueids und als Fahnenflucht gedeutet und trug dazu bei, dass die monarchistische Bewegung während der Weimarer Republik schwach blieb., Geschichte., Die Parlamentarisierung des Deutschen Reiches., Zu Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs hatte Wilhelm II. im Zuge des so genannten Augusterlebnisses zunächst neue Popularität erlangt. Dass er am 4. August 1914 im Rahmen der Burgfriedenspolitik den lange verfemten Sozialdemokraten die Hand reichte („Ich kenne keine Parteien mehr, ich kenne nur noch Deutsche!“) und eine einige Volksgemeinschaft beschwor, gilt als seine größte rhetorische Leistung. Während des Krieges trat er dann immer mehr in den Hintergrund. Zwar hatte er gemäß den Artikeln 63 und 64 der Reichsverfassung von 1871 als Bundesfeldherr den Oberbefehl über die Streitkräfte inne. Seiner Aufgabe als „Oberster Kriegsherr“ wurde er aber nicht gerecht, eine Koordinierung der strategischen und operativen Planung der Teilstreitkräfte leistete er nicht. Stattdessen agierte Wilhelm II. als „Schattenkaiser“, beschränkte sich fallweise auf impulsive Anregungen und überließ die ihm eigentlich zustehende Gesamtverantwortung für die Kriegführung der Obersten Heeresleitung (OHL). Der Historiker Lothar Machtan nennt Wilhelm in den Jahren des Weltkriegs einen „Marionetten-Kaiser“, dessen Fäden von der OHL und vom Reichskanzler gezogen worden seien. Nicht einmal über die personelle Zusammensetzung der OHL konnte er noch bestimmen: Im August 1916 musste er gegen seinen Willen General Erich von Falkenhayn, den Chef der zweiten OHL, durch den machtbewussten Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg ersetzen, der sich geschickt als Retter aus militärischer Not in Szene zu setzen verstand. Hindenburg und nicht mehr dem Kaiser fiel von nun an die Rolle des charismatischen Führers zu. Der Historiker Bernd Sösemann konstatiert einen regelrechten „Verfall des Kaisergedankens im Ersten Weltkrieg“. Für den Politikwissenschaftler Herfried Münkler stellt der Aufstieg Hindenburgs und seines Ersten Generalquartiermeisters Erich Ludendorff an die Spitze der Heeresleitung den „Anfang vom Ende der Hohenzollernmonarchie in Deutschland“ dar., Dass das Deutsche Reich den Ersten Weltkrieg militärisch nicht gewinnen konnte, erfuhr Wilhelm erstmals am 10. August 1918, zwei Tage nachdem den Alliierten in der Schlacht von Amiens ein Einbruch in die deutschen Linien gelungen war („Schwarzer Tag des deutschen Heeres“). Laut seinem Biographen John C. G. Röhl nahm er die Nachricht gefasst auf, zumal Ludendorff am 14. August behauptete, durch entschlossene Defensive den Kriegswillen der Feinde brechen zu können. Im Kronrat, zu dem an diesem Tag die politische und die Heeresleitung im Großen Hauptquartier in Spa zusammengekommen waren, wurde beschlossen, mit Friedenssondierungen abzuwarten, bis sich die militärische Lage stabilisiert hätte. Die nächsten Wochen verbrachte der Kaiser in Schloss Wilhelmshöhe bei Kassel, wo sich seine Frau, Kaiserin Auguste Viktoria von einem leichten Schlaganfall erholte., Die Kaiserin hatte auf ihren Mann, der zu depressiver Verstimmtheit neigte, meist einen wohltuenden Einfluss, machtpolitisch lenkte sie ihn aber mit ihrem Fanatismus gegen alle vermeintlichen Feinde des Hauses der Hohenzollern oft in wenig kluge Richtungen. Gemeinsam mit Wilhelms Entourage bestärkte sie ihn nun in seinem zunehmend unangemessenen Zweckoptimismus: Der Hamburger Reeder Albert Ballin war von Ludendorff nach Kassel gesandt worden, um ihm den Gedanken nahezulegen, noch vor den Friedensverhandlungen eine „rasche und kluge innere Modernisierung des Reiches“ durchzuführen, „sonst erscheint sie von den Gegnern erzwungen und gefährdet die Dynastie“. Stattdessen entschloss sich Wilhelm, am 10. September vor den Arbeitern der Friedrich Krupp AG in Essen eine Durchhalterede zu halten: Wilhelm wiederholte seine Zusicherung vom 4. August 1914, er kenne keine Parteien mehr, und rief zu nationaler Geschlossenheit auf: „Werdet stark wie Stahl, und der deutsche Volksblock, zu Stahl zusammengeschweißt, der soll dem Feind seine Kraft zeigen“. Anschließend sollten die Arbeiter vor ihm ihre Opferbereitschaft und Siegeszuversicht geloben. Das Vorhaben misslang. Die von Wilhelms Chef des Geheimen Zivilkabinetts, dem konservativen Friedrich von Berg, formulierte Rede ging an den Befindlichkeiten und Bedürfnissen seiner Zuhörer vorbei. Als der Kaiser zunehmend vom Redemanuskript abwich und frei sprach, verstärkte sich dies noch. Dass die Arbeiter alle freudig „Ja!“ gerufen hätten, wie die unter den Bedingungen der Zensur schreibende Presse berichtete, war nach Aussagen von Zeitzeugen falsch: Vielmehr hatten die Kruppianer, wie Lothar Machtan schreibt, auf die Rede mit „robuster Gleichgültigkeit“ reagiert. Es sollte Wilhelms letzter Auftritt in der Öffentlichkeit bleiben., Im Anschluss reiste der Kaiser zurück ins Hauptquartier nach Spa, wo man ihm über die sich immer weiter verschlechternde militärische und innenpolitische Lage nicht die Wahrheit sagte. Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller notierte:, Der Kaiser und seine Entourage lebten zwei weitere Wochen in der illusionären Hoffnung auf einen deutschen Sieg, bis die OHL am 26. September reinen Tisch machte: Sie ließ die Reichsregierung ins Große Hauptquartier anreisen und teilte Reichskanzler Georg von Hertling und seinen Staatssekretären mit, dass der Krieg verloren war. Daraufhin trat das Kabinett Hertling geschlossen zurück. Friedrich von Berg arbeitete nun an der Bildung einer Reichsregierung, die auch gegen den Reichstag regieren sollte, und sondierte zunächst bei Bernhard von Bülow, der von 1900 bis 1909 Reichskanzler gewesen war. Dem war aber klar, dass ein Regieren gegen die Mehrheitsparteien des Reichstags nicht mehr möglich war. Berg dachte nun an eine Diktatur eines Generals, etwa Alexander von Falkenhausens oder Max von Gallwitz’, wurde aber zurückgepfiffen: Stattdessen schlug Paul von Hintze, der amtierende Staatssekretär des Auswärtigen, unterstützt von Hindenburg und Ludendorff, am 29.September eine „Revolution von oben“ vor: Das Herrschaftssystem des Kaiserreichs sollte zumindest zum Schein demokratisiert, die MSPD in die neue Regierung einbezogen und eine Bitte um Frieden an den US-Präsidenten Woodrow Wilson gesandt werden. Wilson hatte Anfang des Jahres sein 14-Punkte-Programm veröffentlicht, das unter anderem ein Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Völker enthielt. Auf dieser Grundlage hoffte man, milde Friedensbedingungen bekommen zu können., Eine Demokratisierung des Kaiserreichs hatte der Kaiser bereits in seiner Osterbotschaft 1917 angekündigt, um die unter Krieg und Mangelwirtschaft leidenden breiten Volksschichten zu beruhigen. Nun sollte sie dazu dienen, den Schock der Niederlage abzumildern. Insbesondere Ludendorff machte sich für eine Regierungsbeteiligung der MSPD stark:, Dies war sachlich falsch, denn, wie Gerd Krumeich betont, waren „in der Hauptsache“ die Fehleinschätzungen der OHL und die Schwerfälligkeit des militärischen Apparats für die desaströse Lage verantwortlich. Um die Verantwortung von sich selbst abzuwälzen, legte Ludendorff hier den Keim der später so genannten Dolchstoßlegende, wonach nicht das Militär, sondern die Demokraten für die deutsche Niederlage verantwortlich gewesen wären. Zu dieser Verschwörungstheorie trug außerdem bei, dass er die Öffentlichkeit über den Ernst der militärischen Lage im Unklaren gelassen, im Gegenteil sogar optimistische Propaganda verbreitet hatte. Kaiser Wilhelm hätte gern eine Allparteienregierung unter Einschluss der Deutschkonservativen gehabt, doch dem verweigerten sich die Sozialdemokraten. Sie schlugen als Reichskanzler den bisherigen Vizekanzler Friedrich von Payer von der Deutschen Volkspartei (DVP) vor. Der Kaiser lehnte Payer aber ab. Stattdessen setzte Ludendorff den badischen Thronfolger Prinz Max von Baden durch, den Payers Parteifreund Conrad Haußmann ins Spiel gebracht hatte., Max von Baden hatte bisher politisch so gut wie keine Erfahrung. Nach dem Scheitern einer militärischen Karriere hatte er die Vorstellung entwickelt, er müsse „Deutschland retten“: Am 27.Juli 1918 hatte er ein ausführliches „Programm des Prinzen Max von Baden“ vorgelegt, in dem er einen „ethischen Imperialismus“ skizzierte, der Deutschland die „Pflicht“ auferlege, „die Stellung als Führerstaat in Europa, ja der Welt zu erringen“. Die militärischen Niederlagen erklärte er sich mit der feindlichen „Entmutigungspropaganda“. Dagegen bedürfe es eines „Propagandaministers“, der große öffentliche Kundgebungen veranstalten und den „Führergedanken“ fest im Volke verankern müsse. Wenn Deutschland alle Kräfte zusammenraffe, könne es aus einer Position der Stärke Friedensverhandlungen mit der Entente beginnen. Der Prinz hatte einen Kreis einflussreicher Unterstützer um sich gesammelt, darunter neben Haußmann der Kronprinz Rupprecht von Bayern, Max Warburg, Hans Delbrück und Ludendorffs Vertrauter Generalmajor Hans von Haeften. Diese warben dafür, ihm das Kanzleramt zu übergeben. Max selber hatte sich seinem Cousin, dem Kaiser, am 15. August in einem Brief empfohlen.

Der topographisch günstige Standort auf dem Basler Hausberg St. Chrischona macht den Turm zum wichtigsten Baustein in der Sendeversorgung der Nordwestschweiz. Bereits seit Mitte der 1950er Jahre wird der Standort für Sendeanlagen genutzt., Der weithin sichtbare Turm mit einer markanten Dreibeinkonstruktion und einem Schaft mit polygonalem Grundriss wurde von 1980 bis 1983 errichtet und ist das höchste freistehende Bauwerk der Schweiz, und innerhalb dieses Staates das zweithöchste Bauwerk nach der Staumauer Grande Dixence. Im Jahr der Inbetriebnahme 1984 galt er aufgrund vieler technischer Sonderlösungen als der modernste Fernsehturm Europas. Neben dem regulären Sendebetrieb für Funk und Fernsehen dient er auch als Wasserturm und verfügt über Messinstrumente beispielsweise für Wetterdienste. Abgesehen von begrenzten Führungen für Besuchergruppen ist der Sendeturm für die Öffentlichkeit nicht zugänglich., Geschichte., Vorgängersendeanlagen., St. Chrischona war bereits seit dem 23.April 1954 Standort eines Sendeturms, der damals das Schweizer Fernsehprogramm übertrug und es in der Region Basel einführte. Damit gehört der Sendestandort St.Chrischona zusammen mit dem Standort Uetliberg (seit 1953) und dem Standort Bern-Bantiger (seit 1954) zu den drei ältesten Standorten für Fernseh- und UKW-Ausstrahlung in der Schweiz., Dieser erste 30Meter hohe Stahlgittermast hatte nur zwei Antennen und war experimenteller Natur; er strahlte tageweise für wenige Stunden das Programm aus. Im Jahr 1954 gab es im Raum Basel 76 Fernsehgeräte. 1956 wurden die ersten Sendungen des Radio DRS über die UKW-Sendestation verbreitet. Die Sendeapparatur war damals in einem Holzhäuschen am Fusse des Sendemastes untergebracht. Bereits nach wenigen Jahren machten neue Kommunikationsbedürfnisse eine Erweiterung der Anlage notwendig. Dieser erste Sendemast war bis zum 28. Dezember 1959 in Betrieb., Vom 29. Juni 1961 an diente als Sendeturm auf St.Chrischona ein 136Meter hoher gebrauchter Stahlfunkturm als Antennenmast. Es handelte sich um einen in Beromünster abgebauten und in St.Chrischona wieder aufgebauten Turm. Er trug zuvor zusammen mit dem Reservesendeturm Beromünster eine T-Antenne, welche vormals für den Landessender Beromünster auf Mittelwelle sendete. Seit 1968 strahlte der Sender nach dem Farbfernsehsystem PAL aus., Projektierung., Weil der alte Beromünster-Turm die Bedürfnisse nicht mehr decken konnte, lobte die PTT als Vorläufergesellschaft der Schweizer Post und der Swisscom in den Jahren 1973/1974 einen Architekturwettbewerb für einen Fernsehturm aus, der die Region mit drei Fernseh- und zwei UKW-Programmen versorgen sollte. Gleichzeitig wurde die Frage erörtert, ob der Turm zusätzlich ein Wasserreservoir aufnehmen und als Turmrestaurant mit öffentlicher Besucherplattform dienen sollte., Fünf Projektgruppen legten ihre Modelle vor. Den Zuschlag erhielt das Basler Büro \\"Aegerter &amp; Bosshardt\\", dessen Entwurf von dem sonst üblichen „Röhrenschema“ abwich und einen hexagonalen Querschnitt vorsah. Es war – ohne die technischen Installationen – mit damals veranschlagten 15,2Mio. Schweizer Franken das billigste. Auf der mittleren Höhe des Turmkorbs auf 94m waren ein französisches Restaurant und ein Selbstbedienungsrestaurant für je 200 Personen geplant. Für das Publikum sollte eine zusätzliche Aussichtsplattform auf 145m Höhe errichtet werden. Die einzelnen Räumlichkeiten hätten auf verschiedene Turmkörbe verteilt werden sollen. Eine solche Lösung hätte den Turmschaft um 14 Meter erhöht., Die für den Turmbau Verantwortlichen entschieden bereits damals, bewusst auf den Publikumsverkehr zu verzichten. Die Jury begründete das damals so:, Um private Empfangsantennen nicht neu ausrichten zu müssen oder neue Richtstrahl-Gegenstationen einzurichten, wurde die Beibehaltung des Standortes entschieden, so dass nur 85Meter nordwestlich des alten provisorischen Turms der neue platziert wurde., Neben der Nutzung als Sendeturm wurde der Fernsehturm St. Chrischona schon seit 1972 auch als Wasserturm projektiert. Die Notwendigkeit entstand aus der Mangelversorgung der Gemeinde St. Chrischona, deren Versorgung bis zur Errichtung des Fernsehturms durch einen Wassertank im 21 Meter hohen Kirchturm der Reformierten Chrischonakirche gewährleistet wurde. Die dort verfügbare Kapazität von 38 Kubikmeter des Wasserreservoirs reichte allerdings nur unzureichend aus, um den gestiegenen Bedarf der Bewohner und der Rehabilitationsklinik des Bürgerspitals Basel nach Trinkwasser zu befriedigen. Gleichzeitig sollte auch der Brandschutz im Gebiet St. Chrischona verbessert werden. Aus diesem Grund beschloss der Grosse Rat des Kantons Basel-Stadt Anfang der 1980er Jahre, insgesamt 1,43 Mio. Franken zu Lasten des Anlagekapitals der Industriellen Werke Basel als Kredit zu bewilligen., Bau des Fernsehturms St. Chrischona (1980–1983)., Bei Sondierungsgrabungen im Jahr 1979 für das Fundament wurde ein Fragment eines Mammutstosszahns freigelegt. Nachdem im selben Jahr der PTT-Verwaltungsrat den Baukredit in Höhe von 27,3 Mio. Franken bewilligt hatte, konnte nach Vorliegen der Baugenehmigung im Juli 1980 mit den Arbeiten begonnen werden., Für die Gründung des Fundaments in 17Meter Tiefe wurden Böschungen im 60-Grad-Winkel ausgehoben, die durch eine Abdeckung aus Spritzbeton geschützt wurden. Zusätzlich war eine Unterpallung – wie eine Unterfütterung zwischen dem Erdboden und der Sohlenkonstruktion genannt wird – mit Verankerungen in der Erde für die drei Fundamente notwendig. Die Konstruktion des Sockelbaus selbst war konventioneller Natur., Eine bautechnische Herausforderung stellten aber die drei sich neigenden Stützpfeiler dar. Das Zusammentreffen der senkrechten Stäbe der mittleren Säule mit den Stäben der Stützpfeiler sowie der waagerechten Spannleiste erforderte ein sehr präzises Vorgehen. Für die Konstruktion der Stützpfeiler verwendete man ein auskragendes Gerüst, das in acht Segmente zu je 2,90Meter Höhe aufgeteilt war. Um die Bauzeit zu verkürzen, wurden der Schaft und die drei Stützpfeiler gleichzeitig errichtet. Im November 1981 erfolgte ihr Zusammenschluss. Der Turmschaft wurde über eine mechanisch mitwachsende Betonschalung hochgezogen. Insgesamt 51 Anhübe von 2,90Meter bis 3,05Meter waren notwendig, um den gesamten Schaft zu betonieren. Für die Errichtung des Schaftes brauchte eine Baumannschaft aus zehn bis zwölf Arbeitern etwa ein Jahr., Der Bau des Turmschaftes, der mit einer Kletterschalung errichtet wurde, dauerte bis zum Dezember 1983. Die Tragwerksplanung übernahm die Basler Firma \\"Aegerter &amp; Bosshardt\\". Für den architektonischen Entwurf war das Büro \\"Vischer und Weber\\" verantwortlich. Für die Bauarbeiten formierte sich ein Konsortium aus den Firmen \\"Stamm AG\\", \\"Stehlin + Vischer AG\\", \\"Ed. Züblin + Cie AG\\" und der \\"BBG Basler Baugenossenschaft\\". Das Betonbauwerk wurde ebenso wie der Rohrmast für die Antennen mit einem mitwachsenden Kletterkran (Richier-Weitz GT 1184) realisiert., Die technischen Installationen waren von Januar 1983 bis Juli 1984 vollzogen, so dass am 2.August 1984 der Turm in Betrieb genommen werden konnte und er damit den ausgedienten Stahlfunkturm von 1962 ersetzte. Die Baukosten beliefen sich insgesamt auf rund 50 Mio. Franken., Seit der Inbetriebnahme 1984., Nach der Inbetriebnahme des neuen Fernsehturms – damals offiziell als \\"Mehrzweckanlage St.Chrischona\\" bezeichnet – wurde am 16. September 1985 mit dem zweiwöchigen Abbruch des 136m hohen Stahlfunkturms begonnen. Das Bauwerk ist mit 250Meter Höhe bis heute () der höchste Fernsehturm der Schweiz. Er strahlte seit dem 29. August 1984 aufgrund eines Abkommens zwischen dem deutschen Bundespostministerium und der Schweizer Postverwaltung auch das 1.und 3. Rundfunkprogramm des damaligen Südwestfunks (SWF) aus, um die Versorgungslücke in der Region Hochrhein zu schliessen. Mittlerweile sendet der Turm alle vier Programme des Südwestrundfunks, des Nachfolgers des SWF. Aufgrund vieler technischer Speziallösungen galt der Sendeturm zur Zeit seiner Inbetriebnahme als modernster Europas., Im Jahr 1996 wurden Instandsetzungsarbeiten an den Stahlterrassen-Ankerplatten des Turms durchgeführt. Im Jahr 2006 wurde der Fernsehturm St.Chrischona auf die Ausstrahlung des digitalen Fernsehens umgerüstet und die Abstrahlung der analogen Programme am 26.November 2007 eingestellt., Das 30-jährige Bestehen des Sendeturms St. Chrischona beging die Swisscom Broadcast am 27. September 2014 mit einem Tag der offenen Tür am Fusse des Fernsehturms. Neben einem festlichen Rahmenprogramm konnten rund 700 Besucher die ansonsten nur im Rahmen von Sonderführungen geöffnete Aussichtsplattform und Senderäume besichtigen., Am 22. März 2014 fand das erste Towerrunning für Berufsfeuerwehrleute statt. Im März 2019 jährte sich zum sechsten Mal die Veranstaltung, bei der die 46 Stockwerke und 799 Treppenstufen des Fernsehturms von Feuerwehrleuten in Brandschutzausrüstung emporgestiegen werden. 2020 und 2021 fand die Veranstaltung aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie nicht statt., \\"Da der Standort des Fernsehturms von überdurchschnittlich vielen Sonnenstunden geprägt ist, entschied sich der Betreiber, ab August 2017 entlang der nach Süden ausgerichteten Segmente des Turmschafts 435 Photovoltaik-Module zu montieren. Die insgesamt 710 Quadratmeter Fläche umfassende Anlage verteilt sich vertikal freihängend auf 75 Meter. Die Jahresproduktion der Anlage kann je nach Sonnenstunden etwa 118000 Kilowattstunden betragen. Damit ist der Sendestandort St. Chrischona einer von 17, die die Swisscom Broadcast mit eigenen Photovoltaikanlagen ausgestattet hat. Die Kosten für diese Aufrüstung waren mit etwa 450000 Franken veranschlagt.\\", Beschreibung., Lage und Umgebung., Der Fernsehturm St. Chrischona befindet sich in der nordwestlichen Ecke der Schweiz in einem buchtförmigen Gebietsteil – Wyhlenerbecken genannt. Er steht am Ostrand des Kantons Basel-Stadt knapp 7km Luftlinie nordöstlich der Basler Innenstadt und befindet sich für die Region weithin sichtbar auf dem als Naherholungsraum genutzten Berg St. Chrischona (522m ü.M.), der zum Gebiet der Schweizer Gemeinde Bettingen gehört, auf 492m Höhe etwas unterhalb der Bergspitze.

Obwohl ihr Name auf Äthiopien, das frühere Kaiserreich Abessinien, in Ostafrika als Herkunftsland schließen lässt, liegen ihre Ursprünge in Südostasien., Als Zuchtrasse gibt es die Abessinierkatze seit dem Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts. Hauptzuchtgebiete sind heute die Vereinigten Staaten, Kanada, Australien, Japan und Europa. Abessinierkatzen sind Kurzhaarkatzen in verschiedenen Fellfarben. Typisches Rassemerkmal ist eine zwei-, manchmal auch dreifache Bänderung der Haare. Diese Bänderung wird als \\"Ticking\\" bezeichnet, die daraus entstehende Fellzeichnung als Agouti-Effekt. Diese ist vergleichbar der Fellzeichnung von wilden Hasen und Kaninchen und brachte der Abessinierkatze anfangs den Spitznamen „bunny cat“ (englisch: Hasenkatze) ein., Im Rahmen der Züchtung von Abessinierkatzen entstanden um die Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts auch halblanghaarige Abessinierkatzen. Diese werden als Somali-Katzen bezeichnet und bilden mittlerweile einen eigenen Rassekatzenstandard., Herkunft., Die Abessinierkatze stammt nicht, wie ihr Name vermuten lässt, aus Abessinien, dem heutigen Äthiopien. Auch die Behauptung, dass Abessinierkatzen als Nachfahren der im Alten Ägypten lebenden und dort als göttlich verehrten Katzen gelten, ist dem Bereich der Legende zuzuweisen., Die Vorfahren der heutigen Abessinierkatze stammen mit an Sicherheit grenzender Wahrscheinlichkeit ursprünglich aus den Dschungeln Südostasiens. Denn die lange nur bei dieser Katzenrasse auftretende Mutation des Tabby-Gens „Abessinier-Tabby“ (TA) findet sich bei Katzen an der Küste des Indischen Ozeans zwischen Singapur und Sri Lanka, während es in Ägypten und Ostafrika nicht nachweisbar ist. Der Abessinierkatze ähnelnde Wildkatzenarten in Eurasien, Asien und Afrika sind die Falbkatze (\\"Felis silvestris lybica\\") und die Rohrkatze (\\"Felis chaus\\")., Die bekannte Vorgeschichte der modernen Abessinierkatzenrasse weist in die gleiche Richtung:, Frühe Illustrationen im englischen Katzenjournal aus dem 19. Jahrhundert, welche der Abessinierkatze ähnlich sehen, wurden dort als „asiatische Katzen“ bezeichnet. Ein ausgestopftes Tier mit Merkmalen des TA-Gens aus den 1830er-Jahren existiert nach wie vor als Ausstellungsstück im zoologischen Museum der niederländischen Stadt Leiden. Die grobgesprenkelte wildfarbene Katze, die einer wildfarbenen modernen Abessinierkatze auch vom Exterieur her sehr ähnlich sieht, wird dort als „Patrie, domestica India“ (Indische Hauskatze) bezeichnet., Wahrscheinlich kam es in Einzelfällen zu einer Weiterverbreitung des Ursprungstyps von Südostasien in Richtung Vorderasien beziehungsweise Ostafrika; so vor allem durch englische Händler und Kolonialbeamte innerhalb des Britischen Weltreichs., Geschichte., Die Historie der modernen Katzenrasse „Abessinier“ in Europa beginnt 1868. In einem britischen Katzenbuch von 1874 wird erstmals eine Abessinierkatze erwähnt. Eine kolorierte Lithografie zeigt eine Katze mit gesprenkeltem Fell namens \\"Zula\\" und erläutert in der dazugehörenden Beschreibung: „Zula, die Katze von Frau Captain Barret-Lennard. Die Katze kommt aus Abessinien in Folge des Krieges.“ Da im Mai 1868 britischen Truppen Abessinien verließen und das Land in den Einflussbereich Italiens geriet, liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass \\"Zula\\" als erste Abessinierkatze im Gefolge der englischen Kolonialarmee nach England kam. Wie diese Katze von Südostasien in das damalige Abessinien gelangte und ob es dort eine zeitweilige Population von Katzen mit abessiniertypischen Merkmalen gab, ist unbekannt., Über Zulas historisches Schicksal in England sind keine weiteren Einzelheiten bekannt. Der neue und bis dahin unbekannte Katzentyp erregte aber insbesondere durch den Agouti-Effekt des Fells bei englischen Katzenzüchtern sehr viel Aufsehen. Es kam zu Kreuzungen mit britischen Kurzhaarkatzen, teils Hauskatzen, teils Rassekatzen um der Inzucht entgegenzuwirken. Ein Ergebnis der Kreuzungen waren auch die ersten Abessinierkatzen mit Silberfärbung. Bereits 1871 wurde eine „abessinische“ Katze (wahrscheinlich Zula oder direkte Nachkommen von ihr) bei der ersten öffentlichen Katzenausstellung im Crystal Palace in London ausgestellt und errang den 3. Preis in der Gesamtwertung. 1882 wurde die Abessinierkatze als neue Katzenrasse offiziell anerkannt. Der damalige Präsident des englischen nationalen Katzenklubs, Harrison Weir, definierte 1889 höchstpersönlich den Rassestandard für die Abessinierkatzen. Damit gehört sie zusammen mit den Siam- und Perserkatzen zu den ältesten Rassekatzen der Welt. Bereits einige Jahre nach der Definition des Rassestandards waren die ersten Abessinierkatzen in englischen Zuchtbüchern zu finden. Kurz nach Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts gelangten Abessinierkatzen auch in die USA und wurden dort vermehrt gezüchtet. 1911 erfolgte die Anerkennung der Abessinierzucht in den USA durch die Cat Fanciers’ Association (C.F.A.), der damals wie heute größten in den USA anerkannten Registrierungsstelle für Rassekatzen., In der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts verbreitete sich die Abessinierkatzenzucht weiter in Europa und den USA. Auf beiden Kontinenten arbeiteten die Züchter in den 1930er-Jahren verstärkt an der Selektion von abessiniertypischen Rassemerkmalen. 1926 gründete Major E. Sydney Woodiwiss, ein bekannter englischer Züchter, den ersten \\"Abyssinian Cat Club\\". In Deutschland wurden 1933 die ersten Abessinierkatzen beim damals einzigen deutschen Katzenzuchtverein, dem 1. Deutschen Edelkatzenzüchter-Verband (1. DEKZV e.V.), registriert., Rückschläge in der weiteren Verbreitung und der Zucht der Abessinierkatze gab es durch die beiden Weltkriege. In England, dem damaligen Zentrum der Abessinierkatzenzüchtung in Europa, überlebten lediglich 12 reinrassige Abessinierkatzen und -kater den Zweiten Weltkrieg. Eine Katzen-Leukose-Epidemie in den 1960er-Jahren führte zusätzlich zu den in den beiden Nachkriegszeiten zurückgegangenen Züchter- und Katzenzahlen fast zu einem Aussterben der Abessinierkatzenrasse. Seit den 1970er-Jahren kommt es zu einer langsamen Konsolidierung der Bestandszahlen, die aber bei weitem nicht denen der derzeit populären Katzenrassen wie Maine-Coon, Perser- oder Siamkatzen gleichen., Aussehen., Abessinierkatzen werden aufgrund ihres Aussehens oft als „Miniaturform“ eines Pumas bezeichnet oder auch mit Wildkatzen verglichen. Sie gehören in der Gruppe der Katzen mit Fellzeichnung zu den so genannten „Ticked Tabby-Katzen“, bei denen die Zeichnung des Fells fast vollständig durch den Agouti-Effekt verdrängt wurde. Aufgrund der züchterischen Einflussnahme ist das Tabby-Muster nur noch am Kopf in Form der Augenumrandung und einer M-förmigen Fellzeichnung auf der Stirn erkennbar. Im Idealfall sind Abessinierkatzen aber völlig frei von allen bekannten Zeichnungsmustern wie Tigerung, Stromung oder Tupfung., Die Abessinierkatze ist eine schlanke, muskulöse Kurzhaarkatze von mittlerer Größe. Die Katzen wiegen zwischen 2,5 und 4kg, Kater zwischen 3,5 und 5,0kg. Aufgrund ihrer langen Beine zählt sie, wie beispielsweise auch die Orientalisch Kurzhaar- oder Siamkatze zu den hochbeinigen Katzenrassen. Die Beine enden in kleinen ovalen Pfoten mit einfarbigen Fußballen. Der Schwanz ist relativ lang, breit am Ansatz und schmal zulaufend., Der Kopf hat eine gemäßigte Keilform und sitzt auf einem langen schlanken Hals. Das Profil hat eine sanfte Kontur und die Schnauze ist nicht deutlich zugespitzt. Der mittellange Nasenrücken ist sanft geschwungen, ohne Stop (abrupter Übergang von Schnauzpartie in Stirnpartie) oder „römische Nase“ (nach außen gewölbte Nasenpartie). Die Ohren sind weit auseinanderstehend und weisen manchmal noch Ohrbüschel auf, vergleichbar denen der Luchse. Sie stehen aufrecht, sind im Verhältnis zum Kopf groß und an den Spitzen leicht abgerundet., Die Augen sind groß, mandelförmig und innen umrandet in der gleichen Grundfarbe des Tickings und anschließend im äußeren Bereich der Augenpartie hell umrandet. Die weit auseinanderstehenden Augen können entweder eine bernsteinfarbene (manchmal auch als „gelb“ bezeichnet), nussbraune oder grüne Färbung aufweisen., Das kurze Fell liegt dicht an und weist wenig Unterwolle auf. Auf dem Rücken verläuft der so genannte Aalstrich, ein durchgehend dunkler Farbstreifen im Fell, der in der dunklen Schwanzspitze endet. An den Hinterbeinen bis zur Ferse setzt sich eine dunkle Haarpartie in der Färbung der Gesamtfarbe als sogenannte „Sohlenstreifen“ fort., Das besondere Rassemerkmal der Abessinierkatzen, das „Ticking“ der einzelnen Haare, ist nicht zu übersehen. Jedes Haar ist in der Regel zwei-, manchmal auch drei- oder sogar vierfach gebändert, was in der Fachsprache auch als „getickt“ bezeichnet wird. Welche Farbtöne sich bei der Bänderung abwechseln, hängt von der Farbe der jeweiligen Abessinierkatze ab (siehe Abschnitt „Farben“). Die Haarspitze weist jedoch immer den jeweils dunkelsten Farbschlag auf. Nur die Haare bestimmter Körperbereiche sind getickt: Die des Kopfes, des gesamten Rücken- und Flankenbereiches, des Schwanzes und die an der Außenseite der Beine. Die Haare an der Unterseite des Körpers mit Brust, Bauch und den Innenseiten der Beine sind einheitlich in der Grundfarbe gefärbt., Bei jungen Abessinierkätzchen tritt das Ticking der Haare erst ab der sechsten Woche in Erscheinung, wenn das wollige Babyfell allmählich vom Jugendfell abgelöst wird. Durch das Ticking erscheint das gesamte Fell der Abessinierkatze einheitlich gemustert und dem eines Wildkaninchens oder -hasen ähnlich. Man spricht hierbei auch von dem Agouti-Effekt, wobei für den Begriff Agouti (alternative Schreibweise: Aguti) die Nagetiergattung \\"Dasyprocta\\" (Aguti) namensgebend war. Das Ticking der Haare wird bei Abessinierkatzen homozygot als dominantes Merkmal vererbt (siehe Genotyp unter dem Abschnitt „Farben“)., Charakter., Die Abessinierkatze ist eine intelligente und lebhafte Katze. Eine markante Charaktereigenschaft der Abessinierkatze ist ihre Neugier. Ihren menschlichen Bezugspersonen folgt sie oft auf Schritt und Tritt und beobachtet dessen Aktivitäten. Generell gelten Abessinierkatzen als menschenbezogen und trotzdem unabhängig, ausgeglichen und gesellig.

Der geschlossene 365 GTB/4 und die von ihm abgeleitete Cabrioletversion 365 GTS/4 („Daytona Spider“) gehören zur Modellfamilie Ferrari 365. Sie werden wie deren übrige Mitglieder von einem 4,4 Liter großen Zwölfzylinder-V-Motor angetrieben, haben aber eine eigenständige Karosserie von Pininfarina., Der „Daytona“ war seinerzeit Ferraris Spitzenmodell. Er wird als einer der attraktivsten Straßensportwagen Ferraris angesehen und gehört sowohl in der geschlossenen als auch in der offenen Version zu den hochpreisigen Ferrari-Klassikern. Die Autos gelten mittlerweile als Anlageobjekte, für die siebenstellige Europreise gezahlt werden. Besondere Popularität erlangte der „Daytona“ in den 1980er-Jahren durch die Fernsehserie \\"Miami Vice\\", in der eine Hauptfigur zeitweise die Kopie eines GTS/4 fuhr. Eine Sonderstellung nimmt die Wettbewerbsversion 365 GTB/4 Competizione ein, die von 1971 bis 1981 bei internationalen Langstreckenrennen erfolgreich war., Entstehungsgeschichte und modellpolitische Einordnung., 1961 begann Ferrari, die 1953 eingeführte Modellfamilie 250 durch die Baureihe 330 zu ersetzen, die von 4,0Liter großen Zwölfzylindermotoren angetrieben wurde. Nach und nach erschienen die Modelle 330 America, 330 GT 2+2 und 330 GTC, die unterschiedliche Kundengruppen ansprachen. Als leistungsstärkster Straßen-Ferrari und Spitzenmodell kam ab 1964 der Ferrari 275 GTB hinzu, der ab 1966 mit vier obenliegenden Nockenwellen als 275 GTB/4 verkauft wurde. Ab 1966 ersetzte Ferrari die 330-Reihe schrittweise durch die Modelle der 365-Familie, deren Motoren einen auf 4,4 Liter erhöhten Hubraum hatten. Den Anfang machte das „elitäre“, auf die nordamerikanische Kundschaft zugeschnittene Oberklassefahrzeug 365 California Spyder, von dem nur 14 Exemplare entstanden. Im folgenden Jahr erschien der viersitzige 365 GT 2+2, der als „Familien-Ferrari“ angesehen und wegen seiner Abmessungen und seines Gewichts als „Queen Mary“ verspottet wurde. Als sportliche Variante brachte Ferrari Ende 1967 schließlich den kürzeren 365 GTC auf den Markt., Ein Ersatz für das Spitzenmodell 275 GTB/4 war zunächst nicht vorgesehen. In dieser Klasse hatte Ferraris Konkurrent Lamborghini 1966 mit dem Miura in seinen Wagen den Mittelmotorantrieb eingeführt, der seit einigen Jahren im Automobilsport dominierte. Obwohl Enzo Ferrari diesem Konzept bei Straßensportwagen skeptisch gegenüberstand und auch aus diesem Grund den kleinen Mittelmotorsportwagen Dino 206 nicht unter der Marke Ferrari verkaufen ließ, begannen seine Ingenieure bereits 1966 mit den Entwicklungsarbeiten für einen Hochleistungssportwagen mit Mittelmotor, die letztlich zu dem 1971 vorgestellten 365 GT/4 Berlinetta Boxer führten. Einige Quellen gehen davon aus, dass Enzo Ferrari den zu dieser Zeit noch relativ jungen 275 GTB/4 bis zum Erscheinen des Berlinetta Boxer im Programm belassen wollte. Der Pininfarina-Designer Leonardo Fioravanti behauptete Ende 2017 in einem Zeitungsbeitrag, er sei dem entgegengetreten und habe im Herbst 1966 den Anstoß zur Entwicklung des 365 GTB/4 gegeben. Er habe Enzo Ferrari auf die schlechte Aerodynamik und die „miserable Übersichtlichkeit“ der 275-GTB/4-Karosserie hingewiesen und ihn mit den ersten „Daytona“-Skizzen von der Notwendigkeit überzeugt, den alten 275 GTB/4 abzulösen. Daraufhin kombinierte Ferrari das Fahrgestell des 275 GTB/4 mit einem Motor aus der 365-Baureihe und einer eigenständigen Karosserie zum 365 GTB/4 „Daytona“. Er wird modellpolitisch vielfach als ein bloßes Interimsmodell zwischen dem 275 GTB/4 und dem Berlinetta Boxer angesehen., Mit Blick auf die Konkurrenz war der 365 GTB/4 gegen den Lamborghini Miura gerichtet, der bei seinem Debüt der schnellste und leistungsstärkste Straßensportwagen der Welt war. Ferrari gelang es, die Fahrleistungen des Lamborghini zu übertreffen: Der 365 GTB/4 hatte eine höhere Motorleistung sowie eine höhere Endgeschwindigkeit als der Miura P400. Enzo Ferrari bewies damit, dass ein klassischer Gran Turismo mit Frontmotor schneller sein konnte als ein Mittelmotorsportwagen., Nomenklatur., Die Modellbezeichnung des 365 GTB/4 leitet sich, wie seinerzeit bei Ferrari üblich, von der Motorisierung ab und nimmt auf den in Kubikzentimetern gemessenen Hubraum eines einzelnen Zylinders (hier: 365cm³) Bezug. Der beim Coupé verwendete Buchstabenzusatz GTB ist die Abkürzung von \\"Gran Turismo Berlinetta\\". Die offene Version trägt statt des „B“ den Schlussbuchstaben „S“, der je nach Quelle für \\"Spyder\\" oder \\"Spider\\" steht. Die angehängte Ziffer 4 schließlich ist ein Hinweis auf die Anzahl der Nockenwellen., Das Auto ist allgemein als „Ferrari Daytona“ bekannt. Der Begriff „Daytona“ bezieht sich auf das 24-Stunden-Rennen von Daytona 1967, bei dem die Scuderia Ferrari mit ihren Prototypen 330P4 und 412P auf den Plätzen eins, zwei und drei ins Ziel gekommen war. Er wurde werksseitig nicht verwendet, etablierte sich aber schnell in den Medien. Heute wird er in der Literatur vielfach synonym verwendet bzw. erscheint in Publikationen als gleichberechtigter Zusatz zu dem Ziffern-Buchstaben-Code., Einzelne Quellen gehen davon aus, dass „Daytona“ während der Entwicklungsphase die werksinterne Bezeichnung für das Auto gewesen war und jedenfalls nach anfänglichen Überlegungen auch die offizielle Modellbezeichnung hätte werden sollen. Nachdem aber der Begriff durch eine Indiskretion verfrüht an die Presse gelangt sei, habe Enzo Ferrari aus Verärgerung seine weitere Verwendung untersagt., Entwicklung und Prototypen., Im Dezember 1966 waren die Zeichnungen für die Karosserie des 365 GTB/4 fertig, im Frühjahr 1967 begann die technische Entwicklung., Im Herbst 1967 baute die Carrozzeria Scaglietti die ersten beiden Prototypen auf. Sie hatten noch Übergangskarosserien, die mit dem späteren Serienmodell nicht völlig gleich waren. Beide Fahrzeuge existieren noch., Im Laufe des Jahres 1968 entstanden bei Pininfarina mindestens zwei weitere Prototypen, die äußerlich dem späteren Serien-Coupé entsprachen. Zwei Prototypen aus dieser Gruppe wurden vom 3. bis zum 13. Oktober 1968 auf dem Pariser Autosalon präsentiert, einer (Fahrgestellnummer 11795) auf dem Stand von Pininfarina, der andere (12037) bei Ferrari., Modellbeschreibung., Motor und Kraftübertragung., Der Ferrari 365 GTB/4 und der GTS/4 haben einen 4390cm³ großen Zwölfzylinder-V-Motor, der werksintern als \\"Tipo 251\\" bezeichnet wird. Er geht auf eine Konstruktion von Gioacchino Colombo aus dem Jahr 1947 zurück., Ferrari hatte Colombos Zwölfzylinder zuletzt für die 1961 erschienene Modellfamilie 330 weitgehend überarbeitet; dabei war der Motorblock unter Beibehaltung des Zylinderbankwinkels von 60 Grad neu konstruiert worden. Jener \\"Tipo 209\\" genannte, 4,0Liter große Motor (330cm³ pro Zylinder) wurde für die 365-Reihe auf 4,4 Liter vergrößert. Den Hubraumzuwachs erreichten die Ingenieure durch eine Vergrößerung der Bohrung von 77 auf 81mm. Der Hub blieb mit 71mm unverändert. Dieser Motor erschien 1966 im 365 California Spyder als \\"Tipo 217B\\" und 1967 im 365 GT 2+2 „Queen Mary“ sowie im 365 GTC als \\"Tipo 245\\"., Der Motor \\"Tipo 251\\" des 365 GTB/4 entspricht im Wesentlichen dem \\"Tipo 217B\\" und dem \\"Tipo 245\\". Allerdings hat er im Gegensatz zu ihnen eine Trockensumpfschmierung, die vom 275 GTB/4 übernommen wurde. Eine weitere Besonderheit sind die vier obenliegenden Nockenwellen (zwei für jede Zylinderreihe). Sie werden über zwei Ketten angetrieben. Die Kurbelwelle ist siebenfach gelagert. Zur Gemischaufbereitung werden in den europäischen Autos sechs Fallstrom-Doppelvergaser von Weber (Typ 40DCN20) eingesetzt. Das Verdichtungsverhältnis beträgt 9,3:1. Die in Nordamerika verkauften „Daytonas“ hatten Vergaser vom Typ 40DCN21 und eine auf 8,8:1 reduzierte Verdichtung. Die Höchstleistung des Motors beträgt in beiden Ausführungen bei 7500Umdrehungen pro Minute., Der Motor ist so weit wie möglich nach hinten versetzt eingebaut. Die Kraft wird über eine Trockenkupplung und ein vollsynchronisiertes handgeschaltetes Fünfganggetriebe, das an der Hinterachse positioniert ist (Transaxle-Bauweise), übertragen. Ferrari übernahm die Konstruktion vom Vorgänger 275 GTB/4. Diese Auslegung trägt zu einer nahezu ausgewogenen Gewichtsverteilung bei., Chassis und Fahrwerk., Das Chassis des 365 GTB/4 und GTS/4, das die werksinterne Bezeichnung \\"Tipo 605\\" trägt, entspricht weitgehend dem des 275 GTB/4. Der Radstand und die übrigen Dimensionen stimmen mit denen des Vorgängers überein; lediglich die Spur ist auf Betreiben Leonardo Fioravantis aus optischen Gründen 5mm breiter., Der 365 GTB/4 hat einen Gitterrahmen aus Stahlrohren mit ovalem Querschnitt. Um die Steifigkeit zu erhöhen, sind im Bereich des Passagierraums Querverstrebungen eingebaut. Die Chassiskonstruktion gilt als „simpel, aber robust und bewährt“. Im Bereich der vorderen und hinteren Aufhängung sind Hilfsrahmen montiert., Vorn und hinten sind die Räder einzeln aufgehängt, wie beim Vorgänger an jeweils zwei unterschiedlich langen Querlenkern mit Schraubenfedern, hydraulischen Teleskopstoßdämpfern von Koni und an beiden Achsen Stabilisatoren. An allen Rädern hat der 365 GTB/4 servounterstützte Scheibenbremsen, die einen geringeren Durchmesser haben als die Bremsen des 275 GTB/4. Ferrari versuchte, die daraus resultierende geringere Bremsleistung durch ein neues Innenbelüftungssystem auszugleichen. Einige zeitgenössische Tester beschrieben die Bremsen als sehr effizient und standfest, dazu attestierten sie außergewöhnliche Spurstabilität bei Bremsvorgängen. Andere kritisierten die Bremsen dagegen als zu schwach. Die Räder haben einen Zentralverschluss., Karosserie., Gestaltung., Der Ferrari 365 GTB/4 ist als zweisitziges Fließheckcoupé konzipiert; die Karosserie entwarf Leonardo Fioravanti für Pininfarina angeblich innerhalb einer Woche., Die Proportionen der Karosserie betonen das Frontmotorkonzept des Autos: Der Motorraum ist sehr lang, die Fahrgastzelle dagegen knapp und das Heck kurz und „abrupt endend“. An die Stelle der ovalen Kühlluftöffnung, die die bis dahin gebauten Modelle der 365-Familie hatten, trat ein breiter niedriger Einlass in Form eines Rechtecks, der Beobachter an einen Briefk: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Cabriolet, Coupé, Ferrari-Automobil, Pkw-Modell, Rennwagen, 24-Stunden-Rennen von Le Mans, Sportwagen, Ferrari Daytona, Anlageobjekte, Miami Vice, Enzo Ferrari"},{"instruction":"I'm writing C++ program with Ruby API for Windows OS.

Ihr wissenschaftlicher Name ist aus den altgriechischen Wörtern νήμα \\"nēma\\" „Faden“ und μορφή \\"morphē\\" „Gestalt“ zusammengesetzt. Die mehr als 320 Arten dieser Gruppe leben vor allem im Süßwasser, einige kommen jedoch auch im Meer vor. Die blässlich-weißen bis gräulich-schwarzen, manchmal auch bräunlich bis rötlich gefärbten Würmer sind in der Regel sehr lang und extrem dünn; es können Extremlängen von bis zu zwei Metern erreicht werden wie bei \\"Gordius fulgur\\"; die Tiere haben dabei aber nur einen maximalen Durchmesser von drei Millimetern., Die Jugendformen der Saitenwürmer sind parasitisch. Sie besitzen einen Bohrapparat, mit dem sie sich in den Wirt (meist ein Insekt) einbohren können. Die erwachsenen Tiere verlassen nur zur Eiablage den Wirt und können zu dieser Zeit als Würmerknäuel besonders an Bächen gefunden werden., Forschungsgeschichte., Die Saitenwürmer gehören zu den Tiergruppen, die in der Forschung bislang weitestgehend ignoriert wurden. Entsprechend wenig ist über diese Tiergruppe im Vergleich zu anderen Taxa bekannt. Die erste eindeutige Erwähnung fand ein Saitenwurm in der \\"Historia Animalium\\" (1551–1587) von Conrad Gessner, wo die Saitenwürmer gemäß dem volkstümlichen Namen als Wasserkalb oder lateinisch \\"Vitulus aquaticus\\" bezeichnet werden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt gab es die typische, 1758 mit der bekannten 10. Auflage der \\"Systema Naturae\\" von Carl von Linné erfolgte zweiteilige Namensgebung allerdings noch nicht. Innerhalb der Würmer ordnet Linné ein Tier mit dem Namen \\"Gordius aquaticus\\" ein, benannt nach dem Gordischen Knoten. Er bezog sich damit auf den zu Beginn des 17. Jahrhunderts durch Aldrovandus angestellten Vergleich eines Knäuels Würmer mit dem berühmten Knoten der griechischen Mythologie., In der Folgezeit wurden der Gattung \\"Gordius\\" sowohl freilebende Saitenwürmer als auch parasitische Formen der Insekten zugeordnet, letztere wurden 1788 von den freilebenden \\"Gordius\\"-Arten als \\"Filaria\\" abgespalten. Erst durch eine Reihe von neuen Beobachtungen konnte allerdings geklärt werden, dass die Intestinalfilarien mit den freilebenden Würmern identisch waren. So konnte etwa F. Dujardin 1842 beobachten, wie ein Saitenwurm aus einem Insekt in das freie Wasser überging. Er nannte dieses neu entdeckte Tier \\"Mermis\\" und klärte auf, dass zumindest bei diesem Wurm eine parasitische und eine freilebende Entwicklungsphase bestehen. Dass der \\"Mermis\\" allerdings nicht in die Verwandtschaft der \\"Gordius\\"-Arten gehörte, war damals noch unbekannt, erst 1886 wurde er zu den Fadenwürmern (heute in der Familie der Mermithidae) gestellt. 1849 und 1851 konnten von E.Grube und J.Leidy auch die morphologisch abweichenden Larven der Saitenwürmer entdeckt werden. Etwa zur gleichen Zeit wurden auch die ersten Beiträge über die innere Anatomie der Tiere publiziert (F. Dujardin 1842, A. A. Berthold 1843, G. Meissner 1856)., 1847 beschrieb Friedrich Heinrich Creplin eine zweite Gattung der Saitenwürmer, die er \\"Chordodes\\" nannte; Addison Emery Verrill (1879) beschrieb als erster einen meereslebenden Saitenwurm, der von ihm den Namen \\"Nectonema agile\\" bekam. Diese Meeressaitenwürmer wurden 1887 von F. Vejdovsky mit den „Gordiacea“ zu den Nematomorpha zusammengefasst. Zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts kam eine Reihe neuer Arten hinzu, die vor allem durch die Expeditionen in verschiedene Erdteile gefunden wurden. Camerano, einer der erfolgreichsten Bearbeiter der Gruppe, führte entsprechend 1897 mit \\"Parachordodes\\" und \\"Paragordius\\" zwei neue Gattungen ein, alle weiteren Gattungsbezeichnungen kamen im Laufe des 20. Jahrhunderts hinzu., Genauere Kenntnis über die Anatomie der Tiere gewann man erst in der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts, in der verschiedene Saitenwürmer histologisch und mit Hilfe der Transmissionselektronenmikroskopie (TEM) untersucht wurden. Die Rasterelektronenmikroskopie (REM) wurde vor allem für die Identifizierung und Bestimmung der Tiere ein unverzichtbares Werkzeug. Zu den bekanntesten Nematomorphenforschern der heutigen Zeit zählen der am Zoologischen Museum der Universität Hamburg tätige Andreas Schmidt-Rhaesa, der vor allem die evolutionären Zusammenhänge innerhalb der Saitenwürmer aufklären möchte, sowie Ben Hanelt (Lincoln, USA), Fred Thomas (Montpellier, Frankreich) und Cristina de Villalobos (La Plata, Argentinien)., Anatomie der Saitenwürmer., Anatomie der ausgewachsenen Würmer., Die Saitenwürmer ähneln im Aufbau sehr stark den Fadenwürmern, deren Schwestergruppe sie darstellen. Der Körper ist langgestreckt, drehrund und unsegmentiert. Die Körperlänge beträgt im Extremfall bis zu zwei Meter; bei den meisten Arten liegt sie allerdings bei durchschnittlich fünf bis zehn Zentimetern. Der Durchmesser liegt bei niedrigen 0,5 bis 3 Millimetern., Sowohl die marinen \\"Nectonema\\"-Arten als auch die süßwasserlebenden, als \\"limnisch\\" bezeichneten Arten weisen einen deutlichen Sexualdimorphismus auf:, Das Vorderende der meisten Saitenwürmer ist abgerundet, es kann jedoch auch „abgeschnitten“ oder zugespitzt sein. Viele Arten zeichnen sich durch eine weiße Vorderspitze und einen darauf folgenden dunklen Ring aus, dahinter beginnt die eigentliche Körperfärbung., Die äußere Umhüllung der Tiere besteht aus einer nicht aus Zellen aufgebauten Außenschicht, der Cuticula, der darunterliegenden Epidermis und einer Muskelzellenschicht, die ausschließlich aus Längsmuskulatur besteht:, Ein Hartskelett existiert bei Saitenwürmern nicht; dessen Funktion wird von einem sogenannten hydrostatischen Skelett übernommen, das durch hohen Flüssigkeitsdruck in der Leibeshöhle, dem Pseudocoel, gebildet wird. Die Cuticula kann dadurch als Gegenspieler (Antagonist) der Längsmuskulatur wirken und erlaubt auf diese Weise die Schlängelbewegungen, mit denen sich die Würmer fortbewegen., Das Nervensystem der Saitenwürmer besteht aus einem am Kopfende der Tiere befindlichen Nervenring um den Darm, der das Gehirn der Tiere bildet, einem bauchseitigen Markstrang, von dem Nervenfasern zu den Muskelzellen ziehen und einem Ganglion im Bereich der Afteröffnung (Kloakenganglion). Besonders am Vorder- und Hinterende der Tiere finden sich einfach gebaute Sinnesorgane, die Sensillen. Die Wahrnehmung von Licht wird durch mit einer schwarzen Pigmentschicht ausgekleidete Grübchen unterhalb der an dieser Stelle durchsichtigen Cuticula ermöglicht., Der Darm ist bei allen Arten und in allen Lebensstadien weitgehend zurückgebildet und dient nicht der Nahrungsaufnahme; Mund und Anus sind meist nicht existent. Ob der Darm noch eine wichtige Funktion besitzt, ist bislang ungeklärt; wahrscheinlich dient er bei einigen Arten der Exkretion, daneben werden wohl auch Nährstoffe dort gespeichert. Die Ernährung erfolgt bei den Larven und Jungwürmern über die Epidermis, ausgewachsene Würmer nehmen keine Nahrung zu sich. Spezielle Ausscheidungsorgane existieren bei den Saitenwürmern nicht., Zwischen der Muskelschicht an der Außenseite und dem Darm sowie dessen Aufhängebändern besteht ein mit Flüssigkeit sowie einer aus Kollagenfasern bestehenden Matrix gefüllter Hohlraum, der als Leibeshöhle bezeichnet wird. Da diese nicht von einer einlagigen Schicht umhüllt ist (gemeinhin als Coelom bezeichnet), spricht man bei dieser Form der Leibeshöhle von einem Pseudocoel. Bei den Süßwasserarten ist die Leibeshöhle durch seitliche Gewebslappen in hintereinanderliegende „Taschen“ aufgeteilt, in denen Keimgewebe liegen. Die Tiere sind getrenntgeschlechtlich und besitzen mit Ausnahme der \\"Nectonema\\"-Arten paarige Ovare und Hoden. Bei beiden Geschlechtern münden die Geschlechtsgänge in der Kloake, also einer gemeinsamen Körperöffnung mit dem Darm., Anatomie der Larven., Die Larven der Saitenwürmer sind vollkommen anders aufgebaut als die erwachsenen Würmer. Sie sind in der Regel zwischen 50 und 150 Mikrometer lang und bestehen aus einem Vorderabschnitt mit einem ausstülpbaren Mundkegel sowie einem Hinterleib, der neben einem Darmrest auch eine große Speicheldrüse enthält. Diese beiden Körperabschnitte sind durch ein Häutchen (Septum) voneinander getrennt., Die Speicheldrüse ist über einen langen Gang mit dem rüsselartigen Mundkegel verbunden. Dieser kann über einen hydrostatischen Druck, der durch Muskulatur im Vorderkörper erzeugt wird, ausgestülpt werden und besitzt am Vorderende einen Bohrapparat sowie seitliche Dornen, die eine Verankerung im Gewebe des Wirtes ermöglichen, die zum Eindringen notwendig ist., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Saitenwürmer sind mit Ausnahme der Antarktis auf allen Kontinenten nachgewiesen worden. Die bislang bekannten Arten stellen allerdings wahrscheinlich nur einen Teil der tatsächlich existierenden Arten dar, besonders aus den Tropen und Subtropen werden noch weitere Entdeckungen erwartet. In Deutschland gibt es derzeit 40 beschriebene Saitenwurmarten, weltweit sind es etwa 300 Arten. In Europa sind etwa 100 Arten bekannt, wobei einzelne Vertreter auch auf den zugehörigen Inseln wie Madeira, Teneriffa oder den Shetland-Inseln gefunden wurden. Die afrikanischen Arten stammen überwiegend aus der Republik Kongo, weite Teile des Kontinents sind auf diese Tiere noch nicht besammelt worden. Entsprechend bilden die etwa 70 bekannten Arten wohl nur einen Teil des afrikanischen Spektrums. Ebenfalls überwiegend unbesammelt ist Asien, von wo etwa 100 Arten bekannt sind. In Australien wurden bislang sieben, in Neuseeland sechs Arten gefunden, aus Süd- und Mittelamerika sind etwa 70 Arten bekannt und aus Nordamerika nur 16. Hinzu kommen vier Meeresarten der Gattung \\"Nectonema\\", die an unterschiedlichen Küsten gefunden wurden, im Mittelmeer, im Nordwest-Pazifik, an den Küsten Neuseelands und im Südatlantik., Die süßwasserlebenden Arten leben in kleinen Pfützen, Tümpeln, Bächen, Flüssen bis hin zu Seen sowie in feuchten Böden. Es ist anzunehmen, dass ihre Verbreitung in diesen Gewässern weniger von den Vorlieben der Tiere abhängt als davon, in welche Gewässer sie von ihren Wirten gebracht werden. Austrocknende Kleinstgewässer wie Pfützen könnten für die Saitenwürmer eine Sackgasse darstellen; es ist b: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Parasit - Wirbellose - Saitenwürmer - Nematomorpha - Jugendformen - Forschungsgeschichte - Gattungen - Anatomie - Larven - Verbreitung und Lebensraum"},{"instruction":"Analise as afirmativas a seguir, relativas às regras específicas aplicáveis a itens relacionados à inovação e à pesquisa, conforme disposto na Lei nº 8.666/1993.

Die Listspinne ist in ganz Europa verbreitet. Sie wurde 2002 von der Arachnologischen Gesellschaft e.V. zur Spinne des Jahres gewählt., Aussehen., Ein auffälliges Merkmal der Listspinne sind die langen Beine, von denen das vierte das längste ist (Beinformel 4-2-1-3, der Größe nach geordnet), und der schlanke Hinterleib. Männchen haben eine Länge von 10 bis 13mm, Weibchen sind 12 bis 15mm lang. Nach der Adulthäutung wiegen Männchen im Mittel 54mg, Weibchen 68mg., Der Vorderkörper (Prosoma) hat eine sehr variable Grundfärbung, die von Hellbraun über meist Rotbraun und Grau bis Schwarz reicht. Er trägt in der Mitte einen hellen, deutlich abgesetzten Längsstrich. Der Hinterkörper (Opisthosoma) ist lang und schmal, nach hinten verjüngt und auf dem Rücken mit einer breiten, dunkel gerandeten Zackenbinde versehen., Die Weibchen besitzen mittig auf der Unterseite des Hinterleibs einen aufgrund stärkerer Sklerotisierung der inneren und äußeren Strukturen auffallend dunklen Bereich (Epigyne) mit den beiden Begattungsöffnungen. Bei den Männchen ist die an der gleichen Stelle liegende Geschlechtsöffnung unauffällig. Bei der Listspinne variieren Zeichnungsmuster und Farben des Hinterleibs (Farbpolymorphismus), was schon Hahn (1827, 1834), Bösenberg (1903) und Le Pape (1972) hervorhebend beschrieben. Diese Zeichnung, die sowohl durch Haare als auch Hautpigmente hervorgerufen wird, ändert sich mit dem Heranwachsen (Ontogenese). Pénicaud (1979) fand fünf Typen in der bretonischen Population bei Rennes. Am verbreitetsten war Typ 3, gefolgt von 2, 5 (überwiegend Weibchen) und 1 (überwiegend Männchen): Typ 1 (Rosa und Schwarz), Typ 2 (gelbes Band), Typ 3 (blasses Zickzackmuster), Typ 4 (zwei Spangen) und Typ 5 (sechs Flecken)., Männchen sind kontrastreicher als Weibchen gefärbt und erscheinen, vor allem im Kontrast zum weißen Brautgeschenk, schwarz. Weibchen werden oft zum Ende des Sommers blasser. Die Längsstreifen auf Vorderkörper und Hinterleib sind in allen Farbvarianten vorhanden. Sie wird als kryptische Färbung und auch als Schutzanpassung an optisch jagende Feinde gesehen., Die Kiefertaster (Pedipalpen), also das zweite Gliedmaßenpaar, sind bei Nymphen und Weibchen beinartig, bei Männchen am Fuß verdickt (Bulbus). Am Ende der Verdickung findet sich der Eindringer (Embolus), der das Sperma nach der Aufnahme vom Spermanetz bis zur Paarung aufbewahrt. Am äußeren Chelicerengrundglied befinden sich nur drei Zähne., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Die Listspinne ist in ganz Europa verbreitet. Nach Blandin (1976) kommt sie außerdem auf den Kanarischen Inseln und Madeira, im asiatischen Teil Russlands, in China und ganz Nordafrika vor. Während Roewer (1954) ihr Vorkommen für die ganze Paläarktis beschreibt, nimmt die Listspinne nach Pénicaud (1979) nur den westlichen Bereich des paläarktischen Verbreitungsgebiets der Gattung Pisaura ein. Seit Brignoli (1984) die Variationen der Weibchen beschrieben hat, ist die Verbreitung von \\"Pisaura mirabilis\\" außerhalb Europas höchst umstritten., Die Listspinne besiedelt fast alle Habitate, bevorzugt jedoch feuchte Lebensräume wie Feuchtwiesen, Niedermoore, Salzwiesen, Dünenbereiche, Waldränder und feuchte Hecken (Knicks). Sie kommt in allen Höhenschichten (Strata) vom Boden bis zu den Baumkronen vor. Lediglich unter Steinen und in Höhlen fehlt sie. Die Listspinne ist in Höhenlagen bis heimisch., Lebensweise., Die Listspinne hat ihre Fortpflanzungsperiode im Frühjahr und Sommer. In der Regel erfolgen auch Eiablage und Kokonherstellung in dieser Zeit. Die Jungtiere überwintern. Die Listspinne fängt am Tag und in der Nacht Beute. An warmen Tagen ist sie auch im Winter aktiv., Entwicklung., Die Listspinne entwickelt sich aus einem befruchteten Ei innerhalb des Kokons zum Embryo. Nach der Umrollung des Embryos entsteht die so genannte Prälarve. Diese häutet sich fast gleichzeitig mit dem Verlassen der Eihülle. In diesem ersten Stadium ist die junge Listspinne noch haarlos, klauenlos, ohne funktionierende Sinnesorgane und unbeweglich. Nach einigen Stunden erfolgt dann die Häutung zur Larve. Diese ist farblos, aber beweglich und kann schon Sinnesreize aus der Umwelt wahrnehmen. Sie hat keine Augen und ihre Cheliceren haben nur eine kurze scharfe Spitze. Zudem hat sie einige Tasthaare an den Füßen., Je nach Temperatur häutet sich die Listspinne nach 4,5 bis 7,5 Tagen zur Nymphe 1. Sie verlässt den Kokon nach dem Öffnen durch die Mutter und lebt zunächst im Kinderstubennetz, das das Weibchen aus dem Glockengewebe gefertigt hat. Dort nimmt sie noch keine feste Nahrung zu sich, sondern zehrt weiter von ihren Dotterreserven. Zudem trinkt sie an Wassertropfen. Nach ungefähr einer Woche beginnt die Nymphe sich in ein selbstständiges Leben im ersten eigenen Netz abzuseilen. Der Übergang findet meist im sechsten oder siebten Stadium statt. Nun kann sie bereits Fruchtfliegen überwältigen. Kannibalismus tritt in den ersten Tagen nicht auf. Während ihrer Nymphonal-Imaginalperiode durchläuft die Listspinne maximal zwölf Stadien. Männchen werden mit dem neunten bis elften Stadium geschlechtsreif, Weibchen mit dem zehnten bis zwölften Stadium. Kühle Witterung verzögert die Entwicklung. Alle Stadien produzieren einen Sicherheitsfaden, an dem sie sich bei Gefahr abseilen., Von dem Stadium der Prälarve bis zur letzten Häutung (Adulthäutung) beträgt die Lebensdauer im Mittel 257 Tage für ein Männchen (Stadium 10) und 289 Tage für ein Weibchen (Stadium 11). Das Adultalter ist der Zeitraum von der letzten Häutung bis zum Tod. Weibchen werden deutlich älter als Männchen. Der Rekord liegt für Weibchen bei 247 Tagen und für Männchen bei 186,5 Tagen., In Abhängigkeit vom Verbreitungsgebiet überwintert die Listspinne als Nymphe ein- oder zweimal. Sie verbringt die Zeit der Winterruhe (Diapause) in Bodennähe in der Vegetation unter Laub, Moosen und Steinen. Auch in Garagen und Häusern übersteht sie den Winter. In Südfrankreich überwintern einzelne Exemplare unter lockerer Rinde von Platanen. Dort treten die Nymphen des Stadiums 6-8, meist 7 im November die Winterruhe an und nehmen ihre Entwicklung wieder Ende Februar/Anfang März auf., In West- und Mitteleuropa erreicht die Listspinne ihre Geschlechtsreife im Mai, so dass dann Spermaaufnahme, Brautgeschenkherstellung, Weibchensuche, erste sexuelle Erregung, Balz und Paarung stattfinden. In Nord- und Osteuropa treten geschlechtsreife Listspinnen erst ab Juni auf, während sie in Südeuropa die Geschlechtsreife schon im April erreichen., In Südeuropa hat die Listspinne einen einjährigen Jahreszyklus. Sie wächst im Sommer heran, macht eine Ruhepause mit Häutungsstopp im Winter, wird im Frühling erwachsen, pflanzt sich fort und stirbt spätestens im Herbst. Ihr Nachwuchs ist im nächsten Frühjahr geschlechtsreif. Im nördlichen Verbreitungsgebiet dauert die Entwicklung zwei Jahre, da die Nymphen zweimal überwintern müssen, bis sie geschlechtsreif sind. In Mittel- und Westeuropa gibt es eine Mischform von ein- und zweijähriger Entwicklung. Zwei Monate haben die Männchen Zeit, sich fortzupflanzen, dreieinhalb Monate die Weibchen., Fressfeinde, Parasiten und Krankheitserreger., Die Listspinne hat zahlreiche Fressfeinde. Dazu zählen Wegwespen, Laubfrösche, Eidechsen und Singvögel am Tag sowie Kröten, Spitzmäuse und Fledermäuse in der Nacht. Aber auch andere Spinnenarten stellen Gefahren dar. In Südeuropa kommen weitere Feinde wie die Gottesanbeterinnen hinzu. Gelegentlich wird die Listspinne auch von Krabbenspinnen erbeutet. Zudem kommt Kannibalismus vor., Die Listspinne ist auch oft ein Opfer von Parasiten und Parasitoiden. Dies sind vor allem Fadenwürmer, Grabwespen, Schlupfwespen, Wegwespen und Spinnenfliegen. Auch Erzwespen, Mückenhafte und weitere Fliegen aus anderen Familien sowie Milben parasitieren diese Spinne. Die Parasiten befallen sowohl die Tiere selbst als auch die Eier in den Kokons. Letzteres kann zur vollständigen Vernichtung eines Geleges führen., Die Listspinne wird sowohl von Baculoviren als auch Rickettsien befallen. Beide gelangen höchstwahrscheinlich über Insektenbeute in das Darmsystem. Nicht nur Nymphen und erwachsene Tiere können infiziert werden, sondern auch die Stadien im Kokon. Pilzinfektionen sind bei der Listspinne bisher nicht bekannt., Verhalten., Die Listspinne bewohnt in ihrer Jugend ein Netz und spinnt später selbst verschiedenartige Netze. Männchen stellen Spermanetze her, Weibchen fertigen Eikokons sowie Glockengespinste und Kinderstubennetze. Sowohl Männchen als auch Nymphen und Weibchen umspinnen ihre Beute., Netzaufbau., Die Listspinne baut ihr Netz in der Krautschicht und fixiert es an Gräsern und krautigen Pflanzen. Charakteristisch ist die Position des Netzzentrums und somit der Spinne im unteren Winkel. Sie sitzt dabei kopfunter, nach oben und nach einer Seite hin von Pflanzenteilen geschützt und verdeckt., Typisch für das Netz der Listspinne ist ein zentraler, von einem Fadengeflecht umgebener ellipsoider Freiraum (Oval), den sie selten verlässt und in dem sie auf Beute lauert. Das Oval misst in der Längsachse das eineinhalb- bis zweifache der Körperlänge, in Breite und Höhe das einhalb- bis eineinhalbfache der Spinne. Vom Ovalrand aus laufen kreuzende Spannfäden in die Umgebung, die den zentralen ovalen Raum auch bei Bewegungen der umgebenden Grashalme, Blätter oder Zweige dauerhaft konstant erhalten. In diesem Netzbereich sind Fäden zu finden, die einer Perlenschnur ähneln. Auf beiden Seiten der Ovalöffnung formen Fäden eine trichterförmige Struktur. Ein Teil dieses Netzbereiches (Warte) gibt der Spinne Halt und ist auch noch bei erwachsenen Tieren zu finden. Form und Ausdehnung des Netzes variieren in Anpassung an die Umgebung beträchtlich, aber die drei Hauptelemente Oval, trichterförmige Fußstütze und fächerförmig ausgebreiteter Bereich sind immer vorhanden., Wohn- und Jagdnetz., Die Listspinne sitzt im Netzoval in der charakteristischen Lauerstellung kopfunter mit dem Bauch zum Pflanzenstängel. Sie hat einen Sicherheitsfaden im oberen Bereich des Ovals: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Jagdspinnen, Listspinne, Pisaura mirabilis, Raubspinne, Brautgeschenkspinne, Lycosoidea, Europa, Aussehen, Verbreitung, Entwicklung"},{"instruction":"In this script, Paul’s female friends are having a few friends round at their flat.

Cite and Include references not more than 5 years old in APA format","output":"Introduction Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic immune response to infection, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal units worldwide. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial for improving outcomes in neonates with sepsis. Currently, blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosing sepsis; however, it often has limitations such as long turnaround time and low sensitivity, especially in neonates. Therefore, alternative biomarkers that can aid in the early detection and monitoring of sepsis are urgently needed. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have emerged as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. PCT, a precursor molecule of calcitonin, is produced in response to systemic bacterial infections. CRP, an acute-phase reactant synthesized by the liver, increases in response to inflammatory processes. Several studies have reported the diagnostic accuracy of PCT and CRP individually in neonatal sepsis. However, limited studies have investigated the correlation between these biomarkers and the signs of sepsis in neonatal units. The purpose of this study is to examine the correlation of signs of sepsis with serum PCT and CRP results in a neonatal unit. By evaluating the association between clinical signs and these biomarkers, we aim to determine their diagnostic value and potential for early detection of neonatal sepsis. This knowledge can facilitate timely interventions, appropriate use of antibiotics, and improved management of septic neonates. To achieve our objectives, we will conduct a prospective observational study in a neonatal unit over a period of 12 months. We will collect data on clinical signs of sepsis such as temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, and abnormal laboratory findings. Serum samples will be obtained from neonates suspected of having sepsis, and PCT and CRP levels will be measured using standardized laboratory techniques. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing literature by providing new insights into the correlation between signs of sepsis and the serum levels of PCT and CRP in neonates. The potential of PCT and CRP as diagnostic biomarkers for neonatal sepsis will be further explored, with the aim of improving sepsis management and reducing associated morbidity and mortality rates in neonatal units. In conclusion, this study aims to investigate the correlation of signs of sepsis with serum PCT and CRP results in a neonatal unit. The results will help determine the diagnostic value of these biomarkers in the early detection of neonatal sepsis. The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve clinical outcomes and guide appropriate management strategies for septic neonates. References: 1.

A prospective cohort design was employed, which involved the collection of data over a period of six months. The study was conducted at a neonatal unit in a tertiary care hospital. Participants: The study included all neonates (n=150) admitted to the neonatal unit during the data collection period. The inclusion criteria were neonates aged less than 28 days, while those with major congenital anomalies or those on antibiotic treatment for more than 48 hours prior to admission were excluded. Data Collection: Demographic and clinical data were recorded for each neonate using a standardized data collection form. The signs of sepsis, including temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, and abnormal blood pressure, were assessed by the nursing staff every 4 hours. The presence of these signs was recorded as “yes” or “no” for each neonate. Additionally, blood samples were drawn from each neonate within 24 hours of admission for PCT and CRP measurements. Laboratory Analysis: Blood samples were sent to the hospital laboratory for the analysis of PCT and CRP levels. PCT was measured using an enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay (LFI) method, while CRP was analyzed using a high-sensitivity turbidimetric immunoassay. Both PCT and CRP measurements were obtained within 4 hours of blood collection. Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages, were used to summarize the demographic variables, signs of sepsis, and laboratory results. Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between the signs of sepsis and the PCT and CRP levels. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethical Considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital’s Ethics Committee (approval number: [insert approval number]). Informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the neonates prior to enrollment in the study. The confidentiality of all participants was ensured by assigning unique identification numbers to each neonate. References: Gupta V, Datta P, Rana DS, Chaturvedi P.

Der Alkoholgehalt liegt üblicherweise zwischen 45 und 89 Volumenprozent und ist demnach dem oberen Bereich der Spirituosen zuzuordnen. Aufgrund der Verwendung bitter schmeckender Kräuter, insbesondere von Wermut, gilt Absinth als Bitterspirituose, obwohl er nicht unbedingt bitter schmeckt., Absinth wurde ursprünglich im 18. Jahrhundert im Val de Travers im heutigen Schweizer Kanton Neuenburg \\"(République et Canton de Neuchâtel)\\" als Heilmittel hergestellt. Große Popularität fand diese Spirituose, die traditionell mit Wasser vermengt getrunken wird, in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. und dem frühen 20. Jahrhundert in Frankreich. Zu den berühmten Absinth-Trinkern zählten Charles Baudelaire, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Ernest Hemingway, Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Rimbaud, Aleister Crowley, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec und Oscar Wilde., Auf dem Höhepunkt seiner Popularität stand das Getränk in dem Ruf, aufgrund seines Thujon-Gehalts abhängig zu machen und schwerwiegende gesundheitliche Schäden hervorzurufen. Ab 1915 war das Getränk in einer Reihe europäischer Staaten und den USA verboten. Moderne Studien haben eine Schädigung durch Absinthkonsum über die Wirkung von Alkohol hinaus nicht nachweisen können; die damals festgestellten gesundheitlichen Schäden werden heute auf die schlechte Qualität des Alkohols und die hohen konsumierten Alkoholmengen zurückgeführt. Seit 1998 ist Absinth in den meisten europäischen Staaten wieder erhältlich. Auch in der Schweiz sind seit 2005 die Herstellung und der Verkauf von Absinth wieder erlaubt., Inhaltsstoffe., Verwendete Kräuter., Außer Wermut (\\"Artemisia absinthium\\") enthält in Frankreich und der Schweiz hergestellter Absinth Anis, teilweise ersetzt durch den preisgünstigeren Sternanis, Fenchel, Ysop, Zitronenmelisse und pontischen Wermut. Varianten verwenden auch Angelika, Kalmus, \\"Origanum dictamnus\\", Koriander, Veronica, Wacholder, Muskat und verschiedene weitere Kräuter. Wermut, Anis und Fenchel machen den typischen Geschmack des Absinths aus. Die übrigen Gewürze dienen der geschmacklichen Abrundung. Die grüne Farbe, die viele Absinthsorten aufweisen, stammt vom Chlorophyll in pontischem Wermut, Ysop, Melisse und Minze., Thujon., Thujon ist ein Bestandteil des ätherischen Öls des Wermuts, das für die Absinthherstellung verwendet wird. Die schädlichen Auswirkungen, die während des Höhepunkts der Absinth-Popularität im 19. Jahrhundert in Frankreich zu beobachten waren und zu denen unter anderem Schwindel, Halluzinationen, Wahnvorstellungen, Depressionen, Krämpfe, Blindheit sowie geistiger und körperlicher Verfall gehörten, wurden auf diese Substanz zurückgeführt. Thujon ist ein Nervengift, das in höherer Dosierung Verwirrtheit und epileptische Krämpfe (Konvulsionen) hervorrufen kann. Aus diesem Grund wurde in der Europäischen Union der Thujongehalt in alkoholischen Getränken begrenzt (5mg/kg in alkoholischen Getränken mit einem Alkoholgehalt von bis zu 25 % vol. und bis zu 10mg/kg in alkoholischen Getränken mit einem Alkoholgehalt von mehr als 25 % vol. sowie bis zu 35mg/kg in Bitter-Spirituosen.), Die insbesondere in Tierexperimenten des 19. Jahrhunderts beobachtete konvulsive Wirkung des Absinths wird heute auf eine Blockierung von GABAA-Rezeptoren und eine Desensibilisierung von Serotonin-5-HT3-Rezeptoren durch Thujon zurückgeführt. Es ist jedoch inzwischen widerlegt, dass die im Absinth enthaltene Thujonmenge ausreicht, um in diesem Maße pharmakodynamisch zu wirken. Als Ursache oder wesentlicher Faktor eher wahrscheinlich ist der im Absinth enthaltene Alkohol. Auch ein möglicher gemeinsamer Wirkmechanismus mit dem Cannabis-Wirkstoff Tetrahydrocannabinol über eine Aktivierung von Cannabinoid-Rezeptoren konnte nicht bestätigt werden. Eine in der Clubszene und in den Medien proklamierte euphorisierende und aphrodisierende Wirkung heutiger Absinthe kann anhand dieser experimentellen Daten nicht auf die in diesen Getränken enthaltene Thujondosis zurückgeführt werden., Der Absinth des 19. Jahrhunderts hatte entgegen früheren Berichten, die von bis zu 350 Milligramm je Liter sprachen, im Wesentlichen keinen höheren Thujongehalt als die heutigen reglementierten Absinthe. In einer Untersuchung von Absinthen auf Basis historischer Rezepte und Prozesse und von 1930 hergestelltem Absinth konnten nur Thujonmengen von unter 10 mg/kg nachgewiesen werden. Der Thujongehalt kann jedoch höher liegen, wenn Wermutauszüge oder Wermutöle zugesetzt werden. Die Absinthe werden auf diese Weise jedoch sehr bitter., Alkohol., Der Alkoholgehalt historischer Absinthe lag zwischen 45 und 78 %. In diesem Bereich befinden sich mit wenigen Ausnahmen auch die heute erhältlichen Absinthsorten. Absinth ist aber auch mit einem Alkoholgehalt von bis zu 90 % erhältlich. Wegen des hohen Alkoholgehalts wird Absinth in der Regel verdünnt getrunken., Historisch belegt sind fünf Qualitätsgrade: \\"Absinthe des essences\\" („Absinth-Auszüge“), \\"Absinthe ordinaire\\" („gewöhnlicher Absinth“), \\"Absinthe demi-fine\\" („Absinth halb-fein“), \\"Absinthe fine\\" („Absinth fein“) und \\"Absinthe Suisse\\" („Schweizer Absinth“), wobei \\"Absinthe des essences\\" den geringsten Alkoholgehalt und die niedrigste Qualität repräsentiert. \\"Absinthe Suisse\\" verweist nicht auf das Herstellungsland, sondern auf einen besonders hohen Alkoholgehalt und hohe Qualität., Rückblickend wird heute nicht mehr Thujon, sondern der Alkoholgehalt des Absinths als die vorrangige Ursache des im 19. und Anfang des 20.Jahrhunderts verbreiteten \\"Absinthismus\\" angesehen. 1914 lag die von erwachsenen Franzosen pro Kopf konsumierte reine Alkoholmenge bei jährlich 30Litern. Im Vergleich dazu führt heute (2013, laut WHO) Moldau mit 18,22Litern reinem Alkohol pro Erwachsenem weltweit die Statistiken des Alkoholkonsums an. Die Symptome des Absinthismus unterscheiden sich nicht von denen eines chronischen Alkoholmissbrauchs (Alkoholismus)., Andere Inhaltsstoffe., Ein zusätzliches Problem des Absinths des 19. Jahrhunderts war, dass der verwendete Alkohol oft minderwertig war und viel Amylalkohol und andere Fuselöle enthielt. Auch Methanol, das Schwindel, Kopfschmerzen und Übelkeit bewirkt und als Spätfolge Erblindung, Schüttellähmung oder bei einer Überdosis den Tod nach sich zieht, war im damaligen Absinth enthalten. Um dem Absinth seine charakteristische Farbe zu verleihen, wurden bisweilen Zusatzstoffe wie Anilingrün, Kupfersulfat, Kupferacetat und Indigo zugesetzt. Ebenso wurde Antimontrichlorid hinzugefügt, um den Louche-Effekt (die milchige Trübung des sonst klaren Getränks, wenn es mit Wasser verdünnt oder sehr stark gekühlt wird) hervorzurufen. Jedoch lagen die in historischen Proben gefundenen Konzentrationen potenzieller Schadstoffe wie Pinocamphon, Fenchon, Alkoholverunreinigungen, Kupfer- und Antimon-Ionen in einem für den Rückschluss auf Absinthismus unverdächtigen Bereich., Herstellung., Bei der Herstellung werden Wermut, Anis und Fenchel in Neutralalkohol oder Weinalkohol mazeriert (eingeweicht) und anschließend destilliert. Die Destillation trägt dazu bei, die starken Bitterstoffe des Wermuts abzutrennen. Diese sind weniger flüchtig als die Aromastoffe und bleiben bei der Destillation zurück. Andernfalls wäre das Ergebnis unangenehm bis ungenießbar bitter. Eine unverhältnismäßige Bitterkeit bei Absinth kann ein Indiz dafür sein, dass bei der Produktion auf die Destillation ganz oder teilweise verzichtet wurde, bei der Herstellung Wermutextrakte verwendet wurden und es sich um minderwertigen beziehungsweise unechten Absinth handeln könnte., Das Destillat kann mit Kräutern wie Pontischem Wermut, Melisse und Ysop eingefärbt werden. Die Färbung durch Kräuter trägt zum geschmacklichen Gesamtbild des Endprodukts bei. Sie stellt hohe Ansprüche an die Fertigkeiten des Herstellers bei der Auswahl der Färbekräuter, ihrem quantitativen Verhältnis und der Dauer der Färbung. Bei altem Absinth kann sich die Färbung des Getränks von einem ursprünglich leuchtenden Grün in ein gelbliches Grün oder Braun wandeln, da sich das Chlorophyll zersetzt. Sehr alte Absinthe sind gelegentlich bernsteinfarben. Klarer Absinth, auch „Blanche“ oder „La Bleue“ genannt, ist typisch für den in illegalen Destillerien in der Schweiz hergestellten Absinth. Der Verzicht auf die normalerweise für Absinth typische Färbung erleichterte den heimlichen Verkauf in Zeiten, in denen Absinth in der Schweiz verboten war., Heute wird Absinth häufig hergestellt, indem Absinthessenz in hochprozentigen Alkohol gegeben wird. Erst ab der gehobenen Mittelklasse werden klassische Produktionsmethoden wie die Mazeration angewandt. Einige der heute hergestellten Absinthe werden mit Lebensmittelfarbe gefärbt. Es handelt sich auch dabei meist um minderwertige Absinthe mit einem vereinfachten Produktionsprozess, der den Absinth wichtiger geschmacklicher Nuancen beraubt. Neben der „Grünen Fee“ gibt es auch rot, schwarz oder blau gefärbten Absinth. Diese für Absinth ungewöhnliche Färbung geschieht vor allem aus Marketinggründen., Geschichte., Herkunft des Namens., „Absinth“ ist die Eindeutschung des französischen \\"absinthe\\", das ursprünglich „Wermut“ bedeutete. Es geht über zurück auf, was ebenfalls den Wermut bezeichnete., Wermut als Heilmittel., Wermut gehört zur Gattung \\"Artemisia\\" (Beifuß), deren Vertreter in den gemäßigten Klimazonen der nördlichen Hemisphäre wachsen. Viele Arten dieser duftenden und häufig insektenabwehrenden Pflanzen haben eine lange Tradition als Heilpflanze. Hinweise auf die Verwendung von Beifuß-Arten zu Heilzwecken finden sich bereits im Papyrus Ebers, der Texte aus der Zeit von 3550 bis 1550 vor Christus enthält. Auch das Alte Testament nimmt an mehreren Stellen Bezug auf die Bitterkeit der \\"Artemisia\\"-Kräuter.

Jahrhundert bestehende, ursprünglich kurtrierische, später preußische Befestigungsanlage gegenüber der Moselmündung in Koblenz., Ihr barocker Vorgängerbau, der auf eine um das Jahr 1000 errichtete Burg zurückging, war zeitweilig Residenz der Kurfürsten von Trier und wurde 1801 von französischen Revolutionstruppen gesprengt. In ihrer heutigen Gestalt wurde die Zitadelle (eigentlich „Feste Ehrenbreitstein“ genannt, geplanter Name war „Feste Friedrich Wilhelm“) zwischen 1817 und 1828 unter Leitung des preußischen Ingenieur-Offiziers Carl Schnitzler neu errichtet. Sie war Teil der Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts errichteten preußischen Festung Koblenz und gehörte zum \\"System Oberehrenbreitstein\\". Von der preußischen Armee bis 1918 militärisch genutzt, diente sie im System der Koblenzer Festungswerke der Sicherung des Mittelrheintals und der gesamten Verkehrsinfrastruktur, d.h. Bahnwege und Flussübergänge bei Koblenz., Heute ist sie Eigentum des Landes Rheinland-Pfalz und beherbergt das Landesmuseum Koblenz, die Koblenzer Jugendherberge, das Ehrenmal des Deutschen Heeres sowie verschiedene Verwaltungsstellen. Zur Bundesgartenschau 2011 wurden in die Veranstaltungsfläche Teile des Festungsgeländes sowie das Vorgelände einbezogen. Auf letzterem entstand ein großzügiger Landschaftspark mit Aussichtsplattform., Lage., Die Festung Ehrenbreitstein liegt auf einem 180m hohen Bergsporn gleichen Namens, dessen schroffe Felshänge im Koblenzer Stadtteil Ehrenbreitstein in das Rheintal auslaufen. Dadurch musste nur der Hügelrücken, zum Plateau im Nordosten hin, besonders stark verteidigt werden. Im 19. Jahrhundert galt die preußische Festung Ehrenbreitstein als uneinnehmbar, zum einen durch ihre Lage auf dem gleichnamigen Berg und zum anderen, weil der Feind stets von allen Seiten durch die anderen Festungen und Forts im Festungsverbund attackiert werden konnte. Der Ehrenbreitstein wird auf drei Seiten – im Süden, im Osten und im Westen zum Rhein hin – von hohen Steilhängen begrenzt. Die Festung ist vom Rheinufer her, am Vorwerk Helfenstein vorbei, sowie vom Bergplateau im Norden zugänglich. Der für Verteidigungszwecke ideal geeignete Bergsporn wurde seit frühester Zeit für militärische Anlagen genutzt., Geschichte der militärischen Nutzung., Vorgeschichte., Die Besiedlung des Ehrenbreitsteins ist schon für die Zeit um 4000 v.Chr. nachgewiesen. Bei Ausgrabungen im Frühjahr 2005 wurden unter der Großen Traverse (genauer: unter dem östlichen Kuppelsaal) Reste eines Pfahlgrabens aus dem 10. Jahrhundert v.Chr. gefunden. Er war Teil einer bronzezeitlichen Wehranlage, die sich auf dem Südteil des Bergsporns befand. An einer nur etwa 30 Meter breiten Stelle sicherte die von hinten mit Erde verstärkte Palisade den südlichen Teil des Bergsporns gegen die einzige Zugangsmöglichkeit im Norden. Bei einer archäologischen Ausgrabung wurden 2003 unter dem Fahnenturm Reste eines keltischen Adelssitzes entdeckt. Aus der Römerzeit stammen Funde von Pfeilschleudergeschossen, Gefäßen und Münzen, die eine römische Nutzung des Felsens erkennen lassen. Auf dem südlichen Felssporn befand sich etwa von 250 bis 450 ein spätrömischer Burgus zum Schutz der Moselmündung, der Römerstraßen und des nahe gelegenen Limes. Keramikfunde aus karolingischer Zeit lassen eine mittelalterliche Befestigung im 8. oder 9. Jahrhundert vermuten., Burg Ehrenbreitstein., Um das Jahr 1000 befand sich hier wohl die von Erembert oder Ehrenbrecht aus lahngauisch-konradinischem Grafengeschlecht errichtete \\"Burg Ehrenbreitstein\\". Nach einer ersten urkundlichen Erwähnung ging sie nach Kauf durch Erzbischof Poppo von Babenberg um 1020 in den Besitz der Fürstbischöfe von Trier über. Die Burg war der Brückenkopf für den rechtsrheinischen Besitz des Kurfürstentums Trier und galt als dessen sicherste Burg. So wurden hier in unsicheren Zeiten bedeutende Heiligtümer des Landes aufbewahrt, z.B. der Kopf des heiligen Matthias (Bistumspatron) von 1380 bis 1422 und der Heilige Rock mit wenigen kurzen Unterbrechungen von 1657 bis 1794., Die Burg wurde um 1160 von Erzbischof Hillin von Fallemanien ausgebaut. Ein in dieser Zeit gebauter Halsgraben, der sogenannte Hellengraben, konnte unter der Großen Traverse nachgewiesen werden. Er erneuerte die erzbischöflichen Häuser, vertiefte den Halsgraben, errichtete dahinter den fünfeckigen Bergfried und ließ eine Zisterne anlegen. Es folgten noch weitere Aus- und Umbauten, insbesondere ab dem 16. Jahrhundert der Ausbau der Burg zur Festung. Gelegentlich taucht der Name \\"Festung Hermannstein\\" in alten Grafiken auf. Er beruht offensichtlich auf Fehlern der Grafiker., Südlich entstand um 1160 auf einem Bergsporn die Burg Helfenstein, die von der Familie von Helfenstein bis ins 14. Jahrhundert bewohnt wurde und danach verfiel. Mit Bau der preußischen Festung wurde die Burgruine vom Fort Helfenstein überbaut., Ausbau zur kurtrierischen Festung., Erzbischof Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads begann im frühen 16. Jahrhundert wegen der voranschreitenden Kriegstechnik mit dem Ausbau der Burg zu einer Festung. Die Anlage wurde auf der Nordseite mit einem Graben und Bastionen versehen. Die Errichtung des Zeughauses geht ebenfalls auf seine Initiative zurück. Greiffenklau ließ auch die ersten Kanonen für die neue Festung gießen. Die größte dieser Kanonen ist die 1524 von Meister Simon aus Frankfurt am Main gegossene, neun Tonnen schwere und 4,66 Meter lange Belagerungskanone \\"Greif\\". Nach der Eroberung des Ehrenbreitsteins durch die Franzosen 1799 wurde die Kanone nach Frankreich gebracht. 1940, nach der Eroberung Frankreichs, kam sie kurzzeitig zurück, wurde aber 1946 wieder nach Paris gebracht. 1984 kam sie während der Amtszeit des französischen Staatspräsidenten François Mitterrand, der auf dem Ehrenbreitstein einen entsprechenden Vertrag mit Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl unterzeichnete, als Dauerleihgabe auf die Festung zurück., Um 1600 entstand unter der Leitung des Festungsbaumeisters Johann (II.) von Pasqualini, einem Enkel von Alessandro Pasqualini, eine Bastion vor der Festung. Unterhalb und im Schutze dieser ließ Kurfürst und Erzbischof Philipp Christoph von Sötern 1626 bis 1629 das Schloss Philippsburg erbauen und verlegte 1629 seine Residenz aus dem inzwischen unsicher gewordenen Trier hierher. Im Dreißigjährigen Krieg wechselte die Festung Ehrenbreitstein zweimal den Besitzer, nachdem der Erzbischof 1631 zunächst Frankreich das Besatzungsrecht eingeräumt hatte und französische Truppen am 5. Juni 1632 die Festung besetzt hatten. Drei Wochen später kapitulierte die Stadt Koblenz und wurde ebenfalls besetzt. Im Oktober 1635 traten die Franzosen nach einem Bündnis mit dem Herzog Bernhard von Sachsen-Weimar in den Krieg ein. Nachdem der Erzbischof 1635 von kaiserlichen Truppen gefangen genommen und Trier erobert worden war, befreiten diese im Mai 1636 auch Koblenz. Die Franzosen kontrollierten jedoch weiter die Festung als Brückenkopf auf der rechten Rheinseite. Um den Ehrenbreitstein zur Übergabe zu bringen, zog schließlich Johann von Werth, der bereits über 30 Siege gegen die Franzosen errungen hatte und daher als der \\"Franzosenschreck\\" bekannt war, von Köln aus gegen die Festung. Nach einer Belagerung, bei der es ihm gelang, die französischen Truppen auszuhungern, kapitulierte die Festung am 27. Juni 1637 und blieb bis zum Kriegsende unter kaiserlicher Besatzung., Der Ehrenbreitstein fiel 1650 wieder zurück an Kurtrier. Die Erzbischöfe Karl Kaspar von der Leyen und Johann Hugo von Orsbeck ließen im 17. Jahrhundert die Festung weiter ausbauen. Letzterer ließ den Hellengraben nach den Beschießungen der Stadt Koblenz 1688 im Pfälzischen Erbfolgekrieg mit Trümmerschutt verfüllen und darüber einen mehrgeschossigen repräsentativen Residenzbau errichten. Erzbischof Franz Georg von Schönborn begann 1729 mit dem weiteren Ausbau der Anlage zu einer barocken Festung. Den beiden Wällen im Norden ließ er noch die neuen Schönborn-Werke vorlegen. Balthasar Neumann plante diesen Wall mit Graben, gedecktem Weg und Gegenminensystem um 1730. Auf der Rheinseite und dem Helfenstein wurden zusätzliche Batterien aufgestellt., Am 23. Oktober 1794 eroberten französische Revolutionstruppen im Ersten Koalitionskrieg die Stadt Koblenz und belagerten ab 1795 viermal die Festung. Am 27. Januar 1799 wurde sie nach fast einjähriger Blockade übergeben, weil die Besatzung kaum noch Verpflegung hatte. Durch den Frieden von Lunéville waren die Franzosen 1801 gezwungen, das rechte Rheinufer aufzugeben, also auch den Ehrenbreitstein. Um sie nicht den Gegnern zu überlassen, sprengten sie die barocke Festung planmäßig. Das darunter liegende Schloss Philippsburg wurde bei der Sprengung so in Mitleidenschaft gezogen, dass es abgebrochen werden musste. Die Ruinen der Festung gingen 1803 durch den Reichsdeputationshauptschluss für kurze Zeit an das Fürstentum Nassau-Weilburg (das spätere Herzogtum Nassau) über., Neubau als preußische Festung., Nach den Wiener Kongress 1814/1815 ging das Territorium des Trierer Kurstaates als Teil der Rheinprovinz an das Königreich Preußen über. Am 11. März 1815 erließ König Friedrich WilhelmIII. die „Order zur Neubefestigung der Stadt Coblenz und der Festung Ehrenbreitstein“. In den folgenden Jahren entstand die Festung Koblenz, eines der umfangreichsten Festungssysteme Europas, gebaut nach den damals modernsten Erkenntnissen, der „Neupreußischen Befestigungsmanier“., Die drei Hauptbefestigungswerke der Festung Koblenz sollten die Namen der drei Monarchen der an den Befreiungskriegen beteiligten Länder Preußen, Österreich und Russland erhalten, die sich zur \\"Heiligen Allianz\\" zusammengeschlossen hatten. Es gab offenbar kurzzeitig Überlegungen, die Festung Ehrenbreitstein nach dem preußischen König \\"Feste Friedrich Wilhelm\\" zu nennen, doch man entschied sich schließlich für den historischen Namen \\"Ehrenbreitstein\\"., Unter Einbeziehung von Resten der zerstörten kurtrierischen Festung auf dem Ehrenbreitstein errichteten die preußischen Militärs und führenden Ingenieuroffiziere General der Infanterie Gustav von Rauch, Generalinspekteur der preußischen Festungen, Generalmajor Ernst Ludwig von Aster, Inspekteur der rheinischen Festungen, Generalmajor Claudius Franz Le Bauld de Nans und Generalmajor Gotthilf Benjamin Keibel eine weitläufige Zitadelle, die bis heute das Stadtbild beherrscht., In Koblenz entstand eines der größten militärischen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Befestigungsanlage, Denkmalzone, Dreißigjähriger Krieg, Erbaut, Festung, Koblenz, Kulturdenkmal, Kulturlandschaft, Haager Konvention, Befestigungssystem"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Bauwerk der Wessobrunner Schule, Bauwerk in Salem (Baden), Disposition einer Orgel, Erbaut im 15. Jahrhundert, Gotische Kirche, Gotisches Bauwerk im Bodenseekreis, Kirchengebäude im Bodenseekreis, Kirchengebäude im Erzbistum Freiburg, Kirchengebäude in Europa, Kulturdenkmal in Salem (Baden)], Das Salemer Münster war die Kirche der ehemaligen Reichsabtei Salem (gegründet 1137/38; aufgehoben 1804 durch die Säkularisation) und dient heute als Pfarrkirche der römisch-katholischen Gemeinde von Salem. Das gotische Münster wurde im Zeitraum von etwa 1285 bis 1420 als dreischiffige Säulenbasilika errichtet und gehört zu den bedeutendsten hochgotischen Bauwerken der Zisterzienser im deutschen Sprachraum. In der äußeren Form entspricht die Kirche weitgehend der ursprünglichen Baugestalt, während Umbauten im Innenraum die Raumwirkung nachhaltig veränderten. Das Inventar umfasst Ausstattungsgegenstände aus der Zeit der Spätgotik, des Barock, des Rokoko und des Klassizismus. Es ist nach dem Ulmer und dem Freiburger Münster die drittgrößte gotische Kirche Baden-Württembergs., Erste Klosterkirche., Im Jahr 1137 traf eine Gesandtschaft von Zisterziensern aus dem Kloster Lützel (Oberelsass) auf der Gemarkung Salmannsweiler am Bodensee ein, um das Kloster Salem zu gründen. Zum Zeitpunkt der Besiedelung stand dort bereits eine Kapelle, die dem Doppelpatrozinium der Heiligen Verena und Cyriak unterstellt war. Diese wohl schon baufällige (\\"vetustate paene collapsa\\") Kapelle wurde um 1150 für den Neubau einer Klosterkirche abgerissen., Von der ersten Klosterkirche sind keine baulichen Zeugnisse erhalten. Wenn die Kirche der Primarabtei Clairvaux und die zur gleichen Zeit erbauten Kirchen von Lützel, Kaisheim und anderen Zisterzienserklöstern Rückschlüsse erlauben, handelte es sich um eine dreischiffige Basilika mit kreuzförmigem Grundriss im Stil der Romanik. Nach Knapp (2004) könnte das Querhaus neben der zentralen rechtwinkligen Apsis auf der Nordseite in drei und auf der Südseite in zwei nach Osten ausgerichtete Kapellen eingeteilt gewesen sein. Belegt ist, dass sie vollständig aus Stein gebaut wurde und mindestens acht Altäre besaß, von denen die ersten vier am 13. September 1152 durch den Bischof von Chur und den Bischof von Konstanz geweiht wurden. Die Kirche selbst wurde am 14. Juli 1179 nach rund 30 Jahren Bauzeit geweiht. Ein Jahrhundert später wurde sie wieder abgerissen, um Platz für den Bau des Münsters zu schaffen., Bauzeit., Bis zum Tod Friedrichs II. 1250 stand das Kloster unter dem Schutz der Stauferkönige. Das Machtvakuum im Römischen Reich, das seinem Tod folgte, nutzten die Nachbarn des Klosters aus, um sich dessen Besitztümer zu sichern und einstige Schenkungen rückgängig zu machen. Erst Rudolf I. von Habsburg, dessen Amtsantritt 1273 das Interregnum beendete, nahm Salem unter seinen Schutz und sorgte dafür, dass die verlorenen Güter wieder zurückgegeben wurden. Durch die so gesicherten Einkünfte und eine Reihe in den 1280er Jahren ausgestellten Ablassbriefe sah sich das Kloster finanziell in der Lage, eine neue, größere Kirche zu bauen. Der Münsterbau dokumentiert somit auch eine neue Ära in der Geschichte des Klosters – den Beginn der Protektion durch die Habsburger, die dem Kloster über Jahrhunderte hinweg die Unabhängigkeit sichern sollte., Initiator des Neubaus war der Abt Ulrich II. von Seelfingen (1282–1311). Vermutlich war der ausschlaggebende Grund für den Neubau, dass die alte Kirche für den Konvent, der sich innerhalb weniger Jahrzehnte auf rund 300 Mönche und Laienbrüder vergrößert hatte, zu klein geworden war. Lange Zeit war man der Auffassung, der Neubau sei im Jahr 1299 begonnen worden; neuere Bauuntersuchungen und die Verbindung des Kirchenbaus mit der Revindikationspolitik Rudolfs I. legen dagegen einen Baubeginn um 1285 nahe (Lit.: Knapp 1998). Für den Neubau wurden nicht mehr, wie für die Vorgängerkirche, grob behauene Bruchsteine verwendet, sondern große Quader von behauenem Sandstein, die aus Steinbrüchen in der Umgebung stammten. Die Arbeiter und Planer dürften zumeist Laienbrüder gewesen sein, von denen einige auch über Salem hinaus wirkten, so etwa bei der Errichtung des Turms der Klosterkirche Bebenhausen., Der Bau wurde an der Ostseite begonnen und schritt zunächst rasch voran. Im Jahr 1307 wurden elf Altäre geweiht; 1313 bzw. 1319 wurden zwölf weitere konsekriert. Als der Chor und das Querschiff um 1319 fertiggestellt und überdacht waren, wurde der Bau nur noch langsam weitergeführt, wenn nicht gar vorübergehend eingestellt. Die Zahl der Mönche war seit dem Jahr 1300 kleiner geworden, so dass der bereits überdachte Raum unter dem östlichen Mittelschiff ausreichend Platz für den Konvent bot., Schuld an der Unterbrechung waren zunächst Finanzierungsprobleme, da mit Ludwig dem Bayern von 1314 bis 1347 ein Papstgegner an der Macht war, der die Habsburger Protektion über Salem aufhob und damit die Rechtssicherheit vieler Güter aufkündigte. Nachdem Ludwigs Nachfolger Karl IV. die Abtei wieder in ihren Rechten bestätigt hatte, brach 1348 die Pest über Süddeutschland herein. Erst um 1400 konnte der Bau weitergeführt und in den 1420er Jahren vollständig überdacht werden, wie neuere dendrochronologische Untersuchungen zeigten. Die Bauzeit von rund 150 Jahren ist im Vergleich dennoch recht kurz, blieben doch viele gotische Kirchenbauten über lange Zeit unvollständig oder wurden, wie das Ulmer Münster, erst im gotikbegeisterten 19. Jahrhundert vollendet., Die Kirchweihe fand bereits vor dem Bauabschluss statt. Abt Jodokus Senner nutzte das Konzil von Konstanz, das im Jahr 1414 begonnen hatte, und lud den dort anwesenden Erzbischof von Salzburg Eberhard III. ein, die Kirchweihe zu vollziehen. Eberhard III. sah sich Salem wohl dadurch verbunden, dass sein Amtsvorgänger Eberhard II. rund 200 Jahre zuvor das Kloster unter seinen Schutz genommen hatte. Es gilt als wahrscheinlich, dass bei der Kirchweihe am 23. Dezember 1414 auch König Sigismund anwesend war, der am Vortag in Überlingen im Salemer Stadthof übernachtet hatte und am 24. Dezember auf dem Konzil eintraf., Mit Salem als Vorreiter hatte die gotische Baukunst ihren Weg vom oberrheinischen Straßburg an den Bodensee gefunden: Ungefähr gleichzeitig ließ auch das Bistum Konstanz das Konstanzer Münster in gotischem Stil modernisieren, und kurz nach dem Bauabschluss in Salem sollte auch in der benachbarten Reichsstadt Überlingen mit dem Ausbau der Stadtpfarrkirche St. Nikolaus zur fünfschiffigen Basilika begonnen werden, um Salem noch zu überbieten., Architektur., Baukörper., Das Münster ist als Baukörper in das Klostergeviert integriert und überragt es kaum an Höhe. Die strengen, schlichten Formen der Kirche kontrastieren heute mit dessen ausladendem barockem Baustil. Die architektonische Reduzierung der Salemer Kirche, die nur durch einzelne Zierelemente an der Fassade aufgelockert wird, distanziert sich demonstrativ vom Prunk der amtskirchlichen Kathedralen und der Klosterarchitektur der Cluniazenser., Im Süden schließt sich direkt der Kreuzgang an, der zum Konventsgebäude führt. Dieser Zugang, das sogenannte \\"Bernhardsportal\\", diente als Eingang für die Mönche, während die übrigen Kirchgänger das Westportal benutzten. Ein weiteres Portal – seit 1750 geschlossen – findet sich an der Nordseite des Querhauses; es diente ursprünglich als separater Eingang für hochrangige Gäste., Beim Salemer Münster handelt sich um eine dreischiffige Basilika mit Querhaus, Chor und Chorumgang auf einer rechteckigen Grundfläche von 67 × 28m (Außenmaße); dabei ragt der schmale, hohe Baukörper des Querhauses nicht seitlich über das Grundviereck hinaus. In den Ausmaßen entspricht das Salemer Münster ungefähr dem Konstanzer Münster, in der Länge dem Basler Münster. Das Baumaterial ist fein strukturierter Molasse-Sandstein in gelb-grauen, grünlichen und braunen Farbtönen, der im Außenbereich unverputzt ist. Als regionale Vorbilder des kreuzförmigen Baus könnten die Klosterkirche von Kappel am Albis und das heute nicht mehr existierende Münster des Klosters Petershausen gedient haben. Da Petershausen sich ebenso wie Salem vom Bistum Konstanz unabhängig gemacht hatte und Salem diese Unabhängigkeit auch demonstrieren wollte, liegt wohl in der Petershausener Klosterkirche das unmittelbare Vorbild des Salemer Münsters (Lit.: Knapp 2004)., Der Dachfirst des Querhauses ist bis zum 32m hohen First des Mittelschiffs hinaufgezogen. Die Satteldächer von Lang- und Querhaus überragen die niedrigen Seitenschiffe mit ihren Pultdächern um etwa das Doppelte. Der Dachstuhl über dem Hochchor stammt teilweise noch aus dem Jahr 1301. Auf dessen Südseite sind originale glasierte Dachziegel erhalten, die dem Dach einst einen goldenen Schimmer verliehen; bis zur Neueindeckung 1997 war das gesamte Dach des Langhauses noch großteils mit bauzeitlichen Ziegeln eingedeckt., An der Außenseite des Baukörpers verleihen nur die Harfengiebel und die Lanzettfenster dem architektonisch eher grobschlächtigen Bauwerk eine gewisse Filigranität. Die Westfront wird von einem hohen dreieckigen Harfengiebel überragt, dessen Grundform, ein gleichseitiges Dreieck, in der mittelalterlichen Zahlenmystik als Verehrung der Dreifaltigkeit verstanden werden konnte. Zwei mächtige Strebepfeiler stützen die Fassade und rahmen den Eingang zur Kirche. Die Gestaltung der Giebel wiederholt sich in ähnlicher Form an der Ostseite sowie an Süd- und Nordseite des Querschiffs., Zehn Maßwerkfenster auf jeder Seite des Mittelschiffs (Obergaden) spenden dem Innenraum Licht. Davon liegen sechs Achsen westlich und vier östlich des Querhauses. Die Seitenschiffe besitzen eine Fensterachse mehr, da die Fensterbögen des östlichen Mittelschiffs seit dem Umbau von 1750 weiter auseinander liegen als die Joche des Chorumgangs. Weitere, mächtige Maßwerkfenster finden sich an den vier Giebeln der Kirche, wobei die Fenster der Ostseite im Zuge der Umgestaltung des Innenraums um 1750 zugemauert wurden. Die Stirnseite des nördlichen Querhauses besitzt zusätzlich ein großes achtblättrig gefächertes Rosettenfenster nach dem Vorbild des Straßburger Münsters, was belegt, dass sie als Schauseite der Kirche angelegt wurde. Auch das Maßwerkgitter vor der Giebelwand mit gestaffelten zweibahnigen Lanzetten, die durch Kleeblattformen horizontal verbunden sind, hat wohl in Straßburg sein Vorbild., Tur: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Bauwerk, Wessobrunner Schule, Salem (Baden), Disposition, Orgel, 15.

Es ist ein Element der 1.IUPAC-Gruppe, der Gruppe der Alkalimetalle, und gehört zur zweiten Periode des Periodensystems der Elemente. Lithium ist ein Leichtmetall und besitzt die geringste Dichte der unter Standardbedingungen festen Elemente., Lithium kommt in der Natur aufgrund seiner hohen Reaktivität nicht elementar vor. Bei Raumtemperatur ist es nur in völlig trockener Luft über längere Zeit stabil, reagiert aber langsam zu Lithiumnitrid (Li3N). In feuchter Luft bildet sich an der Oberfläche schnell eine mattgraue Lithiumhydroxid-Schicht. Wie alle Alkalimetalle reagiert elementares Lithium schon bei Berührung mit der Hautfeuchtigkeit und führt so zu schweren Verätzungen und Verbrennungen. Viele Lithiumverbindungen, die in wässriger Lösung Lithiumionen bilden, sind im Gegensatz zu den entsprechenden Natrium- und Kaliumverbindungen als gesundheitsschädlich eingestuft., Als Spurenelement ist Lithium in Form seiner Salze ein häufiger Bestandteil von Mineralwasser. Im menschlichen Organismus sind geringe Mengen Lithium vorhanden; das Element ist jedoch nicht essenziell und hat keine bekannte biologische Funktion. Einige Lithiumsalze haben aber eine medizinische Wirkung und werden in der Lithiumtherapie bei bipolaren Affektstörungen, Manie, Depressionen und Cluster-Kopfschmerzen eingesetzt (siehe Medizin)., Geschichte., Als Entdecker des Lithiums gilt der Schwede Johan August Arfwedson, der im Jahr 1817 die Anwesenheit eines fremden Elements in Petalit (Li[4]Al[4][Si4O10]) und bald darauf auch in Spodumen (LiAl[Si2O6]) und Lepidolith (K(Li,Al)3[(Al,Si)4O10](F,OH)2) feststellte, als er Mineralienfunde von der Insel Utö in Schweden analysierte. Sein akademischer Lehrer Jöns Jakob Berzelius schlug \\"Lithion\\", eine Ableitung zu, als Namen vor, der entsprechend den Bezeichnungen der andern beiden damals bekannten Alkalimetalle Natrium und Kalium auf das Material hinweist, aus dem es gewonnen wurde. Die latinisierte Form \\"Lithium\\" hat sich durchgesetzt., 1818 bemerkte der deutsche Chemiker Christian Gottlob Gmelin, dass Lithiumsalze eine rote Flammenfärbung ergeben. Beide Wissenschaftler scheiterten in den folgenden Jahren mit Versuchen, dieses Element zu isolieren. Im Jahr 1818 gelang dies erstmals William Thomas Brande und Sir Humphry Davy mittels eines elektrolytischen Verfahrens aus Lithiumoxid (Li2O). Robert Bunsen und Augustus Matthiessen stellten 1855 durch Elektrolyse von Lithiumchlorid (LiCl) größere Mengen reinen Lithiums her. Im Jahr 1917 synthetisierte Wilhelm Schlenk aus organischen Quecksilberverbindungen die ersten lithiumorganischen Verbindungen., Mit der ersten kommerziellen Produktion begann 1923 die deutsche Metallgesellschaft in der Hans-Heinrich-Hütte in Langelsheim im Harz, indem eine Schmelze aus Lithium- und Kaliumchlorid (KCl) elektrolysiert wurde., Bis kurz nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg gab es bis auf die Anwendung als Schmiermittel (Mineralöl, angedickt mit Lithiumstearat) und in der Glasindustrie (Lithiumcarbonat oder Lithiumoxid) kaum Anwendungen für Lithium. Dies änderte sich, als in den Vereinigten Staaten Tritium, das sich aus Lithium gewinnen lässt, für den Bau von Wasserstoffbomben benötigt wurde. Man begann mit einer breit angelegten Förderung, vor allem in Kings Mountain (North Carolina). Durch die auf Grund der kurzen Tritium-Halbwertszeit benötigten großen Lithium-Mengen wurde zwischen 1953 und 1963 ein großer Vorrat von Lithium angehäuft, das erst nach dem Ende des Kalten Krieges ab 1993 auf den Markt gebracht wurde. Neben dem Bergbau wurde nun auch die billigere Gewinnung aus Salzlaugen wichtig. Größere Mengen Lithium werden mittlerweile für Batterien, für die Polymerisation von Elastomeren, in der Bauindustrie und für die organische Synthese von Pharmazeutika und Agrochemikalien eingesetzt. Seit 2007 sind Primärbatterien und Akkumulatoren (\\"Sekundärbatterien\\") das wichtigste Segment., Vorkommen und Abbau., Vorkommen auf der Erde., Lithium hat an der Erdkruste einen Anteil von etwa 0,006 %. Es kommt damit etwas seltener als Zink sowie häufiger als Kobalt, Zinn und Blei in der Erdkruste vor. Obwohl Lithium häufiger als beispielsweise Blei ist, ist seine Gewinnung durch die stärkere Verteilung schwierig. Im Trinkwasser und einigen Nahrungsmitteln wie Fleisch, Fisch, Eiern und Milchprodukten ist Lithium enthalten. So enthalten 100g Fleisch etwa 100μg Lithium. Verschiedene Pflanzen wie beispielsweise Tabak oder Hahnenfuß nehmen Lithiumverbindungen aus dem Boden auf und reichern sie an. Der durchschnittliche Anteil an der Trockenmasse von Pflanzen liegt zwischen 0,5ppm und 3ppm. Meerwasser enthält durchschnittlich 180µg/L und Flusswasser etwa 3µg/L., Abbau und Reserven., Mengenmäßig wurden 2015 außerhalb der USA 35.000Tonnen Lithium gewonnen und überwiegend als Lithiumcarbonat (Li2CO3) gehandelt. Im Jahr 2016 war Chile der größte Produzent. Australien verdreifachte seine Produktion zwischen 2016 und 2017 und steigerte sie bis 2018 nochmals um fast 50 %. Derzeit (2018) werden fast zwei Drittel des Lithiumvorrats in Australien im Hartgesteinsbergbau und nur etwa ein Drittel aus Solen gewonnen. Die Reserven in den vorhandenen Minen werden auf rund 17 Millionen Tonnen geschätzt (Stand: Januar 2020). Das Weltvorkommen aus kontinentalen Solen, geothermischen Solen, aus dem Hectorit-Mineral, Ölfeld-Solen und aus dem magmatischen Gestein Pegmatit ist auf 80 Millionen Tonnen geschätzt worden., Ein anderes Bild ergibt sich bei der Analyse der Unternehmen, die Lithiumminen verwalten. Laut einer Reportage des Fachmagazins „illuminem“, Chinesische Investoren kontrollieren mehrere Bergbauunternehmen, auf die 33,1 % der Gesamtproduktion (und die Hälfte der Produktion großer Unternehmen) von Lithium in der Welt entfallen., Ressource = (geschätztes) Gesamtvorkommen des Rohstoffs, Reserve = der Teil der Ressource, der in einem überschaubaren Zeithorizont unter ökonomischen Bedingungen abgebaut werden kann, Primäre Lagerstätten., Lithium kommt in einigen Mineralien in Lithium-Pegmatiten vor. Die wichtigsten Minerale sind dabei Amblygonit (LiAl[PO4]F), Lepidolith (K(Li,Al)3[(Al,Si)4O10](F,OH)2), Petalit (Kastor; LiAl[Si4O10]) und Spodumen (Triphan; LiAl[Si2O6]). Diese Minerale haben einen Lithiumgehalt von bis zu 9 % (bei Amblygonit). Andere, seltenere Lithiumerze sind Kryolithionit (Li3Na3[AlF6]2), das den größten Lithiumgehalt aller Mineralien aufweist, Triphylin (Li(FeII,MnII)[PO4]) und Zinnwaldit (K(Li,Fe,Al)3[(Al,Si)4O10](F,OH)2). Lithiummineralien kommen in vielen Silikat-Gesteinen vor, aber meist nur in geringen Konzentrationen. Eine der großen Lagerstätten liegt in Serbien im Jadartal, wo das Mineral Jadarit gefunden wurde. Es gibt keine großen Lagerstätten. Da die Gewinnung von Lithium aus diesen Mineralien mit großem Aufwand verbunden ist, spielen sie heutzutage bei der Gewinnung von Lithium oder Lithiumverbindungen eine untergeordnete Rolle, dies könnte sich jedoch aufgrund der erwartet hohen Nachfrage ändern. Abbauorte sind vor allem die Greenbushes- und Mt.-Cattlin-Minen in Western Australia, in deren Pegmatit-Gesteinen eine hohe Lithiumkonzentration vorliegt und in denen Lithium als Nebenprodukt der Tantalgewinnung anfällt. Auch in einigen anderen Ländern wie Kanada und Russland, bis 1998 auch in Bassemer City, North Carolina, wird Spodumen zur Lithiumgewinnung abgebaut., Europa besitzt Li-reiche Pegmatitfelder auf der Kärntner Weinebene im Bezirk Wolfsberg, in der finnischen Region Österbotten, im Erzgebirge sowie zwischen Spanien (Almendra) und Portugal (Distrikt Guarda, Boticas)., Während die erste kommerzielle Produktion von Lithiumverbindungen an sich bereits 1923 im Harz begann, könnte die Förderung in den nun neu erschlossenen bedeutenden Lagerstätten in Österreich und Finnland ab 2025 beginnen. Sie werden durch Global Strategic Metals bzw. Keliber betrieben. In Österreich an der Koralpe im Lavanttal haben Probestollen ein viel größeres Vorkommen von lithiumhaltigem Grundgestein ergeben, das auf 22 Millionen Tonnen geschätzt wird. Damit ist es eines der ersten groß angelegten Lithium-Abbauprojekte Europas und könnte 20 Jahre lang betrieben werden. Das Vorkommen bei Zinnwald im Erzgebirge wird durch die Deutsche Lithium exploriert., Sekundäre Lagerstätten., Lithiumsalze, insbesondere Lithiumchlorid, kommen verbreitet auch in Salzlaugen, meist Salzseen, vor. Die Konzentration kann bis zu einem Prozent betragen. Neben der Konzentration des Lithiums ist für die Qualität der Salzlauge das Mengenverhältnis von Magnesium zu Lithium wichtig. Derzeit wird Lithium vor allem in Chile (Salar de Atacama, die mit 0,16 % mit den höchsten bekannten Lithiumkonzentration aufweist), Argentinien (Salar del Hombre Muerto), den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika (Silver Peak, Nevada) und der Volksrepublik China (Chabyêr Caka, Tibet; Taijinaier-See, Qinghai) gewonnen. Im bolivianischen Salzsee Salar de Uyuni mit geschätzt 5,4Millionen Tonnen Lithium lagern möglicherweise die größten Ressourcen. Das Staatsunternehmen Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos investiert seit 2018 mit deutschen und chinesischen Partnern verstärkt in seine Industrialisierung, einschließlich der benachbarten Salar de Coipasa und Laguna Pastos Grandes. Es gibt weitere lithiumhaltige Salzseen, die (Stand April 2019) noch nicht zum industriellen Abbau genutzt werden, beispielsweise in China, Argentinien und Afghanistan. 2016 wurde bekannt, dass im Paradox-Becken im US-Bundesstaat Utah schon in den 1960er Jahren bei Ölexplorationsbohrungen hochsalinares Tiefengrundwasser (Sole) angetroffen wurde, aus dem sich, nach damaligen Analysen, bis zu 1700mg/l reines Lithium gewinnen ließe., Als Kuppelprodukte bei der Lithiumgewinnung werden häufig Kaliumcarbonat (Pottasche), Borax, Caesium und Rubidium gewonnen., Aufgrund der erwarteten starken Nachfrage nach Lithium für Batterien von Elektrofahrzeugen prüften 2010 einige Unternehmen den Abbau von lithiumhaltigen Mineralien und Salzlaugen in verschiedenen Regionen der Welt inklusive Europa. Erforscht wird auch die Lithiumgewinnung aus Meerwasser. In den Weltmeeren sind ca. 230 Mrd. Tonnen Lithium gelöst. 2018 stellten Forscher eine Extraktionsmethode vor, bei der Lithium über solarbetriebene Elektrolyse aus Meerwasser gewonnen werden kann. Als einen Vorteil gegenüber herkömmlicher Gewinnung nannten sie, dass be: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Gemma, Lucy, Sarah, and Emma are all sitting on the sofa, chatting and giggling. The TV plays softly in the background. GEMMA (looking mischievous) Hey, I have an idea. Remember how we hypnotized Paul last time? Let's do it again! LUCY (excitedly) Yes! It was so funny to watch him believe he was a dog. What's the plan this time? SARAH (smiling) I've read about foot fetishes. How about we make him believe he's a foot massager? EMMA (laughing) That's hilarious! It's going to be so much fun. Gemma grabs a small gold pocket watch from the coffee table. GEMMA (grinning) I still have the pocket watch. One snap and he'll be under our control. They all lean in closer, eagerly awaiting the hypnotizing spectacle. INT. GEMMA AND LUCY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER Paul, a slightly confused but willing participant, sits cross-legged on the floor in front of the sofa, facing the girls. The room is dimly lit, creating an ambiance of relaxation. Gemma, with a confident smile, snaps her fingers once. PAUL (confused) Uh, what just happened?

They all giggle, watching Paul's slightly bewildered but content expression. INT. GEMMA AND LUCY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING The girls have moved on to different activities, leaving Paul to continue his foot massaging duties. However, Gemma snaps her fingers to release him from his trance. GEMMA (teasingly) Alright, Paul, you can stop now. You're no longer a foot massager. Paul blinks, momentarily confused, before a smile breaks out across his face. PAUL (laughing) Oh my, what just happened? My hands were starting to cramp up! The girls burst into laughter, realizing the successful prank they pulled off. LUCY (hugging Paul) You were amazing, Paul! Thanks for being such a good sport. PAUL (still chuckling) Anything for you ladies! But, please, no more foot massages today. They all laugh, enjoying the evening together as friends.

A pesar de las críticas al ejercicio y a los recursos con los que cuenta SENAPRED por parte de algunos medios de comunicación, se logró movilizar a las personas para que participen y se interioricen en el mismo ejercicio, cumpliendo con el objetivo de fomentar una cultura preventiva en la comunidad ante un evento de sismo-tsunami, tal como lo indica la Visión de nuestra institución. Visión en terreno En base a lo anteriormente descrito, este Coordinador tuvo una participación en la Unidad de Alerta Temprana de esta Dirección Regional, difusión en terreno de este simulacro y en la movilización del camión simulador que llegó para reforzar la actividad, en los días previos a su realización. Esto llevó a cambiar mi visión del mismo ejercicio y a tomar en cuenta la opinión de las personas, conociendo con mayor detalle las inquietudes de la ciudadanía. Gracias a la difusión en terreno, pude escuchar las inquietudes de las personas con respecto a la evacuación vertical, su desconocimiento de las zonas de seguridad y puntos de encuentro, logrando responder con éxito a todas sus preguntas. En lo personal fue enriquecedor y grato recibir las felicitaciones por parte de los ciudadanos, que valoraron que este Servicio saliera a terreno para difundir y explicar con palabras simples de qué se trataba el ejercicio y el impacto que tenía el mismo en caso que un evento de este tipo ocurriera, incentivando a este Coordinador a seguir difundiendo de la misma forma actividades futuras, que muchas veces no llegan a los adultos mayores debido a su desconocimiento y falta de manejo de las nuevas tecnologías. Visión como Coordinador en la Unidad de Alerta Temprana En cuanto al trabajo realizado operacionalmente por los dos operadores de turno, Sres. Juan Carmona Gómez y Andrés Ardiles Gallardo, este fue destacado, ya que cumplieron con los puntos solicitados en base a la pauta entregada de acuerdo con los tiempos establecidos y a los lineamientos previamente definidos. El ejercicio contaba con varios tipos de llamados, ya sea telefónico y radial, por lo que durante el mismo el trabajo fue ejecutado exhaustivamente en cuanto a las comunicaciones, ya que circulaba mucha información por teléfono, redes sociales, P.25 y VHF, lo que pudo ser ordenado y entregado en forma correcta por vía radial al Jefe del Departamento de Operaciones, el Delegado Presidencial y al Director Regional. Como anécdota y sorpresa del momento, el Delegado Presidencial dio término al Simulacro minutos antes, sin embargo y pese a este acontecimiento, los operadores de la Unidad de Alerta Temprana lograron sobrellevar de forma correcta y seguir cumpliendo lo establecido adelantando los pasos correspondientes para finalizar el mismo, en comunicación constante con el Nivel Central de SENAPRED.","output":"Aquí tienes 10 puntos de mejora para el simulacro de evacuación basados en el texto proporcionado: 1.

Sie ist eine der am besten erhaltenen Festungen in Bayern und wurde in ihrer langen Geschichte, deren nachweisbare Ursprünge ins 13.Jahrhundert zurückreichen, nie gewaltsam eingenommen. Neben der Festung Forchheim war sie eine der beiden Landesfestungen der Fürstbischöfe von Bamberg, die Rosenberg im Laufe der Jahrhunderte von einer mittelalterlichen Schutzburg zum Renaissance-Schloss und später zum neuzeitlichen Festungskomplex ausbauten. Mit ihren zahlreichen Bauabschnitten gilt die Anlage als herausragendes Beispiel für die Entwicklung des Wehrbaus in Deutschland. Einschließlich Wallgräben und Außenwerken umfasst die überbaute Fläche etwa 8,5ha, zusammen mit den ehemaligen Erdwerken im nördlichen Vorfeld umfasste das befestigte Terrain einst 23,6ha., Lage und Aufbau., Erbaut wurde die Festung auf einer Höhe von 378m über Normalnull auf dem Rosenberg in einer strategisch hervorragenden Lage über der Stadt Kronach. Sie beherrschte die drei zu ihren Füßen zusammenlaufenden Täler der Flüsse Haßlach, Kronach und Rodach. Damit schützte und sperrte sie wichtige Handelswege nach Thüringen und in den Frankenwald. Der Rosenberg, der aus einer Schicht des Oberen Buntsandsteins besteht, erstreckt sich in Nord-Süd-Richtung zwischen den Tälern von Haßlach und Kronach. Seine Südseite, an der sich die Festung und die Kronacher Altstadt befinden, fällt sehr steil ab, weshalb die Mauern des äußeren Befestigungsrings dort bis zu 25m in die Höhe ragen und das zum Innenhof der Kernburg hin ansteigende Geländeprofil ausgleichen. Auch der Osthang, wo ein Großteil des zum Bau der Anlage verwendeten Sandsteins gebrochen wurde, und der früher ebenfalls als Steinbruch dienende Westhang fallen steil ab. Nördlich der Festung erstreckt sich der Bergrücken des Rosenbergs. Aufgrund seines vergleichsweise flach verlaufenden Profils bot dieser für Angreifer einst die beste Möglichkeit zur Annäherung an die Festung. Deshalb wurde deren Nordseite als Hauptangriffsseite umfangreich befestigt., Kernburg., In ihrer heutigen Form besteht die Festung Rosenberg aus drei konzentrischen Befestigungsringen. Den innersten Ring bildet die Kernburg mit vier annähernd rechteckig angeordneten Flügeln und zwei nördlichen Ecktürmen, dem Schmiedsturm und dem Nordostturm. Ihr heutiges Erscheinungsbild erhielten diese Gebäude weitgehend erst gegen Ende des 16.Jahrhunderts, die Grundmauern stammen jedoch zum Teil aus dem 14.Jahrhundert. Der Ostflügel, der sogenannte Fürstenbau, beherbergte neben dem Fürstensaal und der Fürstenküche vor allem die Wohn- und Repräsentationsräume des Fürstbischofs. Im Untergeschoss befindet sich das Spitaltor, das älteste noch erhaltene und lange Zeit einzige Zugangstor zur Kernburg; erst in jüngerer Zeit wurden weitere Zugangsmöglichkeiten über den Süd- und den Westflügel geschaffen. Ursprünglich wurde das Spitaltor durch eine Zugbrücke, ein massives Eichenholztor und eine Wolfsgrube in der Durchfahrt geschützt. Der hölzerne Torflügel ist noch im Original erhalten, die Wolfsgrube wurde später entfernt und die Zugbrücke im 18.Jahrhundert durch eine steinerne Brücke ersetzt., Im Nordflügel und im Westflügel, dem sogenannten Gesindebau, befanden sich neben Unterkünften für die Dienerschaft des Fürstbischofs und für dessen Gäste Stallungen, Lager und verschiedene Werkstätten. Der Südflügel, in dem sich einst unter anderem die Schlosskapelle befand, entstand in anderer Form im 15. und 16.Jahrhundert. In der ersten Hälfte des 18.Jahrhunderts wurde er weitgehend abgebrochen und als sogenannte Neue Kaserne im Barockstil neu errichtet. Seit 1983 sind in dem Gebäudetrakt, der heute als Kommandantenbau bezeichnet wird und als einziges Gebäude der Festung eine verputzte Fassade besitzt, Museumsräume untergebracht., Im Innenhof der Kernburg befindet sich der bereits im 13.Jahrhundert errichtete Bergfried. Der etwa 38m hohe Turm mit quadratischem Grundriss hat einen Hocheingang in rund zwölf Meter Höhe, der vor dem Anbau eines schlanken Treppenturms im 16.Jahrhundert nur über eine Leiter erreichbar war. Ursprünglich bildete eine welsche Haube den oberen Abschluss des Bergfrieds; diese wurde im 19.Jahrhundert zusammen mit der darunter gelegenen Türmerstube von der bayerischen Armee entfernt und wenig später durch das heutige Dach ersetzt. An der Südseite des Innenhofs befindet sich ein etwa 45m tiefer Burgbrunnen, der von mehreren Quellen gespeist wird. Für den Fürstbischof gab es in einem Anbau am Nordostturm einen separaten Brunnen, der die benachbarte Fürstenküche versorgte., Mittlerer Bering., Um die Kernburg herum verläuft das unregelmäßig geformte Rund des mittleren Berings, der aus Zeughaustorbau, Altem und Neuem Zeughaus, dem Provianthaus und Kriegspulvermagazin und einer mit sieben Türmen versehenen Wehrmauer besteht. Errichtet wurde dieser zweite Befestigungsring, der im Süden an die Gebäude der Kernburg anstößt, hauptsächlich in der Spätgotik gegen Ende des 15.Jahrhunderts. Jedoch wurden– wie bei den Gebäuden der Kernburg– in späterer Zeit immer wieder Veränderungen und Erweiterungen vorgenommen. Die bis zu 14m dicke Wehrmauer im Norden des Berings wird nach ihrem Erbauer Fürstbischof Philipp von Henneberg als Hennebergsche Futtermauer bezeichnet. Auf der Mauer, die nicht massiv ist, sondern im Inneren hauptsächlich aus Erde und Bruchsteinen besteht, befand sich der Garten des Festungskommandanten, dem das oberste Geschoss des an die Außenseite der Mauer anliegenden Pulverturms als Gartenhaus diente., An der Ostseite des Befestigungsrings erhebt sich der Salzturm, ursprünglich ein zum Burginneren hin offener Schalenturm, der im 16.Jahrhundert für die trockene Lagerung von Salz und Schießpulver geschlossen wurde. Südwestlich des Salzturms befindet sich an der Innenseite des Mauerrings das Provianthaus, in dessen Untergeschoss sich sieben tonnengewölbte Räume befinden. Im 19.Jahrhundert wurde das Gebäude erweitert und als Kriegspulvermagazin genutzt. Der zwischen Salzturm, Provianthaus und dem Ostflügel der Kernburg gelegene kleine Platz wird als Geschützhof oder Reitschule bezeichnet. In Kriegszeiten, wenn ein Verlassen der Festung nicht möglich war, wurden hier die Pferde bewegt, um ihnen Auslauf zu bieten. Zu Beginn des 18.Jahrhunderts wurde an die Außenseite des Berings auf Höhe des Provianthauses das langgestreckte Gebäude der Artilleriekaserne angebaut. Deren Dachgeschoss verdeckt mehrere Schießscharten in der dahinter gelegenen Wallmauer., Unmittelbar westlich von Provianthaus und Artilleriekaserne erhebt sich der Schieferturm, direkt südlich des Kommandantenbaus ein weiterer Rundturm. Dieser wurde im 18.Jahrhundert bei der Umgestaltung des Südflügels der Kernburg zum Treppenaufgang umgebaut. Zwischen dem Kapitänsturm und dem im 16.Jahrhundert zum Artillerieturm ausgebauten Dicken Turm im Südwesten des Berings liegt der in späterer Zeit zum Wohntrakt erweiterte Zeughaustorbau. Das Tor in seinem Untergeschoss wurde bereits im 15.Jahrhundert eingerichtet. Ob es damals durch eine Zugbrücke geschützt wurde, ist unklar, da hier anders als beim Spitaltor im Fürstenbau keine Überreste einer Zugbrückenblende oder Ähnlichem erkennbar sind. Zumindest dürfte im 15. und 16.Jahrhundert– zusätzlich zu der Möglichkeit, Angreifer aus den Schießscharten der beiden flankierenden Türme unter Beschuss zu nehmen– ein dem Bering vorgelagerter Graben als Schutzmaßnahme existiert haben., Hinter dem Zeughaustor liegt der von den beiden Zeughäusern und dem Westflügel der Kernburg begrenzte Zeughaushof, in dem sich ein weiterer, etwa 30m tiefer Ziehbrunnen befindet. Dieser wurde jedoch nur als Pferdetränke und Wasserquelle für das einst im Zeughaushof gelegene, heute nicht mehr existierende Waschhaus genutzt. Die beiden Zeughäuser, die in einem leichten Winkel aufeinanderstoßen, dienten vor allem als Lagerraum für Waffen und andere militärische Ausrüstungsgegenstände. Das Alte Zeughaus beherbergte darüber hinaus noch Stallungen, die Amtsräume der Hauptmannschaft Kronach und den fürstbischöflichen Kastenboden, in dem das Zehntgetreide aufbewahrt wurde. An der Außenseite der Knickstelle zwischen den beiden Zeughäusern befindet sich der Luntenturm, dessen Name auf seine einstige Funktion zur Aufbewahrung von Werg und Lunten hinweist., Äußerer Bering., Der dritte und äußerste Bering besteht aus fünf in der zweiten Hälfte des 17.Jahrhunderts entstandenen barocken Bastionen mit den dazwischen liegenden Kurtinen. An der Außenseite bildet dieses Bastionärsystem ein regelmäßiges Fünfeck, das im Festungsbau als Idealform für kleinere Festungen galt, an der Innenseite nimmt der Befestigungsring die unregelmäßige Rundung des mittleren Berings wieder auf. Die Bastionen werden beginnend am Festungstor im Süden im Uhrzeigersinn gezählt und tragen die Namen St.Kunigunde (I), St.Valentin (II), St.Lothar (III), St.Philipp (IV) und St.Heinrich (V). BastionI undV wurden nach den Bamberger Bistumsheiligen Kunigunde von Luxemburg und HeinrichII. benannt, die drei anderen tragen die Namen der am Bau beteiligten Fürstbischöfe. Im 19.Jahrhundert, als Kronach und die Festung an Bayern fielen, wurden die Bastionen nach dem bayerischen König, der Königin, dem Kronprinzen etc. umbenannt; diese Namen konnten sich jedoch nicht durchsetzen, sodass heute wieder die ursprünglichen Bezeichnungen gebräuchlich sind. An jeder der fünf Bastionen befinden sich großformatige plastische Wappensteine, mit denen sich die beteiligten Fürstbischöfe repräsentativ als deren Bauherren dargestellt haben. Die Bauwerke sind so konstruiert, dass keine toten Winkel entstehen; alle Stellen rund um die Bastionen sind von anderen Positionen aus einsehbar. Die Flanken sind teilweise abgesenkt, damit die dort positionierten Geschütze den Bereich vor den Kurtinen bestreichen konnten. Zum Schutz wurden die Kanonen in Geschützkasematten hinter den Flanken zurückgezogen. An einigen Eckpunkten der Bastionen befinden sich erkerförmige Wachhäuschen. Es sind Rekonstruktionen aus dem 20.Jahrhundert; die Originale wurden 1806 auf Befehl Napoleons: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Baudenkmal, Kronach, Bauwerk, Barock, Festung, Bayern, Europa, Höhenburg, Wehrbau, Kernburg"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Bezirk in Österreich, Bezirkshauptstadt in Österreich, Ehemalige Hauptstadt (Österreich), Gemeinde im Land Salzburg, Hochschul- oder Universitätsort in Österreich, Salzburg, Stadt im Land Salzburg, Statutarstadt (Österreich)], Salzburg (in der Antike, heutige lateinische Bezeichnung \\"Salisburgum\\", im bairisch-österreichischen Dialekt \\"Soizbuag\\") ist die Landeshauptstadt des gleichnamigen Landes der Republik Österreich. Mit Einwohnern (Stand ) ist sie nach Wien, Graz und Linz die viertgrößte Stadt Österreichs. Sie liegt im Salzburger Becken. Prägend für die Stadt sind die Stadtberge, die durch das Stadtgebiet fließende Salzach und die von weitem sichtbare Festung Hohensalzburg. Der Nordwesten der Statutarstadt Salzburg grenzt an Freilassing in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Freistaat Bayern, Landkreis Berchtesgadener Land), das übrige Stadtgebiet an den Bezirk Salzburg-Umgebung, landläufig „Flachgau“ genannt., Im Jahr 488 begann der Niedergang der an dieser Stelle liegenden römischen Stadt Iuvavum. Salzburg wurde 696 als Bischofssitz neu gegründet und 798 Sitz des Erzbischofs. Die Haupteinnahmequellen Salzburgs bildeten Salzgewinnung, der Handel damit sowie der Handel mit Gold, das seit 1300 in den Tauern abgebaut wurde., Die Festung Hohensalzburg, das Wahrzeichen der Stadt und unverkennbarer, weltberühmter Teil ihrer Silhouette, stammt aus dem 11.Jahrhundert. Sie ist eine der größten mittelalterlichen Burganlagen Europas und diente während kriegerischen Belagerungen dem jeweiligen Erzbischof und den Salzburgern als Wehrburg und als Zufluchts- und Überlebensort mit eigener Zisterne., Fürsterzbischof Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau und seine Nachfolger bauten Salzburg im 17.Jahrhundert zur Residenzstadt aus. In Folge der barocken Baulust entstanden prunkvolle Schlösser und Kirchen, die bis heute das Stadtbild prägen. Im Süden der Stadt wurde Schloss Hellbrunn mit dem ihn umgebenden Schlosspark und den Alleen gebaut und die Wasserspiele eingerichtet. Als bekanntester Salzburger gilt der 1756 hier geborene Komponist Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, weshalb die Stadt den Beinamen \\"Mozartstadt\\" und der Flughafen den Namen \\"Salzburg Airport W.A. Mozart\\" trägt. Das historische Zentrum der Stadt steht seit 1996 auf der Liste des Weltkulturerbes der UNESCO., Heute ist Salzburg international für die Sommerfestspiele bekannt, die der Regisseur Max Reinhardt gemeinsam mit dem Schriftsteller Hugo von Hofmannsthal, dem Komponisten Richard Strauss und anderen 1920 ins Leben gerufen hat. Sie wurden mittlerweile um die von Herbert von Karajan gegründeten Oster- und Pfingstfestspiele sowie um die Mozartwoche im Januar erweitert, sodass die Stadt, die auch über bedeutende mittelalterliche, Renaissance- und Barock-Architektur und Mozart-Gedenkstätten verfügt, das ganze Jahr über von Touristen und Kunstliebhabern überflutet wird., Von wirtschaftlicher Bedeutung sind auch Messen und Kongresse sowie die Handels-, Tourismus- und Dienstleistungsbetriebe. Aufgrund ihrer verkehrsgünstigen Lage bildet die Stadt Salzburg den Kern der grenzüberschreitenden „EuRegio Salzburg – Berchtesgadener Land – Traunstein“. Zudem ist sie Knotenpunkt für wichtige Straßen- und Schienenrouten im West-Ost-Verkehr (Innsbruck–Salzburg–Wien) sowie transalpin bzw. von Norden nach Süden verlaufend (München–Salzburg–Villach)., Geographie., Lage., Die Stadt Salzburg liegt am Nordrand der Alpen, in der Mitte des Salzburger Beckens. Der historische Altstadtkern befindet sich an der Salzach und wird von Festungs- und Mönchsberg sowie dessen westlichem Ausläufer, dem Rainberg, begrenzt., Östlich des Altstadtkerns erheben sich am rechten Salzachufer der Kapuzinerberg und der kleine Bürglstein, im Süden der Stadt der Hellbrunner Berg und der Morzger Hügel, westlich des Stadtteils Altliefering der kleine Lieferinger Hügel. Im Südwesten befindet sich, ein wenig außerhalb der Stadtgrenze, der von einer Seilbahn erschlossene 1973m hohe Untersberg, der weit in das nördliche Umland die Silhouette prägt. Landschaftlich sind weiters der im Westen liegende Hohe Stauffen und im Süden die Salzburger Kalkhochalpen mit Göll, Hagengebirge und Tennengebirge dominant. Im Osten bilden der 1288m hohe Stadtberg Gaisberg und die Osterhorngruppe die Grenze des Salzburger Beckens. Nördlich der Stadt erreicht der Fuß des Plainberges mit der Wallfahrtsbasilika Maria Plain das Stadtgebiet. Nordöstlich schließt sich die Hügellandschaft des Flachgaus zum Alpenvorland an, mit dem Haunsberg als letztem Alpenausläufer. Ein geschlossener Auwaldgürtel entlang von Salzach und Saalach reicht im Norden bis in das Stadtgebiet hinein., Der Auwald westlich der Saalach und das dahinter liegende Hügelland, der \\"Högl\\", gehören bereits zum Landkreis Berchtesgadener Land in Bayern. Im Nordwesten grenzt das bayerische Freilassing, nur durch die Saalach getrennt, an den Salzburger Stadtteil Liefering., Die Salzburger Altstadt liegt auf 420 bis 426m Seehöhe. Der höchste Punkt des Stadtgebietes ist die Gaisbergspitze mit 1288m, die Saalachmündung am Böschungsfuß ist mit 404m der tiefste Punkt des Salzburger Beckens. Das Gemeindegebiet umfasst km², davon fallen 2238 Hektar auf Bauland (34,0 %), 503ha auf Verkehrsfläche (7,7 %), 1080ha auf Wald (16,5 %) und 342ha auf Gewässer (5,2 %)., Stadtteile., Die Stadt gliedert sich – unabhängig der historischen Katastralgemeinden – in 24Stadtteile und drei angrenzende Landschaftsräume. Den historischen Kern bildet die Altstadt links und rechts der Salzach (Stadtteil \\"Salzburger Altstadt\\"), an die die alten, seit dem Mittelalter bestehenden Vorstädte Mülln und Nonntal anschließen., Um 1900 entstand westlich der Altstadt der Stadtteil Riedenburg. Auf dem Gebiet der geschliffenen rechtsufrigen Bastionen und Kasernen entstand im Gebiet um die Andräkirche die sogenannte Neustadt, die von den Salzburgern meist \\"Andräviertel\\" genannt wird, westlich des Hauptbahnhofs der Stadtteil Elisabeth-Vorstadt und nördlich von Mülln der Stadtteil Lehen., Die meiste Architektur der Stadtteile Aigen, Parsch, Itzling und Gneis wurde nach 1900 gebaut. Die einst selbständigen Dörfer, späteren Vororte Maxglan im Westen, Liefering im Nordwesten, Gnigl im Osten und Morzg im Süden wurden in der Zwischenkriegszeit eingemeindet und gehören heute zu den Stadtteilen Salzburgs. In dieser Zeit bildete sich allmählich der durchgehend bebaute Siedlungsstreifen entlang der Moosstraße in Leopoldskron-Moos heraus., Nach 1950 entstand als jüngster Siedlungskern Salzburg-Süd mit den Teilen Josefiau, Herrnau und Alpensiedlung. Als ausgebaute alte Umstadtdörfer stammen auch die Stadtteile Langwied, Kasern, Taxham und Schallmoos aus der Mitte des 20.Jahrhunderts, ebenso im Norden der Stadtteil Itzling Nord als junger Siedlungssplitter, der sich nahtlos an den Siedlungsraum der Gemeinde Bergheim anschließt. Südlich von Gneis liegen die ebenfalls jungen Siedlungen Eichethofsiedlung und Birkensiedlung. Sie wurden unter der Stadtteilbezeichnung \\"Gneis Süd\\" zusammengefasst. Westlich des Flughafens erstreckt sich als schmaler Streifen in Nord-Süd-Richtung der Stadtteil Maxglan-West, zu dem die Kendlersiedlung und die kleinen ehemaligen Weiler Pointing und Loig gehören. Die Kendlersiedlung setzt sich in den schon zur Gemeinde Wals-Siezenheim gehörenden Häusern der Glansiedlung fort. Die Häusergruppen Pointing und Loig schließen an das Walser Siedlungsgebiet Himmelreich an., Außerhalb der Siedlungsräume liegen im Stadtgebiet von Salzburg die geschlossenen Landschaftsräume Hellbrunn sowie Gaisberg am Fuß des Stadtbergs Gaisberg und Heuberg, das die im Stadtgebiet liegenden, teils besiedelten Anhöhen des gleichnamigen Bergs einnimmt. Die Landschaftsräume werden ebenfalls als Stadtteile geführt., Katastralgemeinden., Salzburg ist in 14Katastralgemeinden aufgeteilt (Fläche Stand 31. Dezember 2019):, Die Namen der Stadtteile entsprechen großteils den gleichnamigen Katastralgemeinden, deren Grenzen weitestgehend im frühen 19.Jahrhundert (vor 1830) festgelegt wurden. Die Bezeichnung \\"AigenI\\" besagt, dass die einstige Gemeinde Aigen 1939 zum weitaus größten Teil in die Stadt Salzburg eingemeindet wurde. Der verbleibende Teil wurde unter der Bezeichnung \\"AigenII\\" als kleine eigene Katastralgemeinde der Nachbargemeinde Elsbethen zugeteilt. Gleich bzw. entsprechend umgekehrt verhält es sich bei den Katastralgemeinden LieferingI, SiezenheimII und WalsII (zur Gemeinde Wals-Siezenheim), BergheimII (zur Gemeinde Bergheim), HallwangII (zur Gemeinde Hallwang) und HeubergII (zur Gemeinde Koppl). Das Größenverhältnis der Katastralgemeinden GaisbergI in Salzburg und GaisbergII in Elsbethen ist etwa ausgeglichen., Geschichte., Frühgeschichte und bayerische Zeit., Das Gebiet der Stadt ist seit der Jungsteinzeit bis heute durchgehend besiedelt. In der La-Tène-Zeit war es ein Verwaltungszentrum der keltischen Alaunen im Königreich Noricum. Die Bevölkerung auf den Stadtbergen wurde nach dem römischen Einmarsch 15v.Chr. entsprechend der römischen Stadtplanung in den Raum der Altstadt übersiedelt. Die neue Stadt war seit Kaiser Claudius als \\"Municipium Claudium Iuvavum\\" eine der wichtigsten Städte der nun römischen Provinz Noricum., Nach der Aufgabe der Provinz Noricum 488 zu Beginn der Völkerwanderung verblieb ein Teil der romanokeltischen Bevölkerung im Land. Im 6.Jahrhundert folgte die Landnahme durch die Bajuwaren. Bischof Rupert erhielt um 696 n.Chr. die Reste der Römerstadt von Herzog TheodoII. von Bayern geschenkt, um das Land im Osten und Südosten zu missionieren. Er erneuerte das Kloster St.Peter und gründete das Benediktinen-Frauenstift Nonnberg. Das Land Salzburg und seine Grafschaften bekamen durch den aufblühenden Salzbergbau und die weiträumige Missionstätigkeit bald immer mehr Einfluss und Macht innerhalb Bayerns., 996 wurde Salzburg durch Kaiser OttoIII. das Markt-, Münz- und Mautrecht verliehen, 1120/30 ist bereits ein Stadtrichter urkundlich erwähnt. Das älteste bekannte Stadtrecht stammt aus dem Jahr 1287., Fürsterzbischöfliche Residenzstadt., Seit der Schlacht bei Mühldorf 1322 war das Erzbistum mit dem Mutterland Bayern verfeindet. In der Folge wurde Salzburg ein eigenständiges Fürsterzbistum im \\"römisch-deutschen Reich\\". Die wirtschaftliche Blüte der Stadt im 15.Jahrhundert führte zu einem selbstbewussten Bürgertum mit zunehmenden Rechten und Pflichten.

Jahrhundert), Deutscher, Geboren 1769, Gestorben 1838, Hochschullehrer (Technische Universität Berlin), Mann, Mitglied der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Unternehmer (19. Jahrhundert)], Friedrich Christian Accum (* 29. März 1769 in Bückeburg; † 28. Juni 1838 in Berlin) war ein deutscher Chemiker, dessen Hauptverdienste in der Förderung der Leuchtgaserzeugung, dem Kampf gegen Lebensmittelverfälschungen und der Popularisierung der Chemie liegen., Zwischen 1793 und 1821 lebte Accum in London, wo er ein eigenes Labor betrieb, Chemikalien und Laborgeräte verkaufte, Lehrstunden in praktischer Chemie abhielt und an mehreren naturwissenschaftlichen Forschungsinstituten arbeitete. Angeregt durch Friedrich Albert Winsor (1763–1830) und dessen langjährige Werbekampagne für die Gasbeleuchtung, begann Accum sich mit dem Thema der Leuchtgasproduktion zu beschäftigen. Im Auftrag der 1810 gegründeten \\"Gaslight and Coke Company\\" führte er zahlreiche Versuche durch und wurde 1812 in ihren ersten Vorstand berufen. Mit der von Accum geleiteten Errichtung der ersten Londoner Gasanstalt wurde die Nutzung der Gasbeleuchtung vom industriellen auf den öffentlichen und privaten Raum ausgeweitet., Accums 1820 erschienenes Werk \\"Treatise on Adulteration of Food\\", in dem er den Einsatz von giftigen Lebensmittelzusatzstoffen anprangerte, markiert den Beginn eines bewussten Umgangs mit Nahrungsmitteln. Accum war der erste, der sich dieses Themas annahm und zugleich eine breite Öffentlichkeitswirkung erzielte. Während seine Bücher beim Publikum reißenden Absatz fanden, brachte ihm seine Aufklärungsarbeit unter den Londoner Lebensmittelproduzenten zahlreiche Feinde ein. Nach einem gegen ihn angestrengten Gerichtsprozess verließ Accum England und verbrachte den Rest seines Lebens als Lehrer am Gewerbeinstitut und an der Bauakademie in Berlin., Seine vornehmlich in englischer Sprache publizierten Schriften zeichnen sich durch ein besonderes Maß an Allgemeinverständlichkeit aus. Auf diese Weise trug Accum maßgeblich zur Popularisierung des Faches Chemie bei., Leben und Werk., Jugend- und Lehrjahre., Friedrich Accum wurde am 29.März 1769 in Bückeburg, etwa 50km westlich von Hannover, geboren. Sein Vater stammte aus Vlotho an der Weser und hatte zunächst in einem Infanterieregiment des Grafen Wilhelm von Schaumburg-Lippe gedient. Im Jahr 1755 konvertierte Accums Vater vom Judentum zum evangelisch-reformierten Glauben und heiratete kurze Zeit später in Bückeburg Judith Berth dit La Motte, die Tochter eines Hutfabrikanten aus der französischen Kolonie Berlins und Enkelin eines hugenottischen Religionsflüchtlings. Bei seiner Taufe änderte er seinen Geburtsnamen Markus Herz in Christian Accum. Sowohl der Vorname Christian, der dem Wortsinn nach „Anhänger Christi“ bedeutet, als auch der aus dem hebräischen Wort „Akum“ für „Nicht-Jude“ abgeleitete Nachname unterstrichen den Religionswechsel auf besonders nachdrückliche Art und Weise. Unbekannt ist, ob dies auf Drängen der Familie seiner Braut oder aus eigenem Antrieb geschah. Auf jeden Fall begann Christian Accum nach der Hochzeit in einem ursprünglich den Eltern seiner Frau gehörenden Haus in der Bückeburger Schulstraße 141 eine selbständige Tätigkeit als Kaufmann und Seifenfabrikant und erwarb neun Jahre nach seiner Hochzeit das Bürgerrecht der Stadt. Bereits drei Jahre nach Friedrichs Taufe am 2.April 1769 starb Christian Accum im Alter von fünfundvierzig Jahren und hinterließ neben Friedrich und seiner Mutter noch die älteren Geschwister Philipp Ernst, Henriette Charlotte und die achtmonatige Ernestine, die aber bereits im Alter von fünf Jahren starb., Friedrich Accum besuchte das Bückeburger Gymnasium Adolfinum und erhielt darüber hinaus Privatunterricht in Französisch und Englisch. Nach der Schulausbildung absolvierte er eine Lehre in der Apotheke der mit den Accums befreundeten Familie Brande in Hannover. Die Brandes betrieben auch eine Filiale in London und waren die Apotheker des englisch-hannoverschen Königs Georg III. Da London als Zentrum der Technologie zum Ende des 18.Jahrhunderts große Anziehungskraft auf junge, naturwissenschaftlich interessierte Menschen aus ganz Europa ausübte, ging auch Friedrich Accum im Jahr 1793 dorthin und arbeitete als Assistent in der Apotheke Brande in der Arlington Street., Die ersten Jahre in London., Neben seiner Tätigkeit in der Apotheke der Brandes betrieb Accum zunächst naturwissenschaftliche Studien und besuchte medizinische Vorlesungen in der \\"School of Anatomy\\" in der Great Windmill Street. Er hatte Kontakt zu dem Chirurgen Anthony Carlisle (1768–1840) und zu dem Londoner Chemiker William Nicholson (1753–1815), in dessen Zeitschrift \\"Nicholson’s Journal\\" er 1798 – im Alter von neunundzwanzig Jahren – seinen ersten Fachaufsatz veröffentlichte., Am 10.Mai 1798 heiratete Accum, der seinen Namen inzwischen zu „Frederick Accum“ anglisiert hatte, die Engländerin Mary Ann Simpson (*6.März 1777; †1.März 1816 in London). Mit ihr hatte er insgesamt acht Kinder, von denen aber sechs schon tot auf die Welt kamen oder im Kindesalter starben. Sein ältestes Kind, die Tochter Flora Eliza (*17.Mai 1799), heiratete Ernst Müller, mit dem sie drei Kinder hatte. Sein Sohn Friedrich Ernst Accum (*3.April 1801; †28.Januar 1869) hatte mit seiner Frau Charlotte Wilhelmina Johanna Henkel vier Kinder, deren im Jahr 2006 noch lebende Nachfahren aber nicht mehr den Namen Accum trugen., Im Herbst des Jahres 1799 erschien in \\"Nicholson’s Journal\\" eine Übersetzung von Franz Carl Achards richtungsweisender Arbeit zur Zuckergewinnung aus Runkelrüben. Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt war das in Übersee angebaute Zuckerrohr die einzige Nutzpflanze, aus der Zucker gewonnen wurde. Entsprechend wurde die Möglichkeit einer einheimischen Zuckererzeugung mit großem Interesse aufgenommen. Schon kurze Zeit nach der Veröffentlichung ließ Accum sich aus Berlin Proben des Rübenzuckers nach London schicken und präsentierte sie William Nicholson. Es war das erste Mal, dass Rübenzucker nach England gelangte, und Nicholson veröffentlichte in seiner Zeitschrift im Januar 1800 einen detaillierten Bericht über die von ihm angestellten Untersuchungen, bei denen er keine Geschmackseinbußen gegenüber dem Rohrzucker feststellte., Laborbetreiber, Kaufmann und Privatlehrer., Im Jahr 1800 zog Accum mit seiner Familie vom Haymarket 17 in die Old Compton Street 11. Hier lebte er die nächsten zwanzig Jahre und nutzte sein Haus sowohl für den Unterricht von Schülern als auch für Experimente und zum Verkauf chemischer Stoffe und Apparaturen. Auf seinen aus jener Zeit erhaltenen \\"professional cards\\", mit denen Accum seine Dienste anbot, beschrieb er selbst seine Tätigkeit in der Old Compton Street wie folgt:, An seine Kunden in London verteilte Accum in der Old Compton Street Kataloge seiner Waren und verschickte diese auf Nachfrage auch in andere Städte Englands und ins Ausland., Accums Labor in der Old Compton Street war für lange Jahre die einzige bedeutendere Einrichtung in Großbritannien, an der ergänzend zu den theoretischen Vorlesungen zur Chemie auch praktische Laborübungen veranstaltet wurden. Accums Unterricht zog ein zum Teil prominentes Publikum an. Zu seinen Zuhörern gehörten so bekannte Londoner Politiker wie der spätere Premierminister Lord Palmerston, der Duke of Bedford oder der Duke of Northumberland. Gleichzeitig war Accums Labor die erste europäische Lehranstalt für Chemie, die auch von Studenten und Wissenschaftlern aus den Vereinigten Staaten besucht wurde, unter ihnen so berühmte Namen wie Benjamin Silliman und William Dandridge Peck. Als Silliman später Professor für Chemie am Yale College (der heutigen Yale University) in New Haven wurde, bestellte er die erste Laborausstattung bei Accum in London. Accums Biograph Charles Albert Browne vermutete in einer 1925 erschienenen Lebensskizze, dass sich an einigen der älteren US-amerikanischen Colleges noch Belege für Lieferungen aus Accums Londoner Geschäft finden ließen., Bei der Entwicklung neuer Laborgeräte standen für Accum Praktikabilität und geringe Anschaffungskosten im Mittelpunkt. Auch Laien sollten in die Lage versetzt werden, einfache chemische Untersuchungen durchzuführen. So entwickelte Accum tragbare Laborkisten zur Analyse von Boden- und Gesteinsproben für Landwirte, bei denen auch im Falle des Umkippens keine Reagenzien auslaufen konnten. Die zu Preisen zwischen drei und achtzig Pfund Sterling angebotenen Truhen waren die ersten tragbaren Chemielabore., Dozent und Forscher., Im März 1801 erhielt Friedrich Accum eine Berufung an die \\"Royal Institution\\" in der Albemarle Street, ein erst zwei Jahre zuvor von dem Experimentalphysiker Graf Rumford gegründetes Forschungsinstitut. Dort arbeitete er als Laborassistent unter Humphry Davy, der zugleich mit ihm zum Direktor des Labors berufen worden war und später Präsident der \\"Royal Society\\" werden sollte. Accums Tätigkeit an der \\"Royal Institution\\" war allerdings nicht von langer Dauer, denn schon im September 1803 schied er auf eigenen Wunsch aus. Sein Biograph R. J. Cole vermutet einen Zusammenhang mit dem ungefähr gleichzeitigen Weggang des Grafen Rumford nach Paris, der dort Marie Lavoisier, die Witwe des 1794 guillotinierten Chemikers Antoine Laurent de Lavoisier, heiratete. Rumford war die treibende Kraft hinter Accums Berufung an die \\"Royal Institution\\" gewesen und vor diesem Hintergrund erscheint es plausibel, dass das Ausscheiden Accums mit dem seines Förderers zusammenhing., Bis 1803 veröffentlichte Accum eine Reihe weiterer Artikel in \\"Nicholson’s Journal\\", die einen breiten Themenbereich abdeckten: vom Auftreten von Benzoesäure in alten Vanilleschoten über Möglichkeiten, die Reinheit von Medikamenten zu bestimmen, bis hin zu Beobachtungen über die Explosivität von Schwefel-Phosphor-Gemischen. Weitaus bedeutender als diese zumeist recht kurzen Abhandlungen war jedoch sein 1803 veröffentlichtes Werk \\"System of Theoretical and Practical Chemistry\\". Es war das erste auf Englisch veröffentlichte Buch, das auf den bahnbrechenden Erkenntnissen des häufig als „Vater der modernen Chemie“ bezeichneten französischen Chemikers Lavoisier beruhte. Darüber hinaus zeichnete es sich dadurch aus, dass der Text in einer allgemeinverständlichen Sprache gehalten war. Cole bewertet Accums erste umfangreichere Arbeit deshalb auch als eine „herausragende“ Leistung., Seine ersten Vorlesungen zur Chemie und Mineralogie hielt Accum noch in einem kleinen Saal seines Hauses in der Old Compton Street. Seine Zuhörerschaft wuchs jedoch so schnell, dass er bald in das \\"Medical Theater\\" in der Cork Street ausweichen musste. Das große Interesse der Londoner Öffentlichkeit an seinen Vorlesungen führte nach Accums Weggang von der \\"Royal Institution\\" zu seiner Anstellung an der \\"Surrey Institution\\" in der Londoner Blackfriars Road. Einer in der Londoner \\"Times\\" erschienenen Zeitungsannonce vom 6.Januar 1809 lässt sich entnehmen, dass Accum jeden Mittwochabend um 19Uhr Kurse in Mineralogie und der chemischen Analyse von Metallen anbot. Seine verstärkte Beschäftigung mit der Mineralogie in jener Zeit ist auch an den Titeln von zwei Büchern ablesbar, die Accum zwischen 1803 und 1809 schrieb:: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Autor, Chemiker, 19.

Dezember 1932 in Macon, Georgia, als \\"Richard Wayne Penniman;\\" † 9. Mai 2020 in Tullahoma, Tennessee) war ein amerikanischer Rock-’n’-Roll-Sänger, -Pianist und -Songwriter. Während der erfolgreichsten Phase seiner Karriere bei Specialty Records Mitte der 1950er Jahre kombinierte der afroamerikanische Musiker Stilelemente aus Blues, Gospel sowie Rhythm and Blues unter der neuen Genrebezeichnung „Rock ’n’ Roll“ und überführte sie damit in den musikalischen Mainstream. Nach hohen Platzierungen in den von schwarzen Interpreten dominierten Rhythm-and-Blues-Charts gelang ihm das Crossover in den genreunabhängigen amerikanischen Popmarkt. Sein schnelles und kraftvolles Pianospiel, sein lauter und überdrehter Gesang sowie seine energiereichen Konzerte inspirierten viele namhafte Musiker., Nach einem mehrjährigen Rückzug für religiöse Studien begann Little Richard in den 1960er Jahren ein Comeback, für das er seinen Sound in Richtung Soul und Funk weiterentwickelte. Ohne an frühere Verkaufserfolge anknüpfen zu können, steigerte er die Extravaganz seiner Bühnenauftritte durch Selbstinszenierung und Elemente der Travestie. Seit den 1980ern stand Little Richard nur noch sporadisch im Aufnahmestudio oder auf der Bühne. Aufgrund seiner genreprägenden und vielgecoverten Songs und deren Charterfolge gehört Little Richard zu den Wegbereitern und Hauptvertretern des Rock ’n’ Roll, weshalb er 1986 als einer der ersten Musiker in die Rock and Roll Hall of Fame aufgenommen wurde., Leben., Kindheit, Jugend und erste Aufnahmen (1932–1955): Rhythm and Blues., Richard Wayne Penniman wurde am 5.Dezember 1932 in Macon im US-Bundesstaat Georgia als drittes Kind von Leava Mae und Charles „Bud“ Penniman geboren. Er wuchs zusammen mit sieben Brüdern und fünf Schwestern auf. In der Familie erhielt er aufgrund seiner damaligen Körpergröße den Spitznamen „Little“ („kleiner“) Richard. Bud Penniman sorgte als Klubbesitzer unter anderem durch den Handel mit schwarzgebranntem Schnaps für ein bescheidenes Auskommen der Familie. Als häufiger Besucher von Gottesdiensten der örtlichen Pfingstkirche sowie der baptistischen und methodistischen Gemeinden entwickelte Little Richard eine Vorliebe für Gospelmusik, die er als Mitglied der Gruppe The Tiny Tots bei Auftritten in den Kirchen und in den Straßen von Macon und Umgebung aufführte. Dabei entstand sein Wunsch, Priester zu werden. Bei einem Konzert von Sister Rosetta Tharpe im Macon City Auditorium hatte der junge Sänger einen Gastauftritt, der vom Publikum wohlwollend aufgenommen wurde. Bereits als Heranwachsender verspürte Little Richard homosexuelle Neigungen, die in seinem familiären Umfeld auf Spott und bei seinem Vater auf Ablehnung stießen., Da er sein Elternhaus als beengend empfand, verließ er mit 14 Jahren die Highschool und schloss sich mehreren Vaudeville- und Medicine-Shows an, bei denen er seine Erfahrungen als Sänger vertiefen und an seiner Bühnenpräsenz arbeiten konnte. So trug er seine Haare als mächtige Pompadour-Frisur und nahm seinen Spitznamen „Little Richard“ als Künstlernamen an. Schließlich erhielt er um 1951 in Atlanta, einem Zentrum der damaligen Rhythm-and-Blues-Szene, ein Engagement beim Jump-Blues-Sänger Billy Wright, aus dessen Show er Travestie-Elemente wie Frauenkostüme und Make-up übernahm. Wright vermittelte ihm auch einen Studiotermin für erste Blues-Aufnahmen bei RCA Records. Wieder in Macon, freundete sich Little Richard mit dem Rhythm-and-Blues-Musiker Esquerita an, der ihm das besonders „wilde“ Klavierspielen beibrachte. Mit der RCA-Single \\"Every Hour\\" hatte Little Richard 1952 einen ersten regionalen Radiohit. Das versöhnte ihn mit seinem Vater, der kurz darauf bei einer Schießerei vor dessen Klub ums Leben kam. Little Richard nahm daraufhin eine Arbeit als Tellerwäscher im Restaurant der örtlichen Greyhound-Busstation an, um die Familie zu unterstützen. Die unbefriedigende und gering bezahlte Arbeit veranlasste ihn, sich professionell der Musik zu widmen und kommerziellen Erfolg anzustreben., Mit der neu formierten Band The Tempo Toppers spielte Little Richard in Klubs der Südstaaten und erlernte in New Orleans von Earl King den typischen kreolischen Bluesstil. 1953 entdeckte der Produzent Johnny Otis in Houston die Gruppe und deren Frontmann, der sich als „King and Queen“ („König und Königin“) des Blues vermarktete, und ermöglichte die nächsten Aufnahmen bei Peacock Records. Die Zusammenarbeit, aus der neben \\"Directly from My Heart to You\\" nur noch wenige Blues- und Gospel-Nummern hervorgingen, war nicht frei von Konflikten. So schlug sich Little Richard im Streit um Tantiemen mit dem Besitzer des Labels Don Robey. Nach einiger Zeit als Solokünstler stellte Little Richard aus dem Schlagzeuger Charles „Chuck“ Connor und dem Saxophonisten Wilbert „Lee Diamond“ Smith den Kern seiner zukünftigen Liveband The Upsetters zusammen. Die anschließenden Tourneen durch Kentucky, Georgia und Tennessee kamen mit einem gegenüber den Tempo Toppers deutlich härteren Rhythm-and-Blues-Programm, darunter auch einer frühen Version von Little Richards Komposition \\"Tutti Frutti,\\" beim Publikum ausgesprochen gut an., Durchbruch und Karriere-Höhepunkt (1955–1957): Rock ’n’ Roll., Auf Anraten des Sängers Lloyd Price sandte Little Richard im Frühjahr 1955 ein Demotape an Art Rupe, den Chef des kalifornischen Independent-Labels Specialty Records in Los Angeles. Dessen A&amp;R-Manager und Produzent Bumps Blackwell ließ sich durch Little Richards hartnäckige telefonische Nachfragen zu einer ersten Aufnahmesession im J&amp;M Recording Studio von Cosimo Matassa in New Orleans überreden. Er buchte hierfür mit Earl Palmer am Schlagzeug, Lee Allen und Alvin „Red“ Tyler an den Saxophonen sowie Frank Fields am Bass dessen renommierte Studioband. In dieser Konstellation und mit wechselnden Gitarristen entstanden in den kommenden zwei Jahren in fünf Studiosessions Little Richards größte Hits und Verkaufserfolge, darunter \\"Tutti Frutti, Long Tall Sally, Ready Teddy, Rip It Up, Good Golly Miss Molly, Jenny Jenny\\" und \\"The Girl Can’t Help It.\\" Für drei Aufnahmetermine ging Little Richard in Kalifornien ins Studio, wobei er einmal von Guitar Slims Band unter der Leitung von Lloyd Lambert und zweimal von den Upsetters begleitet wurde. Seine Liveband ist auch auf Einspielungen aus Washington zu hören, die während einer Konzertreise entstanden., Für Specialty nahm Little Richard von 1955 bis 1957 Material für knapp 20 Singles, sechs EPs sowie die drei Alben \\"Here’s Little Richard, Little Richard\\" und \\"The Fabulous Little Richard\\" auf. Er erarbeitete sich seinen Erfolg, indem er mit den Upsetters auf ausgedehnte Konzertreisen ging und seine Lieder bei Kurzauftritten in Musikfilmen promoten ließ. Mit dem Vertrag bei Specialty Records war Little Richard unzufrieden, da durch die Vermarktung der Musikstücke durch den labeleigenen Musikverlag Venice Music der Großteil der Einnahmen bei Art Rupe verblieb. Diese Übervorteilung förderte den baldigen Bruch der Zusammenarbeit mit Specialty Records., Berufung zum Prediger (1957–1964): Gospel., Ende September 1957 flog Little Richard an der Seite Eddie Cochrans und Gene Vincents für eine vierzehntägige Tournee nach Australien. Während des Fluges interpretierte er die Propellertriebwerke, die wegen der Hitze an den Tragflächen vor dem Nachthimmel leuchteten, als Engel. Bei einem Konzerttermin in Sydney beobachtete er am 4.Oktober den gerade gestarteten Satelliten Sputnik1, den er auf seinem Weg in den Orbit als Feuerball wahrnahm. Diese Erlebnisse verstand er als Warnungen Gottes, und er beschloss, sein unstetes Leben als Rock-’n’-Roll-Musiker zu beenden und Priester zu werden. Gegenüber seinem Umfeld und seinen Anhängern, die mit Unverständnis reagierten, begründete Little Richard seinen Rückzug mit seinem bisherigen lasterhaften und ausschweifenden Lebensstil, der sich nicht mit seiner religiösen Überzeugung vertrüge., Little Richard begann in verschiedenen Kirchen der Erweckungsbewegung zu predigen und trat im Herbst 1958 eine dreieinhalbjährige theologische Ausbildung bei den Siebenten-Tags-Adventisten im Oakwood Bible College in Huntsville, Alabama an. Die Kirchenleitung schätzte die Popularität Little Richards sowie seine Fähigkeit, andere zu begeistern, und tolerierte das Aufsehen, das er durch sein extrovertiertes Erscheinen auf dem Campus verursachte, genauso wie die häufigen Verstöße gegen die Schulordnung. Die im Juli 1959 geschlossene Ehe mit der Sekretärin Ernestine Campbell aus Washington, D.C. wurde 1964 geschieden. Zum einen störte sich seine Frau an der Öffentlichkeit, die Little Richards Prominenz mit sich brachte, zum anderen räumte er im Rückblick ein, dass er sich aufgrund seiner homosexuellen Orientierung nicht ausreichend um die Ehe bemüht habe., Little Richard vollzog diese Wende in seiner Karriere auch musikalisch, indem er sich nun vornehmlich dem Gospelstil widmete. Für George Goldners Plattenlabel End Records nahm Richard Mitte 1959 mehrere Gospelsongs auf, die im Albenformat als \\"Pray Along With Little Richard Vol.1\\" und \\"Vol.2\\" bei der assoziierten Plattenfirma Golddisc Records erschienen. Bumps Blackwell, der zwischenzeitlich zu Mercury Records gewechselt war, konnte Richard 1961 für einige Studiotermine gewinnen. Die Aufnahmen entstanden unter der Orchesterleitung von Quincy Jones und wurden als LP \\"It’s Real\\" und später als \\"Little Richard. King of Gospel Singers\\" veröffentlicht. Während weitere Einspielungen von religiösen Liedern für Atlantic Records wenig erfolgreich blieben, vermarktete Specialty Records nach und nach alle Aufnahmen von Little Richard aus den eigenen Archiven, darunter die seinerzeit für zu schwach befundenen frühen Bluesnummern, und konnte so bis 1960 regelmäßig Platten mit Originalmaterial veröffentlichen., Der englische Musikpromoter Don Arden lud Little Richard zu einer England-Tournee mit dessen ehemaligem Specialty-Kollegen Sam Cooke ein, der inzwischen im Pop-Genre sehr erfolgreich war. Arden verschwieg einerseits gegenüber Little Richard, dass das europäische Publikum dessen Gospel-Platten weitgehend ignorierte, andererseits machte er die britischen Fans glauben, der Musiker sei für eine Rock-’n’-Roll-Tour gebucht. Als dieser zu seiner ersten Show im Oktober 1962 mit Unterstützung des jungen Organisten Billy Preston begann, spirituelle Lieder wie \\"I Believe\\" und \\"Peace in the Valley\\" zu spielen, reagierte das Publikum enttäuscht und unwillig. Daher organisierte Little Richard mit den Begleitmusikern ein spontanes Rock-’n’-Roll-Comeback, das so enthusiastisch gefeiert wurde, dass er die folgende Tour ganz im alten Genre und in altbekannter Inszenierung durchzog. Brian Epstein, der damalige Manager der Beatles, vereinbarte daraufhin mit der Band und Little Richard einige gemeinsame Konzerte in Nordengland sowie eine anschließende Tour durch Hamburger Clubs., Bei einer zweiten England-Tournee Mitte 1963, zu der Don Arden neben Little Richard die Everly Brothers und Bo Diddley buchte, standen die noch nahezu unbekannten Rolling Stones auf derselben Bühne. In der amerikanischen Heimat blieb seine Abkehr von der Musik und der Lebensführung eines Geistlichen zunächst unbemerkt.

Seit 2017 sind etwa 102 Arten bekannt, von denen vier auch im deutschsprachigen Raum heimisch sind, die Mehrzahl findet sich jedoch in Mittelamerika., Beschreibung., Wuchsformen., Fast alle Fettkraut-Arten sind ausdauernde krautige Pflanzen (bis auf die einjährigen Arten \\"Pinguicula crenatiloba\\", \\"Pinguicula sharpii\\", \\"Pinguicula takakii\\" und \\"Pinguicula pumila\\"). Alle Arten bilden grundständige Rosetten., Grob können die Fettkräuter in zwei Hauptgruppen mit je zwei Untergruppen eingeteilt werden. Die Unterteilung der Hauptgruppen geht dabei auf klimatische Gegebenheiten zurück, die der Untergruppen auf morphologische Merkmale., Generell gilt für alle Fettkräuter, dass sie saisonal wechselnd sogenannte vegetative und generative Rosetten bilden. Tropische Wuchsformen beenden dabei jede Rosettenbildung mit der Ausbildung einer Blüte und gehen nach dieser wiederum in die nächste Rosettenform über. Die sogenannten „temperierten Wuchsformen“ hingegen bilden zwar eine vegetative Rosette aus, diese aber blüht nicht, sondern bildet in ihrem Zentrum einen Hibernakel, der als Überwinterungsorgan dient. Nach der Ausbildung des Hibernakels sterben die Blätter der vegetativen Rosette ab. Erst nach Überwinterung und Neuaustrieb einer Rosette beginnt die Pflanze die Bildung einer Blüte., Als Unterscheidungsmerkmal der Untergruppen dient wiederum die Gestalt der Rosetten einer Art. Wenn vegetative und generative Rosette einer Art in ihrem Erscheinungsbild identisch sind, so spricht man von „homophyllem Wuchs“, wenn sie sich in Form und/oder Größe unterscheiden, so spricht man von „heterophyllem Wuchs“., So ergeben sich vier Formenkreise:, Wurzeln., Das Wurzelwerk der Fettkräuter ist nur schwach ausgeprägt. Es ist weiß und fein und dient in erster Linie der Verankerung im Untergrund, zur Aufnahme von Feuchtigkeit sowie von Spurenelementen. Bei Arten temperierter Zonen, die Hibernakel ausbilden, sind diese wurzellos, mit der Ausnahme des Alpen-Fettkrauts. Bei den (wenigen) epiphytischen Arten (zum Beispiel \\"Pinguiculalignicola\\") sind die Wurzeln zusätzlich mit Haftscheiben versehen., Blätter., Die Blätter sind glatt, fest und sukkulent, von meist hellgrüner, gelegentlich rötlich überhauchter Farbe. Sie sind – je nach Art – zwischen 2 und 30 Zentimeter groß. In Relation zur Gesamtgröße der Pflanze sind die Blätter groß und je nach Sippe unterschiedlich geformt; häufig finden sich jedoch eiförmige, spatelige oder längliche Formen., Wie alle Gattungen der Familie der Wasserschlauchgewächse sind die Fettkräuter karnivor. Zur Sekretion ist die Blattoberfläche mit zwei Typen von Drüsen versehen: gestielte Drüsen und sitzende Drüsen. Das von den gestielten Drüsen ausgeschiedene Fangsekret, an dem Beutetiere kleben bleiben, lässt die Blätter fettig glänzen. Dieser Glanz lockt wahrscheinlich – ähnlich wie bei anderen Karnivoren mit Klebefallen (Sonnentau, Regenbogenpflanzen) – die Beute an. Das erbeutete Tier gerät sodann in Kontakt mit den sitzenden Drüsen der Blattoberfläche, von denen daraufhin der enzymhaltige Verdauungssaft ausgeschieden wird. Nachgewiesene Enzyme sind Amylase, Esterase, Phosphatase, Protease und Ribonuklease. Die Blätter sind beweglich, allerdings sehr langsam, und können sich an den Rändern über sich nicht im Zentrum des Blattes befindende Beute einrollen. Auch können sie kleine Vertiefungen in der Blattoberfläche um die Beute bilden, in denen sich Verdauungssäfte zwecks besserer Zersetzung der Beute sammeln. Blattbereiche, die bereits einmal Beute gemacht haben, können dabei nicht noch ein weiteres Mal Beute zersetzen, da die gestielten Drüsen nur „Einweg“-Drüsen sind. Die durch die Zersetzung der Beute gelösten Nährstoffe werden anschließend durch Öffnungen in der Kutikula absorbiert. Da die Kutikula die Pflanzen auch vor Austrocknung schützt und diese bei Fettkräutern durch die Öffnungen vielfach durchbrochen ist, ist die Gattung auf luftfeuchte Habitate angewiesen., Das Beutespektrum umfasst meist kleinste Fluginsekten, allerdings können die Pflanzen auch effizient Pollen verwerten, der auf ihre relativ große Blattoberfläche geweht wird., Blüten., Wie bei fast allen Karnivoren ragen die zwittrigen Blüten weit über die eigentliche Pflanze hinaus, um ein Fangen von möglichen Bestäubern zu verhindern. Die einzeln stehenden und langblühenden Blüten, an denen sich die Verwandtschaft der Fettkräuter mit den anderen Wasserschlauchgewächsen am deutlichsten zeigt, sind zygomorph, die Krone hat zwei ausgeprägte Lippen und ist an ihrem Ansatz gespornt. Die Oberlippe der Krone ist zweigeteilt, die Unterlippe dreigetreilt. Der verwachsene Kelch ist üblicherweise fünfteilig, die Oberlippe des Kelches drei-, die Unterlippe zweigeteilt. Meist sind die Blüten blau, violett oder weiß, oft auch mit gelb, seltener sind grünliche oder rötliche Färbungen. Letztere findet sich besonders ausgeprägt bei den starkroten Blüten von \\"Pinguicula laueana\\" und \\"Pingucula caryophyllacea\\"., Die genaue Gestalt der Blüte dient als diagnostisches Merkmal zur Unterteilung der Gattung in Untergattungen, ebenso die Blütenfarbe, bei mehrfarbigen Blüten auch deren Kombination., Frucht und Samen., Die eiförmigen bis kugeligen Kapselfrüchte öffnen sich bei Trockenheit in zwei Klappen und schließen sich bei Feuchtigkeit wieder, um so die zahlreichen Samen zu schützen und ihre Ausbreitung durch Windstreuung zu fördern. Die mit einer Länge von 0,5 bis 1 Millimetern relativ feinen Samen sind goldbraun. Die Samen der meisten Arten tragen an ihrer Oberfläche ein Netzmuster, um so auf Wasseroberflächen ohne Versinken treiben zu können (ausgenommen epiphythische Arten, deren Samenoberfläche glatt ist)., Chromosomensätze., Die Chromosomengrundzahlen betragen bei \\"Pinguicula\\"-Arten meist x = 8 oder x = 11, eine Ausnahme dieser Regel ist \\"Pinguicula lusitanica\\", deren Chromosomengrundzahl x = 6 beträgt., Vegetative Vermehrung., Neben der generativen Vermehrung über Samen gibt es in dieser Gattung mehrere Möglichkeiten der vegetativen Vermehrung., Viele Fettkraut-Arten (z.B. \\"Pinguicula vulgaris\\") bilden zum Zeitpunkt der Blüte oder kurz darauf kleine Brutzwiebeln, aus denen sich neue, genetisch identische Pflanzen entwickeln. Einige wenige Arten bilden auch Ausläufer (z.B. \\"Pinguicula calyptrata\\", \\"Pinguicula vallisnerifolia\\") oder Kindeln (z.B. \\"Pinguicula heterophylla\\", \\"Pinguicula primuliflora\\") an ihren Blattspitzen., Verbreitung., Die Gattung \\"Pinguicula\\" ist über die ganze Nordhalbkugel der Erde verteilt; in Afrika ist die Verbreitung dabei auf den äußersten Nordwesten beschränkt. Vor allem sind die \\"Pinguicula\\"-Arten aber von Mexiko über Zentral- und Kuba bis Südamerika zu finden, wo die Vorkommen weit über den Äquator hinweg bis nach Feuerland ausstrahlen. Nicht vertreten ist die Gattung \\"Pinguicula\\" nur in Australien und Neuseeland., Das Ursprungsgebiet der Gattung \\"Pinguicula\\" ist wahrscheinlich Mexiko, das auch das Diversitätszentrum der Gattung bildet – rund 50 Prozent der etwa 100 Arten finden sich allein in Mexiko, in Europa finden sich zwölf Arten, in Nordamerika zehn. Von Mexiko aus haben sich die Vorläufer der Gattung \\"Pinguicula\\" wahrscheinlich auf das heutige Europa verbreitet, bevor die früheren Superkontinente unüberbrückbar auseinanderdrifteten (vergleiche auch: Laurasia, Pangaea)., Weit mehr als die Hälfte aller Arten hat sehr kleinräumige Areale. Die beiden am weitesten verbreiteten Arten, das Gemeine Fettkraut (\\"Pinguicula vulgaris\\") und das Alpen-Fettkraut (\\"Pinguicula alpina\\"), sind auch im deutschsprachigen Raum heimisch. Als Alpenpflanze findet sich zudem in Österreich und der Schweiz noch das Dünnspornige Fettkraut (\\"Pinguicula leptoceras\\") und in der Schweiz das Großblütige Fettkraut (\\"Pinguicula grandiflora\\"), für letzteres ist auch ein angesalbter Standort in Nordrhein-Westfalen bekannt., Standortansprüche., Im Allgemeinen gedeihen Fettkraut-Arten am besten auf nährstoffarmen, neutralen bis alkalischen Böden. Verschiedene Arten haben sich jedoch auch andere Böden wie sauren Torf (\\"Pinguicula vulgaris\\", \\"Pinguicula calyptrata\\", \\"Pinguicula lusitanica\\") oder reinen Gips (\\"Pinguicula gypsicola\\") erobert oder siedeln teils auf blankem, aufrechtem Fels (\\"Pinguicularamosa\\", \\"Pinguicula vallisneriifolia\\"). Einige wenige Arten haben sich auch zu Epiphyten gewandelt (\\"Pinguicula casabitoana\\", \\"Pinguicula lignicola\\")., Fettkräuter benötigen Biotope, die zumindest zur Vegetationszeit feucht bis nass sind, können aber in Gestalt von sukkulenten Winterrosetten Zeiten relativer bis extrem starker Trockenheit überstehen. Als Feuchtigkeit kann durchaus Sprüh- oder Sickerwasser ausreichen. Anders als viele andere Karnivoren bevorzugen Fettkräuter zwar offene, aber nicht direkt besonnte Standorte, oftmals werden sogar halbschattige bis schattige Standorte bevorzugt., Gefährdung., Die Gefährdung der \\"Pinguicula\\"-Arten lässt sich nicht auf einen Nenner bringen, da die Situation der einzelnen Arten sehr unterschiedlich ist. Sie unterscheiden sich stark in ihrer Verbreitung und haben differierende Standortansprüche. Besonders stark bedroht jedoch sind einige Endemiten wie zum Beispiel \\"Pinguicula ramosa\\", \\"Pinguicula casabitoana\\" oder \\"Pinguicula fiorii\\", wobei als bedrohendster Faktor hierfür Habitatzerstörung zu nennen ist. Die nordamerikanische \\"Pinguicula ionantha\\" wird im Anhang 1 des Washingtoner Artenschutzabkommens gelistet. Die in Deutschland vorkommenden Arten sind sämtlich nach Bundesartenschutzverordnung geschützt., Botanische Geschichte., Zum ersten Mal erwähnt wurde das Fettkraut als „zitroch chrawt oder smalz chrawt“ von Vitus Auslasser in seinem Kräuterbuch „Macer de Herbarium“ aus dem Jahre 1479. Der Name „Zittrochkraut“ ist auch heute noch in Tirol für die Fettkräuter gebräuchlich. Der botanische Name geht auf Conrad Gessner zurück, der 1561 in seinem „Horti Germaniae“ auf die fettglänzenden Blätter verwies, \\"„propter pinguia et tenera fol: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"fleischfressende Pflanze, Wasserschlauchgewächse, Fettkräuter, Gattung, Ausdauernde Pflanzen, Rosetten, Wurzeln, Blätter, Karnivoren, Blüten, Samen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Architekturgeschichte von Frankfurt am Main, Bauwerk in Frankfurt-Altstadt, Fachwerkhaus in Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt am Main im 16. Jahrhundert, Geschichte der Salzwirtschaft, Kulturdenkmal in Frankfurt-Altstadt, Renaissancebauwerk in Frankfurt am Main], Das Salzhaus ist ein historisches Gebäude in Frankfurt am Main. Es bildet den nordöstlichsten, vom Römerberg aus gesehen ganz rechts gelegenen Gebäudeteil des Frankfurter Rathauskomplexes., Das Salzhaus entstand ursprünglich um 1600 mit einer reichen Schnitzfassade an der Giebelseite, womit es nicht nur der kunsthandwerklich als der mit Abstand bedeutsamste bürgerliche Bau der Stadt, sondern auch als eine der größten Leistungen der Renaissance im deutschen Sprachraum galt. In dieser Form wurde das Gebäude im März 1944 bei einem Bombenangriff weitgehend zerstört. Der Sockel des Altbaus blieb erhalten, die Geschosse darüber wurden 1951/52 in simpler Architektursprache der Nachkriegszeit aufgebaut. Ein Wiederaufbau der historischen Fassade wurde in den 1980ern im Zuge der Rekonstruktion der Ostzeile diskutiert, aber nicht ausgeführt. Seitdem haben sich die Freunde Frankfurts dieses Themas angenommen., Während der Giebel des Salzhauses zum Römerberg gerichtet ist, erstreckt sich die Fassade der nördlichen Traufseite entlang der Braubachstraße, die den Römerberg vom Paulsplatz trennt. Im Süden grenzt das Gebäude an das \\"Haus Frauenstein\\" und im Westen an das Haus \\"Wanebach\\" an, mit denen es im Innern seit dem 19. Jahrhundert verbunden ist. Die Hausanschrift ist \\"Römerberg27\\"., Geschichte., Erste Erwähnung bis 16. Jahrhundert., Die erste Erwähnung des Gebäudes geht auf eine Urkunde vom 5. Mai 1324 zurück, nach der es ebenso wie das Nachbarhaus zu dieser Zeit im Besitz der vornehmen Frankfurter Patrizierfamilie \\"Wanebach\\" war. Obwohl noch im Volksmund als Haus \\"zum Hohen Homperg\\" bekannt, eine Bezeichnung, deren Etymologie nicht völlig geklärt ist, wurde es in verschiedenen Dokumenten des 14. Jahrhunderts auch schon als Salzhaus bezeichnet, was sich vom hier stattfindenden Salzhandel ableitete., Der Salzverkauf war ein königliches Regal, die sogenannte \\"Salzgerechtigkeit\\". Sie sicherte dem König hohe regelmäßige Einnahmen. Durch Verpachtung oder Verpfändung ging das Salzregal allmählich auf den Rat der Stadt, vielleicht auch direkt in die Hände selbstständiger Kaufleute über. Ein Beweis, dass Salzhandel, in welcher Form auch immer, seit frühesten Zeiten im Haus stattgefunden hat, waren große steinerne, in den Gewölbekeller des Hauses integrierte Becken, die sich hier noch im frühen 20. Jahrhundert erhalten hatten. Ferner ist die Berufsbezeichnung des \\"Selzers\\" mit einem \\"Werner Selzer neben dem Römer\\" bereits im Jahr 1300 das erste Mal erwähnt. Aufgrund der wachsenden Stadtgröße gab es später auch andere „Salzhäuser“ in Frankfurt, bei denen diese Bezeichnung jedoch nie in den Volksmund überkam, unter anderem das Haus \\"zum Pelikan\\" an der Ecke der Altstadtgassen \\"Kleiner Hirschgraben\\" und \\"Am Salzhaus\\"., Es ist wahrscheinlich, dass sich auf der mit dem gemeinhin als Salzhaus bekannten Parzelle bis ins frühe 17. Jahrhundert hinein zwei eigenständige, entsprechend sehr schmale Fachwerkgebäude befanden. Dies zeigen sowohl Bilder des Römerbergs aus verschiedenen älteren Krönungstagebüchern als auch der Belagerungsplan der Stadt von Conrad Faber aus dem Jahre 1552, der an der Stelle des Gebäudes zwei Dachgiebel erkennen lässt. Der Plan ist aufgrund seiner zahlreichen Ungenauigkeiten ein jedoch nur wenig belastbares historisches Beweismittel. Unabhängig davon wäre die Existenz zweier Häuser die naheliegendste Erklärung für die gleichzeitige Erwähnung des Hauses zum Hohen Homperg mit dem eigentlichen Salzhaus., Bis zum Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts finden sich nur noch drei urkundliche Nachrichten, die für die Geschichte des Bauwerks von Bedeutung sind. 1387 war das Salzhaus demnach im Besitz des Gelnhäuser Bürgers \\"Heinrich Bredemann\\", der es am 6. Februar desselben Jahres an einen \\"Wigand Dagestel\\" verkaufte. Weiterhin versammelte sich in den Jahren 1417 bis 1423 hier die 1407 erstmals erwähnte \\"Gesellschaft zur Goldenen Schmiede\\", die ihren Namen vom nahen Stammhaus mit der Anschrift \\"Neue Kräme 17\\" hatte. Nach 1423 zogen sie in das benachbarte Haus \\"Frauenstein\\" um. Hier entwickelte sich die \\"Gesellschaft Frauenstein\\" zur zweiten bedeutenden Patriziervereinigung in Frankfurt nach der Adelsgesellschaft Alten Limpurg. Die Frauensteiner stellten bis in die frühe Neuzeit Dutzende Male unter anderem den Bürgermeister der Stadt., Knapp 40 Jahre später, um 1460, unterhielt der damalige Besitzer, ein \\"Henne Brun\\", im Salzhaus ein privates Schuldengefängnis. Auf Antrag des Gläubigers nahm der Rat der Stadt säumige Schuldner bis zu 4 Wochen in Haft, danach durfte ihn der Gläubiger bis zur Bezahlung der Schuld weiter festhalten, allerdings auf eigene Kosten. Hierzu dienten die im mittelalterlichen Frankfurt häufigen, durch genaue städtische Vorschriften geregelten Privatgefängnisse. Das Gefängnis im Salzhaus befand sich im Kellergewölbe, wo unter Zuhilfenahme von Holzlatten offenbar eine Art Käfig konstruiert worden war., Bürgermeister Kolers prächtiges Wohnhaus., Anfang des 17. Jahrhunderts war das Salzhaus im Besitz von \\"Christoph Andreas Koler\\", der aus Bingen stammte und durch Weinhandel ein beträchtliches Vermögen erworben hatte. Wahrscheinlich kurz nach 1595 ließ er sein Wohnhaus im Stil der Spätrenaissance komplett umgestalten, wahrscheinlich sogar komplett neu errichten. Bestätigt wird dies durch enge stilistische Verwandtschaft mit dem nahen, auf 1595 datierten Haus \\"Silberberg\\", Bilder aus zeitgenössischen Krönungstagebüchern und spätestens den Plan der Stadt von Matthäus Merian aus dem Jahr 1628, die das Salzhaus als alleiniges Gebäude zeigen., Das Salzhaus galt fortan als eines der schönsten Gebäude Mitteleuropas: zum einen erhielt die zum Römerberg gewandte Ostfassade des Gebäudes vermutlich durch den Memminger Bildhauer \\"Johann Michael Hocheisen\\" einen in der deutschen Renaissance sehr selten gebliebenen, ganzheitlichen Schnitzschmuck. Die zur damals engen \\"Wedelgasse\\" gelegene Nordfassade wurde dagegen verputzt und mit Fresken geschmückt, die Motive aus der griechischen Mythologie und der Bibel aufgriffen., Die Fassade zum Römerberg war zudem in den Frankfurter Farben rot, weiß und gold gefasst, wie ein handkolorierter Kupferstich aus dem Krönungsdiarium Joseph I. von 1705 zeigt, und auch durch den Fund von Farbresten bei der Renovierung des Gebäudes Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts belegt wurde. Einer Legende nach färbte sich das Holz schwarz, als Kolers Frau starb und die Fassade dem Brauch nach für den Trauerzug mit schwarzen Tüchern abgehängt worden war. Dem widerspricht allerdings, dass seine Frau bereits 1613 gestorben war. Der reale Hintergrund für ein etwaiges bewusstes Ablaugen der Farben dürfte wohl am ehesten in klassizistischen Bestrebungen der zweiten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts zu suchen sein, als man vielfach versuchte, Fachwerkbauten das Äußere von Steinbauten zu geben., Während des Fettmilch-Aufstandes schloss Koler sich den rebellierenden Zünften an und wurde 1612 jüngerer Bürgermeister. Als sich im Verlaufe des Jahres 1614 das Ende des Aufstands abzeichnete, bei dessen Unterstützung er fast sein gesamtes Vermögen verloren hatte, floh er aus der Stadt und entging so auch seiner Bestrafung. 1616 machte er schließlich Bankrott und ging zurück in seine Heimatstadt, wo er zum katholischen Glauben übertrat und bis zu seinem Tod als Verwalter eines Klosters tätig war., Nach der Ära Koler bis zum 19. Jahrhundert., Wenig ist über die Geschichte des Salzhauses in den folgenden zwei Jahrhunderten bekannt. Aufgrund seiner repräsentativen Gestaltung, den geräumigen Kellern, der Verfügbarkeit eines Ladens im Erdgeschoss und nicht zuletzt der optimalen Lage am Römerberg wegen dürfte es fast ausschließlich im Besitz reicher Frankfurter Kaufmannsfamilien gewesen sein., Historisch belegbar ist, dass 1637 im Salzhaus der reiche Seiden- und Tuchhändler \\"Melchior Sultzer\\" starb, und 1718 \\"Friedrich Freyer\\" im Haus eine Strumpfhandlung begründete, die das damals umfangreichste Geschäft ihrer Art in Frankfurt war. Aufgrund seines geschäftlichen Erfolgs besaß er bald große Werkstätten in Offenbach und Hanau und hinterließ seiner Witwe bei seinem Tod 1752 ein gewaltiges Vermögen in Höhe von 212.000 Reichstalern., Stadtbesitz und Renovierung., Am 1. Mai 1843 erwarb die Stadt das Haus zum Preis von 32.000 Gulden von seiner letzten Besitzerin, der Bürgerswitwe \\"Sara Catharina Lindheimer\\". Die alteingesessene Familie Lindheimer war u.a. mit der Familie Goethes verwandtschaftlich verbunden. Zusammen mit dem angrenzenden, im selben Jahr erworbenen Haus Frauenstein integrierte man das Salzhaus in den Gebäudekomplex um den Römer. Der 1866 erfolgte Abriss des Hauses \\"zum Wedel\\", das es seit Jahrhunderten nördlich flankierte, rückte es zudem in einen neuen städtebaulichen Zusammenhang, als nun die einst ebenfalls prächtig verzierte Nordseite sichtbar wurde., In den Jahren 1887 bis 1888 wurde die mittlerweile dringend nötig gewordene Renovierung unter der Leitung von Stadtbauinspektor Adolf Koch angegangen. Die modulartige Konstruktion der Eichenholztafeln des ersten Geschosses machte es bei diesen einfach, sie abzunehmen und in die Werkstätten von Schreinern und Bildhauern zu bringen, wo sie aufwändig restauriert wurden. Es zeigte sich, dass bei der vorangegangenen, der Giebelinschrift nach 1707 erfolgten Renovierung des Gebäudes, angegriffene Stellen durch Tannenholz ersetzt worden waren., Dieses aus späterer Sicht als fehlerhaft erkannte Vorgehen hatte das Problem der im Holz fortschreitenden Fäulnis weiter verschärft und die Fachwerkkonstruktion, statisch betrachtet, an den falschen Stellen belastet. Den Folgen, angebrochenen Balken an der gesamten Konstruktion, war durch aufgenietete Metallbänder oder zusätzliche, untergelegte Balken entgegengesteuert worden. Tragende Elemente mussten daher an vielen Stellen vollständig ersetzt werden. An den Stellen am Haus, wo Substanzverlust aufgetreten war, wurde dieser mit einem Kitt aus Eichenspänen und verschiedenen Beimischungen aufgefüllt und die entsprechenden Partien nachgeschnitzt., Die Fresken an der Nordfront des Gebäudes waren zum Zeitpunkt der Umbauarbeiten so stark verwittert, dass man sich entschied, sie nicht zu restaurieren, sondern vollständig zu ersetzen.

Sie sind Hemmstoffe (Inhibitoren) des Angiotensin-konvertierenden Enzyms (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme), das im Wesentlichen die Umwandlung von inaktivem Angiotensin-I in aktives Angiotensin-II bewirkt und ein Teil einer den Blutdruck steuernden Kaskade ist (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosteron-System). ACE-hemmende Inhaltsstoffe wurden zuerst in Schlangengiften gefunden. Die wichtigsten in der Therapie verwendeten Wirkstoffe dieser Kategorie sind Captopril, Enalapril, Lisinopril, Perindopril und Ramipril., Chemie., ACE-Hemmer, wie Captopril, Enalapril und ihre Nachfolgersubstanzen, sind strukturverwandt mit dem aus dem Schlangengift der brasilianischen Jararaca-Lanzenotter (\\"Bothrops jararaca\\") isolierten Pentapeptid BPP5a (von „Bradykinin potenzierendes Peptid“; Sequenz DKWAP, siehe Abbildung). Die in BPP5a vorkommende Tripeptidsequenz Tryptophan-Alanin-Prolin wurde als wirksame Komponente erkannt (in Abbildung rot dargestellt)., Da BPP5a und das Tripeptid im Körper sehr schnell abgebaut werden, wurden zahlreiche Modifikationen am Molekül vorgenommen, um die Wirkdauer zu verlängern. Dazu wurde die WAP-Sequenz gegen eine ähnliche aber stabilere FAP-Sequenz ausgetauscht. Die Einbringung einer bernsteinsäure- oder glutarsäureanalogen Struktur (in Abbildung grün dargestellt) brachte weitere Stabilität und eine Verstärkung der Hemmwirkung am Angiotensin Converting Enzyme., Darüber hinaus sind bis auf Captopril und Lisinopril alle therapeutisch genutzten ACE-Hemmer Prodrugs, die erst im Körper aktiviert werden. Im Falle von Enalapril und Ramipril geschieht dies durch Abspaltung der Ethylgruppe durch Esterasen, wodurch die Wirkform, das Enalaprilat bzw. Ramiprilat, mit einer freien Carboxygruppe entsteht, die das Zink des ACE komplexieren kann., Pharmakologie., Anwendungsgebiete., ACE-Hemmer werden überwiegend zur Therapie des Bluthochdrucks eingesetzt. Hierfür gelten sie einzeln (Monotherapie) und in Kombination mit anderen Blutdrucksenkern (Kombinationstherapie, insbesondere mit Diuretika oder Calciumantagonisten) als Mittel der ersten Wahl. Bei Bluthochdruckformen, die mit einem erniedrigten Renin-Spiegel im Blutplasma einhergehen (z.B. Conn-Syndrom) zeigen ACE-Hemmer hingegen nur unzureichende Wirksamkeit., Daneben haben sich einige ACE-Hemmer in zahlreichen großen klinischen Studien auch bei der chronischen Herzinsuffizienz als lebensverlängernd erwiesen. Dies beruht wahrscheinlich auf der Senkung der Nachlast und Verminderung der Wandspannung des Herzmuskels durch die Abnahme von Angiotensin II., Auch nach Herzinfarkten und bei einer Herzmuskelentzündung werden ACE-Hemmer eingesetzt., Eine weitere Indikation der ACE-Hemmer ist die diabetische Nephropathie., Die kanadische ONTARGET-Studie weist aber darauf hin, dass ACE-Hemmer auf keinen Fall in Kombination mit Angiotensin-II-Rezeptorblockern eingenommen werden dürfen. Während beide Medikamente für sich genommen nephroprotektiv wirken, kam es bei der Kombinationstherapie zu einer signifikant verschlechterten Nierenfunktion. Ferner zeichnete sich ein Trend in Richtung eines Anstiegs der Dialysepflicht ab. Untersucht wurden u.a. Ramipril und Telmisartan., Wirkmechanismus., Der Wirkungsmechanismus der ACE-Hemmer beruht auf einer Hemmung des Angiotensin-I-umsetzenden Enzyms ACE. Dieses Enzym hat im Organismus zwei Hauptaufgaben: Einerseits ist es für die Synthese des gefäßverengend wirksamen Octapeptids (Peptid aus acht Aminosäuren) Angiotensin II aus seiner inaktiven Vorstufe, dem Decapeptid (zehn Aminosäuren) Angiotensin I unter Abspaltung der zwei C-terminalen Aminosäuren zuständig. Andererseits katalysiert es den Abbau des Mediators Bradykinin in inaktive Produkte., Die Hemmung des Angiotensin Converting Enzyme hat eine Abnahme der Angiotensin-II-Konzentration an den Angiotensinrezeptoren (AT1 und AT2) zur Folge. Primär sinkt dadurch der Blutgefäßtonus, und der Blutdruck nimmt ab. Es kommt also hämodynamisch zu einer Senkung der Vorlast und der Nachlast. Sekundär führt die Abnahme des Angiotensin-II-Spiegels zu einer Verringerung der Aldosteron-Freisetzung aus der Nebennierenrinde und somit zu einer Beeinflussung des Wasserhaushalts (siehe auch Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosteron-System, RAAS). Auf zellulärer Ebene kann ein Rückgang der durch Angiotensin II vermittelten mitogenen Effekte an Fibroblasten und Myozyten des Herzens, die insbesondere nach einem Herzinfarkt zu ungünstigen Veränderungen (Remodeling) führen, beobachtet werden., In welchem Ausmaß die Blutdrucksenkung erfolgt, hängt davon ab, wie hoch die Aktivität des RAA-Systems ist. Bei der Herzinsuffizienz ist die Aktivität des RAAS sehr hoch, sodass man auf jeden Fall nur einschleichend dosieren sollte, um eine zu starke Blutdrucksenkung zu vermeiden., Bei Nierenerkrankungen wie der diabetischen Nephropathie führen ACE-Hemmer zu einer verminderten Proteinausscheidung und verhindern ein Fortschreiten der Erkrankung (Nephroprotektion)., Die Hemmung des Abbaus von Bradykinin führt hingegen zu dessen Kumulation und damit verbundenen Nebenwirkungen., Molekularer Wirkmechanismus., Auch der molekulare Wirkmechanismus der ACE-Hemmer konnte aufgeklärt werden. Er beruht auf der Ähnlichkeit der ACE-Hemmer zu einem Peptidkettenende des Angiotensin I. Dadurch werden ACE-Hemmer vom Angiotensin Converting Enzyme fälschlich für das physiologische Substrat Angiotensin I gehalten. Im Gegensatz zum physiologischen Substrat werden sie aber nicht vom Enzym umgesetzt, sondern blockieren es., Wichtig für die Bindung des Liganden sind drei Wechselwirkungen:, Pharmakokinetik., Entsprechend ihrer chemischen Differenzen unterscheiden sich die ACE-Hemmer in ihrer Pharmakokinetik. Die Mehrzahl der derzeit verfügbaren ACE-Hemmer sind Prodrugs. Das heißt, dass sie nach einer 20%igen (Ramipril) bis fast 100%igen Aufnahme (Resorption) durch Enzyme im Körper aktiviert werden müssen (siehe Chemie). Lediglich Captopril und Lisinopril benötigen diesen Aktivierungsschritt nicht. Maximale Plasmaspiegel der Wirkformen werden nach 1 bis 8 Stunden erreicht. Die Plasmahalbwertszeiten schwanken zwischen 2 (Captopril) und 40 Stunden (Spirapril). Entsprechend variiert auch die Wirkdauer (8 bis 48 Stunden). Alle ACE-Hemmer werden überwiegend über die Niere ausgeschieden. Fosinopril, Moexipril und Spirapril zeigen darüber hinaus eine relevante biliäre Exkretion (Ausscheidung über die Galle)., Nebenwirkungen., Die wichtigsten Nebenwirkungen sind trockener Husten, Hypotonie, akutes Nierenversagen, Hyperkaliämie und Probleme während der Schwangerschaft (unten einzeln erklärt). Diese Nebenwirkungen sind allen ACE-Hemmern gemeinsam. Bei einer 2018 veröffentlichten Kohortenstudie mit fast einer Million Patienten war die Verwendung von ACE-Hemmern, nach fünf Jahren der Anwendung, mit einem insgesamt um 14 % erhöhten Risiko für Lungenkrebs verbunden. Bei Patienten, die ACE-Hemmer mehr als zehn Jahre lang verwendeten, lag ein um 31 % erhöhtes Risiko vor.&lt;ref name=\\"DOI10.1136/bmj.k4209\\"&gt;Blánaid M Hicks, Kristian B Filion, Hui Yin, Lama Sakr, Jacob A Udell, Laurent Azoulay: \\"Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and risk of lung cancer: population based cohort study.\\" In: \\"BMJ.\\" S.k4209,.&lt;/ref&gt;, Die meisten Nebenwirkungen von ACE-Hemmern werden mit einem verlangsamten Abbau und einer Anreicherung von Bradykinin durch ACE-Hemmer in Verbindung gebracht. Dazu zählen Hautreaktionen wie z.B. Exantheme (0,1–1 %) und Nesselsucht (0,01–0,1 %). Schwere allergische Hautreaktionen werden hingegen nur sehr selten beobachtet (&lt; 0,01 %). Die als charakteristisch für ACE-Hemmer geltende Nebenwirkung, das Auftreten von Angioödemen, kann ebenfalls nur selten beobachtet werden (0,01–0,1 %)., Auch die Mehrzahl der die Atemwege betreffenden Nebenwirkungen kann mit einer Kumulation von Bradykinin in Verbindung gebracht werden. Dazu zählt in erster Linie ein \\"trockener Husten\\", der in den ersten drei Monaten bei 5–35 % der Patienten auftritt. Diese Nebenwirkung ist nicht dosisabhängig. Bei trockenem Husten sollte der ACE-Hemmer abgesetzt bzw. gegen ein anderes Medikament entsprechend der Indikation ausgetauscht werden., Auch Heiserkeit und Halsschmerz (0,1–1 %) treten auf. Asthmaanfälle und Atemnot können ebenfalls, wenn auch selten, auftreten (0,01–0,1 %)., Unter der Therapie mit ACE-Hemmern kann es bradykininunabhängig zu einer \\"Hypotonie\\", d.h. zu einer zu starken Blutdrucksenkung kommen. Infolgedessen können gelegentlich Schwindel, Kopfschmerz und Benommenheit beobachtet werden (0,1–1 %). Von schweren Herz-Kreislauf-Ereignissen, wie Angina Pectoris, Herzinfarkt und Synkope, wurde nur in Einzelfällen berichtet. Dieser Nebenwirkung (die bevorzugt bei Patienten mit Herzinsuffizienz auftritt) kann man mit Vorsichtsmaßnahmen vorbeugen: bei Flüssigkeitsmangel zuerst Flüssigkeitsgabe und Absetzen von Diuretika (falls der Patient diese einnimmt), dann mit der Einnahme von ACE-Hemmern beginnen; bei Patienten mit Herzinsuffizienz mit einer geringeren Dosierung als anvisiert anfangen, dann die Dosis steigern., Durch Eingriff in den Wasser- und Elektrolythaushalt können gelegentlich funktionelle Nierenfunktionsstörungen beobachtet werden (0,1–1 %). Eine Proteinurie (vermehrte Ausscheidung von Proteinen im Harn) bis hin zu \\"akutem Nierenversagen\\" wurde hingegen nur selten beobachtet (0,01–0,1 %). Zum akuten Nierenversagen kommt es fast nur bei Risikopatienten, d.h. bei Menschen oder Tieren mit bilateraler Nierenarterienstenose, mit einer hypertonischen Nephrosklerose, mit einer Herzinsuffizienz, mit einer polyzystischen Nierenerkrankung oder mit einem vorher existierenden chronischen Nierenversagen.

Jahrhundert, Gestorben 1011, Mann], Liudger, auch Liutger, Ludiger, Liudiger oder Luderus, niederdeutsch Lüder († 26. Februar 1011), war der jüngere Bruder des sächsischen Herzogs Bernhard I. aus dem Geschlecht der Billunger. In den Quellen wird Liudger als Graf (\\"comes\\") bezeichnet. Dort erscheint er fast nur an der Seite seines älteren Bruders., Die Stellung Liudgers innerhalb des billungischen Fürstenhauses ist in der Mittelalterforschung noch nicht abschließend geklärt. Während ein Teil der Historiker ihn als begüterten Miterben neben seinem älteren Bruder ansieht, der auch über eigene Herrschaftsrechte verfügte, soll Liudger nach Auffassung von Gerd Althoff nur ein Schattendasein als „Ersatzmann“ für Herzog Bernhard I. geführt haben., Herkunft und Familie., Liudger war der Sohn Hermann Billungs. Sein älterer Bruder Bernhard folgte dem Vater mit dessen Tod als Herzog in Sachsen nach. Liudger hatte zwei Schwestern, Mathilde und Schwanhild., Liudger war mit Emma verheiratet. Nachkommen Liudgers sind nicht überliefert. Der Bremer Domscholaster Adam von Bremen berichtet in der \\"Hamburger Kirchengeschichte\\" aus der Zeit um 1070 von einer namentlich nicht benannten Tochter von Liudgers Frau Emma. Den Vater erwähnt Adam nicht. Dennoch geht ein Teil der Forschung seit jeher davon aus, es handele sich nicht nur um Emmas, sondern auch um Liudgers Tochter. Auch männliche Nachfahren des Paares werden erörtert. In der Lebensgeschichte des Paderborner Bischofs Meinwerk, der \\"Vita Meinwerci\\", wird der spätere Paderborner Bischof Imad als Sohn von Meinwerks Schwester bezeichnet. In der \\"Hamburger Kirchengeschichte\\" heißt es, Emma sei die Schwester eben dieses Meinwerk gewesen. Dennoch wird eine Abstammung Imads von Emma angezweifelt, weil die Notiz zur Verwandtschaft Emmas mit Meinwerk erst in einer Abschrift aus der Zeit nach dem Jahr 1160 eingefügt wurde. Umgekehrt kennt die \\"Vita Meinwerci\\" zwar Emma als Frau Liudgers, aber nicht als Schwester Meinwerks. Als Schwestern Meinwerks benennt sie stattdessen Glismod und Adela., Machtbefugnisse., Die Frage nach Liudgers Machtbefugnissen innerhalb des Adelsgeschlechtes der Billunger wird in der Forschung uneinheitlich beantwortet. Das betrifft sowohl eine etwaige Teilhabe an der Herrschaft seines älteren Bruders Bernhard I. als auch mögliche eigene Herrschaftsrechte als Graf., Teilhabe an der Herrschaft Bernhards I.., Über Liudgers politische Bedeutung für die Herrschaft seines älteren Bruders ist den mittelalterlichen Quellen nichts Sicheres zu entnehmen. Dort wird ausschließlich Bernhard I. als Herzog bezeichnet. Dieser zeichnete sich als Oberhaupt des mächtigsten und reichsten Adelsgeschlechtes im nördlichen Sachsen durch eine besondere Nähe zum Königshof aus. Nach der Überlieferung gehörte er zu den engsten Beratern der Könige und Kaiser Otto II. (973–983), Otto III. (983–1002) sowie Heinrich II. (1002–1024). Entsprechend häufig findet er in mittelalterlichen Urkunden, Annalen und Chroniken Erwähnung. Demgegenüber wird Liudger nur am Rande erwähnt., Trotz dieses Befundes geht ein Teil der Mittelalterforschung davon aus, dass Liudger für die Herrschaft der Billunger in Sachsen eine bedeutende Rolle spielte, ohne diese näher zu bestimmen. Diese Einschätzung gründet sich vorrangig auf Nachrichten aus der Chronik des Klosters St. Michael in Lüneburg, des Hausklosters der Billunger. Darin heißt es, beide Brüder seien ihrem Vater Hermann in die Herzogswürde nachgefolgt und hätten ihn gemeinsam beerbt. Die Chronik stammt aus der Zeit zwischen 1229 und 1233 und ist damit erst rund 200 Jahre nach Liudgers Tod entstanden. Dennoch gilt sie als glaubhaft, da dem Verfasser der Chronik ältere, heute verloren gegangene Urkunden vorgelegen haben sollen. Zudem erscheint der mediävistischen Forschung eine Teilhabe Liudgers an der Herrschaft seines älteren Bruders Bernhard I. auch in Ansehung der Herrschaftspraxis des billungischen Herzogshauses in den Folgegenerationen als naheliegend. Auch Bernhards I. Sohn Thietmar hatte neben seinem älteren Bruder Herzog Bernhard II. Anteil an der Herrschaft. Und Bernhards II. Sohn Herrmann vertrat seinen älteren Bruder Herzog Ordulf sogar über mehrere Jahre an der Spitze des Fürstenhauses. Schließlich fällt auf, dass Liudger fast immer an der Seite seines Bruders Bernhard I. hervortritt. In einer Aufzeichnung über das Ergebnis der Grenzverhandlungen zwischen den Bistümern Hildesheim, Minden und Verden aus der Zeit zwischen dem 15. Januar und 13. Mai 993 führen „Herzog Bernhard und sein Bruder Liudger“ die Liste der weltlichen Zeugen an (\\"Bernhardi ducis suique fratris Liudgeri\\")., Gerd Althoff zeigt in seiner 1990 veröffentlichten Untersuchung zu Gruppenbindungen im Mittelalter die Grenzen von Liudgers Stellung innerhalb des Adelsgeschlechtes der Billunger auf. Danach beschränkte sich die Rolle Liudgers auf die des „Ersatzmannes“ für den älteren Bruder. Nur die Anerkennung von Bernhards Erstgeburtsrecht und die Unterordnung unter dessen Herrschaftsanspruch hätten Liudger überhaupt erst den Verbleib am Hof ermöglicht, um im Interesse des Familienverbandes beim Ausfall des Regenten einzuspringen. Auf keinen Fall habe sich Liudgers Teilhabe an der Herrschaft der Billunger als Mitherrschaft dargestellt, und am Erbgut des Vaters sei er höchstens in kleinerem Umfang beteiligt gewesen. Demgegenüber hatte Althoff in seiner Habilitationsschrift aus dem Jahre 1984 noch die Auffassung vertreten, Liudger habe als jüngerer Bruder unmittelbar an der Herrschaft des Herzogsgeschlechtes partizipiert. Ernst Schubert hat in der Auseinandersetzung mit Althoffs Beurteilung einen vermittelnden Standpunkt eingenommen. Zwar habe sich Liudger dem älteren Bruder untergeordnet, gleichwohl sei ein einvernehmliches brüderliches Zusammenwirken festzustellen, das den Frieden innerhalb des Adelsgeschlechtes der Billunger sicherte., Eigene Herrschaftsrechte Liudgers., Anhand der wenigen Nachrichten über Liudger wird mit unterschiedlichen Ergebnissen erörtert, ob Liudger als Graf über eigene Herrschaftsrechte oder zumindest über den dafür notwendigen Grundbesitz verfügte. Im Mittelpunkt der Überlegungen stehen zwei Urkunden Ottos III. sowie eine Passage aus der \\"Hamburger Kirchengeschichte\\" Adams von Bremen., Die Schenkungsurkunde für Minden., In der älteren Urkunde Ottos III. erteilt Liudger seine Einwilligung zu einer Landschenkung des Königs an den Mindener Bischof Milo und die Mindener Kirche. Die Schenkung erfolgte am 9. September 991 und wurde von Otto III. auf der Brandenburg vorgenommen. Der elfjährige König hatte die im Zuge des Slawenaufstandes von 983 verlorene Festung an der Spitze eines sächsisch-polnischen Heeres von den Lutizen zurückerobert. Nach der Einnahme der Burg stellte er dort in einem demonstrativen Herrschaftsakt eine Urkunde aus. Darin schenkte er dem Mindener Bischof Milo die Forste Huculinhagen und Stioringowald und fügte den Wald „Suntel“ westlich der Weser bis zur Grenze des Bistums hinzu, das heutige Wiehengebirge. Zu der Übertragung des Waldgebietes erteilten sowohl Herzog Bernhard I. als auch Liudger ihre Zustimmung. Daraus wird zunächst abgeleitet, dass beide vor Ort waren und das sächsische Heeresaufgebot gemeinsam anführten. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass sie der Übertragung zustimmen mussten, weil sie Rechte an dem Suntelwald hatten, die sie jetzt zu Gunsten des Mindener Bischofs aufgaben. Der Nestor der Billungerforschung, der Lüneburger Archivar Anton Christian Wedekind, deutete 1835 die gemeinsame Zustimmung mit einem Miteigentum beider Brüder an dem Wald. Wedekind ging generell davon aus, dass die Angaben der Lüneburger Chronik über eine gemeinsame Nachfolge der Brüder in das Erbe des Vaters zutreffend sind. Im Gegensatz dazu stufte Ruth Bork 1951 in ihrer Dissertation die Zustimmung Liudgers als ein Indiz für dessen Alleineigentum an dem Suntelwald ein., Die Schenkungsurkunde für Liudger., In der jüngeren Urkunde Ottos III. ist Liudger selbst der Empfänger einer kaiserlichen Schenkung. Auf Intervention seines Bruders Bernhard I. und des Paderborner Bischofs Meinwerk erhielt er am 27. April 1001 in einer im italienischen Ravenna ausgestellten Urkunde den Fronhof Stipenlo mit allem lebenden und toten Inventar. Die Lage des Fronhofes wird in der Urkunde mit „in der Grafschaft dieses Grafen Liudger und im Westfalengau“ (\\"in comitatu ipsius Liutgeri comitis et in pago Westfalon\\") beschrieben. An der Existenz einer Grafschaft Liudgers ausgerechnet an der Ruhr sind jedoch mehrfach Zweifel geäußert worden. Der Fronhof lag weit entfernt von den übrigen Besitzungen der Billunger, die sich zwischen Weser und Elbe konzentrierten. Zwar war Fern- oder Streubesitz im Mittelalter nicht ungewöhnlich, zumal sich auf diese Weise Missernten durch Erträge an anderen Orten ausgleichen ließen. Weiterer Fernbesitz der Billunger an der Ruhr ist jedoch nicht überliefert. Paul Derks hält es für möglich, dass es sich bei der Angabe der Grafenrechte um eine spätere Ergänzung handelt, die damit keinen historischen Quellenwert besäße. Die Urkunde wurde nur in Abschrift in einem Bremer Kopialbuch aus dem 14. Jahrhundert überliefert. Da das Kopialbuch nach einem Fliegerangriff der Royal Air Force auf Hannover in der Nacht des 9. Oktober 1943 im Hauptstaatsarchiv verbrannte, ist eine weitere Aufklärung nicht mehr möglich., Das Gut Lesum., Umfangreicher Grundbesitz Liudgers an der Weser wird aus einer beiläufigen Notiz bei Adam von Bremen abgeleitet. Dieser berichtet im Zusammenhang mit der Nachricht über den Tod von Liudgers Ehefrau Emma, das Gut Lismona sei wegen eines unbekannten Vergehens von Emmas Tochter durch Kaiser Konrad II. eingezogen worden. Der Umfang dieses Gutes war außergewöhnlich groß. Es bestand unter anderem aus 700 Bauernhöfen, einem großen Waldgebiet, Küstenstreifen und Streubesitz um Bremen. Zu einer Herkunft der Güter aus Emmas oder Liudgers Besitz äußert sich Adam von Bremen nicht. Die Einstufung Lesums als Erbgut der Billunger geht auf eine nachträgliche Vereinnahmung eines Grafen Hermann (\\"comes Herimannus\\") als Vorfahr der Billunger zurück, wie sie etwa von Richard Drögereit vorgenommen wurde. Hermann wird in einer zwischen 860 und 865 von Ansgar verfassten Handschrift über die Wunder des Bremer Bischofs Willehad als Graf in Lesum erwähnt., Tod und Gedenken., Liudger starb im Jahr 1011, wie wenige Tage v: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Familienmitglied, Billunger, 10.

Jahrhundert), Aufstand im Heiligen Römischen Reich, Frankfurt am Main im 17. Jahrhundert, Judentum in Frankfurt am Main, Pogrom], Der Fettmilch-Aufstand (auch \\"Fedtmilch-Aufstand\\") des Jahres 1614 war eine von dem Lebkuchenbäcker Vinzenz Fettmilch angeführte judenfeindliche Revolte in der Reichsstadt Frankfurt am Main. Der Aufstand der Zünfte richtete sich ursprünglich gegen die Misswirtschaft des von Patriziern dominierten Rats der Stadt, artete aber in die Plünderung der Judengasse und die Vertreibung aller Frankfurter Juden aus. Er wurde schließlich mit Hilfe des Kaisers, der Landgrafschaft Hessen-Kassel und des Kurfürstentums Mainz niedergeschlagen., Die Vorgeschichte., Der Aufstand hatte seine Ursache in der Verfestigung des patrizischen Regiments in Frankfurt am Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts sowie im Unmut der Bürger über die Misswirtschaft des Rats und die geringen Einwirkungsmöglichkeiten der Zünfte auf die Politik der Freien Reichsstadt., Die politischen Forderungen der Zünfte waren von Beginn an mit judenfeindlichen Ressentiments verbunden., Ausbruch der Unruhen., Die Unruhen nahmen ihren Anfang am 9. Juni 1612, als Bürger und Zunftmeister vor der Wahl des neuen Kaisers Matthias vom Rat die früher bei solchen Gelegenheiten übliche öffentliche Verlesung der Privilegien der Stadt verlangten. Zuletzt war dies 36 Jahre zuvor, anlässlich der Wahl Rudolfs II. geschehen. Der Rat lehnte das Verlangen der Bürger ab, so dass Gerüchte aufkamen, er wolle ihnen das Wissen um kaiserlich verbriefte Abgabenbefreiungen vorenthalten., Darüber hinaus forderten die Bürger ein verstärktes Mitspracherecht der Zünfte im Stadtregiment. Der 42-köpfige Rat wurde von den 24 Mitgliedern aus den Patrizierfamilien dominiert, die der Gesellschaft Alten Limpurg angehörten. Dies war derjenige Teil des Frankfurter Patriziats, der sich am Lebensstil des Adels orientierte und nicht mehr von Fernhandel und Geldgeschäften, sondern von Einkünften aus Grundbesitz lebte. Ihm stand die Gesellschaft Zum Frauenstein gegenüber, in der sich die Großkaufleute der Stadt zusammengeschlossen hatten. Sie teilten sich die übrigen 18 Ratssitze mit den Vertretern der Handwerkszünfte. Diese Sitzverteilung war festgelegt. Zudem wurde der Rat nicht von allen Bürgern bestimmt, sondern wählte bei Ausscheiden oder Tod eines Mitglieds selbst dessen Nachfolger., Außer einer stärkeren Repräsentation verlangten die Zunftmeister 1612 die Einrichtung eines öffentlichen Kornmarkts in Frankfurt, um niedrigere Getreidepreise durchsetzen zu können, sowie eine Senkung der von den Frankfurter Juden angeblich geforderten Wucherzinsen von 12 auf 6 Prozent. (Tatsächlich nahmen jüdische und christliche Bankiers in Frankfurt etwa die gleichen Zinssätze.) Die Zahl der Bewohner der Judengasse sollte begrenzt werden. Dazu kamen Forderungen der Reformierten, die die bürgerliche Gleichstellung im lutherischen Frankfurt verlangten und sich später in großer Zahl dem Aufstand anschließen sollten. Zu diesen konkreten, aber sehr unterschiedlichen Forderungen kam ein allgemeiner, seit Jahrzehnten aufgestauter Unmut über das als selbstherrlich empfundene Regiment des Rats, der die Bürger in einigen öffentlichen Verlautbarungen als „Untertanen“ bezeichnet hatte., Für die judenfeindliche Wendung, die der Aufstand schließlich nahm, waren unter anderem Kaufleute, Handwerksmeister und andere Schuldner von Geldverleihern aus der Judengasse verantwortlich. Sie hofften, zusammen mit ihren Gläubigern auch ihre Verpflichtungen ihnen gegenüber loszuwerden., Brüchiger Kompromiss: Der Bürgervertrag., Im Streit um die Verlesung der Privilegien wurde der Krämer und Lebkuchenbäcker Vinzenz Fettmilch, der seit 1593 Bürger der Stadt war, zum Wortführer der Zunftmeister. Sie wandten sich zunächst an die Kurfürsten oder deren Stellvertreter, die sich zur Kaiserwahl in Frankfurt aufhielten, und schließlich an den neuen Kaiser selbst, als Matthias zu seiner Krönung nach Frankfurt kam. Sowohl die Kurfürsten als auch der Kaiser lehnten eine Einmischung in die inneren Angelegenheiten Frankfurts zunächst ab. Als die Zünfte daraufhin aber einen Ausschuss bildeten, der mit dem Rat verhandeln sollte, setzte Matthias eine Schlichtungskommission ein., In dieser Kommission wiederum, die von den benachbarten Landesfürsten, dem Kurfürsten von Mainz und dem Landgrafen von Hessen, gestellt wurde, sahen die Patrizier eine Gefährdung des Status der Freien Reichsstadt. Darüber hinaus befürchteten sie negative Auswirkungen der innerstädtischen Unruhen auf die Frankfurter Messe. Nürnberg und andere Handelsstädte hatten beim Frankfurter Magistrat bereits anfragen lassen, ob er die Sicherheit der fremden Kaufleute gewährleisten könne. Daher willigte der Rat am 21. Dezember 1612 in einen Bürgervertrag ein. Diese neue städtische Verfassung, die im Wesentlichen bis 1806 in Kraft blieb, sah eine Erweiterung des Rats um 18 Mitglieder vor, sowie einen Neuner-Ausschuss der Zünfte, der das Recht besaß, die Rechnungsbücher der Stadt zu prüfen. Der so erweiterte Rat wählte 1614 den Aufständischen Nicolaus Weitz zum Stadtschultheiß., Erneute Verschärfung der Lage., Bei dieser Prüfung stellte sich 1613 heraus, dass Frankfurt hoch verschuldet war und der Rat unter anderem Mittel verschwendet hatte, die der Armen- und Krankenfürsorge hätten dienen sollen. Strafgelder hatten die Steuereinnehmer zum eigenen Nutzen veruntreut. Zudem wurde bekannt, dass der Patrizier Johann Friedrich Faust von Aschaffenburg die Bestätigung des Bürgervertrags durch den Kaiser zu hintertreiben versuchte., Ein weiterer Konflikt betraf die so genannte „Judenstättigkeit“, die Verordnung, die das Leben der Juden in Frankfurt regelte. Das Schutzgeld, das die Juden nach dieser Verordnung zu zahlen hatten, war nicht an die Stadtkasse gegangen, sondern unter den Ratsmitgliedern aufgeteilt worden. Um zu verhindern, dass die Unrechtmäßigkeit dieses Vorgehens publik würde, ließ der Rat Neudrucke der „Judenstättigkeit“ konfiszieren. Gleichzeitig kamen Gerüchte auf, die Juden machten mit den Patriziern gemeinsame Sache. Vinzenz Fettmilch veröffentlichte schließlich die Urkunde, mit der Kaiser Karl IV. 1349 seine Herrschaftsrechte über die jüdischen Einwohner Frankfurts an die Stadt abgetreten hatte. Darin fand sich der verhängnisvolle Satz, dass der Kaiser die Stadt nicht dafür zur Verantwortung ziehen werde, falls die Juden „von Todes wegen abgingen oder verdürben oder erschlagen würden“. Dies verstanden viele als Freibrief für ein Pogrom., Der Aufstand., Als die enorme Verschuldung Frankfurts – 9½ Tonnen Goldgulden – öffentlich wurde, stürmte eine Menge am 6. Mai 1613 den Römer, das Frankfurter Rathaus, und erzwang die Herausgabe der Schlüssel zur Stadtkasse an den Neuner-Ausschuss der Zünfte. In den folgenden Monaten konnte der Rat nur so viel Geld ausgeben, wie der Ausschuss ihm bewilligte. Aufgrund der beiderseitigen Verletzungen des gerade erst beschlossenen Bürgervertrags setzte sich der Kaiser erneut für einen Kompromiss ein. Am 15. Januar 1614 unterzeichneten beide Parteien einen neuen Vertrag., Absetzung des Rates und Androhung der Reichsacht., Da der Rat aber weiterhin keine Belege für den Verbleib der 9½ Tonnen Goldgulden beibringen konnte, setzte sich unter den Zünften der radikale Flügel unter Vinzenz Fettmilch durch. Am 5. Mai 1614 ließ er die Stadttore von seinen Anhängern besetzen, den alten Rat für abgesetzt erklären und seine Mitglieder im Römer verhaften. Der Ältere Bürgermeister Johann Hartmann Beyer, einer der 18 aufgrund des Bürgervertrages neu berufenen Ratsherren, verhandelte mit den Aufrührern und unterzeichnete am 19. Mai 1614 gemeinsam mit Fettmilch die Rücktrittsurkunde des Rates. Aber schon zwei Monate später, am 26. Juli, erschien ein kaiserlicher Herold in der Stadt, der die Wiedereinsetzung des Rats forderte. Als dem nicht Folge geleistet wurde, ließ der Kaiser am 22. August jedem Frankfurter die Reichsacht androhen, der nicht bereit war, sich durch Eid seinem Befehl zu unterwerfen., Die Plünderung der Judengasse., Die Aufständischen, die sich lange der Unterstützung des Kaisers sicher gewähnt hatten, richteten ihre Wut nun gegen das schwächste Glied in der Kette ihrer vermeintlichen Gegner. Am 22. August zog eine Menge von Handwerksgesellen mit dem Ruf „Gebt uns Arbeit und Brot“ durch die Stadt. Gegen Mittag stürmten die mittlerweile betrunkenen Gesellen die Frankfurter Judengasse, die ein abgeschlossenes Ghetto am östlichen Stadtrand bildete. Sie war von Mauern umgeben und nur über drei Tore zugänglich., Bei den Kämpfen kamen ein Angreifer und zwei jüdische Verteidiger der Gasse ums Leben. Die Juden flohen schließlich auf den angrenzenden Friedhof oder in den christlichen Teil der Stadt, wo viele von Frankfurter Bürgern versteckt wurden. Mittlerweile plünderte der aufständische Mob die Judengasse, bis er gegen Mitternacht von der Frankfurter Bürgerwehr vertrieben wurde. Bei der Plünderung waren Schäden im Wert von 170.000 Gulden entstanden., Vinzenz Fettmilch selbst scheint an der Plünderung nicht beteiligt gewesen zu sein. In seinem späteren Prozess behauptete er, diese sei gegen seinen Willen erfolgt. Möglicherweise hatte er kurzfristig die Kontrolle über seine Anhänger verloren. Für Versuche Fettmilchs, die Ausschreitungen zu unterbinden, konnten aber keine überzeugenden Beweise beigebracht werden. Tatsache ist dagegen, dass er am nächsten Tag die Vertreibung aller Juden aus Frankfurt erzwang. Die meisten von ihnen suchten in den kurmainzischen und hessischen Nachbarstädten Höchst und Hanau Zuflucht., Das Ende Fettmilchs., Die judenfeindlichen Exzesse und der damit heraufbeschworene Konflikt mit dem Kaiser ließen Fettmilchs Ansehen nun rasch sinken; immer mehr seiner Anhänger wandten sich von ihm ab. Am 28. Oktober 1614 verkündete ein kaiserlicher Herold am Römer, dass die Reichsacht über Fettmilch sowie über den Schreiner Konrad Gerngroß und den Schneider Konrad Schopp verhängt worden sei, die als Rädelsführer der Rebellion galten. Erst am 27. November wagte es der Schöffe Johann Martin Baur, den bis dahin mächtigsten Mann der Stadt zu verhaften. In der Folge wurden noch vier weitere Frankfurter in die Acht erklärt, darunter der Sachsenhäuser Seidenfärber Georg Ebel., In einem langwierigen Prozess, der sich fast das ganze Jahr 1615 hinzog, wurden Fettmilch und insgesamt 38 Mitangeklagte nicht direkt wegen der Ausschreitungen gegen die Juden verurteilt, sondern wegen Majestätsverbrechen, da sie die Befehle des Kaisers missachtet hatten.

Bad Ischler Bahn genannt, verband als Schmalspurbahn mit 760mm Spurweite (Bosnaspur) von 1893 bis 1957 den Kurort Bad Ischl im Zentrum des Salzkammergutes mit der Stadt Salzburg. Die Marktgemeinde Mondsee war über eine Zweigstrecke bei St.Lorenz an die Hauptstrecke angebunden und der Wallfahrtsort St.Wolfgang über eine bahneigene Dampfschifffahrtslinie von der Hauptstrecke aus zu erreichen. Die SKGLB, die im Dampfbetrieb auf 66,9km Streckenlänge bis zu 2,15 Millionen Fahrgäste im Jahr beförderte, wurde 1957 als erste Bahnstrecke von nennenswerter Länge und überregionaler Bedeutung in Österreich trotz starker Proteste aus allen Bevölkerungsteilen eingestellt. Eine bereits projektierte Elektrifizierung wurde nicht realisiert. Mehrere Initiativen streben mittlerweile den Wiederaufbau der Strecke an. 2011 waren schon 29 Gemeinden einem \\"Verein zur Förderung der RegionalStadtBahn\\" beigetreten, lediglich der Salzburger Bürgermeister Heinz Schaden legte keinen Wert auf öffentlichen Verkehr auf dieser Strecke., Geschichte., Anfänge., In der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts entwickelte sich das Salzkammergut zu einem Zentrum des Tourismus in Österreich-Ungarn. Das hohe Fremdenverkehrsaufkommen ließ den Wunsch nach einer Bahnverbindung zwischen dem Kurort Bad Ischl und der Landeshauptstadt Salzburg aufkommen. Bereits Ende der 1860er Jahre wurden erste Pläne für den Bau einer solchen Verbindung ausgearbeitet. Neben einer Abzweigung nach Mondsee war überdies die Errichtung einer Zahnradbahn auf den Schafberg und eines Hotels geplant. Die im Jahre 1873 einsetzende Rezession machte diese Vorhaben jedoch vorerst zunichte., 14 Jahre später legte Ing. Wilhelm Michael aus Wien ein Konzept für die Verwirklichung der bereits in den 1860er Jahren vorhandenen Pläne in Form einer Normalspurbahn vor. 1888 nahm er mit Ing. Josef Stern Kontakt auf, dem Mitgründer der Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl, die in der gesamten Monarchie Bahnprojekte plante und realisierte. Josef Stern übernahm die Planungen für das Bahnprojekt, die mehr als zwei Jahre andauerten. Um das Projekt verwirklichen zu können, mangelte es indes noch an Investoren. Da die Verhandlungen mit Wiener Geldinstituten scheiterten, nahm Josef Stern mit einem seiner früheren Arbeitgeber, dem Besitzer der Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft (LAG) in Bayern sowie den in Oberösterreich und im Bundesland Salzburg ansässigen Banken Kontakt auf und konnte diese für das Projekt gewinnen., Im Jahre 1889 ersuchte die eigens gegründete, nicht börsennotierte \\"Salzkammergut-Localbahn-Aktiengesellschaft\\" (SKGLB) um eine Konzession für die \\"„Errichtung einer schmalspurigen Localbahn von Bad Ischl nach Salzburg mit einer Abzweigung nach Mondsee“\\", die das Unternehmen am 13. Jänner 1890 erhielt. Die Bahngesellschaft verfügte über ein Aktienkapital von 1.600.000Gulden, das durch die Hauptaktionäre LAG und Stern &amp; Hafferl sowie mehrere andere Unternehmen und 140 Privatpersonen aufgebracht wurde. Aus Kostengründen entschied sich das Unternehmen für die schmalspurige Errichtung der Lokalbahn, deren Spurweite von der Militärbehörde auf die so genannte Bosnische Spurweite von 760mm festgelegt wurde. Neben hohen Fahrgastzahlen durch den großen Touristenanteil im Personenverkehr erwartete die Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn-Aktiengesellschaft darüber hinaus einen gewinnbringenden Güterverkehr durch die Erschließung des Waldreichtums der Region., Bahnbau und Eröffnung., Nach dem Kauf aller erforderlichen Grundstücke wurde im Frühjahr 1890 mit den Bauarbeiten begonnen, wobei die Gesamtbauleitung Josef Stern oblag. Die Errichtung der Bahn erfolgte in drei Etappen., Das erste, 9,6km lange, Teilstück zwischen \\"Bad Ischl Localbahnhof\\" und Strobl, welches durch weitgehend unkompliziertes Gelände im Tal der Ischl führte, konnte bereits am 5. August 1890 eröffnet werden. Für den Betrieb dieses Streckenabschnitts wurden die zwei leichten Dampflokomotiven Nr. 1 und 2, sieben Personenwaggons der 2.Klasse, zwei Güterwaggons, zwei Gepäckwagen und zwei Postwagen beschafft. Da Bad Ischl der Sommersitz von Kaiser Franz Joseph war, erfolgte überdies die Anschaffung eines Salonwagens für den Kaiser., Der erste Abschnitt der Bahn hatte seinen Ausgangspunkt beim \\"Localbahnhof\\" in Bad Ischl im Westen des Ortes. Mit dem Hauptbahnhof von Bad Ischl wurde die Lokalbahn erst später verbunden. Zwischen August und September verkehrten täglich acht Zugpaare, im Winter wochentags nur vier und samstags acht Zugpaare. Auf Grund des hohen Fremdenverkehrsaufkommens erhöhte die SKGLB die Anzahl der Zugpaare im Sommer 1891 auf neun., Am 28. Juli 1891 wurde der zweite, 31,6km lange Teil der Strecke zwischen Salzburg und Mondsee eröffnet. Für den Betrieb dieses längeren und anspruchsvoller trassierten Streckenabschnitts wurden drei leistungsstärkere Lokomotiven jener Bauart beschafft, die sich seit 1888 schon auf der Steyrtalbahn bewährt hatte (Loks 3 – 5). Dazu kamen 13 Personenwaggons (1. und 3. Klasse), zwei Gepäckwagen, zwei Postwagen und 14 Güterwaggons. Täglich verkehrten fünf Personenzüge und ein Güterzug auf dem neu errichteten Teilstück; im Winter waren täglich nur drei gemischte Züge unterwegs., Der Bau der letzten Etappe, des 22,4km langen Lückenschlusses zwischen St.Lorenz am Mondsee und Strobl, gestaltete sich wesentlich schwieriger, da die Bahn in diesem Abschnitt Gebirgsbahncharakter aufwies. So arbeitete Josef Stern bei der Ausführung von Trassenfreisprengungen und Durchstichen eng mit der bereits als Geldgeber involvierten Lokalbahn-Aktiengesellschaft aus München zusammen. Deren Mitdirektor Victor Krüzner persönlich leitete die schwierigen Bauarbeiten, die zwei Jahre in Anspruch nahmen. Das Verbindungsstück zwischen den beiden fertigen Teilstrecken wurde am 20. Juni 1893 in Anwesenheit von Kaiser Franz Joseph eröffnet. Die SKGLB beschaffte fünf weitere Lokomotiven der Steyrtalbahntype (6 – 10), 19 Personenwaggons (1. und 3. Klasse), und 42 Güterwaggons. Die Verbindung der Bahn mit dem Hauptbahnhof in Bad Ischl wurde am 3. Juli 1894 für den Betrieb freigegeben. Mit dem Abschluss der Bauarbeiten erlangte das Streckennetz der SKGLB seine maximale Ausdehnung. Eine projektierte Verlängerung des Mondseer Astes über Zell am Moos nach Straßwalchen wurde aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen nicht realisiert. Für die Gesamtstrecke mussten zwei Viadukte, 58 Brücken und fünf Tunnels errichtet werden, zudem waren 432 Straßen- und Wegübergänge zu berücksichtigen., Der fortan nicht mehr benötigte \\"Localbahnhof\\" in Bad Ischl wurde in Personalwohnungen und eine Remise umgebaut. Am 1. August 1893 wurden die Schafbergbahn und das Hotel am Schafberg eröffnet. Beide Einrichtungen gehörten ebenfalls der Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn-Aktiengesellschaft, die zu diesem Zeitpunkt über 10 Lokomotiven, 39 Personenwaggons, vier Gepäckwagen, vier Postwagen, 58 Güterwaggons und einen Salonwagen verfügte. Auch vier offene Sommerwagen gehörten ursprünglich zum Fuhrpark der SKGLB. Da diese 1890 beschafften Fahrzeuge keine Übergänge zu anderen Wagen hatten, mussten die Fahrgäste jedoch bei einsetzendem Regen bis zum nächsten Bahnhof ausharren, um in einen geschlossenen Wagen zu wechseln. Der Einsatz der Sommerwagen war durch das wechselhafte Klima des Salzkammergutes daher kaum zu planen und so wurden sie 1906 in herkömmliche geschlossene Reisezugwagen umgebaut.&lt;ref name=\\"Schmalspur 1/2002\\"&gt;Gerald Breitfuß: \\"Sommerwagen im Wandel der Zeit\\", Zeitschrift Schmalspur 1/2002, Wien 2002, S. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt;, Die Beförderungszahlen entwickelten sich stärker als erwartet. Im ersten Geschäftsjahr 1890/1891 wurden 140.767 Fahrgäste befördert. In den Jahren 1896 und 1897 musste die Strecke mehrmals wegen Hochwassers gesperrt werden. Im Jahre 1898 kaufte die SKGLB zudem die Dampfschifffahrt auf dem Wolfgangsee von den Erben des Unternehmensgründers., 1912 schlug Josef Stern die Elektrifizierung der Lokalbahn vor. Dieses Projekt scheiterte ebenso, wie die drei Jahre zuvor ausgearbeiteten Pläne zur Elektrifizierung der normalspurigen Salzkammergutbahn und ein bereits 1907 erstelltes erstes Projekt zur Elektrifizierung der SKGLB, am Widerstand des Militärs, das elektrische Lokomotiven bei Bedarf nicht auf den ausschließlich mit Dampf betriebenen Strecken in Bosnien und Herzegowina hätte einsetzen können., Kriegsjahre, Aufschwung und Krise., Der Erste Weltkrieg brachte zwar keinen Rückgang der Beförderungszahlen mit sich – die Fahrgastzahlen stiegen stetig an –, hingegen wirkte sich der Krieg negativ auf die Verfügbarkeit der Betriebsmittel der SKGLB aus. Zwischen 1915 und 1918 requirierte die Heeresverwaltung sechs Lokomotiven, die auf den strategisch wichtigen Schmalspurbahnen in Bosnien und der Herzegowina zum Einsatz kamen. Die Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn musste den Betrieb mit den verbliebenen sechs Lokomotiven abwickeln. Längst notwendige Modernisierungsmaßnahmen konnten nicht verwirklicht werden. Der stetig steigende Kohlen- und Personalmangel führte zu einer starken Einschränkung des Zugverkehrs. Am 14. und 15. Dezember 1917 kam es zur vollständigen Einstellung des Betriebs; fortan verkehrten täglich nur mehr zwei Zugpaare. Die eingezogenen Fahrzeuge kehrten nach Kriegsende nicht mehr vollzählig ins Salzkammergut zurück., Das Ende des Krieges brachte eine drastische Verschlechterung der Wirtschaftslage mit sich. Die Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn befand sich in großen finanziellen Schwierigkeiten. Sie schloss ein Übereinkommen mit dem Bund, wodurch die Lokalbahn ab dem 1. Dezember 1920 für vier Jahre von der Republik Österreich verwaltet und durch die damals \\"BBÖ\\" abgekürzten Staatsbahnen betrieben wurde. Diese konnten den Engpass bei den Fahrbetriebsmitteln durch den Einsatz eigener Schmalspurfahrzeuge verringern. Kurze Zeit später erfolgte der Verkauf aller zur SKGLB gehörenden Unternehmungen, die nicht direkt zum Kerngeschäft der Lokalbahn gehörten; nur das Hotel am Schafberg blie: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"- Bahnstrecke - Salzburg - Oberösterreich - 1890er Jahre - Spurweite - 760 mm - Stern & Hafferl - Verkehr - SKGLB - Wiederaufbau"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Operatives Therapieverfahren, Therapeutisches Verfahren in Orthopädie und Unfallchirurgie], Der Begriff Acetabuloplastik fasst verschiedene Operationstechniken zusammen, die –unter dem Oberbegriff der Beckenosteotomien– zur operativen Behandlung der Hüftdysplasie (HD) im Kindesalter Anwendung finden. Hierzu zählen einige technisch sehr ähnliche Operationen, wie zum Beispiel die Osteotomie nach Lance, nach Pemberton oder nach Dega., Die Salter-Osteotomie zählt –im weiteren Sinne– zwar auch zur Gruppe der Acetabuloplastiken, unterscheidet sich aber in der Vorgehensweise sehr von allen anderen Verfahren., Grundlagen., Das Becken, besser gesagt, das Hüftbein setzt sich aus drei Knochen zusammen, dem Darmbein, dem Schambein und dem Sitzbein. Während des Wachstums bleiben die Verbindungsstellen (Wachstumsfugen) zwischen den drei Knochen offen. Sie sind nur bindegewebig, später durch Knorpelgewebe flexibel miteinander verbunden und verknöchern erst zum Ende des knöchernen Wachstums. Die drei Wachstumsfugen treffen sich im späteren Zentrum der Hüftgelenkspfanne und bilden dort die Y-Fuge., Bei der Hüftdysplasie fehlt dem Hüftkopf die seitliche (laterale) und vordere (ventrale) Überdachung (auch \\"Pfannenerker\\" genannt). Der „zukünftige“ Hüftkopf wird nicht korrekt überdacht und droht –je nach Schweregrad der Dysplasie– nach oben abzurutschen und zu luxieren (auszurenken)., Das Prinzip der Acetabuloplastik macht sich die noch offene Y-Fuge zu Nutzen. Das Darmbein wird oberhalb der Pfanne so durchtrennt \\"(Osteotomie)\\", dass der seitliche Pfannenerker heruntergeschwenkt werden kann. Dreh- und Knickpunkt ist die Y-Fuge. Dieses Prinzip ist die Grundlage aller Techniken der Acetabuloplastik, lediglich die Vorgehensweise ist unterschiedlich., Ziel der Acetabuloplastik., Ziel dieser Operation ist es, den lateralen und ventralen Pfannenerker so wiederherzustellen, dass der Hüftkopf eine physiologische Überdachung findet. Je früher die Operation (bei gegebener Indikation) durchgeführt wird, desto größer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Hüftgelenk und Schenkelhals normal heranwachsen., Bemessen wird die laterale Überdachung am sogenannten \\"Acetabulumwinkel\\" (AC-Winkel) im Beckenübersichtsröntgenbild: Ein Winkel zwischen einer Horizontalen durch die Y-Fugen und einer Linie entlang des Pfannenerkers. Beim gesunden Neugeborenen beträgt der AC-Winkel etwa 25°, mit 6 Jahren etwa 15° und ab dem 12. Lebensjahr 11–12°. Entsprechend dieser physiologischen Werte sollte der AC-Winkel auch bei der Acetabuloplastik korrigiert werden. Man spricht von \\"anatomischer Rekonstruktion\\"., Indikationen und Kontraindikationen., Indikationen für eine Acetabuloplastik ist in erster Linie die Hüftdysplasie. Ein operatives Eingreifen wird notwendig, wenn die HD konservativ –also mit Spreizhose/-schiene, Spreizgips oder Repositionsgips– nicht mehr behandelbar ist oder diese Behandlungsmethoden fehlschlugen. Eine absolute Indikation zur Acetabuloplastik ist die nichtreponierbare (nicht wieder einzurichtende) Hüftluxation. Wenn die Indikation zur Acetabuloplastik gestellt ist, sollte die Operation so schnell wie möglich erfolgen., Die Operation kann beim Säugling schon ab dem ersten Lebensmonat durchgeführt werden, wenn keine anderen medizinischen Gründe dagegen sprechen. Empfohlen wird ein gelenkverbessernder operativer Eingriff ab einem Alter von rund eineinhalb Jahren, da erst dann die Ausbildung und Festigkeit des Knochens eine exakte und saubere Durchführung erlauben. Durch die in den meisten Fällen vorangehenden konservativen Maßnahmen kommt es ohnehin frühestens im zweiten Lebensjahr zur Operation. Milde Verlaufsformen der Hüftdysplasie weisen oft eine günstige Verlaufsform auf, weshalb in solchen Fällen meist mit einem operativen Behandlungsplan bis zum 3. Lebensjahr gewartet wird., Es gibt verschiedene Meinungen dazu, bis zu welchem Alter eine Acetabuloplastik durchgeführt werden kann. Entscheidend ist, dass die Y-Fuge noch offen sein muss, was die Operation noch in einem Alter von 12 oder 13 Jahren – also bis zum Verschluss der Y-Fuge – möglich macht. Bei später Erstdiagnose (6. Lebensmonat und älter) ist die Indikation zur direkten OP zwar gegeben, konservative Maßnahmen sollten jedoch, in Abhängigkeit von Befund und Schweregrad, dennoch erwogen werden., Als weitere Indikation ist der Morbus Perthes (frühkindliche Hüftkopfnekrose) zu erwähnen, wobei häufig die Methode nach Salter in Verbindung mit einer intertrochanteren Varisationsosteotomie (Einwärtskippung / Korrektur des Schenkelhalses mit dem Ziel der besseren Zentrierung des Hüftkopfes in der Hüftpfanne) zur Anwendung kommt. Bei seltenen, neurologischen Störungen (z.B. Infantile Zerebralparese), die zu einer Hüftdysplasie oder Hüftluxation führen, kommt die Acetabuloplastik ebenfalls zum Einsatz., Kontraindikationen sind fieberhafte Infektionen, entzündliche Prozesse im Bereich des Hüftgelenks oder des Beckenknochens und andere, bis dahin noch nicht abgeklärte Allgemeinbefunde. Bei geschlossener Y-Fuge, abgeschlossenem knöchernen Wachstum und stark verformtem Hüftkopf kann die Operation nicht mehr durchgeführt werden., Diagnostik und Diagnosestellung., Die Einzelheiten zur klinischen und bildgebenden Diagnostik der Hüftdysplasie beziehungsweise der Hüftluxation werden im Artikel Hüftdysplasie erläutert., Präoperativ werden sowohl zur genauen Beurteilung der Gelenkfehlstellung und des Schweregrades als auch zur Planung der Operation selbst konventionelle Röntgenbilder des Beckens, sogenannte \\"Beckenübersichtsaufnahmen\\" und \\"Rippstein-Aufnahmen\\", angefertigt. Die Rippstein-Aufnahmen dienen der genaueren Beurteilung der Schenkelhälse in einer seitlichen Projektion., Anästhesie., Die Operation wird in Vollnarkose mit Intubation oder Larynxmaske durchgeführt. Zur Schmerztherapie bekommen die Kinder schon vor der Operation ein Schmerzmittel – in Form eines Zäpfchens oder als Injektion – verabreicht., Operationsablauf., Im Falle der dysplastischen Hüftluxation kann als erstes eine Funktionsarthrographie des/der Hüftgelenke/s vorgenommen werden. Hier lässt sich das Luxationsverhalten und der Grad der Kapselüberdehnung/-verletzung im Röntgenbild genau bestimmen. Spätestens jetzt kann noch die Entscheidung getroffen werden, ob operiert werden muss oder nicht, und wenn ja, welches Verfahren zum Einsatz kommt., Technik der Acetabuloplastik., Bei allen Osteotomietechniken wird lediglich ein kleiner Zugang zwischen Leistenfalte und Beckenkamm benötigt. Die Muskulatur wird hier stumpf auseinandergedrängt und darunter das Darmbein dargestellt. Kurz oberhalb der Pfanne wird das Periost abgelöst und der Darmbeinknochen freigelegt., Osteotomie nach Pemberton., Bei Pemberton wird unter ständiger Röntgenkontrolle mit einem flachen Meißel das Darmbein etwa 5mm oberhalb des Pfannenerkers angekerbt und die Osteotomie in Richtung Y-Fuge vervollständigt. Nun wird das Pfannenfragment, ebenfalls unter Röntgenkontrolle, nach unten und gleichzeitig nach vorne geklappt. So wird eine möglichst anatomische Rekonstruktion der Pfanne erreicht., Osteotomie nach Dega., Dega führt die Osteotomie ebenfalls in Richtung Y-Fuge aus, benutzt dabei jedoch spezielle, gebogene Meißel, um eine möglichst sphärische –der Pfannenrundung angepasste– Ablösung des Fragmentes zu erzielen. Ursprünglich senkte Dega das Pfannenfragment nur seitlich ab, heute wird dies jedoch meistens mit einer zusätzlichen Ventral-Schwenkung (nach vorne) ähnlich der Pemberton-Methode modifiziert., Entsprechend dem so entstandenen Spalt wird bei beiden Vorgehensweisen ein passender Knochenkeil (Spenderknochen/Knochenbank, siehe unten) zurechtgesägt und unter Röntgenkontrolle in den Spalt eingestößelt. Der Keil kann wenn nötig mit einem Osteosynthese-Draht (auch Kirschner-Draht genannt) fixiert werden. Bei einem geübten Operateur dauert diese Operation in etwa fünfundvierzig bis sechzig Minuten., Im Anschluss an die Operation wird ein entsprechender Beckenbeingips (modifizierter Fettweiss-Gips) oder eine Abduktions-Orthese angelegt, damit der Hüftkopf während der postoperativen Heilung zentral in der Pfanne steht. Die Narkose wird erst im Anschluss daran beendet., Der Knochenkeil., Bei Kindern ist es nur schwer möglich, Eigenknochen im Sinne der Autologen (Knochen-)Transplantation zu verwenden. Bei gleichzeitiger intertrochantärer (zwischen den Knochenvorsprüngen am Oberschenkelknochen) Umstellung kann versucht werden, den abfallenden Korrekturkeil zu verwenden. In den meisten Fällen ist dieser jedoch zu klein., Heute werden vorwiegend Spenderknochen aus hauseigenen Knochenbanken oder von verschiedenen Herstellern benutzt. Es handelt sich hierbei meistens um Oberschenkelköpfe, die bei Endoprothesenoperationen entnommen und bei sonst gesunden Patienten und vorliegender Einverständniserklärung gespendet werden. Die Spenderknochen werden in zertifizierten Thermodesinfektionsgeräten desinfiziert und entproteinisiert. Anschließend werden sie in sterilen Gefäßen –bei mind. minus 20°C– kryokonserviert. Alternativ dazu ist es möglich, Spenderknochen im Autoklaven unter Einwirkung von gespanntem Wasserdampf zu sterilisieren. Auch andere Sterilisationsverfahren, zum Beispiel die Gammastrahlen-Sterilisation, werden bei der industriellen Knochenaufbereitung angewendet., Alle Aufbereitungs- und Desinfektions-/Sterilisationsverfahren sowie die Lagerung der Spenderknochen (Tiefkühlung) sind aufwändig und unterliegen strengen Auflagen der Bundesärztekammer, des Medizinproduktegesetzes (MPG) und des Robert Koch-Instituts., Sonderfälle., In seltenen sehr schweren Fällen lässt sich der Hüftkopf nicht mehr manuell (Overhead-Technik) reponieren (in die Normalstellung bringen). Der Hüftkopf ist so weit abgerutscht und die Gelenkkapsel so überdehnt und hypertrophiert, dass der Kopf sich nicht zurück in die Pfanne reponieren lässt. Häufig lagert sich überschießendes Kapselmaterial in die Pfanne ab und behindert die Reposition zusätzlich. In solchen Fällen muss der Hüftkopf offen, also unter Eröffnung des Gelenkes selbst, reponiert werden. Man spricht von „Offener Hüfteinstellung“. Dabei wird die Kapsel zirkulär eröffnet, überflüssiges Kapsel- und Gelenkschleimhautgewe: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Operatives Therapieverfahren, Acetabuloplastik, Hüftdysplasie, Beckenosteotomien, Lance, Pemberton, Dega, Salter-Osteotomie, Hüftkopf, Y-Fuge"},{"instruction":"can you describe jessica alba voice","output":"Jessica Alba's voice is best described as smooth and sultry.

Chr., Gestorben 29, Kaiserin (Römisches Reich), Livier], Livia Drusilla (* 30. Januar 58 v. Chr.; † 29n.Chr. in Rom), meist nur kurz Livia genannt, war die langjährige dritte Ehefrau des römischen Kaisers Augustus. Nach dessen Tod wurde sie Iulia Augusta genannt und trug als erste Römerin den kaiserlichen Titel Augusta. Von ihrem Enkel, Kaiser Claudius, nach ihrem Tod zur Göttin erhöht, wurde sie ab 42n.Chr. Diva Augusta genannt., Im Jahr 38 v. Chr. heiratete Livia Drusilla unter Umständen, die viele Römer als skandalös empfanden, den Triumvirn Gaius Caesar, den späteren Augustus, der damals nach Marcus Antonius der zweitmächtigste Mann Roms war. Damit rückte sie ins Zentrum der militärischen und politischen Auseinandersetzungen jener Zeit. Der Aufstieg des jungen Caesar Oktavian vom Triumvir zum Princeps und damit mächtigsten Mann des römischen Reiches war auch ihr eigener. Dass die Ehe 52 Jahre bis zum Tode des Augustus hielt, war für die damalige Zeit außergewöhnlich, zumal Livia wegen einer mit schweren Komplikationen verbundenen Frühgeburt Augustus’ Wunsch nach einem Kind nicht erfüllen konnte. Daher war, auch wenn die Eheschließung von politischen Motiven bestimmt gewesen sein mag, für ihren Bestand gegenseitige Zuneigung und Respekt ausschlaggebend. Trotz oder wegen des stürmischen Beginns ihrer Verbindung war Livia auf ihren guten Ruf als Ehefrau und vorbildliche Mutter bedacht. Im Rahmen der augusteischen Propaganda der wiederhergestellten Republik wirkte sie seit 27v.Chr. geradezu als lebende Inkarnation gesellschaftlicher und moralischer Erneuerung. Augustus würdigte diese Rolle durch Ehrungen, vor allem 9v.Chr., und räumte ihr politischen Einfluss ein, denn er pflegte wichtige Fragen der Politik mit ihr zu besprechen und ihren Rat einzuholen. Von Livia stammen vier Kaiser ab: Sie war die Mutter des Tiberius, die Großmutter des Claudius, die Urgroßmutter Caligulas und die Ururgroßmutter Neros., Leben., Herkunft und Familie., Am dritten Tag vor den Kalenden, dem Monatsbeginn, des Februar 58v.Chr. wurde Livia in Rom als Tochter des Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus und der Alfidia geboren. Im Geburtsjahr Livias zählte der Januar noch 28 Tage, so dass sie wohl am 27. Januar zur Welt kam. Im Jahr 45v.Chr. reformierte Caesar den römischen Kalender und fügte dem Januar drei Tage hinzu. Livia aber datierte ihren Geburtstag nicht neu, sondern blieb bei der Formulierung „am dritten Tag vor den Kalenden“. Dieser fiel nun im neuen Kalender auf den 30. Januar, der ihr offizielles Geburtsdatum wurde., Livias Vater, Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, war ein gebürtiger Claudier und stammte aus dem alten patrizischen Geburtsadel. Vermutlich als Heranwachsender war er von Marcus Livius Drusus dem Jüngeren, dessen Ehe kinderlos geblieben war, in die Familie der Livier adoptiert worden. Diese waren zwar keine Patrizier, sondern Senatoren plebeischer Herkunft. Aber sie gehörten ebenso wie die Claudier zu den politisch aktiven Nobilitätsfamilien der Republik, die über Jahrhunderte zahlreiche Amtsträger gestellt hatten. So hatte sich Livias Großvater als Volkstribun im Jahr 91v.Chr. zum Ziel gesetzt, den italischen Bundesgenossen Roms das römische Bürgerrecht zu verschaffen. Nach der Adoption führte Livias Vater den Namen seines Adoptivvaters Marcus Livius Drusus und fügte den Beinamen Claudianus an, der auf seine patrizische Herkunft hinwies. Wie es allgemein üblich war, erhielt seine Tochter, die nach der Adoption geboren wurde, den Familiennamen des neuen Geschlechts als Name: \\"Livia\\", mit dem Beinamen in der zärtlichen Koseform \\"Drusilla\\". Livias Mutter Alfidia gehörte der landstädtischen Munizipalaristokratie an. Claudianus dürfte sie wohl spätestens im März 59v.Chr. nicht zuletzt wegen ihres Reichtums geheiratet haben., Nach Caesars Tod 44v.Chr. schloss sich Claudianus der Partei der Caesarattentäter an, trat 43v.Chr. offen für Decimus Brutus ein und wollte ihm das Kommando über zwei Legionen verschaffen. Wegen dieser Parteinahme und um sein großes Vermögen einzuziehen setzten die Triumvirn Octavian, Marcus Antonius und Lepidus Ende Oktober 43v.Chr. Claudianus auf die berüchtigten Proskriptionslisten. Mit ihnen erklärten sie ihre politischen Gegner als Staatsfeinde für vogelfrei und konfiszierten ihren Besitz zu Gunsten der eigenen Kriegskassen, um den Bürgerkrieg gegen die Caesarmörder erfolgreich beenden zu können. Claudianus blieb nur die Flucht in die Ostprovinzen, wo er sich dem Heer der Caesarmörder unter Befehl des Marcus Brutus und Gaius Cassius anschloss., Hochzeit mit Tiberius Claudius Nero 43 v. Chr.., Unter diesen schwierigen Umständen verheiratete er sein einziges Kind, Livia, mit Tiberius Claudius Nero, einem entfernten Verwandten. So konnte er seiner Tochter wenigstens einen Teil seines Vermögens in Form einer Mitgift übertragen. Livia war gerade 15 Jahre alt, während Claudius Nero wegen der an die Ämterlaufbahn gebundenen Altersstufen mindestens 26 Jahre älter als seine Frau gewesen sein muss., Noch bevor Livia ihr erstes Kind zur Welt bringen konnte, beging ihr Vater Selbstmord: Zwei Monate vor ihrer Niederkunft war es im September 42v.Chr. zur Doppelschlacht von Philippi gekommen, in der die Heere der Caesarmörder den Triumvirn Marcus Antonius und Octavian unterlagen. In seiner Verzweiflung über die Niederlage und ohne Hoffnung auf eine Zukunft stürzte sich Claudianus in seinem Zelt ins Schwert., Am 16. November 42v.Chr. brachte Livia auf dem Palatin, der bevorzugten Wohngegend der republikanischen Aristokratie in Rom, ihren ersten Sohn zur Welt. Er erhielt den gleichen Namen wie sein Vater, Tiberius Claudius Nero., Scheidung von Tiberius Claudius Nero und Hochzeit mit Octavian (39 v. Chr.)., Livias Ehemann hatte sich zunächst wie sein Vater den Caesarmördern angeschlossen, vollzog dann aber eine Kehrtwende und erwies sich den Triumvirn als nützlich. So vermied er, auf die Proskriptionsliste gesetzt zu werden, und schaffte im Jahr 42v.Chr. sogar den Sprung in ein Prätorenamt. In dieser Funktion setzte er ganz auf Marcus Antonius, den mächtigsten Mann im Triumvirat, und unterstützte im Perusinischen Bürgerkrieg dessen Ziele. Nach der Niederlage der Parteigänger des Antonius floh Claudius Nero mit Livia und ihrem zweijährigen Sohn Tiberius vor dem siegreichen Octavian 40v.Chr. zu Sextus Pompeius nach Sizilien, dann nach Griechenland zu Marcus Antonius. In Sparta fand die Familie schließlich Aufnahme und für einige Zeit eine sichere Zuflucht, denn die Spartaner gehörten zur Klientel der Claudier und waren der Familie des Claudius Nero zu Hilfeleistungen verpflichtet., In der zweiten Hälfte des Jahres 39 v. Chr. konnte Livia mit ihrem Gatten und ihrem Sohn nach Rom zurückkehren, nachdem die Triumvirn sich untereinander versöhnt und mit Sextus Pompeius im Vertrag von Misenum Frieden geschlossen hatten. Es spricht einiges dafür, dass Livia und Octavian am 23. September 39v.Chr. in dessen Haus zum ersten Mal zusammentrafen. Der Triumvir ließ in diesem Jahr mit großem Aufwand seinen 24. Geburtstag feiern, weil er ihn mit dem Fest der Bartschur verband. Aus diesem Anlass veranstaltete er in aller Öffentlichkeit ein Bankett. Als er bei diesem Fest Livia begegnete, verliebte er sich in sie., Kurz zuvor hatte er nach kaum einjähriger Ehe seiner zweiten Frau Scribonia den Scheidungsbrief zustellen lassen. Skandalös daran war, dass er genau an dem Tag bei ihr eintraf, als das erste gemeinsame Kind, Iulia, geboren wurde. In seinen „Memoiren“ rechtfertigte sich Augustus später damit, dass er sich zur Scheidung entschlossen habe „durch und durch angeekelt von ihrem verkommenen Charakter.“, Im Oktober 39 v. Chr. bat Octavian Claudius Nero, sich von Livia scheiden zu lassen, obwohl diese mit einem zweiten Sohn, Drusus, im sechsten Monat schwanger war. Das schloss eine Heirat mit einem anderen Mann nach den gültigen Regeln aus. Doch Octavian setzte eine Sondererlaubnis des Priesterkollegiums der \\"Pontifices\\" durch. Claudius Nero zögerte nicht, zu gehorchen, und übernahm anlässlich der Hochzeit sogar die Rolle des Brautvaters, als er die knapp 20-jährige Livia dem jungen Bräutigam zuführte. Der Termin der Hochzeit ergibt sich eindeutig aus der literarischen Überlieferung. Dagegen legen Inschriften dieses Ereignis auf den 17. Januar 38v.Chr. fest, drei Tage nach der Geburt des Drusus, die Sueton in der Biographie des Kaisers Claudius auf den 14. Januar datiert. Dabei handelt es sich um einen offiziellen Termin, den erst Kaiser Claudius zum Festtag beschließen ließ, „weil auch der Geburtstag seines Großvaters (Marcus) Antonius auf denselben Tag falle“. Das war nach Ausweis der kaiserlichen Kalender (Fasti Praenestini) der 14. Januar. Mit dem tatsächlichen Datum der Eheschließung und der Geburt des Drusus hat er nichts zu tun. In Wirklichkeit muss Drusus \\"im dritten Monat nach der Hochzeit\\" geboren worden sein. Historisch glaubwürdig ist also nur die literarische Überlieferung. Danach muss die Hochzeit drei Monate früher, als im Festkalender offiziell angegeben, stattgefunden haben, also Mitte bis Ende Oktober 39v.Chr. Später wurde dann das offizielle Hochzeitsdatum auf den 17. Januar 38v.Chr. festgelegt., Octavian soll Livia, so Tacitus, „aus Lust auf ihre Schönheit“ begehrt haben. Und Sueton betont eine Nuance sachlicher, dass Octavian zwar „Livia ihrem Gatten Tiberius Nero wegnahm, als sie schon schwanger war“, aber „sie auf einzigartige Art und Weise und mit einzigartiger Treue liebte und schätzte.“ Eine leidenschaftliche Liebesbeziehung mag in der Tat die entscheidende Triebfeder gewesen sein. Doch allein erklärt dieses Motiv nicht, weshalb Octavian Livia so überstürzt heiraten wollte. Es muss noch ein politisches Kalkül hinzugekommen sein: Bei dieser Scheidung und Wiederverheiratung hat der Frontwechsel des früheren Antonius-Anhängers Claudius Nero zu Octavian eine bedeutsame Rolle gespielt. Die Heirat verstärkte enorm Octavians Basis in der alten Aristokratie., Von „Brautraub“, wie Tacitus suggeriert, kann keine Rede sein, da Augustus Claudius Nero gebeten hatte, ihm Livia abzutreten. Dass ihr erster Ehemann bei der Hochzeit anwesend war und eine wichtige Rolle bei der Zeremonie spielte, untermauert, dass er der Bitte entsprochen hatte, um sich dem starken Mann in Rom zu verpflichten.

Sie liegen im Bereich von Flusstälern, an Seen oder in Senken. Feuchtwiesen existieren in weiten Bereichen Europas und Asiens, mit Schwerpunkten in Mitteleuropa. Ausläufer gehen bis ins Mittelmeergebiet, auf den Balkan und nach Nordeuropa. Das Areal reicht im Osten bis nach Sibirien., In Mitteleuropa zählen Feuchtwiesen zu den artenreichsten Biotopen. Hier gelten sie als Halbkulturformationen, die durch menschliche Nutzung infolge der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion von Streu und Futter für die Nutzviehhaltung entstanden sind. Sie tragen wesentlich zur Ausprägung der mitteleuropäischen Kulturlandschaft bei. Sie müssen bewirtschaftet werden, da die Sukzession zur Ausbildung von Hochstaudenfluren, später Gebüschen und schließlich zu Wäldern führen würde., Feuchtwiesen sind auch unter den Begriffen Sumpfwiese und Brühl (von mittellateinisch \\"brogilus oder broilus\\": \\"Baumstück\\") zu finden. Letzterer wurde dadurch zum Namensgeber für viele tief liegende, teilweise mit Baumwuchs versehene Stadtteile und Straßen, die vielleicht auf ehemaligem Sumpfland errichtet wurden., Der folgende Artikel gibt einen zusammenfassenden Überblick über die Feuchtwiesen Mitteleuropas, deren Standorte, die verschiedenen Feuchtwiesentypen und deren Lebenswelt nach ökologischen und naturschutzfachlichen Gesichtspunkten. Hier werden unter Feuchtwiesen die ungedüngten, einmal jährlich gemähten Streuwiesen sowie die nährstoffreichen, meist zweimal gemähten Feucht- und Nasswiesen zusammengefasst., Entstehung von Feuchtwiesen., Nach herrschender Lehrmeinung bestand die Landschaft Mitteleuropas mit Unterbrechungen (z.B. Bandkeramische Kultur) bis ins frühe Mittelalter überwiegend aus einem Mosaik aus Wäldern, Lichtungen, Mooren und Wasserflächen. Typische Wiesenpflanzen waren deshalb auf Bereiche beschränkt, die unter anderem durch große Weidegänger (Megaherbivoren) wie zum Beispiel Elch, Wisent, Wildpferd oder Auerochse offen gehalten wurden oder in denen im Bereich der großen Flüsse durch Überschwemmungen und/oder Laufveränderungen keine Waldentwicklung zugelassen wurde. Bis dahin hatten die Menschen die Landschaft nur kleinflächig im engeren Umfeld der Siedlungen beeinflusst. Mit dem Bevölkerungswachstum nahm auch die ungeregelte Nutzung der Wälder als Allmende zu. Hutewaldnutzung oder Rodung bewirkte eine weitgehende Öffnung der Landschaft., Es entstanden großflächig offene, parkähnliche Landschaftsräume (siehe zeitgenössisches Gemälde rechts). Im Lauf der Jahrhunderte entwickelten sich auf diese Weise durch den wirtschaftenden Menschen begründete halbnatürliche Ökosysteme. Auf feuchten bis nassen Standorten haben sich die Feuchtwiesen entwickelt. Feuchtwiesen zählten noch im 18. Jahrhundert zu weit verbreiteten Lebensräumen Mitteleuropas. Neben grundlegenden strukturellen Veränderungen mit der Entstehung großflächiger Offenlandgesellschaften und der Zurückdrängung ursprünglicher Lebensräume haben die Nutzungsformen Acker und Grünland auch zu Veränderungen im Artenspektrum von Tieren und Pflanzen und insgesamt zu einer Erhöhung der biologischen Vielfalt gegenüber der Naturlandschaft geführt., Gefährdung., Bereits ab Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts, verstärkt aber nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg, wurden die Feuchtwiesen durch umfangreiche Meliorationsmaßnahmen wie Entwässerung und Düngung großflächig in Fettwiesen oder durch Umbruch in Äcker umgewandelt. Diese tief greifenden Veränderungen führten zum Verschwinden vieler Charakterarten der Feuchtwiesen, andere sind in ihrem Bestand stark gefährdet beziehungsweise zurückgegangen. Eine weitere Gefährdung von Feuchtwiesen ist die Nutzungsaufgabe landwirtschaftlicher Flächen aus sozialen, ökonomischen und agrarstrukturellen, besonders aber standörtlichen Gründen (Sozialbrache). Davon sind vor allem Grenzertragsstandorte, das sind schwierig zu bewirtschaftende Flächen, wie zum Beispiel Nassstandorte oder sehr kleine Parzellen, betroffen, welche bevorzugt aufgelassen werden. Durch die Intensivierung der Landwirtschaft einerseits und die Nutzungsaufgabe andererseits droht die einst gewonnene Vielfalt wieder verloren zu gehen. Anstelle artenreicher Feuchtwiesen sind heute vielfach Fettwiesen, intensiv genutzte Portionsweiden sowie Äcker vorherrschend, in denen alle Nässezeiger verschwunden und durch Stickstoffzeiger ersetzt sind., Standortfaktoren., Feuchtwiesen existieren in feuchten Niederungen, kleinräumig auch in quellig-staufeuchten bis vermoorten Bereichen von Hängen und Plateaulagen und schmalen Tälern. Feuchtwiesen gibt es, einfach ausgedrückt, überall, wo es feucht genug ist. Die Höhenverbreitung reicht von der planaren bis zur subalpinen, fragmentarisch auch bis in die alpine Stufe. Aus den Faktoren Klima, Wasserhaushalt und Boden ergeben sich vielfältige Pflanzen- und Tiergemeinschaften (Phyto- und Zoozönosen). Diese Standortfaktoren werden von der Nutzung überprägt., Klima., Ein humides Klima, in dem die Jahresniederschlagssumme die Jahresverdunstung übersteigt, zusammen mit vergleichsweise niedrigen Sommertemperaturen begünstigt die Bildung von Feuchtwiesen. Deshalb kommen sie gehäuft in den Mittelgebirgen, im Alpenvorland und in Küstennähe der Norddeutschen Tiefebene vor., Wasserhaushalt., Aufgrund ihres Wasserhaushaltes werden Feuchtwiesen vom übrigen Wirtschaftsgrünland abgegrenzt. Für Feuchtwiesen sind eine zeitweilig hohe Bodenfeuchtigkeit von Quellwasser bis zu stagnierendem Grund- und Stauwasser sowie teilweise Überschwemmungen bestimmend. Die starke Bodendurchfeuchtung kann lang anhaltend oder von sommerlichen Austrocknungsphasen unterbrochen sein., Der zumindest zeitweilige Überschuss an Wasser im Wurzelbereich ist mit einem Sauerstoffmangel verbunden, der zu Schäden an den Pflanzenwurzeln (Wurzelatmung) und zu einem eingeschränkten Wachstum der Pflanzen, aufgrund einer begrenzten Nährstoffaufnahme, führen kann. Die Pflanzenarten der Feuchtwiesen zeichnen sich gegenüber Arten anderer Standorte durch spezielle Anpassungsmechanismen an den Wasserüberschuss aus. Beispielsweise verfügen etliche Arten über spezielle Hohlraumgewebe (Aerenchyme) in dem Luft vom oberirdischen Spross in die Wurzel geleitet werden kann sowie über spezifische Stoffwechselwege, welche ohne Sauerstoff auskommen. Durch diese Anpassungen sind Feuchtwiesenpflanzen auf feuchten und nassen Standorten gegenüber Pflanzen anderer Standorte in einem Konkurrenzvorteil., Böden und Nährstoffversorgung., Die Böden der Feuchtwiesen sind Gleye, Pseudogleye und verwandte Auenböden sowie An- und Niedermoore mit unterschiedlichen Basen- und Nährstoffgehalten. Die Nährstoffnachlieferung des Bodens ist abhängig von seinem Nährstoffvorrat und dessen Verfügbarkeit für die Pflanzen. Ein optimales Pflanzenwachstum setzt eine gute Versorgung mit allen Pflanzennährstoffen, insbesondere mit Stickstoff, Phosphor und Kalium, voraus. Der natürliche Nährstoffgehalt des Bodens wird ergänzt durch Überschwemmungen, dem Grundwasser, der Atmosphäre und Düngung. Dabei hat der Säuregrad des Bodens entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Verfügbarkeit von Pflanzennährstoffen und die Aufnahmefähigkeit der Pflanzenwurzeln für Nährstoffe. Feuchtwiesen können auf sehr sauren aber auch auf kalkreichen Standorten sowie auf allen Übergängen zwischen diesen Extremen vorkommen., Viele Pflanzenarten der Feuchtwiesen nährstoffarmer Standorte haben besondere Mechanismen zur Anpassung an einen Nährstoffmangel entwickelt. Um die wenigen Nährstoffe vollständig nutzen zu können, durchwurzeln sie den Boden intensiv, bilden Speicherorgane (Rhizome, Knollen) und verfügen über einen internen Nährstoffkreislauf durch die Rückverlagerung in bodennahe Speicherorgane um die Nährstoffe in der kommenden Vegetationsperiode rasch nutzen zu können., Bedeutung der Nutzung., Bei Feuchtwiesen werden zwei Nutzungsformen unterschieden. Die Mahd kann einmal allein zur Gewinnung von Einstreu für Viehställe mit einmaliger Mahd im Herbst (nach der Vegetationsperiode oder im Winter) auf nährstoffärmeren Standorten erfolgen (Streuwiesen, Pfeifengraswiesen, Brenndoldenwiesen). Auf nährstoffreicheren Standorten dient eine zweimalige Mahd im Frühling (Anfang bis Mitte Juni) und im Spätsommer (Mitte August bis Mitte September) zur Werbung von Winterfutter für Wiederkäuer wie Rinder und Schafe (Futterwiesen, Sumpfdotterblumenwiesen)., Eine Wiese wird erst durch eine regelmäßige Mahd zu dem, was sie ist, nämlich zu einem artenreichen Pflanzenbestand mit Habitateignung für die Tierwelt. Durch den Schnitt werden Licht liebende und niedrigwüchsige Pflanzen gefördert und hochwüchsige Konkurrenten verdrängt. Dazu gehören Pflanzen mit hohem Wiederaustriebsvermögen, so genannte Hemikryptophyten, die ihre Überdauerungsorgane und Blätter sehr nahe am Boden ausbilden und von den Messern der Sensen und Mähmaschinen nicht erreicht werden. Bei der Mahd entscheidet der Schnittzeitpunkt wesentlich über die Artenvielfalt. Eine regelmäßige Mahd bewirkt, dass Pflanzen unterschiedlicher Wuchs- und Lebensformen auf ein und demselben Standort nebeneinander wachsen können. Je später gemäht wird, umso mehr Möglichkeiten haben Pflanzen und Tiere, sich im Ökosystem Wiese einzunischen. Eine Nutzung mit ein bis zwei Schnitten pro Jahr vermögen besonders viele Pflanzenarten auszuhalten, eine artenreiche Blumenwiese ist das Ergebnis. Die Abfuhr des Mähgutes bedingt außerdem eine langsame Verarmung an Nährstoffen (Aushagerung). Dieses bedeutet, dass bei extensiver Nutzung unter Umständen ein regelmäßiger Ausgleich des Nährstoffdefizites über eine organische Düngung mit Stallmist erfolgen muss., In extensiv genutzten Feuchtwiesen der naturnahen Kulturlandschaften können auf 20m² zwischen 40 und 60 höhere Pflanzenarten wachsen. Einen besonderen floristischen Reichtum zeigen die nährstoffärmeren und ungedüngten Pfeifengraswiesen, auch Streuwiesen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Biotoptyp, Naturschutz, Wiese, Feuchtwiesen, Gräser, Binsen, Seggen, Pflanzen, Halbnatürliche Biotope, Grundwasser, Mitteleuropa"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Bahnstrecke im Land Salzburg, Bahnstrecke in Oberösterreich, Erbaut in den 1890er Jahren, Spurweite 760 mm, Stern & Hafferl Verkehrsgesellschaft, Verkehr (Flachgau), Verkehr (Salzkammergut), Verkehrsbauwerk in Salzburg], Die Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn, kurz SKGLB oder Ischlerbahn bzw. Bad Ischler Bahn genannt, verband als Schmalspurbahn mit 760mm Spurweite (Bosnaspur) von 1893 bis 1957 den Kurort Bad Ischl im Zentrum des Salzkammergutes mit der Stadt Salzburg. Die Marktgemeinde Mondsee war über eine Zweigstrecke bei St.Lorenz an die Hauptstrecke angebunden und der Wallfahrtsort St.Wolfgang über eine bahneigene Dampfschifffahrtslinie von der Hauptstrecke aus zu erreichen. Die SKGLB, die im Dampfbetrieb auf 66,9km Streckenlänge bis zu 2,15 Millionen Fahrgäste im Jahr beförderte, wurde 1957 als erste Bahnstrecke von nennenswerter Länge und überregionaler Bedeutung in Österreich trotz starker Proteste aus allen Bevölkerungsteilen eingestellt. Eine bereits projektierte Elektrifizierung wurde nicht realisiert. Mehrere Initiativen streben mittlerweile den Wiederaufbau der Strecke an. 2011 waren schon 29 Gemeinden einem \\"Verein zur Förderung der RegionalStadtBahn\\" beigetreten, lediglich der Salzburger Bürgermeister Heinz Schaden legte keinen Wert auf öffentlichen Verkehr auf dieser Strecke., Geschichte., Anfänge., In der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts entwickelte sich das Salzkammergut zu einem Zentrum des Tourismus in Österreich-Ungarn. Das hohe Fremdenverkehrsaufkommen ließ den Wunsch nach einer Bahnverbindung zwischen dem Kurort Bad Ischl und der Landeshauptstadt Salzburg aufkommen. Bereits Ende der 1860er Jahre wurden erste Pläne für den Bau einer solchen Verbindung ausgearbeitet. Neben einer Abzweigung nach Mondsee war überdies die Errichtung einer Zahnradbahn auf den Schafberg und eines Hotels geplant. Die im Jahre 1873 einsetzende Rezession machte diese Vorhaben jedoch vorerst zunichte., 14 Jahre später legte Ing. Wilhelm Michael aus Wien ein Konzept für die Verwirklichung der bereits in den 1860er Jahren vorhandenen Pläne in Form einer Normalspurbahn vor. 1888 nahm er mit Ing. Josef Stern Kontakt auf, dem Mitgründer der Firma Stern &amp; Hafferl, die in der gesamten Monarchie Bahnprojekte plante und realisierte. Josef Stern übernahm die Planungen für das Bahnprojekt, die mehr als zwei Jahre andauerten. Um das Projekt verwirklichen zu können, mangelte es indes noch an Investoren. Da die Verhandlungen mit Wiener Geldinstituten scheiterten, nahm Josef Stern mit einem seiner früheren Arbeitgeber, dem Besitzer der Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft (LAG) in Bayern sowie den in Oberösterreich und im Bundesland Salzburg ansässigen Banken Kontakt auf und konnte diese für das Projekt gewinnen., Im Jahre 1889 ersuchte die eigens gegründete, nicht börsennotierte \\"Salzkammergut-Localbahn-Aktiengesellschaft\\" (SKGLB) um eine Konzession für die \\"„Errichtung einer schmalspurigen Localbahn von Bad Ischl nach Salzburg mit einer Abzweigung nach Mondsee“\\", die das Unternehmen am 13. Jänner 1890 erhielt. Die Bahngesellschaft verfügte über ein Aktienkapital von 1.600.000Gulden, das durch die Hauptaktionäre LAG und Stern &amp; Hafferl sowie mehrere andere Unternehmen und 140 Privatpersonen aufgebracht wurde. Aus Kostengründen entschied sich das Unternehmen für die schmalspurige Errichtung der Lokalbahn, deren Spurweite von der Militärbehörde auf die so genannte Bosnische Spurweite von 760mm festgelegt wurde. Neben hohen Fahrgastzahlen durch den großen Touristenanteil im Personenverkehr erwartete die Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn-Aktiengesellschaft darüber hinaus einen gewinnbringenden Güterverkehr durch die Erschließung des Waldreichtums der Region., Bahnbau und Eröffnung., Nach dem Kauf aller erforderlichen Grundstücke wurde im Frühjahr 1890 mit den Bauarbeiten begonnen, wobei die Gesamtbauleitung Josef Stern oblag. Die Errichtung der Bahn erfolgte in drei Etappen., Das erste, 9,6km lange, Teilstück zwischen \\"Bad Ischl Localbahnhof\\" und Strobl, welches durch weitgehend unkompliziertes Gelände im Tal der Ischl führte, konnte bereits am 5. August 1890 eröffnet werden. Für den Betrieb dieses Streckenabschnitts wurden die zwei leichten Dampflokomotiven Nr. 1 und 2, sieben Personenwaggons der 2.Klasse, zwei Güterwaggons, zwei Gepäckwagen und zwei Postwagen beschafft. Da Bad Ischl der Sommersitz von Kaiser Franz Joseph war, erfolgte überdies die Anschaffung eines Salonwagens für den Kaiser., Der erste Abschnitt der Bahn hatte seinen Ausgangspunkt beim \\"Localbahnhof\\" in Bad Ischl im Westen des Ortes. Mit dem Hauptbahnhof von Bad Ischl wurde die Lokalbahn erst später verbunden. Zwischen August und September verkehrten täglich acht Zugpaare, im Winter wochentags nur vier und samstags acht Zugpaare. Auf Grund des hohen Fremdenverkehrsaufkommens erhöhte die SKGLB die Anzahl der Zugpaare im Sommer 1891 auf neun., Am 28. Juli 1891 wurde der zweite, 31,6km lange Teil der Strecke zwischen Salzburg und Mondsee eröffnet. Für den Betrieb dieses längeren und anspruchsvoller trassierten Streckenabschnitts wurden drei leistungsstärkere Lokomotiven jener Bauart beschafft, die sich seit 1888 schon auf der Steyrtalbahn bewährt hatte (Loks 3 – 5). Dazu kamen 13 Personenwaggons (1. und 3. Klasse), zwei Gepäckwagen, zwei Postwagen und 14 Güterwaggons. Täglich verkehrten fünf Personenzüge und ein Güterzug auf dem neu errichteten Teilstück; im Winter waren täglich nur drei gemischte Züge unterwegs., Der Bau der letzten Etappe, des 22,4km langen Lückenschlusses zwischen St.Lorenz am Mondsee und Strobl, gestaltete sich wesentlich schwieriger, da die Bahn in diesem Abschnitt Gebirgsbahncharakter aufwies. So arbeitete Josef Stern bei der Ausführung von Trassenfreisprengungen und Durchstichen eng mit der bereits als Geldgeber involvierten Lokalbahn-Aktiengesellschaft aus München zusammen. Deren Mitdirektor Victor Krüzner persönlich leitete die schwierigen Bauarbeiten, die zwei Jahre in Anspruch nahmen. Das Verbindungsstück zwischen den beiden fertigen Teilstrecken wurde am 20. Juni 1893 in Anwesenheit von Kaiser Franz Joseph eröffnet. Die SKGLB beschaffte fünf weitere Lokomotiven der Steyrtalbahntype (6 – 10), 19 Personenwaggons (1. und 3. Klasse), und 42 Güterwaggons. Die Verbindung der Bahn mit dem Hauptbahnhof in Bad Ischl wurde am 3. Juli 1894 für den Betrieb freigegeben. Mit dem Abschluss der Bauarbeiten erlangte das Streckennetz der SKGLB seine maximale Ausdehnung. Eine projektierte Verlängerung des Mondseer Astes über Zell am Moos nach Straßwalchen wurde aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen nicht realisiert. Für die Gesamtstrecke mussten zwei Viadukte, 58 Brücken und fünf Tunnels errichtet werden, zudem waren 432 Straßen- und Wegübergänge zu berücksichtigen., Der fortan nicht mehr benötigte \\"Localbahnhof\\" in Bad Ischl wurde in Personalwohnungen und eine Remise umgebaut. Am 1. August 1893 wurden die Schafbergbahn und das Hotel am Schafberg eröffnet. Beide Einrichtungen gehörten ebenfalls der Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn-Aktiengesellschaft, die zu diesem Zeitpunkt über 10 Lokomotiven, 39 Personenwaggons, vier Gepäckwagen, vier Postwagen, 58 Güterwaggons und einen Salonwagen verfügte. Auch vier offene Sommerwagen gehörten ursprünglich zum Fuhrpark der SKGLB. Da diese 1890 beschafften Fahrzeuge keine Übergänge zu anderen Wagen hatten, mussten die Fahrgäste jedoch bei einsetzendem Regen bis zum nächsten Bahnhof ausharren, um in einen geschlossenen Wagen zu wechseln. Der Einsatz der Sommerwagen war durch das wechselhafte Klima des Salzkammergutes daher kaum zu planen und so wurden sie 1906 in herkömmliche geschlossene Reisezugwagen umgebaut.&lt;ref name=\\"Schmalspur 1/2002\\"&gt;Gerald Breitfuß: \\"Sommerwagen im Wandel der Zeit\\", Zeitschrift Schmalspur 1/2002, Wien 2002, S. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt;, Die Beförderungszahlen entwickelten sich stärker als erwartet. Im ersten Geschäftsjahr 1890/1891 wurden 140.767 Fahrgäste befördert. In den Jahren 1896 und 1897 musste die Strecke mehrmals wegen Hochwassers gesperrt werden. Im Jahre 1898 kaufte die SKGLB zudem die Dampfschifffahrt auf dem Wolfgangsee von den Erben des Unternehmensgründers., 1912 schlug Josef Stern die Elektrifizierung der Lokalbahn vor. Dieses Projekt scheiterte ebenso, wie die drei Jahre zuvor ausgearbeiteten Pläne zur Elektrifizierung der normalspurigen Salzkammergutbahn und ein bereits 1907 erstelltes erstes Projekt zur Elektrifizierung der SKGLB, am Widerstand des Militärs, das elektrische Lokomotiven bei Bedarf nicht auf den ausschließlich mit Dampf betriebenen Strecken in Bosnien und Herzegowina hätte einsetzen können., Kriegsjahre, Aufschwung und Krise., Der Erste Weltkrieg brachte zwar keinen Rückgang der Beförderungszahlen mit sich – die Fahrgastzahlen stiegen stetig an –, hingegen wirkte sich der Krieg negativ auf die Verfügbarkeit der Betriebsmittel der SKGLB aus. Zwischen 1915 und 1918 requirierte die Heeresverwaltung sechs Lokomotiven, die auf den strategisch wichtigen Schmalspurbahnen in Bosnien und der Herzegowina zum Einsatz kamen. Die Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn musste den Betrieb mit den verbliebenen sechs Lokomotiven abwickeln. Längst notwendige Modernisierungsmaßnahmen konnten nicht verwirklicht werden. Der stetig steigende Kohlen- und Personalmangel führte zu einer starken Einschränkung des Zugverkehrs. Am 14. und 15. Dezember 1917 kam es zur vollständigen Einstellung des Betriebs; fortan verkehrten täglich nur mehr zwei Zugpaare. Die eingezogenen Fahrzeuge kehrten nach Kriegsende nicht mehr vollzählig ins Salzkammergut zurück., Das Ende des Krieges brachte eine drastische Verschlechterung der Wirtschaftslage mit sich. Die Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn befand sich in großen finanziellen Schwierigkeiten. Sie schloss ein Übereinkommen mit dem Bund, wodurch die Lokalbahn ab dem 1. Dezember 1920 für vier Jahre von der Republik Österreich verwaltet und durch die damals \\"BBÖ\\" abgekürzten Staatsbahnen betrieben wurde. Diese konnten den Engpass bei den Fahrbetriebsmitteln durch den Einsatz eigener Schmalspurfahrzeuge verringern. Kurze Zeit später erfolgte der Verkauf aller zur SKGLB gehörenden Unternehmungen, die nicht direkt zum Kerngeschäft der Lokalbahn gehörten; nur das Hotel am Schafberg blie: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Bahnstrecke, Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn, Schmalspurbahn, 760mm Spurweite, Stern & Hafferl, Bad Ischl, Salzburg, Elektrifizierung, Wiederaufbau, Geschichte"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Operatives Therapieverfahren, Therapeutisches Verfahren in Orthopädie und Unfallchirurgie], Der Begriff Acetabuloplastik fasst verschiedene Operationstechniken zusammen, die –unter dem Oberbegriff der Beckenosteotomien– zur operativen Behandlung der Hüftdysplasie (HD) im Kindesalter Anwendung finden. Hierzu zählen einige technisch sehr ähnliche Operationen, wie zum Beispiel die Osteotomie nach Lance, nach Pemberton oder nach Dega., Die Salter-Osteotomie zählt –im weiteren Sinne– zwar auch zur Gruppe der Acetabuloplastiken, unterscheidet sich aber in der Vorgehensweise sehr von allen anderen Verfahren., Grundlagen., Das Becken, besser gesagt, das Hüftbein setzt sich aus drei Knochen zusammen, dem Darmbein, dem Schambein und dem Sitzbein. Während des Wachstums bleiben die Verbindungsstellen (Wachstumsfugen) zwischen den drei Knochen offen. Sie sind nur bindegewebig, später durch Knorpelgewebe flexibel miteinander verbunden und verknöchern erst zum Ende des knöchernen Wachstums. Die drei Wachstumsfugen treffen sich im späteren Zentrum der Hüftgelenkspfanne und bilden dort die Y-Fuge., Bei der Hüftdysplasie fehlt dem Hüftkopf die seitliche (laterale) und vordere (ventrale) Überdachung (auch \\"Pfannenerker\\" genannt). Der „zukünftige“ Hüftkopf wird nicht korrekt überdacht und droht –je nach Schweregrad der Dysplasie– nach oben abzurutschen und zu luxieren (auszurenken)., Das Prinzip der Acetabuloplastik macht sich die noch offene Y-Fuge zu Nutzen. Das Darmbein wird oberhalb der Pfanne so durchtrennt \\"(Osteotomie)\\", dass der seitliche Pfannenerker heruntergeschwenkt werden kann. Dreh- und Knickpunkt ist die Y-Fuge. Dieses Prinzip ist die Grundlage aller Techniken der Acetabuloplastik, lediglich die Vorgehensweise ist unterschiedlich., Ziel der Acetabuloplastik., Ziel dieser Operation ist es, den lateralen und ventralen Pfannenerker so wiederherzustellen, dass der Hüftkopf eine physiologische Überdachung findet. Je früher die Operation (bei gegebener Indikation) durchgeführt wird, desto größer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Hüftgelenk und Schenkelhals normal heranwachsen., Bemessen wird die laterale Überdachung am sogenannten \\"Acetabulumwinkel\\" (AC-Winkel) im Beckenübersichtsröntgenbild: Ein Winkel zwischen einer Horizontalen durch die Y-Fugen und einer Linie entlang des Pfannenerkers. Beim gesunden Neugeborenen beträgt der AC-Winkel etwa 25°, mit 6 Jahren etwa 15° und ab dem 12. Lebensjahr 11–12°. Entsprechend dieser physiologischen Werte sollte der AC-Winkel auch bei der Acetabuloplastik korrigiert werden. Man spricht von \\"anatomischer Rekonstruktion\\"., Indikationen und Kontraindikationen., Indikationen für eine Acetabuloplastik ist in erster Linie die Hüftdysplasie. Ein operatives Eingreifen wird notwendig, wenn die HD konservativ –also mit Spreizhose/-schiene, Spreizgips oder Repositionsgips– nicht mehr behandelbar ist oder diese Behandlungsmethoden fehlschlugen. Eine absolute Indikation zur Acetabuloplastik ist die nichtreponierbare (nicht wieder einzurichtende) Hüftluxation. Wenn die Indikation zur Acetabuloplastik gestellt ist, sollte die Operation so schnell wie möglich erfolgen., Die Operation kann beim Säugling schon ab dem ersten Lebensmonat durchgeführt werden, wenn keine anderen medizinischen Gründe dagegen sprechen. Empfohlen wird ein gelenkverbessernder operativer Eingriff ab einem Alter von rund eineinhalb Jahren, da erst dann die Ausbildung und Festigkeit des Knochens eine exakte und saubere Durchführung erlauben. Durch die in den meisten Fällen vorangehenden konservativen Maßnahmen kommt es ohnehin frühestens im zweiten Lebensjahr zur Operation. Milde Verlaufsformen der Hüftdysplasie weisen oft eine günstige Verlaufsform auf, weshalb in solchen Fällen meist mit einem operativen Behandlungsplan bis zum 3. Lebensjahr gewartet wird., Es gibt verschiedene Meinungen dazu, bis zu welchem Alter eine Acetabuloplastik durchgeführt werden kann. Entscheidend ist, dass die Y-Fuge noch offen sein muss, was die Operation noch in einem Alter von 12 oder 13 Jahren – also bis zum Verschluss der Y-Fuge – möglich macht. Bei später Erstdiagnose (6. Lebensmonat und älter) ist die Indikation zur direkten OP zwar gegeben, konservative Maßnahmen sollten jedoch, in Abhängigkeit von Befund und Schweregrad, dennoch erwogen werden., Als weitere Indikation ist der Morbus Perthes (frühkindliche Hüftkopfnekrose) zu erwähnen, wobei häufig die Methode nach Salter in Verbindung mit einer intertrochanteren Varisationsosteotomie (Einwärtskippung / Korrektur des Schenkelhalses mit dem Ziel der besseren Zentrierung des Hüftkopfes in der Hüftpfanne) zur Anwendung kommt. Bei seltenen, neurologischen Störungen (z.B. Infantile Zerebralparese), die zu einer Hüftdysplasie oder Hüftluxation führen, kommt die Acetabuloplastik ebenfalls zum Einsatz., Kontraindikationen sind fieberhafte Infektionen, entzündliche Prozesse im Bereich des Hüftgelenks oder des Beckenknochens und andere, bis dahin noch nicht abgeklärte Allgemeinbefunde. Bei geschlossener Y-Fuge, abgeschlossenem knöchernen Wachstum und stark verformtem Hüftkopf kann die Operation nicht mehr durchgeführt werden., Diagnostik und Diagnosestellung., Die Einzelheiten zur klinischen und bildgebenden Diagnostik der Hüftdysplasie beziehungsweise der Hüftluxation werden im Artikel Hüftdysplasie erläutert., Präoperativ werden sowohl zur genauen Beurteilung der Gelenkfehlstellung und des Schweregrades als auch zur Planung der Operation selbst konventionelle Röntgenbilder des Beckens, sogenannte \\"Beckenübersichtsaufnahmen\\" und \\"Rippstein-Aufnahmen\\", angefertigt. Die Rippstein-Aufnahmen dienen der genaueren Beurteilung der Schenkelhälse in einer seitlichen Projektion., Anästhesie., Die Operation wird in Vollnarkose mit Intubation oder Larynxmaske durchgeführt. Zur Schmerztherapie bekommen die Kinder schon vor der Operation ein Schmerzmittel – in Form eines Zäpfchens oder als Injektion – verabreicht., Operationsablauf., Im Falle der dysplastischen Hüftluxation kann als erstes eine Funktionsarthrographie des/der Hüftgelenke/s vorgenommen werden. Hier lässt sich das Luxationsverhalten und der Grad der Kapselüberdehnung/-verletzung im Röntgenbild genau bestimmen. Spätestens jetzt kann noch die Entscheidung getroffen werden, ob operiert werden muss oder nicht, und wenn ja, welches Verfahren zum Einsatz kommt., Technik der Acetabuloplastik., Bei allen Osteotomietechniken wird lediglich ein kleiner Zugang zwischen Leistenfalte und Beckenkamm benötigt. Die Muskulatur wird hier stumpf auseinandergedrängt und darunter das Darmbein dargestellt. Kurz oberhalb der Pfanne wird das Periost abgelöst und der Darmbeinknochen freigelegt., Osteotomie nach Pemberton., Bei Pemberton wird unter ständiger Röntgenkontrolle mit einem flachen Meißel das Darmbein etwa 5mm oberhalb des Pfannenerkers angekerbt und die Osteotomie in Richtung Y-Fuge vervollständigt. Nun wird das Pfannenfragment, ebenfalls unter Röntgenkontrolle, nach unten und gleichzeitig nach vorne geklappt. So wird eine möglichst anatomische Rekonstruktion der Pfanne erreicht., Osteotomie nach Dega., Dega führt die Osteotomie ebenfalls in Richtung Y-Fuge aus, benutzt dabei jedoch spezielle, gebogene Meißel, um eine möglichst sphärische –der Pfannenrundung angepasste– Ablösung des Fragmentes zu erzielen. Ursprünglich senkte Dega das Pfannenfragment nur seitlich ab, heute wird dies jedoch meistens mit einer zusätzlichen Ventral-Schwenkung (nach vorne) ähnlich der Pemberton-Methode modifiziert., Entsprechend dem so entstandenen Spalt wird bei beiden Vorgehensweisen ein passender Knochenkeil (Spenderknochen/Knochenbank, siehe unten) zurechtgesägt und unter Röntgenkontrolle in den Spalt eingestößelt. Der Keil kann wenn nötig mit einem Osteosynthese-Draht (auch Kirschner-Draht genannt) fixiert werden. Bei einem geübten Operateur dauert diese Operation in etwa fünfundvierzig bis sechzig Minuten., Im Anschluss an die Operation wird ein entsprechender Beckenbeingips (modifizierter Fettweiss-Gips) oder eine Abduktions-Orthese angelegt, damit der Hüftkopf während der postoperativen Heilung zentral in der Pfanne steht. Die Narkose wird erst im Anschluss daran beendet., Der Knochenkeil., Bei Kindern ist es nur schwer möglich, Eigenknochen im Sinne der Autologen (Knochen-)Transplantation zu verwenden. Bei gleichzeitiger intertrochantärer (zwischen den Knochenvorsprüngen am Oberschenkelknochen) Umstellung kann versucht werden, den abfallenden Korrekturkeil zu verwenden. In den meisten Fällen ist dieser jedoch zu klein., Heute werden vorwiegend Spenderknochen aus hauseigenen Knochenbanken oder von verschiedenen Herstellern benutzt. Es handelt sich hierbei meistens um Oberschenkelköpfe, die bei Endoprothesenoperationen entnommen und bei sonst gesunden Patienten und vorliegender Einverständniserklärung gespendet werden. Die Spenderknochen werden in zertifizierten Thermodesinfektionsgeräten desinfiziert und entproteinisiert. Anschließend werden sie in sterilen Gefäßen –bei mind. minus 20°C– kryokonserviert. Alternativ dazu ist es möglich, Spenderknochen im Autoklaven unter Einwirkung von gespanntem Wasserdampf zu sterilisieren. Auch andere Sterilisationsverfahren, zum Beispiel die Gammastrahlen-Sterilisation, werden bei der industriellen Knochenaufbereitung angewendet., Alle Aufbereitungs- und Desinfektions-/Sterilisationsverfahren sowie die Lagerung der Spenderknochen (Tiefkühlung) sind aufwändig und unterliegen strengen Auflagen der Bundesärztekammer, des Medizinproduktegesetzes (MPG) und des Robert Koch-Instituts., Sonderfälle., In seltenen sehr schweren Fällen lässt sich der Hüftkopf nicht mehr manuell (Overhead-Technik) reponieren (in die Normalstellung bringen). Der Hüftkopf ist so weit abgerutscht und die Gelenkkapsel so überdehnt und hypertrophiert, dass der Kopf sich nicht zurück in die Pfanne reponieren lässt. Häufig lagert sich überschießendes Kapselmaterial in die Pfanne ab und behindert die Reposition zusätzlich. In solchen Fällen muss der Hüftkopf offen, also unter Eröffnung des Gelenkes selbst, reponiert werden. Man spricht von „Offener Hüfteinstellung“. Dabei wird die Kapsel zirkulär eröffnet, überflüssiges Kapsel- und Gelenkschleimhautgewe: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Operatives Therapieverfahren, Therapeutisches Verfahren, Orthopädie, Unfallchirurgie, Acetabuloplastik, Beckenosteotomien, Hüftdysplasie, Operationstechniken, Operative Behandlung, Hüftgelenk"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Schienenfahrzeug (Spurweite 1524 mm), Straßenbahnfahrzeug (PTMS)], Die LM-49 () sind vom Wagonoremontny Sawod in Leningrad (WARS, heute Peterburgski Tramwajno-Mechanitscheski Sawod, Sankt Petersburg, Russland) gebaute Straßenbahntriebwagen. Die Abkürzung \\"LM\\" bedeutet \\"L\\"eningradski \\"M\\"otorny (, deutsch Leningrader Triebwagen), die Zahl \\"49\\" entspricht dem Entwicklungsjahr 1949. Gewöhnlich fuhren die Triebwagen im Zugverband mit den Beiwagen des Typs \\"LP-49\\", der antriebslosen Variante des LM-49. Der Buchstabe \\"P\\" steht für \\"Prizepnoi\\" (, deutsch Beiwagen). Die Minizüge aus Trieb- und Beiwagen wurden oft als \\"LM-/LP-49\\" bezeichnet. Beide Wagen waren Einrichtungsfahrzeuge und verkehrten nur auf Linien mit Wendeschleifen oder Gleisdreiecken an den Streckenenden., Aus technischer Sicht verband die Konstruktion der LM-49 sowohl fortschrittliche (z.u202fB. den tragenden Wagenkasten) als auch konservative Lösungen (z.u202fB. die Direktsteuerung mit handbetätigten Fahrschaltern). Das WARS produzierte beide Bauarten ab 1949. Die LM-49 wurden in der Fertigung 1960 durch die moderneren \\"LM-57\\"-Solotriebwagen ersetzt, die der Beiwagen lief bis 1968 weiter. Die Wagen wurden in Leningrad, Gorki, Minsk, Magnitogorsk und Nowokusnezk als Minizüge oder Solotriebwagen von 1949 bis 1987 eingesetzt. Sie galten als dauerhaft, sicher und zuverlässig, aber schwierig in der Bedienung., Seit Ende der 1970er-Jahre nahm die Führung der sowjetischen Verkehrsbetriebe die Fahrzeuge als veraltet außer Betrieb. Ihr technischer Zustand war noch recht gut, aber sie wurden zwangsweise durch den in Überfluss vorhandenen neuen Fuhrpark ersetzt. Die ausgemusterten Wagen wurden fast alle verschrottet und nur drei Trieb- und ein Beiwagen blieben als Museumsexponate oder als Denkmal erhalten., Geschichte., Voraussetzungen., Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg bedurfte der Leningrader Straßenbahnverkehrsbetrieb akut der Ergänzung seines Fuhrparkes. Der bedeutende Teil der Vorkriegsfahrzeuge wurde während der Blockade Leningrads durch Luftangriffe oder Artilleriebeschuss zerstört oder schwer beschädigt und die Reparatur der übrig gebliebenen Wagen war der erste Schritt beim Wiederaufbau des Betriebs. Von einigen vierachsigen \\"LM-33\\"-Trieb- und \\"LP-33\\"-Beiwagen waren nur die Bodenrahmen mit den Drehgestellen ohne den zerstörten Holzwagenkasten erhalten. Das WARS baute auf diese Bodenrahmen neue Wagenkästen in Stahlbauweise auf. Diese Umbauten wurden als \\"LM-47\\" (Triebwagen) und \\"LP-47\\" (Beiwagen) bezeichnet. Doch die Zahl der dafür nutzbaren beschädigten LM-/LP-33 war begrenzt, daher stellte sich für die Führung des Leningrader Verkehrsbetriebs die Frage nach der Entwicklung eines neuen Fahrzeuges. Auch zeigte die Praxis, dass die Aufbauwagen sehr schwer waren und so die erreichbare Geschwindigkeit und Beschleunigung unter den gewünschten Werten blieb., Entwicklung., Deshalb begannen im Jahr 1948 die Konstrukteure des WARS unter der Leitung von G.u202fI.u202fRomanow, T.u202fA.u202fSewastjanow, G.u202fA.u202fTitkow und W.u202fS.u202fStrischakow mit der Entwicklung eines neuen Straßenbahnfahrzeuges, das den Anforderungen seiner Zeit entsprechen sollte. Gefordert waren:, Die letzten zwei Forderungen widersprechen einander, weshalb die Konstrukteure einen Kompromiss zwischen hoher Nutzungsdauer und niedriger Leermasse suchen mussten., Dank des im sowjetischen Straßenbahnfahrzeugbau neuen Konzeptes mit selbsttragendem Wagenkasten gelang es dem Kollektiv der Konstrukteure, diese Aufgabe erfolgreich zu lösen. Alle vorherigen Typen aus sowjetischer Produktion waren entweder mit einem nicht- oder mittragendem Wagenkasten ausgeführt. Bei ersterem wurde der hölzerne Wagenkasten auf einen massiven Bodenrahmen aus schwerem Profilstahl aufgesetzt. Dieser Rahmen nahm alle mechanische Belastungen auf und nur er wirkte Verformungen entgegen. Die Konstruktion mit mittragendem Wagenkasten war fortschrittlicher, aber auch sie erforderte eine bedeutende Menge Metall, denn Dach und die Enden des Wagenkastens wirkten den Belastungen nicht entgegen. Der \\"LM-49\\" nutzte alle Vorteile eines dritten Konzepts– der selbsttragenden Konstruktion. Sein Wagenkasten war ein komplett geschweißtes Gerüst aus verschiedenen leichten Profilstählen. Weder der Bodenrahmen, noch die Eingangsbereiche, noch die Seiten des Wagenkastens hatten eine selbstständige Bedeutung bei der Sicherstellung der Steifigkeit, das Gerüst des Wagenkastens nahm die Kräfte als einheitliches Ganzes auf. Dank dieser Konstruktion wurde schwerer Profilstahl in geringerem Umfang verbaut als bei den Vorkriegswagen, was die Leermasse des LM-49 auf 19,5u202fTonnen verringerte. Im Vergleich dazu wog der Vorkriegswagen dieser Klasse LM-33 mit Holzwagenkasten leer noch 21,3u202fTonnen. Um eine hohe Nutzungsdauer zu erreichen, wurde der Profilstahl des Wagenkastens mit Aluminiumlack gestrichen und an sehr wichtigen Stellen verchromt., Die größtmögliche Kapazität des neuen Straßenbahnfahrzeuges wurde durch maximale Nutzung der zulässigen Fahrzeugumgrenzungslinie für einen vierachsigen Wagen mit zwei Drehgestellen erreicht. Die Länge des LM-49 liegt damit bei 15u202f400u202fmm, die Breite beträgt etwa 2550u202fmm. Für das bequeme Ein- und Aussteigen der Fahrgäste wurden erstmals im sowjetischen Straßenbahnwagenbau einteilige Schiebetüren mit pneumatischem Antrieb zum Öffnen und Schließen wie bei U-Bahn-Wagen verwendet. Diese Konstruktion der Türen erforderte besondere Eigenschaften des Wagenkastens – man musste die Türtaschen ohne Beeinträchtigung der Festigkeitseigenschaften der Kastenstruktur im Bereich der Türportale vorsehen., Da dieser Wagenkasten der erste in der Sowjetunion konstruierte selbsttragende Wagenkasten war, hatten die Konstrukteure keine empirischen Formeln zur Berechnung seiner Widerstandsfähigkeit. Diese Formeln waren früher ein Hauptinstrument in der Projektierung der Fahrzeuge mit nichttragendem Wagenkasten gewesen. Darum wurde der erste gebaute LM-49 für elektrotensometrische Tests der Haltbarkeit des tragenden Wagenkastens genutzt. Sie zeigten die guten Reserven in der Widerstandsfähigkeit und gaben den Entwicklern Erfahrungsdaten. Das erlaubte die folgenden Straßenbahnfahrzeuge nicht blindlings, sondern unter Verwendung der vorhandenen Kenntnisse beim Aufbau des LM-49 zu erarbeiten., Ein Teil der elektrischen Ausrüstung und der Konstruktion der Drehgestelle wurden von den Vorkriegswagen \\"LM-33\\" übernommen. Noch ein Fortschritt war der Verzicht auf den Tatzlagerantrieb im Drehgestell im Jahr 1950. Die neue Variante des Drehgestelles besaß am Drehgestellrahmen aufgehängte Fahrmotoren, damit diese zur gefederten Masse gehörten und deren Stoßbelastung verringert wurde. Der erste Teil der gebauten \\"LM-49\\" wurde noch mit der frühen Variante des Drehgestells mit nur teilweise abgefederten Tatzlagermotoren ausgestattet., Die Verbesserung des Fahrkomforts der Fahrgäste und die Erleichterung der Arbeit des Wagenführers wurde größtenteils der zukünftigen Entwicklungsarbeit überlassen. Trotz der Verwendung von gummigefederten Radsätzen und Schützensteuerung im Vorkriegsversuchszug \\"LM-/LP-36\\", wurden die Serienfahrzeuge \\"LM-/LP-49\\" mit herkömmlichen Radsätzen und handbetätigten Fahrschaltern ausgestattet. Die Räder wurden aus vollständig gegossenen Radscheiben und aufgeschrumpften Radreifen zusammengesetzt. Die Steuerung erfolgte direkt, der Fahrzeugführer schaltete durch einen Fahrschalter unmittelbar die Motorstromkreise. Im Ergebnis war die Fahrt wegen der zweistufig gefederten Drehgestelle von bedeutendem Lärm begleitet und die Fahrzeugführer mussten mit der schweren Kurbel des Direktsteuerungs-Fahrschalters arbeiten., Serienproduktion., Nach den erfolgreichen Tests des Prototyps wurde die Serienproduktion der LM-49 im Jahr 1949 begonnen. Sie dauerte bis einschließlich 1960. Die Fertigung der Nachfolgebauart \\"LM-57\\" begann im Jahr 1958 im WARS. Die Fertigung der LM-49 wurde erst zwei Jahren danach eingestellt, da die LM-57 viele Kinderkrankheiten aufwiesen und ihr Bau zusätzlich Umrüstungen der Produktionsanlagen (einige neue Maschinen, Einrichtung des Arbeitsablaufs, Weiterbildung des Personals) erforderte. Die Fertigung der Beiwagen LP-49 wurde ebenfalls im Jahr 1960 gestoppt, sie wurde allerdings im Jahr 1965 wieder aufgenommen und dauerte bis einschließlich 1968. Diese Wiederaufnahme hatte zwei Gründe:, Die früher gefertigten LM-49-Solotriebwagen konnten den Verkehr auf den Straßenbahnlinien mit hohem Fahrgastaufkommen nicht bewältigen, so dass sie mit Beiwagen eingesetzt werden mussten. In den Jahren 1967–1968 entwickelte WARS mit den \\"LM-68\\" die nächste Triebwagenbauart, die mit einer Vielfachsteuerung ausgerüstet wurde. Faktisch beendete dies die Ära der „klassischen“ Straßenbahnzüge aus Trieb- und Beiwagen in der UdSSR. Ab 1969 wurden in den sowjetischen Waggonbaufabriken keine Beiwagen mehr gefertigt. Der LP-49 waren damit die letzten sowjetischen Serienbeiwagen. Ihre Produktion lief zugunsten der Fertigung der LM-68 aus., Insgesamt fertigte das WARS 400 LM-49 und 375 LP-49., Betriebseinsatz., Die meisten produzierten LM-/LP-49 verkehrten in Leningrad. Daneben wurden diese Fahrzeuge als erster Typ der in Leningrad gefertigten Wagen auch an andere Städte geliefert: Seit 1958 nach Gorki, Nowokusnezk und Magnitogorsk. Ein LM-49 war im Jahr 1959 ein Geschenk für die Minsker Bevölkerung. Im Jahr 1965 wurden alle LM- und LP-49 aus Nowokusnezk nach Gorki umgesetzt., Ende der 1970er, Anfang der 1980er-Jahre wurden die LM- und LP-49 ausgemustert, obwohl ihr technischer Zustand einen Weiterbetrieb ermöglicht hätte. Aber die Führung des Minschilkomchos der UdSSR (russisch \\"Минжилкомхоз\\" – Abkürzung für министерство жилищно-коммунального хозяйства, Ministerium der Wohnungs- und Kommunalwirtschaft) bestand auf der Erneuerung des Fuhrparkes hin zu moderneren Fahrzeugen. Dies war der Hauptgrund für die Verschrottung vieler äußerst haltbarer Straßenbahnfahrzeuge der Stalin-Ära., Leningrad., In Leningrad erhielten die LM- und LP-49 Wagennummern von 3601 bis 3999, ungerade Nummern für: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Schienenfahrzeug, Straßenbahnfahrzeug, LM-49, Wagonoremontny Sawod, Leningrad, LP-49, Triebwagen, Beiwagen, selbsttragender Wagenkasten, Tragfahrzeug"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Absolvent der Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Atheistischer Humanist, Deutscher, Erkenntnistheoretiker, Geboren 1804, Gestorben 1872, Hochschullehrer (Erlangen), Junghegelianer, Ludwig Feuerbach, Mann], Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach (* 28. Juli 1804 in Landshut, Kurfürstentum Bayern; † 13. September 1872 in Rechenberg bei Nürnberg) war ein deutscher Philosoph und Anthropologe, dessen Religions- und Idealismuskritik bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Bewegung des Vormärz hatte und einen Erkenntnisstandpunkt formulierte, der für die modernen Humanwissenschaften, wie zum Beispiel die Psychologie und Ethnologie, grundlegend geworden ist. Er sah Religion als Anthropologie an und vertrat eine Ethik des Diesseits., Leben., Herkunft, Familie., Ludwig Feuerbachs Vater war der aus Frankfurt am Main stammende Rechtsgelehrte Paul Johann Anselm von Feuerbach (1775–1833, 1808 geadelt), der als einer der bedeutendsten Juristen der neueren Zeit in Deutschland und insbesondere als Begründer des modernen deutschen Strafrechts gilt. Wenige Wochen vor Ludwigs Geburt hatte er an der Bayerischen Landesuniversität in Landshut einen Lehrstuhl übernommen. Im Jahr 1806 wurde er in die Regierung nach München berufen, um das Strafrecht zu modernisieren. Noch im selben Jahr erreichte er für Bayern die Abschaffung der Folter, 1813 trat das von ihm ausgearbeitete Bayerische Strafgesetzbuch in Kraft. Nach einem Zwischenspiel in Bamberg war er von 1817 bis zu seinem Tod 1833 Präsident des Appellationsgerichts Ansbach, wo er sich auch mit dem Fall Kaspar Hauser befasste., Ludwigs Mutter, geb. Eva Wilhelmine Tröster (* 1774 in Dornburg/Saale, † 1852 in Nürnberg), stammte aus bescheidenen Verhältnissen, hatte allerdings hochadelige Vorfahren: Ihr Großvater väterlicherseits war ein außerehelicher Sohn von Ernst August I., Herzog von Sachsen-Weimar, sie war also eine Cousine zweiten Grades von Großherzog Carl August, dem Freund und Förderer Goethes. Sie hatte nur eine Dorfschule besucht, war jedoch vielfältig interessiert, auch am Werk ihres Sohnes Ludwig, dessen Religionskritik sie teilte. Sie war nach dem Zeugnis einer jüngeren Verwandten „bis ins hohe Alter eine gewinnende Erscheinung, von seltener Herzensgüte und Sanftmut“., Ludwig Feuerbach hatte vier Brüder und drei Schwestern, die vielfältige Begabungen zeigten:, Alle Brüder Ludwigs engagierten sich in ihrer Studienzeit in der Burschenschaftsbewegung, die in der ersten Zeit nach den Befreiungskriegen die einzige einigermaßen zielgerichtete Opposition gegen die Restauration darstellte. Anselm und Eduard gehörten vermutlich, Karl erwiesenermaßen, dem geheimen Jünglingsbund an, zu dessen Zielen eine republikanische Verfassung und Bürgerfreiheiten in einem geeinten Deutschland gehörten. Auch beim jungen Ludwig Feuerbach sind Sympathien für die studentische Bewegung belegt; eine aktive Beteiligung ist nicht nachweisbar., Kindheit, Jugend, Studium., Als Zweijähriger kam Ludwig Feuerbach nach München, wo er später die Elementarschule besuchte. Freundschaften seines Vaters brachten es mit sich, dass in der Familie etliche der Geistesgrößen des damaligen München verkehrten, unter ihnen der Philosoph Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi sowie die beiden Erneuerer des bayerischen Schulwesens, Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer und Friedrich Thiersch. Nach der Versetzung des Strafrechtlers nach Bamberg besuchte Ludwig dort die Oberprimärschule. 1816 trennten sich die Eltern für mehrere Jahre. Die Brüder Friedrich, Ludwig und Eduard zogen mit dem Vater nach Ansbach, die drei Schwestern blieben einstweilen bei der Mutter in Bamberg., Nachdem Ludwig Feuerbach sich schon in der Gymnasialzeit in Ansbach intensiv mit Theologischem beschäftigt und dafür beim örtlichen Rabbiner Hebräisch-Unterricht genommen hatte, begann er 1823 in Heidelberg ein protestantisches Theologiestudium. Von der rationalistischen Theologie, die in Heidelberg von Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob Paulus gelehrt wurde, fühlte er sich heftig abgestoßen, doch der mit Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel befreundete Carl Daub machte ihn auf die Philosophie aufmerksam. 1824 ging er nach Berlin, wo er gegen den Widerstand des Vaters das Studienfach wechselte: Zwei Jahre lang hörte er sämtliche Vorlesungen, die Hegel in dieser Zeit hielt, die \\"Logik\\" sogar zweimal. Da er als Stipendiat des bayerischen Königs das Studium an einer Landesuniversität abzuschließen hatte, kehrte er 1826 nach Bayern zurück. Nach einem Jahr privater Studien in Philologie, Literatur und Geschichte belegte er in Erlangen Botanik, Anatomie und Physiologie und schrieb gleichzeitig seine Dissertation mit dem Titel: \\"Über die Unendlichkeit, Einheit und Allgemeinheit der Vernunft\\". Im Juni 1828 promovierte er in Philosophie; am Ende desselben Jahres folgte die Habilitation. Wenige Wochen danach begann er, als unbesoldeter Privatdozent in Erlangen zu lehren., Erlangen, Bruckberg, die ersten Werke., Die akademische Karriere verbaute sich Feuerbach durch die anonyme Erstlingsschrift \\"Gedanken über Tod und Unsterblichkeit\\". Sie erschien 1830 kurz nach dem Ausbruch der Unruhen, die im Gefolge der Pariser Julirevolution zwei Jahre lang auch ganz Deutschland erschütterten und im Hambacher Fest gipfelten. Wegen ihres religionskritischen Inhalts wurde die Schrift sofort verboten und der Verfasser polizeilich ermittelt. Im Frühjahr 1832 brach Feuerbach seine Vorlesungstätigkeit unvermittelt ab., Auf der Suche nach Alternativen schrieb er die Aphorismensammlung \\"Abälard und Héloïse oder Der Schriftsteller und der Mensch\\" sowie die \\"Geschichte der neuern Philosophie von Bacon von Verulam bis Benedict Spinoza\\". Letztere trug ihm die Einladung der hegelianischen „Societät für wissenschaftliche Kritik“ zur Mitarbeit an ihren „Jahrbüchern“ ein. Zwei der gelieferten Beiträge erregten Aufsehen: Der eine griff mit dem konservativen Staatsrechtler Friedrich Julius Stahl einen herausragenden Theoretiker der Restauration an. Der andere, veranlasst durch eine Polemik des Kantianers C.Fr. Bachmann gegen die Hegelschule, geriet zur Rechtfertigungsschrift der idealistischen Philosophie überhaupt. Weil der Aufsatz wegen seiner Länge von den „Jahrbüchern“ nur auszugsweise akzeptiert wurde, veröffentlichte Feuerbach ihn als eigenständige Schrift unter dem Titel \\"Kritik des „Anti-Hegels“. Eine Einleitung in das Studium der Philosophie\\"., Im Wintersemester 1835/36 hielt Feuerbach noch einmal Vorlesungen in Erlangen, dann nahm er endgültig Abschied vom universitären Lehrbetrieb. Im ländlichen Bruckberg nahe Ansbach hatte er den ihm zuträglichen Ort gefunden. Seine Geliebte Bertha Löw, die 1837 seine Ehefrau wurde, war dort Mitinhaberin einer Porzellanmanufaktur, die im ehemals markgräflichen Jagdschloss untergebracht war. Die kleine Fabrik warf zwar nur bescheidene Gewinne ab, bot aber freies Wohnrecht und umfangreiche Naturaliennutzung. 1839 wurde die erste Tochter „Lorchen“ geboren, 1842 die zweite, die jedoch sehr früh starb. Das einfache, aber insgesamt sorglose Leben auf dem Land entsprach Feuerbachs persönlichem Geschmack, und die völlige Freiheit von allen akademischen Rücksichten wurde, wie er selbst bekannte, zum „archimedischen Punkt“ in seinem philosophischen Entwicklungsgang., In Bruckberg trieb Feuerbach zunächst ausgiebig naturkundliche Studien und schrieb einen zweiten, ausschließlich Leibniz und dessen Monadentheorie gewidmeten Band seiner Geschichte der neueren Philosophie., Die epochemachende Religionskritik., Eine Verlagerung der Aufmerksamkeit brachte im Herbst 1837 Arnold Ruges Einladung zur Mitarbeit an den \\"Hallischen Jahrbüchern\\", dem ab 1. Januar 1838 erscheinenden publizistischen Sammelbecken der Junghegelianer: Die Zeitung bot Feuerbach ein willkommenes Forum, um in die geistig-ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen der Restaurationszeit einzugreifen. Er tat es mit einer Reihe von Rezensionen und Aufsätzen, von denen einige zu seinen wichtigsten Schriften zählen, so \\"Zur Kritik der positiven Philosophie \\" (1838) und \\"Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Philosophie\\" (1839). An der Debatte um den Kölner Bischofsstreit wollte er sich mit einer umfangreichen Stellungnahme beteiligen. Als der Abdruck in den \\"Hallischen Jahrbüchern\\" nach zwei Folgen von der Zensur verboten wurde, veröffentlichte er sie insgesamt als eigenständige Schrift unter dem Titel \\"Über Philosophie und Christentum in Beziehung auf den der Hegelschen Philosophie gemachten Vorwurf der Unchristlichkeit\\". Gleichzeitig schrieb er eine Monographie über den Begründer der französischen Aufklärung, Pierre Bayle, die zum persönlichen Bekenntnisbuch wurde (1839)., Die heftige Polemik gegen die als rückwärtsgewandt und unredlich kritisierte „Christentümelei“ der Restauration veranlasste ihn, dem Phänomen Religion auf den Grund zu gehen. Zwei Jahre lang, von 1839 bis 1841, arbeitete er am Hauptwerk \\"Das Wesen des Christentums\\". Das Buch erschien im Frühjahr 1841 im Verlag Otto Wigand in Leipzig und machte Feuerbach schlagartig berühmt. Im selben Jahr entstanden sechs weitere Polemiken und Artikel; sie erschienen zunächst in den \\"Hallischen Jahrbüchern\\" und, als diese zensurhalber umbenannt und nach Dresden verlegt wurden, im Nachfolgeorgan \\"Deutsche Jahrbücher für Wissenschaft und Kunst\\". Zum größeren Teil sind sie Erläuterungen seiner Religionskritik und Erwiderungen auf inzwischen erschienene Kritiken des \\"Wesens des Christentums\\". In \\"Zur Beurteilung der Schrift: Das Wesen des Christentums\\" wird bereits deutlich, dass sich Feuerbach während der Arbeit an seinem Hauptwerk auch von Hegel gelöst hat., In den Anfang 1842 geschriebenen, wegen des Verbots durch die Zensur allerdings erst im Herbst 1843 erschienenen \\"Vorläufigen Thesen zur Reformation der Philosophie\\" entwickelte Feuerbach erstmals seine berühmt gewordene Kritik der spekulativ-idealistischen Philosophie. Im darauffolgenden Winterhalbjahr arbeitete er diese Kritik systematisch aus in \\"Grundsätze der Philosophie der Zukunft\\". Danach konzentrierte er sich wieder auf die Fortführung der Religionskritik: Im Sommer 1843 hatte er sich intensiv mit Luther beschäftigt und daraufhin \\"Das Wesen des Glaubens im Sinne Luthers\\" geschrieben, wo er anhand von Zitaten aufzeigte, dass seine Sicht des Christentums schon beim großen Reformator angelegt gewesen sei. Zwei Jahre lang arbeitete er dann an einer Schrift, die in ihrer ersten Fassung weniger als achtzig Seiten stark ist: \\"Das Wesen der Religion\\". In ihr fließen Religionskritik und weltanschaulicher Materialismus erstmals explizit zusammen., Seit dem Erscheinen des \\"Wesens des Christentums\\" war auch Feuerbachs Privatleben wesentlich bewegter als zuvor. Er ging häufiger auf Reisen: Im Sommer verbrachte er regelmäßig einige Wochen bei Christian Kapp in Heidelberg. Im Hause dieses Freundes entspann sich die bekannte Liebesaffäre mit der Tochter Johanna Kapp: Sie verliebte s: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Ludwig Feuerbach, Erkenntnistheoretiker, Anthropologe, Vormärz, Religionskritik, Humanwissenschaften, Philosoph, Hochschullehrer, Junghegelianer, Atheistischer Humanist"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Deutscher, Ehrenbürger von Düsseldorf, Geboren 1827, Gestorben 1905, Hochschullehrer (Kunstakademie Düsseldorf), Landschaftsmaler, Maler (Düsseldorf), Maler der Romantik, Mann, Mitglied der Ehrenlegion (Ritter)], Wilhelm Oswald Gustav Achenbach (* 2. Februar 1827 in Düsseldorf; † 1. Februar 1905 ebenda) war ein deutscher Maler, welcher der Düsseldorfer Malerschule zugerechnet wird. Zu seinen Lebzeiten zählte er zu den bedeutenden Landschaftsmalern Europas und prägte während seiner Lehrtätigkeit die Düsseldorfer Kunstakademie. Sein Bruder war der zwölf Jahre ältere Andreas Achenbach, der gleichfalls zu den bedeutenden deutschen Landschaftsmalern des 19. Jahrhunderts zu rechnen ist. Die beiden Brüder wurden scherzhaft auch das „A und O der Landschaftsmalerei“ genannt., Leben., Familie., Oswald Achenbach wurde als fünftes von zehn Kindern in Düsseldorf geboren. Seine Eltern waren der Kaufmann Hermann Achenbach (1783–1849) und dessen Ehefrau Christine, geborene Zilch (1797–1868). Wenig ließ darauf schließen, dass aus der Familie zwei für das 19. Jahrhundert wichtige Maler hervorgehen würden. Hermann Achenbach war in einer Reihe unterschiedlicher Berufe tätig. Er war zunächst Bier- und Essigbrauer, besaß zwischenzeitlich einen Gasthof in Düsseldorf und arbeitete später als Buchhalter. Noch während Achenbachs früher Kindheit zog die Familie nach München um, wo Oswald Achenbach zumindest für kurze Zeit die Grundschule besuchte. Zu welchem Zeitpunkt die Familie wieder nach Düsseldorf zurückkehrte, ist nicht überliefert, sie zog jedoch um 1844 in das Haus Altestadt 1., Das Verhältnis zu seinem Bruder Andreas, wie er ein bekannter Maler, war offenbar gestört. Emil Hünten und Anton von Werner versuchten einmal, ihn zu einem Trinkspruch auf den Bruder zu bewegen, doch Oswald Achenbach lehnte ab., Die frühen Jahre., Schüler der Düsseldorfer Kunstakademie., Achenbach wurde bereits 1835, im Alter von acht Jahren, in die Elementarklasse der Düsseldorfer Kunstakademie aufgenommen. Dies entsprach eigentlich nicht den Statuten dieser Einrichtung, die ein Mindestalter von zwölf Jahren vorsahen. Achenbach blieb bis 1841 an der Akademie., Bis auf ein Jahr in der Architekturklasse war er Schüler der Elementarklasse, in der die Grundlagen des Zeichnens unterrichtet wurden. Auch dies entsprach nicht dem normalen Lehrplan. Aus welchen Gründen Oswald Achenbach anders behandelt wurde als es die Statuten vorsahen, lässt sich heute nicht mehr nachvollziehen. Möglicherweise galten die Statuten nur als Rahmenrichtlinie und für zeichnerisch Hochbegabte wie Achenbach wurde eine Ausnahme gemacht., Aus welchem Grund Oswald Achenbach 1841 die Düsseldorfer Akademie wieder verließ, ist nicht geklärt. Aufgrund seiner Skizzenbücher weiß man, dass er zu dieser Zeit intensivere Naturstudien in der Gegend um Düsseldorf betrieb. Mechthild Potthoff hat in ihrer Dissertation über Achenbach die These aufgestellt, dass sein Austritt erfolgte, weil er mit dem starren akademischen Lehrbetrieb zunehmend unzufrieden wurde., Die ersten größeren Reisen., 1843 folgte eine mehrmonatige Reise des erst 16-jährigen Achenbach nach Oberbayern und Nordtirol, während der er seine Naturstudien fortsetzte. Aus dieser Zeit stammen auch die frühesten bekannten Arbeiten in Öl. Auch die Reise nach Oberitalien, die Achenbach mit seinem Freund und späteren Schüler Albert Flamm im Sommer 1845 unternahm, diente der Fortsetzung dieser Studien. Von diesem Zeitpunkt an zeigen die Gemälde, die Achenbach schuf, überwiegend italienische Landschaftsmotive., Von den Werken, die Achenbach bis 1850 malte, sind nur wenige erhalten geblieben. In diesen zeigt sich, dass er sowohl in der Wahl seiner Motive als auch in seiner Maltechnik noch stark von dem Kunstverständnis geprägt war, das zu dieser Zeit an den Kunstakademien gelehrt wurde. Der malerische Einfluss von Johann Wilhelm Schirmer und Carl Rottmann ist in diesen Bildern noch erkennbar. In den Ölstudien, die Achenbach während dieser Reisen schuf, hielt er vorwiegend Landschaftsansichten fest und befasste sich detailliert mit der für Italien typischen Vegetation. Eine weit geringere Rolle spielen Architekturmotive oder Figurenstudien., Achenbach und das kulturelle Leben in Düsseldorf., Bis weit ins 19. Jahrhundert hinein war die künstlerische Ausbildung von den Kunstakademien geprägt. Diese Kunstakademien waren jedoch insbesondere im 19. Jahrhundert zu einem formelhaften und starren Ausbildungsbetrieb geworden, die auf neuere künstlerische Richtungen nicht reagierten. Die Kunstakademien arrangierten auch die großen Kunstausstellungen, über die Künstler vorrangig ihre Werke verkauften. Künstler, die in ihrem Kunststil in Widerspruch zu der akademischen Kunstauffassung standen, wurden dort nicht ausgestellt und hatten in der Regel weitaus geringere Möglichkeiten, ihre Werke zu verkaufen. Von Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts an standen einzelne Künstler und Vertreter ganzer Kunstrichtungen in Opposition zur akademischen Kunstauffassung. Auch Achenbach zählte zu den Künstlern, die der Düsseldorfer Kunstakademie kritisch gegenüberstanden, und wurde sehr früh Mitglied zweier Düsseldorfer Vereine, denen sich viele gleichgesinnte Künstler angeschlossen hatten. Dies war der „Verein der Düsseldorfer Künstler zu gegenseitiger Unterstützung und Hilfe“ sowie der Künstlerverein „Malkasten“, der am 11. August 1848 gegründet wurde. Zu den Unterzeichnern der Gründungsschrift des Malkastens gehörte Achenbach. Zum Vereinszweck des „Malkastens“ gehörte es, unterschiedlichste Künstler zusammenzubringen und zu fördern. Man inszenierte gemeinsam Theaterstücke, veranstaltete Musikabende und Ausstellungen. An vielen Veranstaltungen war Achenbach aktiv beteiligt, führte Regie, trat selber auf oder inszenierte Theaterstücke. Insbesondere dem Verein „Malkasten“ blieb Achenbach bis zum Ende seines Lebens verbunden., Ab 1850 waren seine Gemälde in den Ausstellungen der neu gegründeten Düsseldorfer Galerie Eduard Schulte vertreten. Dort wurden anfangs bevorzugt Werke von Künstlern ausgestellt, die sich als von der Kunstakademie Düsseldorf unabhängig verstanden. An Achenbachs wirtschaftlichem Erfolg als Maler hatte diese Galerie wesentlichen Anteil, da sie sich zu einer der führenden deutschen Galerien entwickelte und später Niederlassungen auch in Berlin und Köln unterhielt. Wohnhaft war er zu dieser Zeit quasi um die Ecke auf der Ratinger Straße., Die erste große Italienreise., In den Sommermonaten 1850 unternahm Achenbach erneut eine Reise nach Italien, die ihn nach Nizza, Genua und Rom führte. Gemeinsam mit Albert Flamm reiste er von Rom aus in die Umgebung der italienischen Hauptstadt und besuchte vor allem die Orte, die schon vor ihm Landschaftsmaler zu Bildern angeregt hatten. Während dieser Reise lernte er unter anderem Arnold Böcklin, Ludwig Thiersch und Heinrich Dreber näher kennen und verbrachte mit ihnen längere Zeit in Olevano. Thiersch hat überliefert, wie unterschiedlich diese Künstler die Eindrücke der Landschaft verarbeiteten. Während Dreber sorgfältige Bleistiftzeichnungen anfertigte, ließ Böcklin tagelang die Umgebung nur auf sich wirken und hielt in seinem Skizzenbuch lediglich wenige Details fest. Achenbach und Flamm malten dagegen ihre Ölskizzen direkt in der freien Natur. Die erhalten gebliebenen Skizzen von Achenbach zeigen, dass er sich weniger für Details interessierte, sondern sich auf die charakteristischen Farben und Formen sowie die Licht- und Schattenverteilungen konzentrierte. Den farblichen Eindruck der italienischen Landschaft setzte er künstlerisch um, indem er Farbschichten in unterschiedlicher Pigmentdichte und Pastosität übereinander setzte, um so den gewünschten Ton zu finden., Heirat mit Julie Arnz und erste internationale Auszeichnungen., Am 3. Mai 1851 heiratete Achenbach Julie Arnz (1827–1896), mit der er seit 1848 verlobt war. Julie war die Tochter des Düsseldorfer Verlagsbuchhändlers und Druckereibesitzers Heinrich Arnz (1785–1854, Arnz &amp; Comp.). Dieser verlegte unter anderem die \\"Düsseldorfer Monathefte\\", für die Achenbach satirische Blätter schuf, und das \\"Düsseldorfer Monatsalbum\\", zu dem Achenbach Illustrationen zu Gedichten und Liedern ebenso beisteuerte wie Lithografien seiner Gemälde. In derselben Zeit begann er, die ersten Schüler privat in Landschaftsmalerei zu unterrichten. Hierzu nutzte er sein Atelier im Palais Spinrath an der Ratinger Straße. Zwischen 1852 und 1857 wurden die vier Töchter des Paars geboren: Clara Catharina Louise (1852–1938), Henriette Maria (* 1853), Hedwig Anna (* 1855) und Caecilie Maria Ottilie (1857–1925). Der einzige Sohn des Ehepaars Benno kam 1861 zur Welt., Bis zum Jahre 1864 bewohnten die Achenbachs eine Wohnung, Ecke Schadow- und Viktoriastraße, mit einem Gartenhaus, genannt das „Vogelhaus“, in dem sich das Atelier befand, das auch dem Unterricht seiner Privatschüler diente. An der Goltsteinstraße 9 ließ Achenbach für sich und seine Familie ein Haus erbauen, in dem sein Atelier in der ersten Etage lag, dieses mit Balkon und Blick in den Hofgarten., Achenbach war zu dieser Zeit als Maler bereits weit über die Grenzen Deutschlands hinaus bekannt. 1852 nahm die Kunstakademie in Amsterdam den erst 25-Jährigen als Ehrenmitglied auf. Auf der Weltausstellung in Paris 1855, bei der er mit mehreren Gemälden vertreten war, wurde er ausgezeichnet. 1859 ehrte man ihn im Pariser Salon mit einer Goldenen Medaille, und 1861 verlieh ihm die St. Petersburger Akademie die Ehrenmitgliedschaft. 1862 erhielt er dieselbe Auszeichnung durch die Kunstakademie in Rotterdam., Professor für Landschaftsmalerei., Im März 1863 erhielt Achenbach die Professur für Landschaftsmalerei an der Kunstakademie, die bis 1872 im Düsseldorfer Schloss und Galerie untergebracht war. Die Annahme bedeutete für Achenbach einen gesellschaftlichen Aufstieg und gleichzeitig finanzielle Sicherheit. Sie scheint jedoch auch in Widerspruch zu seiner vorherigen Opposition zu dieser Einrichtung zu stehen. Seit Wilhelm von Schadow im Jahr 1859 das Amt des Direktors niedergelegt hatte, hatten sich allerdings die Auseinandersetzungen sowohl innerhalb der Kunstakademie als auch die zwischen der Akademie und den sich von ihr als unabhängig verstehenden Künstlern verringert. Die Berufung Achenbachs auf einen Lehrstuhl für Landschaftsmalerei war außerdem bewusste Politik durch die neue Direktion der Düsseldorfer Kunstakademie, um eine Versöhnung mit den von der Akademie unabhängigen Künst: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Wilhelm Achenbach, Düsseldorfer Malerschule, Landschaftsmaler, Romantik, Lehrer, Italienreise, Malkasten, Galerie Schulte, Julie Arnz, Professor."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Dampflokomotive Achsfolge 2C1, Schienenfahrzeug (Crewe Works), Schienenfahrzeug (Spurweite 1435 mm), Triebfahrzeug (London, Midland and Scottish Railway)], Die Dampflokomotiven der LMS-Klasse 7P „Coronation“ (; teilweise auch als \\"Princess Coronation Class\\", \\"Coronation Scot Class\\", \\"Duchess Class\\" oder \\"City Class\\" bezeichnet) wurden zwischen 1937 und 1948 mit insgesamt 38 Stück von der britischen Bahngesellschaft London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) beschafft. Die für den Expresszugdienst vorgesehenen Schlepptenderlokomotiven mit der Achsfolge 2’C1’ wurden von William Stanier, dem Chefingenieur der LMS, entworfen und in den \\"Crewe Works\\" der LMS in Crewe für den Einsatz auf der West Coast Main Line (WCML) zwischen London und Schottland erbaut. 24 der Maschinen wurden mit Verkleidung als Stromlinienlokomotiven gebaut. In den Nachkriegsjahren wurden die Verkleidungen jedoch wieder demontiert. 1937 erzielte die erste Maschine der Klasse mit 114 mph (ca. 183,4 km/h) einen Geschwindigkeitsrekord für britische Dampflokomotiven. Ab 1948 gehörten die Maschinen zum Bestand von British Railways, nachdem die LMS infolge des Transport Act 1947 verstaatlicht worden war. Bis Ende der 1950er Jahre bespannten sie die meisten wichtigen Expresszüge auf der WCML, bevor sie allmählich durch Diesellokomotiven ersetzt wurden. In den Jahren 1962 bis 1964 wurden die Lokomotiven ausgemustert. Drei Exemplare der Klasse blieben museal erhalten, davon ist noch eines betriebsfähig., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Nachdem die LMS 1935 eine erste Serienlieferung von zehn Exemplaren der seit 1933 erprobten Klasse 7P „Princess Royal“ erhalten hatte, die sich sehr gut bewährt hatte, wurde im Sommer 1936 die Bestellung weiterer Exemplare für einen zur Einführung im Folgejahr vorgesehenen neuen schnellen und luxuriösen Expresszug zwischen London Euston und Glasgow vorbereitet. Zudem sollten mit den zusätzlichen Pacifics die bislang überwiegend immer noch erforderlichen Lokomotivwechsel in Carlisle oder Crewe abgeschafft werden. Entsprechend der seitdem gesammelten Betriebserfahrungen überarbeitete das technische Büro der LMS die Konstruktionszeichnungen geringfügig und sah lediglich leichte Anpassungen in Details wie etwa den Überhitzerelementen und dem Radstand vor., Der Erfolg der konkurrierenden London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) mit ihren neuen, ab 1935 ausgelieferten Stromlinienlokomotiven der Klasse A4 wie auch die Erfahrungen mit Testfahrten einer \\"Princess Royal\\" bewogen die LMS und ihren \\"Chief Mechanical Engineer\\" (CME) William Stanier jedoch dazu, den Entwurf gründlicher zu überarbeiten. Insbesondere wurden größere Treibräder vorgesehen und der Kessel bis zu den maximal möglichen Maßen innerhalb des Lichtraumprofils der LMS vergrößert. Auch das Vierzylinder-Triebwerk (ohne Verbundwirkung) der \\"Princess Royal\\" wurde umfassend überarbeitet und die Außenzylinder etwas weiter nach vorne versetzt. Eine Stromlinienverkleidung wurde analog zu den A4 ebenfalls vorgesehen. Stanier schätzte diese zwar eher als Modeerscheinung ein, musste aber hier dem Druck der LMS-Führung nachgeben, die aus Marketinggründen Wert darauf legte. Letztendlich entstand damit eine neue Bauart und die Beschaffung der \\"Princess Royal Class\\" wurde zugunsten des neuen Entwurfs nicht fortgesetzt. Da Stanier in dieser Zeit mit einer Untersuchung zur Ursache von Entgleisungen von Pacific-Lokomotiven in Britisch-Indien befasst war, wurden die Konstruktionsarbeiten bei der LMS weitgehend von Thomas F. Coleman, dem Chefzeichner des LMS-Konstruktionsbüros, Staniers Assistenten Robert Riddles und dem späteren CME von British Railways, Roland C. Bond, übernommen., Bau und Erprobung., Im Vergleich mit den \\"Princess Royals\\" konnte bei den Lokomotiven der \\"Coronation Class\\" eine spürbare Leistungssteigerung erzielt werden, bspw. durch eine deutlich größere Heizfläche. Sie waren die größten und leistungsfähigsten Schnellzuglokomotiven aller britischen Eisenbahngesellschaften. Dennoch wogen die Maschinen voll ausgerüstet lediglich eine Tonne mehr als ihre Vorgänger, was auf die umfangreiche Verwendung nickellegierten Stahls zurückzuführen ist. Wie die \\"Princess Royal Class\\" wurde die \\"Coronation Class\\" in der von der LMS verwendeten Leistungsklassifizierung aller Lokomotiven als 7P eingestuft. British Railways änderte die Einstufung zum 1. Januar 1951 auf 8P., Die ersten fünf Maschinen der neuen \\"Coronation Class\\" entstanden 1937 in den LMS-eigenen Werkstätten in Crewe. Sie erhielten die Nummern 6220 bis 6224. Mit ihnen sollte der neue Expresszug Coronation Scot bespannt werden, der in diesem Jahr den Dienst zwischen London und Glasgow mit lediglich einem Zwischenhalt in Carlisle aufnehmen sollte. Die erste Lokomotive wie auch der Zug erhielten ihre Namen zur Feier der im gleichen Jahr stattfindenden Krönung von König Georg VI. Passend zur für den \\"Coronation Scot\\" beschafften neuen Zuggarnitur und zum Ziel des Zuges in Schottland bekamen die Lokomotiven abweichend von der normalen Farbgebung der LMS eine Lackierung in Blau mit silbernen Längsstreifen in den traditionellen Farben der Caledonian Railway, einer der Vorgängerbahnen der LMS., Auf einer Pressefahrt zur Vorstellung der neuen Lokomotive und des \\"Coronation Scot\\" erzielte die Maschine 6220 zwischen London Euston und Crewe am 29. Juni 1937 kurzzeitig eine Geschwindigkeit von 114 Meilen pro Stunde (mph, ca. 183 km/h) und errang damit den britischen Geschwindigkeitsrekord für Dampflokomotiven, den zuvor mit rund 181 km/h eine Lokomotive der LNER-Klasse A4 gehalten hatte. Die Fahrt hätte beinahe in einer Katastrophe geendet, da der Zug vor Crewe erst relativ spät abgebremst werden konnte und im Bahnhof über abzweigende Weichenstraßen geführt wurde. Statt den erlaubten 20 mph (ca. 32 km/h) passierte der Zug die Weichen mit gut 52 mph (ca. 84 km/h), nach anderen Angaben sogar mit 57 mph (ca. 92 km/h). Das neu entwickelte Fahrwerk der Lokomotive bewährte sich jedoch und der gesamte Zug blieb trotz kräftiger Wankbewegungen im Gleis. Einen Totalschaden gab es lediglich im mitgeführten Speisewagen, in dem das gesamte Geschirr der heftigen Querbewegung zum Opfer fiel. Mehrere Fahrgäste trugen dabei leichte Verletzungen wie Prellungen und blaue Flecken davon. Der LMS-Vizepräsident Ernest Lemon bemerkte gegenüber den bleich gewordenen Pressevertretern im Zug mit typisch britischem Understatement, dass man bei den regulären Fahrten natürlich nicht vorhabe, das zu wiederholen, der Zug wäre lediglich ein wenig schneller gewesen als fahrplanmäßig vorgesehen („a little faster than in the ordinary course“). Gut ein Jahr später eroberte die LNER am 3. Juli 1938 mit der Weltrekordfahrt der A4 4468 \\"Mallard\\" allerdings auch den britischen Rekord zurück., Stanier ließ während der bereits begonnenen Serienlieferung die Konstruktion der \\"Coronation Class\\" in diversen Details verbessern und erprobte neue Bauteile. Die Lokomotive 6234 \\"Duchess of Abercorn\\" erhielt daher kurz nach ihrer Ablieferung einen Doppelschornstein, der in Testfahrten ausführlich erprobt wurde. Im Rahmen einer solchen Testfahrt beförderte die Lokomotive am 26. Februar 1939 einen aus 20 Reisezugwagen bestehenden Zug von Crewe nach Glasgow und zurück. Obwohl die Zuglast mit 604 Tonnen damit fast das Doppelte der Last des \\"Coronation Scot\\" betrug, benötigte die Lokomotive gegenüber dessen vorgesehener Fahrtzeit lediglich 1,5 Minuten mehr. Die Messungen während der Fahrt ergaben eine Leistung von 2.282 PS am Zughaken, was einer indizierten Leistung von 3.333 PSi entsprach und damit die größte je bei einer britischen Dampflokomotive gemessene Leistung war. Zuvor war die Lokomotive mit Einfachschornstein vor einem vergleichbaren Zug erprobt worden und hatte erhebliche Probleme gehabt, den Zug auf der West Coast Main Line über die langen Rampen des Shap Summit und bei Beattock zu befördern. In der Folge erhielten alle neuen Lokomotiven von Beginn an Doppelschornsteine, bei den bereits gelieferten Exemplaren wurden sie nachgerüstet., Serienlieferung., Nachdem sich die ersten fünf Lokomotiven bewährt hatten, gab die Führung der LMS Ende 1937 die Beschaffung einer ersten Serie von zehn Maschinen für das Jahr 1938 frei. Zuvor waren noch einzelne Brücken auf den außer der WCML vorgesehenen weiteren Einsatzstrecken für die Achslast der \\"Coronation Class\\" ertüchtigt worden; mit 22,50 Long tons (22,86 t) waren die Lokomotiven nur auf wenigen Hauptstrecken der LMS uneingeschränkt einsetzbar. Aus dieser Bestellung folgten zunächst 1938 weitere fünf Maschinen mit den Nummern 6225 bis 6229 und mit Stromlinienverkleidung, jedoch nun wieder im gewohnten Dunkelrotbraun \\"(LMS Maroon)\\" der LMS lackiert. Stanier sah seine Zweifel an der Nützlichkeit der Stromlinienverkleidung aufgrund der ersten Erfahrungen und Messfahrten bestätigt und ließ die fünf weiteren Maschinen, die Nummern 6230 bis 6234, erstmals ohne Verkleidung bauen. Vergleichsfahrten zwischen verkleideten und unverkleideten Lokomotiven der Klasse zeigten keine großen Vorteile der Stromlinie beim Kohlenverbrauch – hochgerechnet auf einen Monat belief sich die Differenz auf etwa sieben bis 12 Tonnen, was im Schnitt ungefähr einer Tenderfüllung entsprach. Insgesamt ergab sich eine Einsparung von etwas über zwei Prozent. 1939 und 1940 folgten jeweils weitere fünf Maschinen, jedoch auf Druck der für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit Zuständigen der LMS wieder mit Stromlinienverkleidung., Bedingt durch den Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkriegs, der statt Expresszuglokomotiven den Bau von Güterzuglokomotiven erforderte, endete die Beschaffung 1940 zunächst. Erst 1943 gelang es der LMS, die Beschaffung weiterer Maschinen genehmigt zu bekommen. Die in diesem Jahr gebauten Lokomotiven mit den Nummern 6245 bis 6248 erhielten nochmals eine Stromlinienverkleidung. Alle weiteren Maschinen wurden ohne Verkleidung geliefert: 1944 kamen zunächst die vier Lokomotiven 6249 bis 6252 in den Bestand der LMS. Nach einer Pause erhielt die LMS 1946 und 1947 die letzten vier Lokomotiven der Klasse mit den Nummern 6253 bis 6256. Mit Verzögerung wurde schließlich im Mai 1948 die letzte Maschine der \\"Coronation Class\\" ausgeliefert, nunmehr an die infolge des Transport Act 1947 zum 1. Januar 1948 neugegründeten British Railways (BR), in der alle verstaatlichten britischen Privatbahnen zu diesem Datum aufgegangen waren. Sie erhielt die BR-Nummer 46257., Die letzten beiden Maschinen wichen leicht von den vorigen Serienlieferungen ab. George Ivatt, der letzte CME der LMS, ließ die Maschinen u.a. mit Wälzlagern anstelle von Gleitlagern ausstatten.

Die noch wenig erforschten Mechanismen, mit deren Hilfe die Pflanzen sich an extreme Umweltbedingungen anpassen und photosynthetisch aktiv bleiben können, sind sehr vielfältig. Einige Salzpflanzen (die obligaten Halophyten) werden durch moderate Salzgehalte in ihrem Wachstum gefördert, andere Salzpflanzen benötigen kein Salz für ihre Lebenstätigkeit. Sie gedeihen wesentlich besser auf salzfreien Böden, nur sind sie dort der Konkurrenz anderer Pflanzen unterlegen., Definitionen., Es gibt mehrere Definitionen des Begriffs Salzpflanze bzw. Halophyt. Ein Kriterium ist beispielsweise, dass die Pflanzen auf Salzboden mit mehr als 0,5 Prozent Salz im Bodentrockengewicht wachsen können. Dieser Wert ist zwar leicht zu bestimmen, wichtiger für die Pflanze ist aber die Salz- bzw. Ionenkonzentration im Bodenwasser. Die ebenfalls oft verwendete Definition von Jennings (1976) bezeichnet Halophyten als \\"die natürliche Flora auf Salz-Standorten\\". Bereits Warming (1909), der den Begriff Halophyt erstmals definierte, schrieb: \\"eine gewisse Menge an löslichen Salzen muss anwesend sein, bevor eine halophytische Vegetation entsteht; die Art des Salzes scheint von keiner Bedeutung zu sein.\\" Mann et al. (1983) haben die Standorte wie folgt beschrieben: \\"„[…] enthalten Salzwasser mit einem osmotischen Druck von über 3,3 bar“\\", was einer Konzentration von 70 mM monovalenter Salze entspricht., Pflanzen, die an Salzstandorten auch unter Ausschluss der Konkurrenz nicht überleben, werden im deutschsprachigen Raum oft \\"Glykophyten\\" genannt. Dieser Ausdruck wird vom Wort \\"„Süßwasser“\\" abgeleitet und findet sich ausschließlich in der Deutschen Sprache. Passendere, jedoch seltener genutzte Bezeichnungen für denselben Begriff sind \\"halophobe\\" Pflanzen oder einfach \\"Nicht-Halophyten\\"., Salztolerante Lebewesen werden generell als \\"halophil\\" bezeichnet, und zwar, wenn sie durch die evolutionär bedingte Salzresistenz nicht mehr fähig sind, in Abwesenheit von Salz zu existieren. Diese Salzresistenz hat sich mehrfach unabhängig entwickelt. Daher sind Salzpflanzen auch keine monophyletische Verwandtschaftsgruppe, obwohl sie in einigen Pflanzengattungen und -familien gehäuft auftreten., Unter den Höheren Pflanzen finden sich Halophyten nur unter den Angiospermen. Es gibt rund 1.500 bekannte Halophytenarten. Familien mit zahlreichen Vertretern sind die Chenopodiaceae, Aizoaceae, Frankeniaceae, Plumbaginaceae und unter den Mangroven die Rhizophoraceae, Lythraceae, Avicennioideae innerhalb der Akanthusgewächse, Combretaceae und Myrsinaceae. Zudem gibt es Halophyten unter den Süß- und Sauergräsern sowie den Juncaceae., In Deutschland kommen 54 Halophyten vor. Dazu kommen noch einige Übergangsformen und Zwischenarten, die nur selten Halotoleranz ausbilden oder als Bastarde von litoralen (\\"Ammophila arenaria\\") und binnenländischen (\\"Calamagrostis epigeios\\") Arten aufgefasst werden. Die Existenz derartiger besonderer Litoralformen von sonst weitverbreiteten halophytischen oder sandbewohnenden Gräsern ist der beste Beweis dafür, dass diese bereits seit einer sehr langen Zeitepoche von ihrem gegenwärtigen Standort Besitz ergriffen haben müssen und hier die ihm entsprechenden Formen erzeugten., Einteilung nach Abhängigkeit vom Salz., Obligate Halophyten., Die obligaten Halophyten (\\"obligatorisch\\" = pflichtgemäß), auch Eu-Halophyten genannt, sind an ihre salzige Umgebung gebunden. Ohne eine bestimmte Konzentration von Salz als Lebensgrundlage wäre das Gedeihen und Keimen dieser Pflanzen nicht möglich, da sie sich an Extrembedingungen dieses Umweltfaktors weitgehend angepasst haben. Der Toleranzbereich der obligaten Halophyten gegenüber Salz ist dementsprechend sehr groß, so dass diese sogar bei ständiger Überflutung mit Meerwasser bestehen können. Die bekanntesten heimischen Gattungen sind Queller (\\"Salicornia\\"), Binsen (\\"Juncus\\"), Salzmelden (\\"Suaeda\\") und Schlickgräser (\\"Spartina\\")., Fakultative Halophyten., Die fakultativen Halophyten (\\"fakultativ\\" = wahlweise) haben die Fähigkeit, an Salzstandorten zu wachsen, sind aber nicht an diese gebunden. Vertreter, wie das Gänsefingerkraut (\\"Potentilla anserina\\"), die Strand-Aster (\\"Aster tripolium\\"), der Strand-Wegerich (\\"Plantago maritima\\") und der Strand-Beifuß (\\"Artemisia maritima\\") können durchaus auch in maritimen Gebieten auftreten. Ihr Optimum an Lebensfunktionen erreichen sie jedoch nur auf Böden, die überwiegend salzfrei sind oder nur einen leichten Salzgehalt aufweisen. Da sie in diesen Gebieten zunehmend auf die Konkurrenz anderer Pflanzen stoßen, sind diese Salzpflanzen häufig gegenüber den dort anzutreffenden Süßwasserpflanzen im Nachteil. Diese sind besser an ihr Milieu angepasst und vermehren sich schneller. Fakultative Halophyten weisen einen größer eingeschränkten Toleranzbereich gegenüber dem Salzgehalt des Bodens auf, als obligate Halophyten., Indifferente Halophyten., So genannte standortindifferente Halophyten bilden eine Übergangsform zu den Süßwasserpflanzen und sind meist nur in salzfreien Gebieten zu finden. Ihr Toleranzbereich ist relativ gering, sie kommen aber noch mit Salzböden zurecht, die eine geringere Konzentration aufweisen. In diesen Fällen verändert sich der Habitus der entsprechenden Pflanze auf unterschiedlichste Weise und weicht vom Grunderscheinungsbild ab. Vertreter dieser Gruppe sind: Rotschwingel (\\"Festuca rubra litoralis\\"), Weißes Straußgras (\\"Agrostis stolonifera\\"), Kröten-Binse (\\"Juncus bufonius\\"), Kriechender Hahnenfuß (\\"Ranunculus repens\\") und Mauerpfeffer (\\"Sedum\\")., Einteilung nach Art der Einwirkung des Salzes., Salz kann auf verschiedensten Wegen auf die Pflanze einwirken, wonach sich Halophyten grundlegend als lufthalin (\\"aerohalin\\"), wasserhalin (\\"hydrohalin\\") oder \\"terrestrisch halin\\" beschreiben lassen. Die beiden zuletzt genannten Kategorien greifen dabei ineinander, weshalb oft auch die zusammenfassende Bezeichnung \\"hydroterrestrisch halin\\" verwendet wird., Lufthaline., Brechende Wellen und Gischt auf den Ozeanen führen durch einen Dispergierungprozess (\\"bulk to particle conversion\\") zur Freisetzung kleiner Tröpfchen (\\"Sea spray\\") in der Luft. Wesentliche Anteile davon werden durch die Turbulenz der marinen Grenzschicht nach oben transportiert und können teilweise trocknen. Das durch solche Brandungszerstäubung entstehende Aerosol, welches zusammenfassend als \\"Seesalzaerosol\\" bezeichnet wird, wirkt sich infolge hoher Salzluftkonzentration auf Pflanzen in zum Meer nahe gelegenen und entfernten Gebieten aus. Viele lufthaline Arten sind zugleich wasserhalin, so dass sich zwischen beiden Kategorien eine engere Verbindung ergibt. Die im eigentlichen Sinne rein aerohalinen Arten leben als Übergang vom maritimen zum terrestrischen Bereich in abgelegener Umgebung zum Meer und nehmen Salz fast ausschließlich über die Blattoberfläche auf. So kann der Salzgehalt der Blätter an der Luvseite bis zu zehn Mal höher sein als bei Blättern derselben Pflanze im Windschatten. Der Gelbe Hornmohn (\\"Glaucium flavum\\") ist etwa gegen Salzstaub und Spritzwasser unempfindlich, verträgt jedoch kein Salz im Boden., In der Nähe von Verdunstungsbecken, also bestimmten Binnensalzseen, die regelmäßig in Dürreperioden austrocknen und eine Salzwüste hinterlassen (Desertifikation), finden sich ebenfalls zahlreiche Salzpflanzenarten. Das in der Luft vorhandene Salz ist auf solche Verdunstungsprozesse des Salzwassers zurückzuführen und wird von der dort lebenden Pflanzenwelt aus dem aeroben Umfeld aufgenommen., Wasserhaline., Die \\"maritimen\\" Arten leben sowohl in näherer Umgebung von Salz- als auch von Brackwasser und finden sich von der Gezeitenzone über Flussmündungen hinein ins Landesinnere an Binnenlandsalzgewässern. Hydrohaline Pflanzen sind all jene Arten, die entweder vollkommen oder halb\\"aquatil\\" sind, also ihren Lebensmittelpunkt im oder in der Nähe vom Wasser haben. Ist der Boden trocken und sandig ausgebildet, im engeren Sinne an Stränden und Dünen, haben sich die dortigen arenicolen Halophyten meist mit einem weiteren, tieferen Wurzelsystem an ihr Umfeld angepasst. Auf schlickigem, oft überflutetem Untergrund, der eine direkte Wasseraufnahme gewährleistet, kommen hingegen eher Pflanzen mit kleineren, aber auch kräftigeren, nicht wegschwemmbaren Wurzeln auf. Einige geschlossene Pflanzenformationen haben sich offensichtlich auf verdünntes Meerwasser der Flussdeltas und auf Flussmündungen als Lebensraum spezialisiert, wohingegen andere in einer ausgeprägten Sandlückenflora an salzkonzentrierten Seen und Binnenmeeren wie dem Toten Meer leben. Dabei variiert der Salzgehalt thalassohaliner Standorte über einen weiten Bereich und kann dem des Meerwassers (3,5 %) bis zu dem Salzgehalt einer gesättigten Natriumchloridlösung (30 %) entsprechen. Die Übergangsformen zu den terrestrischen und aerohalinen Salzpflanzen bilden weiter vom Salzwasser abgelegene Vielfältigkeitsbereiche, welche sich oberhalb des bei Flut gewöhnlich erreichten Wasserspiegels auf normaler Erde oder Felsgeröll (vorzugsweise \\"Sedum\\"-Arten) angesiedelt haben und normalerweise nur von der salzigen Gischt erreicht werden., Terrestrische Haline., Als terrestrische Haline bezeichnet man alle landlebenden Arten, die sich auf Binnensalzstellen spezialisiert haben. Sie nehmen Salz ausschließlich über den Boden auf. Zu den nicht am Strand vorkommenden Salzpflanzen gehören beispielsweise der Felsen-Beifuß (\\"Artemisia rupestris\\"), Schlitzblättriger Beifuß (\\"Artemisia laciniata\\") oder das Land-Reitgras (\\"Calamagrostis epigeios\\"). Auch in Wüsten- und Steppenregionen auftretende Gewächse, wie Arten der Gattung \\"Atriplex\\" sind als solche vom Wasser abgelegene Formen aufzufassen, welche sich bevorzugt unter standortindifferenten Halophyten auffinden lassen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Pflanzentyp, Salzpflanzen, Halophyten, ökologisch abgrenzende Gruppe, erhöhte Gehalte, leicht lösliche Salze, Standort, fortpflanzen, salzreiche Standorte, trockene Lebensräume, Meeresnähe, Salzseen, Mechanismen, Umweltbedingungen, photosynthetisch aktiv, moderate Salzgehalte, Konkurrenz, Definitionen, Salzboden, Salz-Standorten, Salzwasser, osmotischer Druck, Lebensgehalt, anderen Pflanzen, Salzwasserpflanzen, Salzresistenz, monophyletische Verwandtschaftsgruppe, Angiospermen, Chenopodiaceae, Aizoaceae, Frankeniaceae, Plumbaginaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Lythraceae, Avicennioideae, Akanthusgewächse, Combretaceae, Myrsinaceae, Deutschland, Halotoleranz, Glykophyten, halophil, Halophyt, Obligate Halophyten, Eu-Halophyten, salzige Umgebung, Toleranzbereich, ständige Überflutung, Meerwasser, Gattungen, Queller, Binsen, Salzmelden, Schlickgräser, Fakultative Halophyten, Gänsefingerkraut, Strand-Aster, Strand-Wegerich, Strand-Beifuß, Optimum, salzfreie Böden, indifferente Halophyten, Rotschwingel, Weißes Straußgras, Kröten-Binse, Kriechender Hahnenfuß, Mauerpfeffer, Salzeinwirkung, Lufthaline, brachende Wellen, Gischt, Meer, Seesalzaerosol, aerohaline Arten, salzfreie Gebiete, Verdunstungsbecken, Desertiifikation, wasserhaline, maritim, arenicolen Halophyte, schlickiger Untergrund, Kräftige Wurzeln, Flussdeltas, Flussmündungen, Flussmündungen, Sandlückenflora, salzkonzentrierte Seen, Binnenmeere, Satzgehalt, sedum-Arten, pouFelsen, Erde, Felsgeröll, salzige Gischt, terrestrische Haline, Binnensalzstellen, Wasser, Felsen-Beifuß, Schlitzblättriger Beifuß, Land-Reingras, Atriplex-Arten, standortindifferente Halophyten."},{"instruction":"Write me an interesting story for children","output":"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled amidst rolling green hills, there was a young girl named Lucy who had an incredible imagination. She spent hours exploring the woods, seeking enchantment in every leaf and whisper of wind. One sunny afternoon, Lucy stumbled upon an old, rusty key while wandering through her backyard. It was unlike any key she had ever seen, with an intricate design etched onto its surface. Curiosity gripped her, and she decided to find the lock it belonged to. Lucy's grandmother had always told her stories about a hidden door that led to a magical world within the mighty oak tree at the edge of the forest. Feeling a spark of hope, Lucy ran to her grandma and excitedly shared her discovery. Full of anticipation, Lucy journeyed to the old oak tree, key in hand. The tree's bark seemed to whisper secrets as she approached. With a deep breath, she inserted the key into a knothole, turning it slowly. Suddenly, the tree trembled, and a door appeared! As Lucy stepped into the enchanted realm, she found herself surrounded by colorful flowers that twinkled like stars. The air was filled with the melodic chatter of talking animals. Rabbits hopped, squirrels sang, and butterflies flitted about, carrying songs of the fairies. Further into the magical forest, Lucy encountered a wise owl perched atop a tree branch. The owl, named Oliver, wore tiny glasses and had a penchant for storytelling. Oliver told Lucy about a mischievous sprite called Sparkle, who had lost her way home. Eager to help, Lucy set off through the woods, guided only by the shimmering trail left by Sparkle's disappearing fairy dust. Along her journey, she met a band of musical gnomes with moustaches as long as their beards. They played their instruments with such joy that the forest echoed with laughter and song. As the sun began to set, Lucy discovered Sparkle stuck in a tangled web spun by a grumpy spider named Sylvester. Bravely, she rescued Sparkle and set her free. Overjoyed, the sprite thanked Lucy and led her to the grandest fairy circle in all the land. In the center of the fairy circle stood the Fairy Queen, adorned in a gown made of moonbeam silk. Grateful for Lucy's kind heart, the Fairy Queen granted her one special wish. Without hesitation, Lucy wished for the magical door within the oak tree to remain open forever, allowing children from all over the world to experience its wonders. With a shimmering wave of her hand, the Fairy Queen granted Lucy's wish and bid her farewell. Lucy returned to her village, but her adventures filled her dreams each night, inspiring her to write stories of magic and friendship. From that day forward, children from far and wide visited the magical realm within the oak tree, which came to be known as \\"Lucy's Enchanted Kingdom.\\" Lucy's stories touched the hearts of all who read them, reminding them of the extraordinary power of imagination and the beauty that lies within each child's heart. And so, Lucy lived happily ever after, continuing to weave enchanting tales that touched the lives of children for generations to come."},{"instruction":"Lion stories with animals","output":"Once upon a time, in the vast grasslands of Africa, there lived a mighty lion named Leo. Leo was known far and wide for his courage, strength, and golden mane that shimmered under the African sun. Leo had a deep respect for all creatures big and small, and he believed in the importance of unity among animals. He would often gather fellow animals at the watering hole to discuss matters of the jungle, providing a safe space for them to share their thoughts and concerns. One day, Leo noticed an uneasiness among the animals. The zebras were shivering with fear, the elephants wore worried expressions, and the ostriches stuck their heads in the sand. Leo realized something was amiss and called for a meeting at the watering hole. As the animals gathered, Leo listened attentively to each of their tales. The overzealous monkeys complained about a mischievous leopard who stole their bananas, while the timid gazelles shared their concerns about a pack of sly hyenas that lurked nearby. Everyone had a story to tell, and it was Leo's duty to restore peace in their kingdom. Determined to find a solution, Leo called upon his trusted friend, Koko the wise old owl. Koko was known for her vast knowledge of the jungle and its inhabitants. Together, Leo and Koko devised a plan. Leo would use his immense strength and bravery to confront the mischievous leopard, while Koko would seek out the hyenas and convince them to live harmoniously with the gazelles. With the plan in place, Leo set off into the dense forest to find the leopard. He located the leopard's den amidst the tangled vines and stood before the startled feline with a firm resolve. Leo explained that the monkeys needed their bananas and proposed a fair trade – the leopard would receive a variety of fruits in exchange for leaving the monkeys' beloved bananas alone. The leopard, realizing the harmony and camaraderie at stake, reluctantly agreed to the trade. Leo's diplomacy had saved the day, and the monkeys celebrated their regained banana supply with joyous chatter. Meanwhile, Koko fluttered through the trees and located the pack of hyenas. She diligently shared stories of unity, love, and friendship that thrilled the hyenas. Touched by the wise owl's words, the hyenas realized the error of their ways and, for the first time, saw the gazelles as fellow creatures deserving respect and understanding. Leo and Koko's efforts brought tranquility back to the grasslands. The animals came together, acknowledging that diversity and collaboration were the true strengths of their kingdom. Leo's story of unity and friendship spread across the jungle, inspiring animals to treat each other with kindness and empathy. From that day forward, the animals of the grasslands lived in harmony, sharing resources and protecting one another against any threat that came their way. Through Leo's leadership and the guidance of Koko, the grasslands thrived. The animals honored Leo by calling him the King of the Grasslands, a title he wore with humility and pride. His kingdom became a symbol of unity and a haven for all creatures in need. And so, the legend of Leo the lion and his extraordinary acts of bravery and compassion echoed through the African grasslands, teaching future generations the importance of unity, respect, and the power of friendship among animals, creating a legacy that would forever inspire both lions and animals alike."},{"instruction":"Hi.

Die Spezies wurde erstmals 1758 von dem schwedischen Naturforscher Carl von Linné beschrieben. Je nach regionaler Mundart wird sie unter anderem auch als Feuermolch, Erdmolch, Erdsalamander, Regenmolch, Regenmännchen, Gelber Schneider, Bergnarr, Wegnarr, Regenmolli oder Tattermandl (bayerisch) bezeichnet. Diese volkstümlichen Namen unterscheiden allerdings nicht immer eindeutig zwischen Feuer- und Alpensalamander., Die Schwanzlurche leben in größeren Laub- und Mischwaldgebieten mit naturnahen Bachläufen. Sie sind überwiegend nachtaktiv. Anders als bei vielen anderen mitteleuropäischen Lurchen werden keine Eier, sondern in der Regel weit entwickelte, kiementragende Larven ins Wasser abgesetzt (Ovoviviparie). Die Hauptlaichzeit erstreckt sich witterungsbedingt von Anfang März bis in den Mai., In Nordrhein-Westfalen und Rheinland-Pfalz sind erste Auswirkungen der eingeschleppten Salamanderpest (\\"Bsal\\") erkennbar. Im Ruhrgebiet wurden bereits Massensterben beobachtet. Die tödliche \\"Bsal\\"-Infektion greift inzwischen auch auf andere Bundesländer über., Der Feuersalamander war Lurch des Jahres 2016. Aufgrund seiner Vorliebe für unterirdische Verstecke wurde er für das Jahr 2023 als Höhlentier des Jahres in Deutschland und der Schweiz ernannt., Verbreitung in Europa., Der Feuersalamander ist über weite Teile Mittel- und Südeuropas verbreitet. Er hat das größte Verbreitungsgebiet unter den europäischen Landsalamandern. Die Nordgrenze seines Areals verläuft durch Nord- und Mitteldeutschland, dann südostwärts entlang der Karpaten bis in die Ukraine und Rumänien und südwärts über Bulgarien nach Griechenland, wobei die Verbreitung maßgeblich durch die Gebirge Südosteuropas bestimmt wird. In Südwesteuropa, insbesondere auf der Iberischen Halbinsel, stellen die großen Gebirgszüge die Lebensräume für mehrere Feuersalamanderunterarten. Die großen subkontinental geprägten Hochebenen, beispielsweise die Iberische Meseta, werden aus klimatischen Gründen nicht besiedelt., Nicht besiedelt sind auch Skandinavien, Großbritannien, Irland und Nordosteuropa. In Mitteleuropa unterscheidet man die Tiere je nach ihrem gelben Zeichnungsmuster auf dem Rücken als gebänderte Unterart (\\"Salamandra salamandra terrestris\\") mit dem Hauptverbreitungsgebiet West- und Mitteleuropa sowie die Nominatform mit geflecktem Muster (\\"Salamandra salamandra salamandra\\") mit dem Verbreitungsgebiet Mittel-/Osteuropa. In Deutschland gibt es Regionen, in denen sich die Areale dieser beiden Unterarten überschneiden, beispielsweise im Rhein-Main-Gebiet. Im Gesamtareal werden derzeit 14 Unterarten unterschieden, die meisten davon auf der Iberischen Halbinsel., Vier ehemalige Unterarten werden mittlerweile aufgrund genetischer Untersuchungsergebnisse als eigenständige Arten angesprochen:, Der Südspanische Feuersalamander (\\"Salamandra salamandra longirostris\\" Joger &amp; Steinfartz, 1994) kommt von der Sierra de Ronda südöstlich bis Marbella vor. Er wurde im Jahr 2009 als eigene Art anerkannt, aber aufgrund molekulargenetischer Untersuchungen wieder zur Unterart zurückgestuft., Noch nicht alle Publikationen haben diese taxonomischen Änderungen berücksichtigt. Die Vorkommen vor allem am südlichen Arealrand müssen ferner sämtlich als Refugialhabitate angesehen werden, die wohl weitgehend voneinander isoliert sind., Verbreitung in Deutschland., Der Feuersalamander ist in Deutschland vor allem in bewaldeten Landschaften beheimatet. Verbreitungsschwerpunkte sind die Mittelgebirge im westlichen, mittleren und südwestlichen Deutschland. Dazu kommen zusammenhängende Bereiche unter anderem im Erzgebirge sowie in Nord- und Ostbayern. Im nordwestdeutschen Tiefland gibt es mehrere isolierte Vorkommen, insbesondere auch im Gebiet der Lüneburger Heide und im Münsterland. Im nordostdeutschen Tiefland fehlt die Art, die Elbe wird in östlicher Richtung nicht überschritten. Auch im südwestlichen Bayern, südlich der Donau, gibt es die so genannte „Allgäu-Lücke“. Dieser Raum ist weitgehend unbesiedelt von Feuersalamandern. In Sachsen-Anhalt befindet sich der Verbreitungsschwerpunkt im Harz. Daneben existiert ein isoliertes Vorkommen im Süden, im Bereich des Zeitzer Forsts (FFH-Gebiet), das Anschluss an die Vorkommen in Thüringen hat., Im Saarland und in Rheinland-Pfalz ist die Art in fast allen Lebensräumen oberhalb 200 m gut verbreitet. Die Tieflagen (Nördliche Oberrheinebene, Rheinhessen) dagegen sind fundfrei. In Hessen sind die Mittelgebirge Odenwald, Spessart, Taunus und Westerwald fast flächendeckend besiedelt. Niedersachsen besitzt Verbreitungsschwerpunkte im Osnabrücker Hügelland sowie im Weser- und Leinebergland. Isolierte Fundpunkte liegen bei Delmenhorst, Vechta und südlich von Nordhorn. In Nordrhein-Westfalen finden sich Feuersalamander im Bergischen Land sowie in der Nordeifel. Im Ruhrgebiet (Bochum) dringen kleine Populationen sogar bis in den Siedlungsbereich (Parks und Hausgärten) vor. Baden-Württemberg ist innerhalb Deutschlands ein wichtiges Verbreitungszentrum. Hier sind Feuersalamander bis auf die Naturräume Oberrheinebene und Oberschwaben nahezu flächenhaft vorhanden. Im Bereich des Kleinen Odenwalds in Nordbaden überschneiden sich die Vorkommen von \\"S. salamandra salamandra\\" und \\"S. salamandra terrestris\\". Im Freistaat Bayern liegen die meisten Vorkommen im Südosten. In den bayerischen Alpenregionen ist die Art selten; ebenso im Chiemgau. Im Bayerischen Wald, Oberpfälzer Wald, Frankenwald, in der Südrhön sowie im Spessart ist der Feuersalamander fast flächendeckend verbreitet (z.B. NSG Amphibienfreistätte Sommergrund im Landkreis Aschaffenburg)., Die Höhenlage ist nicht unbedingt maßgeblich für die Verbreitung des Feuersalamanders in Mitteleuropa. Wichtig ist die Existenz alter, naturnaher Laubwälder, dem Lebensraum heimischer Feuersalamander. Diese liegen etwa zwischen 200 und 600 Metern über Normalhöhennull; darüber hinaus werden auch Höhen zwischen 650 Meter ü. NHN im Harz und 900 Meter ü. NHN im Südschwarzwald und in den Alpen erreicht. In Niedersachsen und in Nordrhein-Westfalen finden sich auch Vorkommen deutlich unter 100 Meter ü. NHN, wie beispielsweise in der Umgebung von Münster und im Nordwesten des Kreises Warendorf (beide etwa 60 m ü. NHN), im Hasbruch bei Oldenburg (25 Meter ü. NHN)., Manche Vorkommen des Feuersalamanders sind wohl immer noch unbekannt. Durch ihre versteckte Lebensweise sowie durch ihre nächtliche Aktivität, können diese Lurche trotz ihrer auffälligen Färbung jahrzehntelang einen Lebensraum besiedeln, ohne dass der Mensch sie bemerkt., Lebensraum., Unter den einheimischen Amphibien ist der Feuersalamander die Art mit der engsten Bindung an den Lebensraum Wald (silvicol). Bevorzugt werden heterogen strukturierte, grundwassernahe Laub- und Mischwälder. Reine Nadelwaldbestände dagegen werden gemieden; allenfalls noch akzeptiert werden lückenhafte Bereiche von Fichtenwäldern mit aufkommender Moos- und Krautvegetation. Wo der Wald verschwunden ist, kann der Feuersalamander sich als Faunenrelikt für längere Zeit noch halten, wenn die klimatischen Bedingungen günstig sind., Habitate., Feuersalamander sind als erwachsene Tiere weitgehend unabhängig von Oberflächengewässern und führen ein verborgenes Dasein in Nischen von Höhlen, unter Totholz und Baumstümpfen, zwischen Felsen und Blockhalden sowie im Lückensystem des Bodens, zum Beispiel in Kleinsäugergängen. Bei den Weibchen spielt die Nähe zu einem Laichgewässer bei der Wahl des Habitats neben dem Vorhandensein von Tagesverstecken eine wichtige Rolle. Auch Bauwerke wie Brunnenstuben, Stolleneingänge und stillgelegte, verschlossene Eisenbahntunnel bieten guten Unterschlupf. Die stäbchenreiche Netzhaut der Feuersalamanderaugen ist für die visuelle Orientierung in lichtarmen Habitaten wie stillgelegte Bergwerke besonders hilfreich. In Regionen mit weichen bzw. lockeren Böden graben sich die Lurche auch selbst eigene kleine Gänge mit einer Tiefe bis zu 16 cm, in die sie sich zurückziehen. Da adulte Feuersalamander sehr ortstreu sein können, behalten sie ihre Rückzugsgebiete und Laichplätze über lange Zeiträume bei., Eine besondere Vorliebe besitzen Feuersalamander für in Waldnähe gelegene, schattenreiche Friedhofsanlagen mit Altbaumbestand; sie bieten den Tieren bei günstiger Konstellation nahezu ideale Lebensmöglichkeiten:, Der Strukturwandel im Bestattungswesen (vermehrte Feuerbestattung) ändert inzwischen die allg. Beerdigungskultur auf öffentlichen Friedhöfen. Von daher werden die genannten landschaftstypischen Aspekte mittelfristig verschwinden., Aktivität., In Abhängigkeit zur geografischen Lage sind unterschiedliche Jahresaktivitäten zu beobachten. Im atlantisch geprägten Teil des westlichen Europas können die Salamander ganzjährig aktiv sein. Faktoren für einsetzende Aktivität sind Temperatur und relative Luftfeuchte sowie die eingestrahlte Tageslichtmenge. Bei starken Regenfällen, besonders nach längerer Trockenheit, verlassen Feuersalamander ihre Verstecke sogar tagsüber. Normalerweise liegt das Aktivitätsmaximum in der Nacht. Nach der Aktivitätsphase kehren die Tiere in der Morgendämmerung zum Tagesversteck zurück. Bei ihren nächtlichen Streifzügen können sie im Schnitt Strecken bis zu 350 m zurücklegen. Die weiteste Entfernung wurde von Reiner Klewen (1985) ermittelt. Sie lag bei 980 m., In den überdurchschnittlich heißen, trockenen Sommermonaten der Jahre 2019/20 verlagerte sich die Aktivität der heimischen Feuersalamander auf die Herbst- bzw. Wintermonate (Oktober/November). Generell gelten in Europa Temperaturen um den Gefrierpunkt als begrenzender Aktivitäts-Parameter. Dennoch gibt es in kalten Wintermonaten hin und wieder Beobachtungen von einzelnen Exemplaren, auch auf Schneefeldern. Oft handelt es sich um Weibchen., Normalerweise beginnt die Hauptaktivität der Weibchen mit der Laichzeit im März. Ab Mai finden sich dann überwiegend Männchen im Gelände. Offensichtlich spielen auch die Windverhältnisse eine wichtige Rolle. So verharren die Schwanzlurche bei starkem Wind in ihren Verstecken, trotz ansonsten optimaler äußerer Bedingungen., Begleitfauna., Ausgewachsene Feuersalamander sind aufgrund ihrer Lebensraumansprüche mit vergleichsweise wenigen anderen Amphibien vergesellschaftet.

While it did not have a strict separation of powers like many Western democracies, the Soviet Union had a distinct structure that aimed to distribute power among its different institutions. The key components of power distribution in the Soviet Union were: 1. Communist Party: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was the dominant political force in the country. It held ultimate authority and exercised control over all other institutions. The Party played a major role in decision-making processes, policymaking, and the appointment of key personnel across the government and other organizations. 2. Executive Power: The Soviet Union had a dual executive system, with power divided between the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (equivalent to a prime minister) and the General Secretary of the CPSU (the top position within the Party). Although they were separate positions, in practice, they were often held by the same person, leading to a concentration of power. 3. Legislative Power: The Supreme Soviet was the highest legislative body in the Soviet Union. However, its role was limited as it functioned mainly as a rubber-stamp institution, approving decisions made by the Party and the executive branch. The actual power to legislate rested with the Party and its centralized decision-making organs. 4. Judicial Power: The judicial system in the Soviet Union was under strict control of the Party. The courts were expected to uphold and enforce the laws created by the Party and focus on maintaining social order and political stability. The judiciary lacked independence from the party leadership, and political motivations often influenced their decisions. It is important to note that the Soviet Union's power structure was highly centralized and heavily influenced by the Communist Party. While there were some separation of powers on paper, the practical reality was the dominance of the Party in all aspects of governance."},{"instruction":"How would have power been distributed under the New Union Treaty?","output":"The New Union Treaty, which was proposed in 1991 but never ratified, aimed to transform the Soviet Union into a looser federation and distribute power among its constituent republics. While the treaty was never implemented, it outlined a new power-sharing structure that would have involved the following components: 1. Central Government: The central government would have had limited powers, primarily focusing on defense, foreign affairs, and economic coordination among the republics. It would have consisted of a President, a legislative body, and a judiciary. 2. Republics: Under the New Union Treaty, the Soviet Union would have been transformed into a federation of independent republics, each having its own constitution, executive branch, and legislative body. The republics would have had the authority to make decisions on a wide array of issues, including education, healthcare, and culture. 3. Concurrent Powers: Some powers would have been shared between the central government and the republics. These concurrent powers would have included economic planning, natural resources management, and environmental protection. Both levels of government would have cooperated and coordinated their efforts in these areas. 4. Defense and Foreign Affairs: Defense and foreign affairs would have been primarily under the control of the central government. The central government would have been responsible for providing for the defense of the entire union, negotiating with foreign governments, and representing the union in international organizations. 5. Judiciary: The New Union Treaty proposed the creation of a centralized judiciary to ensure the protection of individual rights and adjudicate disputes between the central government and the republics. The judiciary would have had the authority to interpret the constitution and the laws of the union. It is worth noting that the New Union Treaty was never ratified, and the Soviet Union dissolved later in 1991. The power distribution outlined in the treaty was never put into practice, and the constituent republics of the Soviet Union eventually became independent states."},{"instruction":"What would have been the separation of powers under the New Union Treaty?","output":"Under the proposed New Union Treaty, there would have been a separation of powers between the central government and the individual republics. While the specific details would have been determined by the treaty implementation, the general framework suggested a distribution of powers along the following lines: 1. Central Government: - Executive Power: The central government would have had an executive branch led by a President, who would have been responsible for defense, foreign affairs, and economic coordination among the republics. - Legislative Power: The central government would have had a legislative body responsible for passing laws on matters of national interest, defense, and foreign affairs. It would have been the supreme legislative authority of the proposed union. - Judicial Power: There would have been a central judiciary responsible for ensuring the rule of law and protecting individual rights. It would have had the authority to interpret the constitution and the laws of the proposed union. 2. Republics: - Executive Power: Each republic would have had its own executive branch led by a President or equivalent position. The republics would have been responsible for governing their territories, implementing policies on matters within their jurisdiction, and representing their interests at the central government level. - Legislative Power: Each republic would have had its own legislative body with the authority to pass laws within the republic's jurisdiction, including laws related to education, healthcare, and culture. - Judicial Power: Each republic would have had its own judiciary responsible for administering justice within its jurisdiction, resolving disputes, and protecting individual rights. The proposed separation of powers in the New Union Treaty aimed to strike a balance between the central government's authority over defense, foreign affairs, and economic coordination, and the autonomy of the individual republics in governing their own territories and making decisions in areas within their jurisdiction. However, it is important to note that the New Union Treaty was never ratified, and the Soviet Union dissolved shortly after its proposal. As a result, this proposed separation of powers was never put into practice."},{"instruction":"What are the separation of powers in Malaysia?","output":"In Malaysia, the separation of powers is defined by its Constitution, which establishes three main branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judiciary. However, it is important to note that the separation of powers in Malaysia is not as distinct as in some other democratic systems. There are overlapping responsibilities and instances where different branches interact and influence each other. Nonetheless, the general framework of separation of powers in Malaysia can be understood as follows: 1. Executive: - The executive branch is headed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, who is the constitutional monarch of Malaysia. The role of the monarch is mainly ceremonial, and executive power lies primarily in the hands of the Prime Minister. - The Prime Minister, appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, leads the government and exercises executive authority. The Prime Minister and Cabinet collectively make important policy decisions and implement laws. 2. Legislative: - The legislative branch of Malaysia is the bicameral Parliament, consisting of two houses: the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) and the Dewan Negara (Senate). - The Dewan Rakyat is made up of elected representatives from constituencies across the country, and it is responsible for making laws, passing budgets, and holding the executive accountable. - The Dewan Negara comprises appointed members, including representatives from the states and those appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. While it has limited legislative powers, its role includes reviewing and suggesting amendments to legislation proposed by the Dewan Rakyat. 3. Judiciary: - The judiciary in Malaysia is responsible for interpreting and applying the law. The highest court is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and the High Courts. - The judiciary is meant to be independent and impartial, ensuring the rule of law and protecting constitutional rights. Judges are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister after consulting the Chief Justice. In addition to these three main branches, there are several other bodies and institutions in Malaysia that play important roles, including the Election Commission, Attorney General's Chambers, and various government agencies. These entities create a complex web of relationships where power is distributed, although there can be instances of overlapping responsibilities or influence between them. It's worth noting that the Malaysian system of separation of powers has faced criticism, particularly regarding the concentration of power in the executive branch, limited judicial independence, and potential for political influence on certain institutions and processes."},{"instruction":"What are the separation of powers in Switzerland?","output":"Switzerland has a political system that is designed to foster a strong separation of powers. The separation of powers in Switzerland is based on the principle of federalism, which divides authority between the national government and the cantonal (state) governments. The key components of the separation of powers in Switzerland are: 1. Executive: - The Swiss Federal Council, which serves as the collective head of state and government, exercises executive power. It consists of seven members, elected by the Federal Assembly (legislature), and is responsible for implementing laws, managing government affairs, and representing Switzerland at the international level. - The Federal Council operates through various government departments, each headed by a Federal Councillor. These departments are responsible for specific policy areas, such as finance, foreign affairs, or justice. 2. Legislative: - The Swiss Parliament, known as the Federal Assembly, is the legislative branch. It is composed of two chambers: - The National Council (Nationalrat) represents the Swiss people and consists of 200 members elected through a proportional representation system. - The Council of States (Ständerat) represents the cantons and comprises 46 members, with each canton having two representatives and the six half-cantons having one. - The Federal Assembly is responsible for making laws, scrutinizing the executive branch, and approving the federal budget. It also has the authority to amend the constitution. 3. Judiciary: - The Swiss judiciary is independent and separate from the executive and legislative branches. The judicial system is administered by federal and cantonal courts. - The Federal Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority in Switzerland. It is responsible for ensuring the uniform application of federal law and reviewing decisions made by lower courts. - Each canton has its own judicial system, which handles matters related to regional and cantonal laws. 4. Federalism: - Federalism is a crucial aspect of the Swiss system. Under the principle of subsidiarity, powers and responsibilities are divided between the federal government and the cantonal governments. The cantonal governments have authority over matters not explicitly assigned to the federal government, such as education, healthcare, and police. This separation of powers, along with direct democracy mechanisms like referendums and initiatives, allows for a strong system of checks and balances in Switzerland. It ensures that power is distributed between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as between the federal and cantonal levels of government."},{"instruction":"What were the separation of powers during the Roman Republic?","output":"During the Roman Republic, which lasted from 509 BCE to 27 BCE, the political structure of Rome was characterized by a system of checks and balances, albeit in a different form than modern systems. While the Romans did not have a strict separation of powers as in contemporary democracies, power was divided among different institutions and magistrates. The separation of powers in the Roman Republic can be understood through the following components: 1. Senate (Senatus): - The Senate was one of the most influential institutions in the Roman Republic. It comprised around 300 members, mainly aristocrats and former magistrates, who served for life. - The Senate held significant authority. It deliberated on policies, foreign relations, and legislation proposed by magistrates. The Senate's recommendations and decrees were highly influential and carried significant weight. 2. Executive Magistrates: - The highest executive office in Rome was the two Consuls. The Consuls were elected annually by the people and had broad powers. They were responsible for commanding the army, convoking and presiding over the Senate and the assembly, and executing laws. - The Consuls could veto each other's actions, providing a system of balance within the executive branch. This veto power was intended to prevent abuses of power and encourage cooperation between the Consuls. 3. Assemblies (Comitia): - The Roman Republic featured several assemblies where Roman citizens, organized into various groups, could participate in decision-making. The general citizen body participated in legislative matters, elected magistrates, and voted on important issues. - The Assembly of the Centuries (Comitia Centuriata) and the Assembly of the Tribes (Comitia Tributa) were the primary legislative bodies. They could pass laws and make decisions on war and peace. - The assemblies played a crucial role in the election of magistrates and acted as a check on the power of the Senate and magistrates. 4. Judicial Magistrates: - Various magistrates were responsible for administering justice in the Roman Republic. These magistrates included Praetors, Quaestors, and Aediles, who presided over legal proceedings, ensured the enforcement of laws, and maintained public order. - The Roman Republic did not have a dedicated body like a supreme court. Instead, judicial powers were distributed among different magistrates who had the authority to adjudicate cases. It is important to note that the Roman political system was highly influenced by the oligarchic tendencies of the patrician class, and the extent of the separation of powers often favored the ruling nobility. Nevertheless, the system aimed to provide checks and balances by dividing powers between different institutions like the Senate, executive magistrates, and popular assemblies."},{"instruction":"Who were the Maratha?","output":"The Maratha people were a prominent socio-political and military community in India, primarily concentrated in the western region of the Indian subcontinent. They emerged as a powerful force during the 17th and 18th centuries in the wake of the decline of the Mughal Empire. The Marathas were descendants of the Marathi-speaking people, hailing from the region that covers present-day Maharashtra, Karnataka, and parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. Initially, the Marathas were mostly farmers and warriors belonging to the lower castes, but they gradually formed a confederacy under charismatic leaders and expanded their influence. The rise of the Marathas as a dominant force was led by charismatic leaders such as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who established the Maratha Empire in the 17th century. Shivaji and his successors utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and innovative military strategies to challenge the Mughal Empire's hegemony over the region. Under Shivaji's rule, the Marathas effectively used guerrilla tactics, established forts, and implemented administrative reforms in their territories. Post-Shivaji, the Marathas underwent expansion and faced power struggles among various factions and leaders. However, their influence continued to grow, and they eventually became a significant political and military force. The Marathas reached the pinnacle of their power during the reign of Peshwa Bajirao I in the 18th century. Bajirao I expanded Maratha territories through successful military campaigns and established an efficient administrative system known as the Peshwa administration. The Peshwa's effective governance allowed the Marathas to exert control over large parts of present-day India. The Maratha Empire's influence declined after the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, where they suffered a major defeat against the Afghan forces of Ahmad Shah Durrani. Although the Marathas continued to exist as a force for several decades, their centralized authority weakened, and they gradually lost power to the British East India Company, who took advantage of infighting among Maratha factions. Overall, the Marathas played a crucial role in shaping Indian history, challenging the supremacy of the Mughals, and establishing a significant regional power in western India. Their legacy is remembered for their military prowess, cultural contributions, and efforts towards regional unity."},{"instruction":"Can you condense your previous response to just a couple sentences?","output":"The Marathas were a powerful socio-political and military community in western India during the 17th and 18th centuries.

The Ashta Pradhan acted as an advisory council and held diverse responsibilities, contributing to the Marathas' ability to maintain autonomy from the Mughals. The ministers included the Peshwa (Prime Minister), Amatya (Finance Minister), Mantri (Minister of Foreign Affairs), Sachiv (Secretary), Dabir (Historian and Intelligence Minister), Senapati (Commander-in-Chief), Nyayadhish (Chief Justice), and Panditrao (Religious Affairs Minister). Each minister oversaw a specific area of governance, including finance, diplomacy, intelligence, military, justice, and administration, ensuring efficient functioning and decision-making within the empire. The collaborative efforts of the Ashta Pradhan supported Shivaji Maharaj's vision for a strong Maratha state, enabled effective resistance against the Mughals, and facilitated the Marathas' ability to assert their autonomy and maintain independence."},{"instruction":"东站联勤工作会议 会议时间：2023年2月21日 会议地点：东站警务站会议室 会议主题：通报近期各单位工作情况及关于加强年后巡逻防控、交通疏导等联勤工作安排 一、东站警务站通报近期辖区接报警情况，年后春运反弹每日进出站车辆人员较多以及旅客丢失行李情况增多，建议东站派出所、秀山大队对地下停车场的联勤巡控。 二、霍里派出所通报近期小区内盗窃类案件高发以及噪音扰民类警情增多，年后夜间需要东站警务站配合加强辖区巡逻防控工作。 三、巡警大队表示根据高铁东站以及长途客运站人流量增多，需加强\\"1、3、5\\"反恐的巡逻频次，并提出需要加强与武警和特警联勤强化\\"反恐防暴\\"能力。四、东站派出所通报近期每日东站客流量日渐增多，会加强对东站内外的巡逻工作，人员车辆的疏导工作。五、交警秀山大队通报近期酒后违法驾车情况频发，建议增加联勤查处酒后驾车等违法行为的查处。","output":"六、会议讨论并决定了以下工作安排： 1. 东站警务站将加强对地下停车场的联勤巡控工作，以确保车辆和旅客的安全，并减少丢失行李的情况发生。 2. 霍里派出所将与东站警务站配合，加强夜间巡逻防控工作，特别是针对小区内盗窃类案件和噪音扰民类警情的增多情况。 3. 巡警大队将增加巡逻频次，尤其是在高铁东站和长途客运站人流量增多的情况下，加强\\"1、3、5\\"反恐巡逻，并与武警和特警联勤，提升\\"反恐防暴\\"能力。 4. 东站派出所将加强对东站内外的巡逻工作，特别是随着东站客流量的增加，加强人员和车辆的疏导工作，确保秩序和安全。 5. 交警秀山大队将增加对酒后违法驾车等违法行为的查处力度，加强联勤工作，确保交通秩序和道路安全。 七、会议要求各单位做好工作落实，加强协同配合，确保联勤工作的顺利进行，并给予必要的支持和协助。同时，还要对相关工作进行监督和评估，及时总结经验，进一步完善联勤工作的机制和措施。"},{"instruction":"根据三月份“两会”召开，和315活动，提出几点要求","output":"根据三月份\\"两会\\"召开和315活动的特殊情况，我们提出以下几点要求： 1. 维护社会稳定：要加强社会面的安全防控，特别是在\\"两会\\"期间，加强对敏感事件和突发事件的应对和处理，确保社会的稳定和秩序。 2. 保障会议安全：要增加对会议场所及周边区域的安保力度，加强巡逻防控，严密监控可能存在的安全隐患，保证会议期间的安全和顺利进行。 3. 突出反腐倡廉意识：在315活动期间，要加大对违法违规行为的打击力度，特别是对于涉及食品安全、假冒伪劣产品、虚假宣传等问题要进行严厉查处，提高公众对消费者权益的保护感知。 4. 加强宣传引导：要通过媒体等渠道，加强宣传315活动的目的和意义，提高公众的消费意识和维权意识，引导消费者对商品和服务的合理评估，增强消费者的权益保护意识。 5. 加强执法监管：要加强对相关行业的执法监管，特别是对商家、企业等经营者进行监督，防止虚假宣传、价格欺诈、假冒伪劣产品等违法行为的发生，保障消费者的合法权益。 6. 加强信息安全：要加强对网络和信息系统的安全防控，特别是加强对重要会议、会场等网络设施的保护，防止网络攻击和信息泄露等安全问题的发生。 通过以上要求的落实，我们可以确保\\"两会\\"期间的安全和秩序，保障消费者的合法权益，推动社会的和谐稳定发展。"},{"instruction":"Thank my team member for all of his disciplined work ethic, team comradery and sales skills","output":"Dear [Team Member's Name], I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for your outstanding contributions to our team.

The Lion and the Mouse: Once, a hungry lion caught a tiny mouse in his paw. The mouse pleaded with the lion to spare its life, promising to return the favor someday. The lion, amused by the tiny creature's boldness, laughed and released it. Months later, the lion found himself trapped in a hunter's net. Hearing the lion's roar for help, the mouse remembered its promise and gnawed through the net, setting the lion free. The lion learned that even the smallest creatures can be helpful. 2. The Lion and the Hare: A lion and a hare were good friends. They would hunt together, with the hare's speed helping the lion catch prey. One day, they spotted a wounded antelope far away. The hare suggested a plan to trick the antelope by pretending to fight with the lion, thus distracting it. The plan succeeded, and the lion managed to catch the antelope. The lion realized that intelligence and cooperation were just as important as strength. 3. The Lion and the Elephant: In a jungle, a lion and an elephant were constantly arguing about who was stronger. Tired of their constant squabbles, the other animals organized a competition to settle the matter. The challenge was to carry the heaviest rock in the jungle. While the lion struggled and ultimately failed, the elephant carried the rock effortlessly. The lion understood that strength alone was not enough to be considered the greatest animal in the jungle. 4. The Lion and the Cheetah: A lion and a cheetah were competing to prove who was the fastest animal. They decided to have a race, with the winner gaining the title of the fastest creature in the animal kingdom. During the race, the cheetah sprinted ahead, leaving the lion far behind. However, as they reached the finish line, the lion roared loudly, scaring the cheetah, who stumbled and lost the race. The lion taught the cheetah that quick thinking and determination could sometimes beat sheer speed. 5. The Lion's Mane: In a pride of lions, a young cub was born without a mane. As the cub grew, he felt embarrassed about his lack of mane and was often mocked by other animals. Determined to prove himself, he developed exceptional strength and agility. One day, the pride was attacked by hyenas, and the cub's unique advantage became apparent – his lack of mane made it difficult for the hyenas to get a grip on him. The cub's courage and resourcefulness saved the pride, teaching everyone that appearance does not determine worth."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Ctenophora, Rippenquallen], Die Lobata sind eine biologisch bedeutsame Ordnung von Rippenquallen (Ctenophora) aus der Klasse Tentaculata. Sie zeichnen sich durch ihre muskulösen Mundlappen aus, die an Stelle der bei anderen Rippenquallen bevorzugt benutzten Tentakel zum Beutefang eingesetzt werden., Aufbau., Die Körperform der bis zu 25 Zentimeter großen Lobata wird durch drei senkrecht aufeinander stehende Achsen beschrieben, die \\"Körperlängsachse\\" zwischen Mund und Gleichgewichtsorgan, die \\"tentakuläre\\" Achse als Verbindungsachse der beiden Tentakelscheiden und die \\"pharyngeale\\" Achse senkrecht dazu. Die tentakuläre Achse ist kürzer als die pharyngeale Achse, so dass sich ein ovaler Querschnitt ergibt., Zwei große muskeldurchzogene Mundlappen flankieren den stielförmig vorstehenden Mund und die beiden auf der Mundseite gelegenen Tentakel, die je nach Art unterschiedlich deutlich ausgeprägt und in der Gattung \\"Ocyropsis\\" sogar ganz abwesend sind. Auf diese Weise entsteht zwischen der Mundseite und den beiden Mundlappen eine schirmartige Höhlung wie sie auch bei den nicht verwandten Quallen der Nesseltiere zu finden ist., An den beiden Tentakelscheiden entspringen je zwei langgezogene Vertiefungen in der Körperwand, die \\"aurikularen Furchen\\", die über die Schirmunterseite nach außen je zu einem Mundlappen hinlaufen und mit langen Fäden, den Tentillen, besetzt sind. Diese tragen zahlreiche Klebekörperchen (Colloblasten), die zum Beutefang dienen., Die wie bei allen Rippenquallen von der Statocyste, dem Gleichgewichtsorgan, am mundabgewandten Ende ausgehenden Kammrippen lassen sich in zwei Gruppen einteilen: Je zwei von ihnen laufen parallel in die beiden Mundlappen links und rechts des Mundes hinein; die vier anderen verlaufen senkrecht dazu annähernd in der Tentakelebene und setzen sich mundseitig in vier kegelförmigen Körperanhängen, den \\"Aurikeln\\", fort, die aber statt Kammplättchen lange Geißeln tragen. Eine Besonderheit der Lobata ist es, dass sich auf allen Kammrippen zwischen den einzelnen Plättchen eine mit Geißeln besetzte Furche befindet, die vermutlich auf mechanische Weise das Schlagsignal der Statocyste weiterleitet. Auch Beschädigungen der Kammrippen können so relativ schnell behoben werden. Letzteres könnte für die auf aktive Fortbewegung angewiesenen Lobata der entscheidende Grund für die Ausbildung dieser Innovation gewesen sein., Das vom zentral gelegenen Magen ausgehende Kanalsystem besteht aus zwei \\"paragastrischen\\" Kanälen, die an den beiden Schlundseiten entlang zum Mundende laufen sowie vier zum mundabgewandten Ende nach außen laufenden \\"Transversalkanälen\\". Diese teilen sich Y-förmig auf und setzen sich in den \\"Meridionalkanälen\\" fort, die unterhalb der Kammrippen zum Mundende laufen und dabei in zwei Schleifensystemen auch die Mundlappen durchqueren. Sie vereinigen sich in einem \\"zirkumoralen\\", also um den Mund herum gelegenen Ringkanal mit den Enden der paragastrischen Kanäle., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Lobata-Arten bilden einen wichtigen Bestandteil des Meeresplanktons und kommen weltweit in allen Meeresgewässern vor. Sie leben allesamt \\"pelagisch\\", also im freien Wasser., Fortbewegung und Ernährung., Lobata schwimmen mit der Mundseite voran; obwohl sie dazu unterstützend ihre Kammrippen einsetzen, kommt der Vortrieb hauptsächlich durch Wellenbewegungen ihrer muskulösen Mundlappen und Aurikeln zustande., Die auf den vier Aurikeln sitzenden Geißeln erzeugen eine Wasserströmung, durch die Beute wie Fischlarven, kleine Krebse und anderes Zooplankton um diese herum über die ausgestreckten Tentillen der aurikularen Tentillenbänder geleitet wird, wo sie an den durch Berührung aktivierten Colloblasten hängenbleibt und dann zum Mund transportiert wird., Die Aurikeln erzeugen nicht nur den zum Mund hingeleiteten Nahrungsstrom, sondern sind anscheinend auch zur Wahrnehmung in der Nähe befindlicher Beute befähigt und können die Strömungsrichtung des Wassers entsprechend aktiv steuern – Lobata-Rippenquallen zeigen damit ein größeres Verhaltensrepertoire, als man bis zum Ende des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts für möglich gehalten hätte., Das zum Beutefang eingesetzte System der Mundlappen und Aurikeln kann als Alternative zu den Tentakeln angesehen werden: Im Gegensatz zu diesen ermöglicht es die ununterbrochene Nahrungsaufnahme von passiv im Wasser schwebender oder nur langsam schwimmender Beute aus dem Mikro- und Mesozooplankton. Anders als die zweite größere Gruppe von Rippenquallen, die Cydippida, die in einem als „Spin Capture“ bezeichneten Vorgang immer erst ihre Tentakel einziehen und durch eine Drehung ihres Körpers zum Mundende bringen müssen, sind sie daher eher auf kleinere Beute spezialisiert. Als Folge treten sie mit den Cydippida kaum in Nahrungskonkurrenz, sondern können durch ihre alternative Strategie mit diesen koexistieren. Von manchen Wissenschaftlern wird dies als selektiver Vorteil angesehen, der die stammesgeschichtliche Entstehung der Lobata aus Cydippida-ähnlichen Vorfahren begünstigt hat., Fortpflanzung., Lobata pflanzen sich ausschließlich auf sexuelle Weise fort. Die meisten sind Zwitter, besitzen also sowohl männliche als auch weibliche Keimdrüsen; Selbstbefruchtung spielt dennoch wahrscheinlich nur bei den Arten der Gattung \\"Mnemiopsis\\" eine große Rolle. Oft werden erst die männlichen und dann die weiblichen Keimzellen ins Wasser abgegeben, wo die Befruchtung stattfindet. Die weitere Entwicklung läuft über ein Cydippea-Stadium, das wie eine Miniaturversion einer Cydippida-Rippenqualle aussieht, aber noch keine Mundlappen hat. Da sich die Jungtiere weder im Lebensraum noch im Aussehen wesentlich von den Erwachsenen unterscheiden, spricht man meist nicht von einer Larve, die Entwicklung ist also direkt., Bei den Arten der Gattung \\"Ocyropsis\\" treten die Geschlechtsorgane im Gegensatz zu allen anderen Rippenquallen immer getrennt auf, es lassen sich also männliche und weibliche Individuen unterscheiden., Ein bemerkenswertes Phänomen, dass bei einigen Lobata-Arten auftritt, ist die so genannte \\"Dissogenie\\": Einige Jungtiere werden vorzeitig geschlechtsreif und beginnen mit der Produktion von Keimzellen; im Laufe der weiteren Entwicklung bilden sich ihre Keimdrüsen jedoch zurück, um erst in der Erwachsenenphase wiederzukehren., Einfluss von Lobata in fremden Ökosystemen., Im Jahr 1982 wurde die Lobata-Art Mnemiopsis leidyi erstmals im vorher nicht von Rippenquallen besiedelten Schwarzen Meer beobachtet, wohin sie vermutlich mit dem Ballastwasser von Schiffen gelangt war, die zuvor die Gewässer des nordwestlichen Atlantik durchquert hatten. Ohne natürliche Feinde explodierte die Population wenige Jahre später und vertilgte nicht nur zahlreiche Fischeier und -larven, sondern verdrängte auch erfolgreich innerhalb von nur zehn Jahren alle Nahrungskonkurrenten um die Planktonbestände, so dass insbesondere die Sardellen-Fischerei vollkommen zusammenbrach. Die Vorteile von \\"Mnemiopsis leidyi\\" bestanden anscheinend nicht nur darin, ihre Konkurrenten schon im Ei- oder Larvenstadium vertilgen zu können, sondern auch in der früher begonnenen Nahrungsaufnahme, so dass das vorhandene Zooplankton mengen- und artenmäßig bereits erheblich reduziert war, wenn die verbliebenen Fischlarven schließlich zu erwachsenen Tieren herangereift waren., Erst mit dem zusätzlichen Auftreten einer weiteren, auf \\"Mnemiopsis leidyi\\" als Beutetier spezialisierten Rippenqualle, \\"Beroe ovata\\", im Jahre 1997 gelangte das Ökosystem wieder ins Gleichgewicht; dennoch ist seitdem das Schwarze Meer mit zwei ortsfremden Arten besiedelt. Ein ähnliches Phänomen ist zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts im Kaspischen Meer zu beobachten, wohin \\"Mnemiopsis leidyi\\" 1998 oder 1999 vermutlich im Ballastwasser von Schiffen gelangte, die den Wolga-Don-Kanal befahren., Inzwischen ist sie auch in die westl. Ostsee verschleppt worden, wie Funde im Oktober 2006 in der Kieler Förde belegen., Stammesgeschichte., Fossilien, die den Lobata zugeordnet werden können, sind bis heute nicht bekannt, so dass die stammesgeschichtlichen Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse allein aus dem Vergleich mit anderen modernen Rippenquallen erschlossen werden müssen. Eine vorläufige molekulargenetische Studie ergab, dass eine Gruppe aus den Lobata zusammen mit den Cestida und den Thalassocalycida ein monophyletisches Taxon bildet, also alle Nachkommen des letzten gemeinsamen Vorfahren dieser Tiere umfasst. Morphologische Eigenheiten der Ganeshida, einer Ordnung, die in die vorbenannte Studie nicht einbezogen wurde, deuten darauf hin, dass auch dieses Taxon möglicherweise in denselben Verwandtschaftskreis gehört., Systematik., Ob die Lobata selbst ein monophyletisches Taxon darstellen, ist noch nicht geklärt; möglicherweise sind einige Lobata-Arten enger mit Rippenquallen aus der Ordnung Thalassocalycida verwandt als mit anderen Lobata-Arten. In diesem Falle wäre das Taxon Lobata paraphyletisch, umfasste also nicht alle Nachkommen der Stammart., Die folgende Aufstellung (Stand: 25.

Ihre ersten Gedichte schrieb sie im Alter von elf Jahren nicht unter dem Namen Gorenko, da ihr Vater um seinen guten Ruf fürchtete – sie wählte den Namen ihres bulgarischen Urgroßvaters Chan Achmat als Pseudonym., Wie Puschkin 90 Jahre vor ihr erhielt Achmatowa ihre Schulausbildung im exklusiven Lyzeum von Zarskoje Selo. Ihr Verhältnis zu dem wichtigsten russischen Dichter zieht sich von Beginn an wie ein roter Faden durch ihre Arbeiten: Im September 1911, zum 100-jährigen Jubiläum des Lyzeums, verfasste sie ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \\"Der dunkelhäutige Knabe schlenderte durch die Alleen\\", in dem es Anspielungen auf den jungen Puschkin gibt. Bereits in diesem Gedicht wird die typische Metonymietechnik der Achmatowa deutlich: Ohne Lyzeum und Puschkin beim Namen zu nennen, wird durch typische Eigenschaften und Gegenstände (hier: dunkelhäutig, der Lyzeums-Dreispitz usw.) klar, wer und was gemeint ist., Nachdem ihre Eltern sich 1905 getrennt hatten, lebte sie mit ihrer Mutter und den Geschwistern ein Jahr lang in Jewpatorija auf der Krim. Das letzte Schuljahr verbrachte sie schließlich am Kiewer Funduklejew-Gymnasium. Von 1907 bis 1910 studierte Achmatowa in Kiew in „Höheren Frauenkursen“ Jura, wobei sie sich vor allem für die Grundkurse in Rechtsgeschichte und Latein interessierte und den rein juristischen Fachthemen gleichgültig gegenüberstand., Im Jahr 1910 heiratete sie den Dichter Nikolai Gumiljow, den sie schon seit ihrer Schulzeit kannte und der ihr lange und verzweifelt den Hof gemacht hatte. Es folgten gemeinsame Reisen nach Paris und Italien, wo sie u.a. den Künstler Modigliani traf – seine Zeichnungen der Achmatowa sind später berühmt geworden – und Zeugin der ersten triumphalen Erfolge der russischen Balletttänzer in Westeuropa wurde. Malerei und Architektur Italiens beeindruckten sie tief., Vor der Revolution., Achmatowa, Gumiljow und Ossip Mandelstam wurden zu den zentralen Vertretern der Literaturbewegung des Akmeismus (von griech. \\"akme\\", Gipfel, Höhepunkt, Blütezeit). Die so genannte „Zeche“ um diese Dichter bildete eine Gegenströmung zum Symbolismus, dessen Metaphorik des Jenseitigen, Metaphysischen die Akmeisten eine eigene Poesie jedes „irdischen Dings“ und eine entschiedene Diesseitigkeit entgegensetzten. Achmatowas Gedichte zeichnen sich daher durch eine einfache und prägnante Sprache aus. Anders als bei den „esoterisch“ angehauchten Treffen der Symbolisten waren die Zusammenkünfte der Akmeisten eher „Workshops“, in denen u.a. neue Schreibtechniken erarbeitet wurden., Neben Puschkin fand Achmatowa ihre dichterischen Wurzeln bei Innokenti Annenski (1856–1909), einem Vorläufer der Akmeisten, außerdem bei dem französischen Symbolisten Verlaine und dem jungen Majakowski., Nach ihrer Rückkehr nach Sankt Petersburg studierte Achmatowa Literaturgeschichte und schrieb die Gedichte, die in ihren ersten Gedichtband \\"Abend\\" (, 1912) eingingen. Es waren vor allem Liebesgedichte, in denen sie Trennung, Kummer und Liebesleid beschrieb wie beispielsweise in der letzten Strophe ihres Gedichtes „Lied von der letzten Begegnung“:, Sie verwendete in ihren lakonischen, knappen Gedichten Alltagssprache, in denen Gefühle gestisch angedeutet werden. Ein linker Handschuh, der aus Versehen auf die rechte Hand gestreift wird, wird zum Ausdruck der Verzweiflung und Verwirrtheit der Beschriebenen, die äußerlich ruhig bleibt:, Im Oktober 1912 wurde Achmatowas einziger Sohn Lew geboren. Schon 1914 erschien ihr zweites Buch, \\"Rosenkranz\\" (), das trotz der Ereignisse des beginnenden Weltkrieges, wie schon der erste Band, ein großer Erfolg wurde. Diese Sammlung enthielt auch das im Januar 1914 entstandene Gedicht \\"Für Alexander Blok\\" (), ein Indiz für ihre enge Beziehung zu dem Dichter des Symbolismus, die sie immer wieder als platonisch, „ausschließlich poetisch“ bezeichnete. Auch von Alexander Blok gibt es eine Reihe von Gedichten, die der Achmatowa gewidmet sind (z.B. \\"An Anna Achmatowa\\", ). Ihre erste Begegnung hatte 1913 stattgefunden. Während der Symbolist in seinen Gedichten über Weiblichkeit und Schönheit sinnierte, wählte Achmatowa ihren gewohnt sparsamen, nüchternen Stil: „Ich habe den Dichter besucht. Gerade Mittag. Sonntag. Das Zimmer geräumig. Vor den Fenstern Frost.“ Allerdings schildert das unmittelbar vor diesem im \\"Rosenkranz\\" gedruckte Gedicht (\\"Der Gast\\",, Januar 1914) eine zärtliche Begegnung mit einem Mann, dessen Schilderung auf Blok zutraf. Diese Übereinstimmungen führten gelegentlich zu der Vermutung, dass die Beziehung der beiden Dichter intimer war als offiziell bekannt., Auch der nächste Gedichtband, \\"Die weiße Schar\\" (), fiel bei seinem Erscheinen 1917 in eine historisch unruhige Zeit. Die chaotischen Zustände zu Beginn der Revolution schmälerten den Verkaufserfolg des Buches., Repressionen in der jungen Sowjetunion., Nach der Oktoberrevolution arbeitete Achmatowa als Bibliothekarin im Landwirtschaftlichen Institut. Von 1922 an bis 1940 wurden ihre Gedichte nicht mehr gedruckt, da sie den kommunistischen Machthabern zu wenig gesellschaftlich relevant, zu privat waren. In der Sowjetenzyklopädie hieß es, ihre Gedichte seien mit religiös-mystischen und erotischen Motiven überladen, mit denen sie die Jugend vergifte. Ihre älteren Werke fanden nur unter der Hand im Samisdat Verbreitung. Lew Kopelew schrieb über sie: \\"Ihre Verse blieben im Gedächtnis haften, wurden je nach Stimmung wieder hervorgeholt … Damals war man noch bereit zuzugestehen, daß auch Klassenfeinde und unversöhnliche weltanschauliche Gegner selbstlos, edelmütig und tapfer sein konnten. Ein derartiger „liberaler Objektivismus“ war noch keine Todsünde, noch keine Straftat.\\", Ihr Ehemann Gumiljow, von dem sie sich 1918 hatte scheiden lassen, wurde 1921 wegen angeblicher konterrevolutionärer Aktivitäten erschossen., Dem Mosaizist Boris Anrep, dem sie sehr nahestand, wollte sie nicht ins westliche Ausland folgen, weil sie sich nicht vorstellen konnte, ihre Heimat und ihr Volk zu verlassen. Ihre nächste Liebe, der Literaturkritiker Nedobrowo, starb 1919 an Schwindsucht. Nach einer zweiten, von 1918 bis 1922 dauernden und unglücklich verlaufenden Ehe mit dem Assyriologen und Übersetzer Wladimir Schileiko (1891–1930), der ihre Gedichte zum Teil verbrannt haben soll, lebte sie ab 1926 bis 1938 mit dem Kunsthistoriker Nikolai Nikolajewitsch Punin (1888–1953) zusammen, wobei das Paar zum Teil in einer angespannten Situation in einer Wohnung mit Punins Noch-Ehefrau und deren Tochter wohnte. Oftmals lebte Achmatowa in dieser Zeit buchstäblich von Brot und Tee, wobei sie ihr Selbstbewusstsein und ihren eigenen Stil nie aufgab., 1930 bis zum Ausbruch des Krieges., Sowohl ihr Sohn Lew als auch ihr Ehemann Nikolai Punin wurden in den 1930er Jahren mehrfach verhaftet. Ihr Sohn wurde nach dem anfänglichen Todesurteil in die Verbannung geschickt und erst im April 1956, drei Jahre nach Stalins Tod, endgültig nach Hause entlassen. Insgesamt verbrachte er anderthalb Jahrzehnte in Lagerhaft. Ihr Ehemann Nikolai Punin starb 1953 im Arbeitslager Workuta., In der Zeit der Inhaftierung ihres Sohnes verbrachte Achmatowa viel Zeit in den Warteschlangen der Angehörigen vor dem Gefängnis. In \\"Requiem\\", das sie in dieser Zeit zu schreiben begann und das ein einziges Klagelied gegen den Stalin-Terror ist, schrieb sie anstelle eines Vorworts folgenden kurzen Prosatext:, Für Achmatowa waren diese Jahre ein nicht endender Albtraum. Sie rechnete stets damit, dass an ihrem Sohn das Todesurteil vollstreckt wurde. Die neben Achmatowa andere bedeutende russische Lyrikerin des 20. Jahrhunderts, Marina Zwetajewa, die Achmatowa mit dem Zitat „Anna von ganz Russland“ ehrte, erhängte sich 1941 völlig verarmt. Freunde verschwanden, darunter ihr jahrelanger Wegbegleiter Ossip Mandelstam, der während seiner Verhöre in der Lubjanka im Jahre 1934 seine Gedichte über Stalin sogar für seine Folterknechte niederschrieb. Trotzdem wurde er nicht wie damals üblich in den Gulag geschickt, sondern von Stalin, dem der Dichter zur damaligen Zeit tot gefährlicher gewesen wäre als lebendig, versucht ihn \\"zu isolieren, aber am Leben zu erhalten\\". Die Mandelstams wurden daraufhin ins Exil nach Woronesch, 400km südlich von Moskau, verbannt und durften 1937 wieder ins Moskauer Gebiet – wenn auch nicht in die Hauptstadt selbst – zurückkehren. Im Herbst desselben Jahres besuchten die Mandelstams Achmatowa im Fontänenhaus in Leningrad, wo sie auf dem Sofa ihres Zimmers schlafen mussten, da sie keine eigene Unterkunft hatten. Achmatowa schrieb während dieses letzten Besuches der beiden ein Gedicht für Ossip Mandelstam, den sie wie einen Zwillingsbruder ansah. Das Gedicht handelte von der Stadt – Leningrad –, welche sie beide liebten., Mandelstam wurde jedoch sechs Monate später erneut verhaftet und zu fünf Jahren Zwangsarbeit im ostsibirischen Kolyma verurteilt. Auf der Fahrt nach Kolyma kam er, wie im Gedicht beschrieben, am Jenissei sowie: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Akmeismus, Autor, Bibliothekar, Dissident, Ehrendoktor, Frau, Gestorben 1966, Russland, Literatur, Geboren 1889"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Geboren im 6. oder 7.

Um 623/624 gründete er das in Mitteleuropa gelegene \\"Reich des Samo\\" (lateinisch: \\"regnum Samoni\\"), welches Samo bis zu seinem Tod 35 Jahre lang als König (\\"rex\\") regiert haben soll. Das weitere Schicksal des Reiches nach Samos Tod ist unbekannt. Sein Zentrum befand sich vermutlich im südlichen March-Gebiet, das heißt dem heutigen Mähren, Niederösterreich und der Südwest-Slowakei. Seine genaue Ausdehnung ist aber umstritten., Das Reich des Samo gilt als das erste bekannte politische Gebilde der Slawen. Es war noch kein „Staat“, sondern eher ein Stammesbund oder eine höhere Stufe eines Stammesbundes, eine Konföderation mehrerer mehr oder weniger selbstständiger „Fürstentümer“ (\\"ducates\\")., Quellenlage., Die schriftlichen Quellen zu Samo und seinem Reich sind spärlich. Die einzige zeitgenössische Quelle, die von den Ereignissen berichtet, ist die Fredegarchronik (IV 48 und IV 68) aus dem 7. Jahrhundert. Deren zweiter Teil, in dem die Geschichte der Franken zwischen 584 und 642/643 beschrieben wird, gilt als Hauptquelle der merowingischen Geschichte dieser Zeit. Das Problem dieser Quelle ist, dass sie ausschließlich die fränkische Perspektive enthält, Ereignisse, die keinen Bezug zum Frankenreich hatten, nicht erwähnt werden und ein Korrektiv für die slawische Sicht nicht zur Verfügung steht., Alle anderen Quellen sind von der Fredegarchronik abgeleitet und erheblich jünger. Dabei handelt es sich um die \\"Gesta Dagoberti\\" aus dem ersten Drittel des 9. Jahrhunderts aus der Abtei Saint-Denis bei Paris sowie vor allem um die um 870 verfasste \\"Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum\\" aus Salzburg, einem Zentrum des bayerischen Klerus, die aber in mehreren Teilen von den \\"Gesta Dagoberti\\" abgeleitet ist., Samos Herkunft., In der Fredegar-Chronik (IV, 48) wird ein \\"homo nomen Samo, natione Francos, de pago Senonago\\" genannt (\\"Ein Mann namens Samo, fränkischer Herkunft, aus dem Gau von „Senonago“\\"). Dieser Satz kann jedoch unterschiedlich übersetzt und gedeutet werden. Teilweise wird heute davon ausgegangen, dass Senonago der heutigen französischen Stadt Sens südöstlich von Paris entspricht. Anderen Quellen zufolge handelt es sich beim Senonago allerdings um Soignies oder Sennegau. Mit „\\"natione Francos\\"“ wurden in Quellen im 7. Jahrhundert allgemein die Bewohner des Frankenreichs bezeichnet., Heute eher sekundär sind andere Deutungen, die jedoch recht zahlreich sind. So wird Samo entgegen den Angaben in der Fredegar-Chronik als Slawe gesehen, vor allem aufgrund einiger Angaben in der \\"Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum\\" (siehe dazu unten den Abschnitt zur geographischen Lage). Neuerdings wird manchmal das Wort Samo als altslawischer Rangtitel betrachtet: Samo soll „Herr“ oder „Selbstherrscher“ bedeuten, vor allem da „samo-“ in slawischen Sprachen „selbst-“ bedeutet. Es gibt aber auch bereits veraltete Ansichten, dass Samo eine Abkürzung des slawischen Namens Samoslav ist. Und schließlich könnte der Name vom hebräischen Samuel abgeleitet sein., Ereignisse., Vor Samos Ankunft., Die Slawen ließen sich spätestens um 500 in der heutigen Südslowakei, im Laufe des 6. Jahrhunderts auch in Mähren, im nördlichen Niederösterreich, nordwestlichen Böhmen, in Kärnten, Osttirol, im Salzburger Lungau und in der Steiermark, im nördlichen Slowenien und im nördlichen Kroatien nieder. Vereinzelte Slawen gab es auch im heutigen Ungarn. Die Gebiete um die mittlere Donau wurden von Langobarden und Gepiden beherrscht. Südlich davon befand sich das Byzantinische Reich, östlich und nördlich all dieser Gebiete lebten ausschließlich Slawen und westlich der Gebiete befand sich das Frankenreich., In dieser Situation kamen 567 aus Asien die nomadischen Awaren in das heutige Ostungarn. Danach schlugen sie in einer Allianz mit den Langobarden die Gepiden vollständig, die als selbständiger Verband untergingen. 568 drängten sie auch die Langobarden zu einer Umsiedlung nach Norditalien, siedelten sich nun auch im heutigen Westungarn an und gründeten dort ihr Kaganat. Dieses mächtige Awarenreich unterwarf am Ende des 6. Jahrhunderts die Slawen in den besetzten Gebieten und in den Grenzgebieten., Das Reich des Samo., Der Aufstand., Der Text der Fredegar-Chronik setzt im Jahre 623/624 ein, im 40. Regierungsjahr des fränkischen Königs Chlothar II. In diesem Jahr unternahm dieser Quelle zufolge der \\"negucians\\" (vielleicht Unterhändler) Samo mit seinen Gefährten eine Handelsreise zu den „\\"auch als Wenden bezeichneten Slawen\\"“. Trotz eines fränkischen Verbotes lieferte Samos Karawane, genauso wie damals andere Kaufleute aus Gallien, vermutlich vor allem Waffen an die Slawen. Die „Karawanen“ waren zu dieser Zeit militärisch gut ausgerüstet und geschützt, und sie wurden von Kriegern begleitet. Gelegentlich wird die nicht durch Quellen belegbare Ansicht vertreten, Samo sei ein Sklavenhändler gewesen, der sich bei den Slawen neue „Ware“ holte., Zu dieser Zeit begannen die Slawen einen Aufstand gegen die awarische Oberhoheit. Die Gründe waren den Quellen zufolge, dass sie gezwungen waren, in den ersten Reihen in der awarischen Armee zu kämpfen, dass sie den Awaren hohen Tribut leisten mussten, sowie dass die Awaren bei den Slawen alljährlich den Winter verbrachten und mit ihren slawischen Frauen Kinder zeugten. Die Aufständischen waren den Quellen zufolge Kinder awarischer Väter und slawischer Mütter. Der Aufstand brach in einer Zeit aus, als sich die Awaren, zusammen mit den Persern und von südlichen Slawen unterstützt, zur Eroberung von Konstantinopel anschickten, und war vielleicht dank diesem Umstand erfolgreich. Die Awaren erlitten 626 zusammen mit den Sassaniden bei der Belagerung von Konstantinopel eine schwere Niederlage., Samo und seine Gruppe nahmen nach ihrer Ankunft bei den Slawen zwangsläufig am Kampf der Slawen gegen die Awaren teil und seine „militärische Fähigkeit“ verhalf laut Fredegar-Chronik den Slawen zum Sieg. Die Forscher interpretieren diesen Teil so, dass entweder Samo selbst ein guter Kämpfer oder Kampfführer war oder dass die militärische Begleitung seiner Karawane sehr hilfreich war bzw. dass Samos Hilfe in der Lieferung von Waffen und in der Kontaktaufnahme mit dem fränkischen König bestand. Daraufhin wurde Samo laut Fredegar-Chronik von den Slawen wegen seiner entscheidenden Beteiligung an einer siegreichen Schlacht zum \\"rex\\" („König“) gewählt. Manche Historiker ziehen die Begriffe „Anführer“ oder „Fürst“ vor. \\"Rex\\" war zumindest derselbe Titel, den auch der Herrscher des Frankenreichs trug. Dabei ist nicht ausgeschlossen, dass Samo von Dagobert I., dem Sohn Chlothars, der zu dieser Zeit von seinem Vater als Unterkönig im austrasischen Reichsteil eingesetzt worden war, zu den Slawen ausgesandt wurde. Das Ziel einer solchen Aktion war möglicherweise, eine weitere Macht zwischen den Awaren und dem fränkischen Reich aufzubauen und sein Reich so vor awarischen Angriffen zu schützen. Andere sehen dagegen in Samo einen „Kompromisskandidaten“, auf den sich mehrere slawische Anführer einigen konnten. Die Wahl fiel demnach auf einen Fremden, um nicht einen der konkurrierenden Anführer gegenüber den anderen zu bevorzugen., Samos Herrschaft., Samo passte sich dem neuen kulturellen Umfeld rasch an. In der Fredegar-Chronik wird erwähnt, dass er zwölf slawische Frauen und mit ihnen 22 Söhne und 15 Töchter gehabt habe. Dabei soll es sich den Ansichten einiger Historiker zufolge um Frauen aus den verschiedenen von Samo beherrschten Fürstentümern gehandelt haben, das heißt um „politische Heiraten“, woraufhin sich auch zwölf Stämme unter seiner Führung zusammengeschlossen hätten. Angesichts der vielfältigen Bedeutung der Zahl im Mittelalter sollte die Verlässlichkeit dieser Angabe jedoch nicht überschätzt werden. Unter Samos Herrschaft sollen die Slawen noch weitere erfolgreiche Kriege gegen die Awaren geführt haben., Ansonsten informiert die Fredegar-Chronik über das Reich des Samo nur insofern, als es einen Bezug zu den Franken gab. So wird angegeben, dass das von den Awaren befreite Gebiet von weiteren fränkischen Kaufleuten aufgesucht wurde. Im Jahr 631/632 beraubten und töteten Slawen eine Gruppe fränkischer Kaufleute. Daraufhin schickte Dagobert Gesandte in Samos Reich, um Wiedergutmachung für diesen Mord und Diebstahl zu verlangen. Es wird angenommen, dass Dagobert diesen Zwischenfall zum Anlass nahm, eine intensivere „Ostpolitik“ zu beginnen. Allerdings gehörte der Schutz der fränkischen Untertanen auch innerhalb eines fremden Machtbereichs zu den Aufgaben des Königs. Die Verhandlungen, die ein Sicharius im Auftrage König Dagoberts führte, blieben erfolglos. Die Fredegar-Chronik beschreibt sie wie folgt:, \\"… wie es bei den Heiden und törichten Hochmütigen üblich ist, machte Samo nichts von dem, was sein Volk verbrochen hatte, wieder gut, sondern er wollte nur … dass gegenseitig Recht und Gerechtigkeit hinsichtlich dieser und anderer Anschuldigungen, die sich zwischen den Parteien ergaben, geltend gemacht wird. Sicharius … sprach Samo gegenüber unangebrachte [ungerechte/beleidigende] Worte, die ihm nicht auferlegt worden waren, ja sogar Drohungen aus, dass Samo und sein Volk Dagobert zum „servicium“ [Dienstbarkeit oder Unterstellung unter seine Macht] verpflichtet sind. Samo antwortete bereits mit Wut: „Das Land, welches wir innehaben, ist das Land Dagoberts, und wir sind auch die seinen, vorausgesetzt jedoch, dass er anordnet, dass mit uns Frieden gehalten wird.“ Sicharius sagte: „Es ist nicht möglich, dass Christen und Diener Gottes Freundschaft mit Hunden schließen.“ Samo erwiderte: „Wenn ihr die Diener Gottes seid und wir die Hunde Gottes, [dann] während ihr ununterbrochen gegen Gott hand: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Sie begann im Februar 1978 mit Filbingers Unterlassungsklage gegen den Dramatiker Rolf Hochhuth, der ihn öffentlich als „furchtbaren Juristen“ bezeichnet hatte., Im weiteren Verlauf wurden vier Todesurteile entdeckt, die Filbinger als Militärrichter der Kriegsmarine 1943 und 1945 beantragt oder gefällt hatte. Er bestritt zuvor drei davon und gab dann an, sie vergessen zu haben, hielt aber an ihrer Rechtmäßigkeit fest. Angesichts der wachsenden öffentlichen Kritik verlor er den Rückhalt der CDU, der er seit 1951 angehörte. Daraufhin trat er am 7. August 1978 als Ministerpräsident zurück., Seine bis zu seinem Tod am 1. April 2007 fortgesetzten Rehabilitierungsversuche und eine umstrittene Trauerrede Günther Oettingers für ihn hielten die Erinnerung an die Affäre wach. Sie beeinflusste die Vergangenheitsbewältigung in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und die Rehabilitierung der Opfer der NS-Militärjustiz. Filbingers Verhalten in der NS-Zeit gilt heute als Beispiel für das Versagen vieler Täter und Mitläufer unter damaligen Juristen., Vorgeschichte., Militärrichter im und nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg., Filbinger war während seiner Juristenausbildung 1937 NSDAP-Mitglied und 1940 freiwillig Soldat in der deutschen Kriegsmarine geworden. Im März 1943 wurde er in die Marinejustiz berufen. Er wirkte nacheinander an fünf Militärgerichten in Norddeutschland und Norwegen und nahm an mindestens 234 Strafverfahren teil. In 169 Fällen war er als Vorsitzender Richter direkt für Urteil und Strafverfügung verantwortlich, in 63 Fällen indirekt als Ankläger oder Untersuchungsführer. Nach Kriegsende wurde er als Kriegsgefangener der Briten in Oslo bis Februar 1946 zur Lageraufsicht weiter als Marinerichter eingesetzt., Dieses Kapitel seiner Biografie wurde erstmals 1972 zum Medienthema, aber erst 1978 bundesweit öffentlich debattiert. Bis dahin unbeachtete Akten von 41 Verfahren, an denen Filbinger beteiligt war, wurden bis zum 13. Juni 1978 im Bundesarchiv, Zweigstelle Kornelimünster, aufgefunden, aber von ihm nicht zur Einsicht freigegeben., Filbingers Prozess gegen den \\"Spiegel\\" 1972., Die Zeitschrift \\"Der Spiegel\\" berichtete am 10. April 1972 von \\"Kurt Olaf Petzold\\", der sich als Gefangener in einem britischen Kriegsgefangenenlager Hakenkreuze von seiner Kleidung gerissen und einen Umzugsbefehl mit den Worten verweigert hatte: „Ihr habt jetzt ausgeschissen. Ihr Nazihunde, Ihr seid schuld an diesem Krieg. Ich werde bei den Engländern schon sagen, was Ihr für Nazihunde seid, dann kommt meine Zeit.“ Marinerichter Filbinger verurteilte ihn dafür am 1. Juni 1945 zu sechs Monaten Gefängnis und begründete dies mit einem „hohen Maß von Gesinnungsverfall“. Petzold habe „zersetzend und aufwiegelnd für die Manneszucht gewirkt“. Der Begriff „Manneszucht“ stammte aus preußischer Militärtradition und bestimmte im Nationalsozialismus Soldatenausbildung und Militärrecht. Mit einer „Gefahr für die Manneszucht“ hatten Wehrmachtsrichter, besonders oft die der Marine, in der letzten Kriegsphase tausende Todesstrafen für meist geringfügige Dienst- oder Disziplinvergehen begründet., Im Interview mit dem \\"Spiegel\\" erklärte Petzold 1972, Filbinger habe vor seinem Prozess „unseren geliebten Führer“ gerühmt, der „das Vaterland wieder hochgebracht hat“. Filbinger klagte auf Unterlassung dieser Aussagen. Er erinnere sich nicht mehr an den Fall, habe sich aber als „religiöse Persönlichkeit“ „vielfach aktiv gegen dieses Regime betätigt“. Er sei 1933 wegen antinazistischer Gesinnung von der Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes ausgeschlossen worden und später Mitglied eines bekannten regimefeindlichen Freiburger Kreises gewesen. Zudem habe er als unbeteiligter Marinerichter für den wegen „Wehrkraftzersetzung“ zum Tod verurteilten Priester Karl Heinz Möbius im Frühjahr 1945 ein Wiederaufnahmeverfahren erreicht, in dem Möbius freigesprochen worden sei. Für den Oberleutnant \\"Guido Forstmeier\\" habe er durch Verzögern der Verhandlung ein drohendes Todesurteil abgewendet., Akten zu diesen Fällen legte Filbinger nicht vor; sie wurden auch im späteren Verlauf nicht aufgefunden. Doch beide Genannten bezeugten mehrfach schriftlich, dass Filbinger ihr Leben gerettet habe. Adolf Harms, Kollege Filbingers als Marinerichter und seit 1944 am gleichen Militärgericht tätig, bezeugte, dieser habe zum NS-Regime „eine ausgesprochen negative Einstellung“ gehabt. Das Gericht gab Filbingers Klage am 3. August 1972 statt, weil es die von Petzold zitierten Aussagen für unwahrscheinlich hielt und eine Verwechslung vermutete., Filbingers Gedenkrede 1974., Zum Gedenken an das Attentat vom 20. Juli 1944 hielt Filbinger als Bundesratspräsident im Berliner Reichstagsgebäude am 19. Juli 1974 eine Rede über den Widerstand gegen den Nationalsozialismus. Er beschrieb zunächst Hintergründe des Attentats und Gewissensnot der Teilnehmer. Dann erklärte er, er habe in der NS-Zeit zum Freiburger Freundeskreis um den katholischen Schriftsteller Reinhold Schneider gehört, der Kontakte zu Widerstandsgruppen gehabt habe, und habe „aus der Gesinnung, die diesen Kreis beseelte, gehandelt, unter Inkaufnahme der damit gegebenen Risiken“. Dennoch empfinde er sein damaliges Handeln angesichts des Notwendigen als „schwerwiegende Unterlassung“. Dies sehe er im Stuttgarter Schuldbekenntnis vom Oktober 1945 treffend ausgedrückt, dessen Kernsatz er zitierte. Dann beschrieb er den Kirchenkampf der katholischen Bischöfe und der Bekennenden Kirche, der sich seit 1933 zu einer „Totalfront des Widerstandes“ entwickelt und „dem nationalsozialistischen System selbst“ gegolten habe., Schon im Vorfeld hatten manche Angehörige hingerichteter Widerständler gegen Filbingers Rederecht protestiert. Bei der Rede ertönten Zwischenrufe wie „Nazi“, „Heuchler“, „NS-Richter“, bis die Rufer aus dem Saal gewiesen wurden. Die Wochenzeitung \\"Die Zeit\\" kommentierte die Vorfälle mit Bezug auf den 1972 bekannt gewordenen Fall Petzold: „…wer nach Kriegsende einen Soldaten im Gefangenenlager wegen ‚Auflehnung gegen Zucht und Ordnung‘ und wegen ‚Gesinnungsverfalls‘ zu sechs Monaten Gefängnis verurteilt, der hat mit denen, die sich gegen die Ordnung jener Zeit aufgelehnt haben, wenig gemein.“, Der Zeithistoriker Peter Reichel verglich die Reden und zeigte die Unterschiede von Filbingers Gedenkrede mit der Rede Gustav Heinemanns von 1969 auf. Das Auftreten und die Rede Filbingers habe „ein ganz anderes Bild“ geboten. Heinemann habe im Gegensatz zu ihm den kommunistischen Widerstand anerkannt, auf die undemokratische, deutschnationale Tradition der Attentäter des 20. Juli hingewiesen, die deutsche Teilung auch als Folge ihres Zu-Spät-Kommens und Scheiterns beschrieben und zuletzt eigene Versäumnisse in der NS-Zeit biografisch konkret benannt., Verlauf., Filbingers Prozess gegen Rolf Hochhuth und die \\"Zeit\\" 1978., In einem Vorabdruck seines Romans \\"Eine Liebe in Deutschland\\" vom 17. Februar 1978 bezeichnete Rolf Hochhuth Filbinger als „Hitlers Marinerichter, der sogar noch in britischer Gefangenschaft nach Hitlers Tod einen deutschen Matrosen mit Nazi-Gesetzen verfolgt hat“. Er sei „ein so furchtbarer Jurist gewesen, daß man vermuten muß – denn die Marinerichter waren schlauer als die von Heer und Luftwaffe, sie vernichteten bei Kriegsende die Akten – er ist auf freiem Fuß nur dank des Schweigens derer, die ihn kannten.“, Auf Filbingers erneute Unterlassungsklage hin untersagte das Landgericht Stuttgart am 23. Mai 1978 durch eine einstweilige Verfügung die Behauptung, er sei nur wegen Strafvereitelung einer Haftstrafe entgangen. Hochhuth hatte diesen Teil seiner Aussagen zuvor zurückgenommen: Sie seien absurd gewesen, da kein Richter der NS-Zeit in der Bundesrepublik je für Unrechtsurteile bestraft worden sei. Die übrigen Aussagen erlaubte das Gericht als freie und zum Teil faktengestützte Meinungsäußerung. Damit schien die Affäre zunächst abgeschlossen zu sein., Filbinger wollte jedoch auch \\"Die Zeit\\" gerichtlich verpflichten, Hochhuths gesamte Äußerungen zu ihm nicht mehr abzudrucken. Im Zuge dieses Prozesses gewährte das Bundesarchiv in Kornelimünster den Anwälten beider Seiten Einsicht in die Akten der Marinegerichte, an denen Filbinger tätig gewesen war. Dabei fand Hochhuth im April 1978 den Fall \\"Walter Gröger\\", den der Chefredakteur der \\"Zeit\\" Theo Sommer Filbinger am 4. Mai vorlegte. Sommers Anwalt Heinrich Senfft präsentierte ihn in seinem Plädoyer am 9. Mai, nahm auf das Urteil von 1972 Bezug und fragte, wer Filbinger angesichts seiner angeblichen antinazistischen Gesinnung und seines Einsatzes für zum Tod Verurteilte gezwungen habe, diesmal das Todesurteil zu beantragen und seine Vollstreckung anzuordnen., Erich Schwinge erwiderte mit einem Rechtsgutachten, der Fall Gröger könne Filbinger weder rechtlich noch moralisch angelastet werden. Schwinge war führender Militärstrafrechtler der NS-Zeit gewesen, hatte mit seinem Gesetzeskommentar zum 1940 verschärften Militärstrafgesetzbuch unter anderem die Todesstrafe für „Wehrkraftzersetzung“ zur Generalprävention gefordert und als Wehrmachtsrichter selbst Todesurteile verhängt. Seit 1949 verteidigte er ehemalige Wehrmachts- und SS-Angehörige in etwa 150 Prozessen und beeinflusste die bundesdeutsche Rechtsprechung noch bis 1995 mit seiner These, die NS-Militärjustiz habe gegen den Nationalsozialismus rechtsstaatliche Prinzipien vertreten., Am 13. Juli 1978 bestätigte das Gericht die vorherige Verfügung und ließ die Aussagen „furchtbarer Jurist“, „Hitlers Marinerichter“ und „Filbinger verfolgte einen deutschen Matrosen noch in britischer Gefangenschaft mit Nazigesetzen“ als freie Meinungsäußerungen zu. Sein Urteil gegen Petzold und Urteilsantrag gegen Gröger passe nicht „zu einem Richter, der seine Gegnerschaft zum NS-Regime hervorhebt“. Zwar habe er in beiden Verfahren „im Rahmen des damals geltenden Rechts“ gehandelt, müsse sich aber heutige Anfragen an sein Verhalten gefallen lassen., Der Fall: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Aufarbeitung Nationalsozialismus, Hans Filbinger, Militärjustiz, Politik 1978, Politische Affäre, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Todesurteile, CDU, Rehabilitierung, NS-Militärjustiz"},{"instruction":"python numpy.ndarray with shape (5,2) to dataframe with columns 'class_0' and 'class_1'","output":"You can convert a numpy ndarray with shape (5,2) to a dataframe with columns 'class_0' and 'class_1' using the pandas library in Python.

There are several types of defuzzification methods that can be used depending on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Some of the commonly used defuzzification methods are: 1. Centroid Method: This is one of the most commonly used defuzzification methods. It calculates the center of gravity or centroid of the fuzzy output membership function and considers it as the crisp value. The centroid is determined by taking the weighted average of the fuzzy output values with their corresponding membership grades. 2. Weighted Average Method: In this method, the crisp value is determined by taking the weighted average of the output values. The weights assigned to each output value are based on their corresponding membership grades. 3. Maximum Membership Method: This method selects the output value with the highest membership grade as the crisp value. It assumes that the output value with the maximum membership adequately represents the fuzzy output. 4. Smallest of Maxima Method: This method selects the output value with the smallest maximum membership as the crisp value. It aims to find the output value that minimizes the impact of uncertainty and variability in the fuzzy output. 5. Largest of Maxima Method: This method selects the output value with the largest maximum membership as the crisp value. It assumes that the output value with the largest maximum membership provides the most representative and reliable crisp value. 6. Mean of Maxima Method: In this method, the crisp value is determined by taking the mean of the output values with the maximum membership grades. It aims to provide a more balanced and representative value. These are some of the commonly used defuzzification methods in fuzzy logic systems. The selection of the method depends on the specific problem and the desired characteristics of the crisp output value."},{"instruction":"Inference Engine Method for fuzzy logic","output":"The Inference Engine is a key component in fuzzy logic systems that processes the fuzzy inputs and fuzzy rules to generate the fuzzy output. It applies fuzzy logic principles to perform inference and make decisions based on the given inputs and rules. The Inference Engine primarily consists of two steps, namely, fuzzyfication and rule evaluation. Let's discuss these steps in more detail: 1. Fuzzification: In this step, the crisp inputs are converted into their corresponding fuzzy values using membership functions. Each input is associated with a membership function that assigns a degree of membership (between 0 and 1) to a set of linguistic terms or fuzzy sets. The fuzzification process determines the membership grade of each input in the relevant fuzzy sets. 2. Rule Evaluation: Once the fuzzy inputs are determined, the rule evaluation step applies the fuzzy rules to infer the fuzzy output. These rules are defined using fuzzy IF-THEN statements, where the antecedent (IF part) consists of the fuzzy inputs and the consequent (THEN part) represents the fuzzy output. Each rule is associated with a membership function indicating the degree of certainty or strength (between 0 and 1) with which the rule is applicable. During rule evaluation, the Inference Engine combines the fuzzy inputs and the fuzzy rules to determine the fuzzy output. Various inference methods can be used, including the Max-Min method, wherein the minimum value of the antecedent and the consequent membership grades is considered, or the Center of Gravity method, which uses weighted averages to determine the resultant fuzzy output. Once the fuzzy output is obtained, the defuzzification method is applied to convert it into a single crisp value that can be easily understood and used in further processing or decision-making. In summary, the Inference Engine in fuzzy logic systems performs fuzzification to convert crisp inputs into fuzzy values and applies fuzzy rules to determine the fuzzy output. It is a crucial component that enables the system to make decisions based on uncertain or imprecise data."},{"instruction":"Fuzzy inference using the Min/Max method","output":"Fuzzy inference using the Min/Max method is one of the most popular methods used in fuzzy logic systems to combine fuzzy inputs and fuzzy rules and determine the output. It is also known as the Mamdani method, named after its creator Ebrahim Mamdani. The Min/Max method of fuzzy inference involves two main steps: fuzzification and rule evaluation. 1. Fuzzification: In the fuzzification step, the crisp inputs are mapped to their corresponding membership degrees in the relevant fuzzy sets using membership functions. Each input is associated with a membership function that assigns a degree of membership (between 0 and 1) to each fuzzy set. The degree of membership indicates the extent to which the input belongs to that fuzzy set. 2. Rule Evaluation: Once the fuzzification is done, the fuzzy rules are evaluated to determine the fuzzy output. In the Min/Max method, the rule evaluation is performed by considering the minimum degree of membership between the antecedent (IF part) of the rule and the corresponding fuzzy inputs. For each rule, the minimum degree of membership is obtained by finding the minimum value among all the antecedent membership grades. This minimum value represents the strength or certainty with which the rule is applicable. After evaluating all the rules, the aggregated fuzzy output is obtained by combining the consequent (THEN part) of each rule. The degree of membership for each output fuzzy set is determined by taking the minimum degree of membership obtained from the rule evaluation step. Finally, defuzzification is performed to convert the aggregated fuzzy output into a crisp value using methods like the centroid method, weighted average method, or any other appropriate defuzzification method. The Min/Max method is relatively simple and widely used in fuzzy logic systems due to its intuitive nature. However, it may not capture the full complexity of the underlying system and can lead to conservative outputs. Advanced methods like the Sugeno method or Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) method provide more precise control over the output, especially in systems with non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs."},{"instruction":"1. Mamdani method","output":"The Mamdani method, named after its creator Ebrahim Mamdani, is a fuzzy inference method commonly used in fuzzy logic systems, particularly in control systems and decision-making applications.

Fuzzification: In the fuzzification step, the crisp inputs are mapped to their corresponding membership degrees in the relevant fuzzy sets using membership functions. Each input is associated with a membership function that assigns a degree of membership (between 0 and 1) to each fuzzy set. The degree of membership represents the extent to which the input belongs to that fuzzy set. 2. Rule Evaluation: Once the fuzzification is done, the fuzzy rules are evaluated to determine the degree of activation or applicability of each rule. For each rule, the degree of activation is determined by finding the minimum degree of membership among the input variables that satisfy its antecedent (IF part). This minimum value represents the strength or certainty with which the rule is applicable. 3. Aggregation: After evaluating all the rules, the fuzzy outputs of each rule are combined or aggregated to obtain a single fuzzy output. The fuzzy output is obtained by assigning a weighted degree of membership to each output fuzzy set, where the weights correspond to the degree of activation of the associated rule. 4. Defuzzification: In the defuzzification step, the aggregated fuzzy output is converted into a crisp value. This conversion is performed using various defuzzification methods, such as the centroid method or the weighted average method. These methods calculate a single crisp value that represents the most likely output based on the fuzzy output and its corresponding membership grades. The Mamdani method provides a systematic approach for reasoning and decision-making when dealing with uncertainty and imprecise information. It is widely used because of its simplicity and interpretability. However, it can sometimes generate conservative or overly conservative results, and other methods like the Sugeno method or TSK (Takagi-Sugeno-Kang) method may be preferred for specific applications."},{"instruction":"Sugeno method","output":"The Sugeno method, also known as the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) method, is a fuzzy inference method commonly used in fuzzy logic systems. It is an extension of the Mamdani method and provides more precise control over the output, particularly in systems with non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. The Sugeno method involves several steps similar to the Mamdani method: fuzzification, rule evaluation, aggregation, and defuzzification. However, it differs in the way rules are constructed and how the output is determined. 1. Fuzzification: In the fuzzification step, the crisp inputs are mapped to their corresponding membership degrees in the relevant fuzzy sets using membership functions, similarly to the Mamdani method. 2. Rule Evaluation: In the Sugeno method, the fuzzy rules are evaluated in a slightly different way. Instead of using a linguistic proposition as the consequent (THEN part) of the rule, the Sugeno method uses a mathematical expression or function. The rule evaluation calculates the output values of each rule based on the input values. These output values can be constants or functions of the input variables. 3. Aggregation: After evaluating all the rules, the outputs of each rule are combined or aggregated to obtain a single output value for each fuzzy output variable. The aggregation is typically done by weighting the output values of each rule based on the degree of activation or applicability of the rule. 4. Defuzzification: In the defuzzification step, the aggregated output values are converted into a crisp value, similar to the Mamdani method, using defuzzification methods like the centroid method or the weighted average method. The Sugeno method allows for more flexibility in representing the relationship between inputs and outputs by using mathematical functions in the rule consequents. This enables the system to handle non-linear relationships and perform more accurate modeling and control. Furthermore, the Sugeno method provides interpretable and transparent outputs, as the rule consequents can be expressed as mathematical expressions or functions. Overall, the Sugeno method is widely used in various applications such as modeling, control, and decision-making, where precise control and accurate representation of input-output relationships are crucial."},{"instruction":"Types of Fuzzy Control Methods","output":"There are several types of fuzzy control methods commonly used in fuzzy logic systems. These methods vary in their approach to designing and implementing fuzzy control systems. Some of the major types are as follows: 1. Mamdani-Type Fuzzy Control: The Mamdani-type fuzzy control method, or Mamdani control, is one of the most widely used fuzzy control methods. It uses linguistic rules, membership functions, and fuzzy inference to control a system. The output of the Mamdani control system is typically fuzzy and requires defuzzification to obtain a crisp control signal. 2. Sugeno-Type Fuzzy Control: The Sugeno-type fuzzy control method, also known as the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) method, uses rule-based fuzzy logic to control a system. The difference is that instead of using linguistic rules, it uses mathematical functions in the rule consequent or output. The output of a Sugeno-type control system is a crisp function of the input variables. 3. Adaptive Fuzzy Control: Adaptive fuzzy control methods aim to adapt the fuzzy control parameters or rules based on the changing dynamics of the system or external factors. These methods use techniques like neural networks or genetic algorithms to update the fuzzy control parameters dynamically and optimize the control system performance. 4. Hybrid Fuzzy Control: Hybrid fuzzy control methods combine fuzzy logic with other control techniques, such as PID control or model-based control, to enhance the performance and robustness of the control system. These methods leverage the strengths of each control technique to overcome their limitations. 5. Neuro-Fuzzy Control: Neuro-fuzzy control methods combine fuzzy logic with neural networks to create adaptive control systems. These methods use neural networks to model the system's behavior and fuzzy logic to capture expert knowledge and control the system. The neural network is trained to learn the fuzzy rules and optimize the control system's performance. 6. Fuzzy Supervisory Control: Fuzzy supervisory control methods are used when dealing with multiple control systems or sub-systems. A fuzzy supervisor is designed to oversee and coordinate the individual control systems based on a set of predetermined rules or conditions. These are some of the major types of fuzzy control methods. Each method has its advantages and is suitable for different applications.

Larsen-Type Inference Engine: The Larsen-type inference engine is another type of fuzzy inference engine. It is a simple and intuitive method that uses the Larsen method of fuzzy inference. In this method, the fuzzy output is determined by multiplying the input membership grades by a scaling factor associated with each rule. This results in a crisp output that is a linear combination of the input variables. 4. Tsukamoto-Type Inference Engine: The Tsukamoto-type inference engine is a specific type of inference engine that uses the Tsukamoto method of fuzzy inference. It is based on a gradual transition between membership grades along the fuzzy sets. The output is determined by taking a weighted average of the input memberships and considering the shape of the membership functions.

Die häufigste ambulante Anwendung findet die Lokalanästhesie in der Zahnmedizin. Dabei wird vor allem unterschieden zwischen der Infiltrationsanästhesie (auch Terminalanästhesie), der intraligamentären Anästhesie und der Leitungsanästhesie (auch Regionalanästhesie). Die Leitungsanästhesie am Unterkiefer erfolgt insbesondere am Nervus alveolaris inferior als Teil des dritten Astes des Nervus trigeminus, des Nervus mandibularis, während die Leitungsanästhesie am Oberkiefer am Nervus maxillaris erfolgt. Das Ziel ist die Schmerzausschaltung bei allen schmerzhaften Eingriffen im Fachgebiet der Zahn-, Mund- und Kieferheilkunde. Die Lokalanästhesie leistet einen entscheidenden Beitrag zur Vermeidung der Dentophobie (Zahnbehandlungsangst), bei entsprechender schmerzarmer beziehungsweise schmerzloser Injektionstechnik auch zur Vermeidung der Trypanophobie (Spritzenangst). Die Durchführung einer Lokalanästhesie steht unter (Zahn-)arztvorbehalt., Abgrenzung., Bei der \\"Oberflächenanästhesie\\" wird in der Regel das Anästhetikum auf die Schleimhaut aufgebracht, wobei die sensiblen Nervenenden per Diffusion erreicht werden., Die \\"Infiltrationsanästhesie\\" ist eine Umspritzung des Zahnes beziehungsweise des Zielgebietes im Gewebe mit einem Lokalanästhetikum. Sensible Leitungsbahnen, die aus einem Bündel Nervenfasern bestehen, leiten die Impulse von Empfindungsrezeptoren zum Gehirn., Die \\"Leitungsanästhesie\\" hat die Blockade einer Nervenbahn zum Ziel, wodurch alle durch diesen Nervenast innervierten (versorgten) Bereiche anästhesiert werden., Mit der \\"intraligamentären Anästhesie\\" wird gezielt nur ein Zahn anästhesiert., Wirkungsweise., Lokalanästhetika liegen chemisch in zwei Formen vor. Während die nicht dissoziierte, lipophile Base zum Nerv vordringt, ist die hydrophile, dissoziierte Form (Kation) lokal wirksam. Sie blockiert den Natriumeinstrom in (Nerven-)Zellen und somit die Reizleitung. Je dicker die Nervenfaser, desto höher muss die Konzentration des Lokalanästhetikums sein. Aufgrund des geringen Durchmessers der schmerzleitenden C- und A-delta-Fasern werden diese früh gehemmt, während die motorischen A-alpha-Fasern erst spät unterbunden werden., Oberflächenanästhesie., Die Oberflächenanästhesie wird in der Mundhöhle zur Schmerzausschaltung der Mundschleimhaut, beispielsweise zur Schmerzreduktion des Einstichschmerzes der nachfolgenden Lokalanästhesie oder bei oberflächlichen Eingriffen am Zahnfleisch angewandt. Zur Anwendung kommen vorwiegend Articain in 2- bis 4-prozentiger Konzentration, Lidocain oder Tetracain in 0,5- bis 3-prozentiger Konzentration. Die Oberflächenanästhetika sind als Gel, Salbe oder Spray erhältlich. Zur besseren punktgenauen Anwendung wird das Anästhetikum meist auf ein Watte- oder Schaumstoffpellet aufgetragen, das etwa eine Minute lang auf die zu anästhesierende Stelle gedrückt wird. Durch den Ethanolgehalt kann auch eine Desinfektion der Injektionsstelle erfolgen. Die Oberflächenanästhesie wird daneben bei empfindlichen Patienten zur Ausschaltung des Würg- oder Schluckreflexes angewandt, beispielsweise bei der Abformung oder der Anfertigung von Röntgenaufnahmen in der Mundhöhle. Dabei wird das Oberflächenanästhetikum auf das Gaumensegel und den Zungengrund aufgebracht. Zur Anwendung kommt hierbei eine 0,5- bis 1-prozentige Lösung. Eine Überschreitung des Grenzdosis muss vermieden werden. Daneben kann eine Anästhesie der Oberfläche auch durch infiltrierende Umspritzungen des Gewebes (Hautquaddeln) erfolgen, ebenso im Rahmen der Segmenttherapie., Auch durch eine Druckanästhesie kann der Einstichschmerz reduziert oder vermieden werden. Dabei wird Druck durch einen Finger oder ein Instrument für etwa 15Sekunden auf den vorgesehenen Injektionsbereich ausgeübt., Dem Patienten die Angst vor der Spritze zu nehmen, bedeutet, ihm auch die Angst vor der Behandlung zu nehmen, denn diese verläuft unter Lokalanästhesie schmerzfrei oder schmerzarm. Meist entstand die Spritzenphobie aus schlechten Vorerfahrungen, vorwiegend in der Kindheit. Eine deutlich wahrnehmbare Empathie des behandelnden Zahnarztes trägt ein Übriges zum Abbau der Spritzenangst bei., Ein anästhesierendes Gel wird bei Erwachsenen verwendet und ist für die professionelle Zahnreinigung (PZR) bei schmerzempfindlichen Patienten geeignet. Es kann auch bei kleineren parodontalchirurgischen Eingriffen angewendet werden. Es wird mit Hilfe einer stumpfen Nadel in den Sulkus jedes zu behandelnden Zahnes appliziert und besteht – in 5-prozentiger Konzentration – aus gleichen Teilen Lidocain und Prilocain \\"(Oraqix)\\"., Instrumentarium., In der Regel wird das Anästhetikum zur Infiltrationsanästhesie oder Leitungsanästhesie mit einer Zylinderampullenspritze, auch \\"Karpulenspritze\\" genannt, verabreicht. Es werden jedoch auch Einmalspritzen verwendet, mit denen das Anästhetikum aus Ampullen oder Durchstichflaschen aufgezogen wird. Nach jedem Patienten werden die Nadeln in einer Kanülenabwurfbox entsorgt und das Spritzenbesteck sterilisiert. Teilverbrauchte Zylinderampullen dürfen nicht für andere Patienten weiterverwendet werden. Im Handel sind auch kostenintensivere selbstaspirierende Einmalspritzen mit eingebautem Aspirationsmechanismus erhältlich, sowie selbstaspirierende Zylinderampullenspritzenbestecke (Beispiel: Aspiject nach Evers). Aspiration (siehe unten) und Injektion erfolgen in gleicher Richtung durch Kolbendruck, ohne dass ein Aspirationszug notwendig wird. Zur Anwendung kommen Kanülen nach ISO 7864 beziehungsweise DIN 13097 mit einer Gaugegröße 25 (ø 0,5mm) oder 27 (ø 0,4mm) bei einer Länge von 1\\" (25mm) bei der Infiltrationsanästhesie oder 1½\\" (40mm) bei der Leitungsanästhesie. Bei Einwegspritzen wird die Kanüle mit der Spritze mittels konischem Luer-Ansatz verbunden, bei Zylinderampullenspritzen mittels Verschraubung., Schmerzarme Injektionstechnik., Eine schmerzreduzierte beziehungsweise schmerzfreie Injektion kann durch das Einhalten mehrerer Maßnahmen erreicht werden. Hierzu gehören die Verwendung eines Oberflächenanästhetikums oder die Anwendung einer Druckanästhesie vor der eigentlichen Injektion. Das Lokalanästhetikum soll auf Körperwärme (37°C) erwärmt sein. Einmalspritzen lassen sich gefühlvoller handhaben als Zylinderampullenspritzen. Auf Grund ihrer geringen Größe erscheinen Einmalspritzen weniger „bedrohlich“ für den Patienten. Die Injektionskanülen sollen für einen geringeren Initialschmerz einen dreifachen Facettenschliff aufweisen und für ein schmerzreduziertes Gleiten durchs Gewebe silikonbeschichtet sein. Die Injektionskanülen verlieren bereits nach einer ersten Injektion ihre schmerzreduzierende Schärfe, sodass für jede weitere Injektion beim selben Patienten eine neue Kanüle verwendet werden soll. Ein Zurückziehen der Injektionsnadel nach dem Knochenkontakt vermeidet eine schmerzhafte subperiostale Injektion. Die Injektionsgeschwindigkeit soll 1ml/min nicht überschreiten. Andernfalls führt der plötzlich erzeugte Druckanstieg im Gewebe zu Schmerzen. Alternativ kann eine fraktionierte (aufgeteilte) Injektionstechnik angewandt werden, bei der zuerst ein kleines Depot des Anästhetikums gesetzt wird. Das Einspritzen ins Gewebe erfolgt kurz danach, wenn das erste Depot den Injektionsbereich bereits anästhesiert hat. Die fraktionierte Injektion kann zusätzlich zum Aspirationstest eine intravasale Injektion der Gesamtdosis verhindern helfen, was insbesondere bei Patienten mit Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen sinnvoll ist. Das erste Depot würde in diesem Fall zu einem Pulsanstieg führen. Ein zu heftiger Knochenkontakt führt zum Umbiegen der Nadelspitze, die beim Herausziehen der Kanüle nach der Injektion wie ein kleiner Widerhaken wirkt und schmerzhaft das Gewebe aufreißt., Aspirationstest., Vor der eigentlichen Injektion wird durch einen Aspirationstest (Ansaugen der Gewebsflüssigkeit) sichergestellt, dass die Kanülenspitze nicht in einem Blutgefäß zu liegen kommt und dass nicht direkt in ein Gefäß injiziert wird (insbesondere im Bereich der Arteria alveolaris inferior, die unmittelbar neben dem Nervus alveolaris inferior liegt). Läge die Kanülenspitze in einem Blutgefäß, würde dies durch das angesaugte Blut in der gläsernen Zylinderampulle oder Spritze sichtbar. In diesem Fall wird die Injektion abgebrochen und das Spritzenbesteck ausgetauscht und eine neue Injektion – einschließlich erneutem Aspirationstest – durchgeführt. Der Aspirationstest schließt jedoch eine intravasale Injektion nicht völlig aus. Eine intravasale Injektion führt einerseits zu einem Anästhesieversager, andererseits zu unerwünschten Wirkungen auf Herz und Kreislauf, auch durch den in der Anästhetikumlösung enthaltenen Vasokonstriktor (Adrenalin, Noradrenalin)., Anästhesie im Oberkiefer., Infiltrationsanästhesien., Bei zahnärztlichen Eingriffen im Oberkiefer wird zumeist eine Infiltrationsanästhesie durchgeführt. Der Einstich erfolgt in der Umschlagfalte im Mundvorhof in Höhe der Wurzelspitze. Das Anästhetikum wird unter die Schleimhaut \\"(submukös)\\" und über die Knochenhaut \\"(supraperiostal)\\" injiziert, damit es sich im Knochen ausbreitet und durch ihn diffundiert. Der Kieferknochen hat vestibulär eine Dicke von etwa 1–3mm. Die Wirkung der Anästhesie setzt meist nach ein bis drei Minuten ein und erreicht nach 20Minuten ihre maximale Wirkungstiefe. Diese genügt, um beispielsweise schmerzfrei einen Zahn zu ziehen (Extraktion)., Leitungsanästhesien., Der Nervus palatinus major versorgt die dorsalen (hinteren) zwei Drittel der Gaumenschleimhaut.

Die Rasse entstand aus Hunden, die von samojedischen Völkern in Sibirien verwendet wurden. Nach diesen Völkern wurde die Hunderasse auch benannt, als Ernest Kilburn-Scott ab 1894 erste Tiere nach England brachte und mit dem Züchten der ab 1913 anerkannten Rasse begann., Beschreibung., Der Rassestandard für den Samojeden wird als FCI-Standard Nr. 212 bei der Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) geführt. Er beschreibt das allgemeine Erscheinungsbild eines Samojeden als ein Tier, das „den Eindruck von Kraft, Ausdauer, Geschmeidigkeit, Würde und Selbstvertrauen gepaart mit Charme vermittelt“. Als charakteristisches Merkmal wird das so genannte „Lächeln“ des Samojeden genannt; dieser für Hunde ungewöhnliche Gesichtsausdruck wird erzeugt durch die Kombination der Augenform und -stellung mit den in sanfter Kurve nach oben gerichteten Lefzenwinkeln. Der Charakter des Samojeden soll „freundlich, aufgeschlossen, munter und lebhaft mit sehr gering ausgeprägtem Jagdinstinkt“ und „sehr gesellig“ sein; Samojeden sollen „keinesfalls scheu oder aggressiv“ auftreten., Trotz ihrer früheren Nutzung als Wachhunde gelten sie heute als ungeeignet für diese Verwendung, wobei sie bei Annäherung eines Fremden an „ihr“ Territorium (Garten) zwar anschlagen, aber nicht aggressiv werden., Die ideale Schulterhöhe eines Samojeden liegt bei 57 (Rüden) beziehungsweise 53 Zentimetern (Hündinnen), wobei jeweils eine Abweichung von 3 Zentimeter nach oben oder nach unten toleriert wird. Der Rüde wiegt zwischen 25 und 30 Kilogramm, die Hündin zwischen 20 und 25 Kilogramm. Der Kopf soll kräftig und keilförmig, der Hals kräftig und mittellang sein. Der Körper ist etwas länger als hoch, tief und kompakt, dabei jedoch geschmeidig. Die Rute soll „ziemlich hoch angesetzt“ sein und wird „in der Bewegung oder in aufmerksamer Haltung […] vom Ansatz an über den Rücken oder zur Seite gebogen getragen, darf aber in Ruhestellung herabhängen“. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Schlittenhunden sind blaue oder zwei unterschiedlich gefärbte Augen ein zuchtausschließender Faktor., Das Fell., Ein besonderes Merkmal des Samojeden ist das Haarkleid, das „üppig, dick, elastisch und dicht“ sein soll; es dient als natürlicher Schutz im Polarklima. Das Fell ist rein weiß oder weiß, beige oder cremefarben. Es besteht aus einer dichten weichen Unterwolle (Kälteschutz) sowie einem längeren Deckhaar, das die Unterwolle vor Feuchtigkeit und Verschmutzung schützt. Der Samojede haart wenig bis gar nicht, außer während des Fellwechsels, der zweimal im Jahr auftritt. Das Fell ist zum größten Teil selbstreinigend., Die ursprünglichen Samojedenhunde traten auch in anderen Fellfärbungen wie braun oder schwarz auf. Dies entspricht jedoch nicht dem heutigen Zuchtstandard., Züchtung und Nutzung., Samojeden wurden von dem Volksstamm der Nenzen (\\"Samojeden\\") ursprünglich als Arbeitshunde, Schlittenhunde, Hütehunde und Wachhunde verwendet. Erna Bossi beschreibt in ihrem Buch \\"Der Samojede\\" die frühere Nutzung dieser nordischen Hunderasse: \\"„Sie hüteten ihre Rentierherden, verteidigten sie gegen angreifende Wölfe und Bären und waren ihre Jagdgefährten. Manchmal wurden sie auch vor die Schlitten gespannt. […] Mensch und Tier waren aufeinander angewiesen und lebten in engster Gemeinschaft miteinander […]. Nachts durften die Hunde auch mit ins Zelt und dienten als Bettwärmer. Sie galten als vollwertige Mitglieder der Familie“\\"., Im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert wurden Samojeden von europäischen und amerikanischen Forschern in Arktis und Antarktis als Schlittenhunde genutzt. Eine frühe Erwähnung der Vorfahren heutiger Samojeden findet sich in den Berichten zur gescheiterten Nordpol-Expedition von Fridtjof Nansen von 1894; die Tiere werden als sehr ausdauernd beschrieben, sie könnten 95 Kilometer in einer Strecke zurücklegen, ohne gefüttert zu werden., Der britische Zoologe Ernest Kilburn-Scott brachte 1889 erste Exemplare nach England und gilt als Begründer der Samojedenzucht. Sein Entwurf für einen Rassestandard sah zwei Typen von Samojeden vor: Der eine war etwas hochbeinig, aber stabil gebaut, das Fell war schneeweiß; der andere war ein bärenhafter Typ mit kleinen, behaarten Ohren und kräftigen Pfoten mit dicken Ballen. Diese Grundtypen finden sich, im Rahmen des durch den Zuchtstandard Zulässigen, in Grundzügen auch heute noch. Der erste Rassestandard stammt von 1909., Erste Tiere gelangten etwa 1904 in die Vereinigten Staaten; 1913 wurden Samojeden amtlich als Hunderasse anerkannt. 1923 wurde in den USA als erster Zuchtverein der \\"Samoyed Club of America\\" gegründet. Eine intensive Zucht begann in den ersten Nachkriegsjahren ab etwa 1946, die Popularität der Samojeden nahm jedoch erst ab etwa 1956 in nennenswertem Ausmaß zu., In Deutschland ist der 1968 gegründete \\"Deutsche Club nordischer Hunderassen\\" (DCNH) für die Einhaltung der Zuchtstandards zuständig., Samojeden werden auch in Australien, Dänemark, Finnland, Deutschland, den Niederlanden, Irland, Italien, Neuseeland, Schweden, Norwegen und seit einiger Zeit auch in Spanien in größerem Umfang gezüchtet. Sogar in Simbabwe gibt es einen kleinen Zwinger. Die dort gezüchteten Tiere sollen sich den klimatischen Gegebenheiten erstaunlich gut angepasst haben., Obwohl Samojeden eigentlich Arbeitshunde sind, werden sie heute hauptsächlich als Haus-, Familien- oder Ausstellungshunde sowie gelegentlich im Hundesport, beispielsweise in Agility, mit gutem Erfolg eingesetzt. Seltener werden sie als Schlittenhunde bei Schlittenhunderennen verwendet, da sie zwar sehr ausdauernd, aber weniger schnell als Huskys und weniger kräftig als Malamutes sind., Gesundheit., Für den Samojeden sind in der tiermedizinischen Fachliteratur mehrere rassespezifische Erbkrankheiten beschrieben:, Verwandte Rassen., Der Samojede wird häufig verwechselt mit weißen Exemplaren des Großspitzes (\\"Deutscher Spitz\\"), des American Eskimo Dog oder auch des Wolfsspitzes, die ebenfalls einen spitzen Fang und Stehohren haben. Der Samojede ist eine nordische Rasse und mit den Spitzen verwandt, teilt deren Wesensmerkmale als Wach- und Hofhund aber nicht., Als nordische Rasse wird der Samojede gelegentlich auch mit dem Siberian Husky verwechselt; dieser hat jedoch in der Regel ein graues Fell und blaue Augen, während Samojeden immer weißes Fell und braune bis braunschwarze Augen haben und das Fell viel länger ist als das des Huskys, bei dem das zu lange Fell ein zuchtausschließender Fehler ist. Gelegentlich ist auch eine Verwechslung mit weißen Eurasiern möglich, doch ist Weiß als Farbe bei Eurasiern ein zuchtausschließender Fehler; sie sind also dementsprechend selten. Da zur Züchtung des Eurasiers – neben Wolfsspitz und Chow-Chow – auch Samojeden eingesetzt wurden, handelt es sich hier um sehr enge Verwandte.]: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Asiatische Hunderasse, Europäische Hunderasse, FCI-Gruppe 5, Herdengebrauchshund, Pastoral Group, Working Group, Samojede, Samojedenspitz, FCI-Standard, Lächeln, Haarkleid"},{"instruction":"dame palabras con este kanji","output":"Dado que no especificas qué kanji te refieres, te proporcionaré palabras con diferentes kanji: 1. 食 (comida): - 食べる (taberu) - comer - 食事 (shokuji) - comida - 食堂 (shokudō) - comedor - 食品 (shokuhin) - alimento 2. 水 (agua): - 水 (mizu) - agua - 水道 (suido) - acueducto - 水泳 (suiei) - natación - 水色 (mizuiro) - color azul claro 3. 歩 (caminar): - 歩く (aruku) - caminar - 散歩 (sanpo) - paseo - 歩道 (hodō) - sendero peatonal - 歩数計 (hosūkei) - podómetro 4. 犬 (perro): - 犬 (inu) - perro - 犬小屋 (inugoya) - perrera - 野犬 (yainu) - perro callejero - 犬種 (inushu) - raza de perro 5. 花 (flor): - 花 (hana) - flor - 花瓶 (kabin) - jarrón - 花束 (hanataba) - ramo de flores - 花見 (hanami) - contemplación de flores (sakura)"},{"instruction":"dame una lista de vocabulario espa;ol japones en relacion al tema, auditoria laboral.","output":"Aquí tienes algunas palabras relacionadas con el tema de la auditoría laboral en español y su equivalente en japonés: 1.

Jahrhundert), Literatur (Russisch)], Anna Andrejewna Achmatowa (gebürtige \\"Gorenko\\"; bzw. Горенко, wiss. Transliteration \\"\\" / \\"Gorenko\\"; * in Bolschoi Fontan bei Odessa, Russisches Kaiserreich; †5.März 1966 in Domodedowo bei Moskau, Russische SFSR) war eine russische Dichterin und Schriftstellerin. Sie gilt als die \\"Seele des Silbernen Zeitalters\\" in der russischen Literatur und als bedeutende russische Dichterin. Ihr späteres Schaffen ist vor allem von den Schrecken der stalinistischen Herrschaft geprägt, während der sie selbst Schreibverbot hatte, ihr Sohn und ihr Mann inhaftiert waren und viele ihrer Freunde ums Leben kamen., Leben., Kindheit und Jugend., Anna Gorenko wurde am 23. Juni 1889 in dem Dorf Bolschoi Fontan bei Odessa als drittes von sechs Kindern in die Familie eines Marine-Ingenieurs geboren; die Familie übersiedelte aber bereits 1890 nach Zarskoje Selo bei Sankt Petersburg, wo Anna bis zu ihrem 16. Lebensjahr in sozial privilegierter Umgebung aufwuchs. Sie beschrieb später ihre Kindheitserinnerungen an die Parks, die Pferderennbahn und den alten Bahnhof des Ortes. Die Sommermonate verbrachte die Familie meist bei Sewastopol am Schwarzen Meer. Früh lernte sie in der Schule auch Französisch. Ihre ersten Gedichte schrieb sie im Alter von elf Jahren nicht unter dem Namen Gorenko, da ihr Vater um seinen guten Ruf fürchtete – sie wählte den Namen ihres bulgarischen Urgroßvaters Chan Achmat als Pseudonym., Wie Puschkin 90 Jahre vor ihr erhielt Achmatowa ihre Schulausbildung im exklusiven Lyzeum von Zarskoje Selo. Ihr Verhältnis zu dem wichtigsten russischen Dichter zieht sich von Beginn an wie ein roter Faden durch ihre Arbeiten: Im September 1911, zum 100-jährigen Jubiläum des Lyzeums, verfasste sie ein kurzes Gedicht mit dem Titel \\"Der dunkelhäutige Knabe schlenderte durch die Alleen\\", in dem es Anspielungen auf den jungen Puschkin gibt. Bereits in diesem Gedicht wird die typische Metonymietechnik der Achmatowa deutlich: Ohne Lyzeum und Puschkin beim Namen zu nennen, wird durch typische Eigenschaften und Gegenstände (hier: dunkelhäutig, der Lyzeums-Dreispitz usw.) klar, wer und was gemeint ist., Nachdem ihre Eltern sich 1905 getrennt hatten, lebte sie mit ihrer Mutter und den Geschwistern ein Jahr lang in Jewpatorija auf der Krim. Das letzte Schuljahr verbrachte sie schließlich am Kiewer Funduklejew-Gymnasium. Von 1907 bis 1910 studierte Achmatowa in Kiew in „Höheren Frauenkursen“ Jura, wobei sie sich vor allem für die Grundkurse in Rechtsgeschichte und Latein interessierte und den rein juristischen Fachthemen gleichgültig gegenüberstand., Im Jahr 1910 heiratete sie den Dichter Nikolai Gumiljow, den sie schon seit ihrer Schulzeit kannte und der ihr lange und verzweifelt den Hof gemacht hatte. Es folgten gemeinsame Reisen nach Paris und Italien, wo sie u.a. den Künstler Modigliani traf – seine Zeichnungen der Achmatowa sind später berühmt geworden – und Zeugin der ersten triumphalen Erfolge der russischen Balletttänzer in Westeuropa wurde. Malerei und Architektur Italiens beeindruckten sie tief., Vor der Revolution., Achmatowa, Gumiljow und Ossip Mandelstam wurden zu den zentralen Vertretern der Literaturbewegung des Akmeismus (von griech. \\"akme\\", Gipfel, Höhepunkt, Blütezeit). Die so genannte „Zeche“ um diese Dichter bildete eine Gegenströmung zum Symbolismus, dessen Metaphorik des Jenseitigen, Metaphysischen die Akmeisten eine eigene Poesie jedes „irdischen Dings“ und eine entschiedene Diesseitigkeit entgegensetzten. Achmatowas Gedichte zeichnen sich daher durch eine einfache und prägnante Sprache aus. Anders als bei den „esoterisch“ angehauchten Treffen der Symbolisten waren die Zusammenkünfte der Akmeisten eher „Workshops“, in denen u.a. neue Schreibtechniken erarbeitet wurden., Neben Puschkin fand Achmatowa ihre dichterischen Wurzeln bei Innokenti Annenski (1856–1909), einem Vorläufer der Akmeisten, außerdem bei dem französischen Symbolisten Verlaine und dem jungen Majakowski., Nach ihrer Rückkehr nach Sankt Petersburg studierte Achmatowa Literaturgeschichte und schrieb die Gedichte, die in ihren ersten Gedichtband \\"Abend\\" (, 1912) eingingen. Es waren vor allem Liebesgedichte, in denen sie Trennung, Kummer und Liebesleid beschrieb wie beispielsweise in der letzten Strophe ihres Gedichtes „Lied von der letzten Begegnung“:, Sie verwendete in ihren lakonischen, knappen Gedichten Alltagssprache, in denen Gefühle gestisch angedeutet werden. Ein linker Handschuh, der aus Versehen auf die rechte Hand gestreift wird, wird zum Ausdruck der Verzweiflung und Verwirrtheit der Beschriebenen, die äußerlich ruhig bleibt:, Im Oktober 1912 wurde Achmatowas einziger Sohn Lew geboren. Schon 1914 erschien ihr zweites Buch, \\"Rosenkranz\\" (), das trotz der Ereignisse des beginnenden Weltkrieges, wie schon der erste Band, ein großer Erfolg wurde. Diese Sammlung enthielt auch das im Januar 1914 entstandene Gedicht \\"Für Alexander Blok\\" (), ein Indiz für ihre enge Beziehung zu dem Dichter des Symbolismus, die sie immer wieder als platonisch, „ausschließlich poetisch“ bezeichnete. Auch von Alexander Blok gibt es eine Reihe von Gedichten, die der Achmatowa gewidmet sind (z.B. \\"An Anna Achmatowa\\", ). Ihre erste Begegnung hatte 1913 stattgefunden. Während der Symbolist in seinen Gedichten über Weiblichkeit und Schönheit sinnierte, wählte Achmatowa ihren gewohnt sparsamen, nüchternen Stil: „Ich habe den Dichter besucht. Gerade Mittag. Sonntag. Das Zimmer geräumig. Vor den Fenstern Frost.“ Allerdings schildert das unmittelbar vor diesem im \\"Rosenkranz\\" gedruckte Gedicht (\\"Der Gast\\",, Januar 1914) eine zärtliche Begegnung mit einem Mann, dessen Schilderung auf Blok zutraf. Diese Übereinstimmungen führten gelegentlich zu der Vermutung, dass die Beziehung der beiden Dichter intimer war als offiziell bekannt., Auch der nächste Gedichtband, \\"Die weiße Schar\\" (), fiel bei seinem Erscheinen 1917 in eine historisch unruhige Zeit. Die chaotischen Zustände zu Beginn der Revolution schmälerten den Verkaufserfolg des Buches., Repressionen in der jungen Sowjetunion., Nach der Oktoberrevolution arbeitete Achmatowa als Bibliothekarin im Landwirtschaftlichen Institut. Von 1922 an bis 1940 wurden ihre Gedichte nicht mehr gedruckt, da sie den kommunistischen Machthabern zu wenig gesellschaftlich relevant, zu privat waren. In der Sowjetenzyklopädie hieß es, ihre Gedichte seien mit religiös-mystischen und erotischen Motiven überladen, mit denen sie die Jugend vergifte. Ihre älteren Werke fanden nur unter der Hand im Samisdat Verbreitung. Lew Kopelew schrieb über sie: \\"Ihre Verse blieben im Gedächtnis haften, wurden je nach Stimmung wieder hervorgeholt … Damals war man noch bereit zuzugestehen, daß auch Klassenfeinde und unversöhnliche weltanschauliche Gegner selbstlos, edelmütig und tapfer sein konnten. Ein derartiger „liberaler Objektivismus“ war noch keine Todsünde, noch keine Straftat.\\", Ihr Ehemann Gumiljow, von dem sie sich 1918 hatte scheiden lassen, wurde 1921 wegen angeblicher konterrevolutionärer Aktivitäten erschossen., Dem Mosaizist Boris Anrep, dem sie sehr nahestand, wollte sie nicht ins westliche Ausland folgen, weil sie sich nicht vorstellen konnte, ihre Heimat und ihr Volk zu verlassen. Ihre nächste Liebe, der Literaturkritiker Nedobrowo, starb 1919 an Schwindsucht. Nach einer zweiten, von 1918 bis 1922 dauernden und unglücklich verlaufenden Ehe mit dem Assyriologen und Übersetzer Wladimir Schileiko (1891–1930), der ihre Gedichte zum Teil verbrannt haben soll, lebte sie ab 1926 bis 1938 mit dem Kunsthistoriker Nikolai Nikolajewitsch Punin (1888–1953) zusammen, wobei das Paar zum Teil in einer angespannten Situation in einer Wohnung mit Punins Noch-Ehefrau und deren Tochter wohnte. Oftmals lebte Achmatowa in dieser Zeit buchstäblich von Brot und Tee, wobei sie ihr Selbstbewusstsein und ihren eigenen Stil nie aufgab., 1930 bis zum Ausbruch des Krieges., Sowohl ihr Sohn Lew als auch ihr Ehemann Nikolai Punin wurden in den 1930er Jahren mehrfach verhaftet. Ihr Sohn wurde nach dem anfänglichen Todesurteil in die Verbannung geschickt und erst im April 1956, drei Jahre nach Stalins Tod, endgültig nach Hause entlassen. Insgesamt verbrachte er anderthalb Jahrzehnte in Lagerhaft. Ihr Ehemann Nikolai Punin starb 1953 im Arbeitslager Workuta., In der Zeit der Inhaftierung ihres Sohnes verbrachte Achmatowa viel Zeit in den Warteschlangen der Angehörigen vor dem Gefängnis. In \\"Requiem\\", das sie in dieser Zeit zu schreiben begann und das ein einziges Klagelied gegen den Stalin-Terror ist, schrieb sie anstelle eines Vorworts folgenden kurzen Prosatext:, Für Achmatowa waren diese Jahre ein nicht endender Albtraum. Sie rechnete stets damit, dass an ihrem Sohn das Todesurteil vollstreckt wurde. Die neben Achmatowa andere bedeutende russische Lyrikerin des 20. Jahrhunderts, Marina Zwetajewa, die Achmatowa mit dem Zitat „Anna von ganz Russland“ ehrte, erhängte sich 1941 völlig verarmt. Freunde verschwanden, darunter ihr jahrelanger Wegbegleiter Ossip Mandelstam, der während seiner Verhöre in der Lubjanka im Jahre 1934 seine Gedichte über Stalin sogar für seine Folterknechte niederschrieb. Trotzdem wurde er nicht wie damals üblich in den Gulag geschickt, sondern von Stalin, dem der Dichter zur damaligen Zeit tot gefährlicher gewesen wäre als lebendig, versucht ihn \\"zu isolieren, aber am Leben zu erhalten\\". Die Mandelstams wurden daraufhin ins Exil nach Woronesch, 400km südlich von Moskau, verbannt und durften 1937 wieder ins Moskauer Gebiet – wenn auch nicht in die Hauptstadt selbst – zurückkehren. Im Herbst desselben Jahres besuchten die Mandelstams Achmatowa im Fontänenhaus in Leningrad, wo sie auf dem Sofa ihres Zimmers schlafen mussten, da sie keine eigene Unterkunft hatten. Achmatowa schrieb während dieses letzten Besuches der beiden ein Gedicht für Ossip Mandelstam, den sie wie einen Zwillingsbruder ansah. Das Gedicht handelte von der Stadt – Leningrad –, welche sie beide liebten., Mandelstam wurde jedoch sechs Monate später erneut verhaftet und zu fünf Jahren Zwangsarbeit im ostsibirischen Kolyma verurteilt. Auf der Fahrt nach Kolyma kam er, wie im Gedicht beschrieben, am Jenissei sowie: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Akmeismus, Autor, Dissident, Ehrendoktor, Frau, Geboren 1889, Gestorben 1966, Literatur, Russland, Russisch"},{"instruction":"you are the management account, advise the price increase for the menu, here is the information, fixed asset of hkd 50000, 22 business days,","output":"Based on the given information, we can consider the following factors to advise on a price increase for the menu: 1.

Die zu Ehren des heiligen Sebastian geweihte Kirche gehört zum Seelsorgeraum Voitsberg in der Diözese Graz-Seckau und ist der Pfarre Mooskirchen unterstellt. Als Wallfahrtskirche spielt sie nur noch eine lokale Rolle für Kleinsöding und die umliegenden Ortschaften., Ihre Geschichte führt bis in den Beginn des 16. Jahrhunderts zurück, als sie als Pestheiligtum errichtet wurde. Die Ursprünge der Kirche sind dabei eng mit den Ausbrüchen der Pest im 15. Jahrhundert verbunden, die Teile des Umlandes fast vollständig entvölkerte. Überlebende Bauern legten einen Schwur ab, im Laufe ihres Lebens den sogenannten Kühzins zu entrichten. Dabei versprachen sie, den Gegenwert einer Kuh zu spenden. Das so aufgekommene Geld finanzierte den Kirchenbau. Durch erneute Pestepidemien im 17. Jahrhundert entwickelte sich die Kirche zum wichtigsten Pestheiligtum in der Weststeiermark. In der zweiten Hälfte des 17. Jahrhunderts wurden eine Sakristei und die Kreuzkapelle angebaut und die Kirche selbst barockisiert. In den nachfolgenden Jahrhunderten nahm die Bedeutung als Wallfahrtsort aber ab. Seit der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts befindet sich das Bauwerk im Besitz der Gemeinde, die seither auch für die Erhaltung zuständig ist. Vor allem ab der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts wurden zahlreiche Instandhaltungs- und Sanierungsarbeiten an der Bausubstanz und am Kircheninventar durchgeführt., Die Filialkirche von Kleinsöding ist eine im Kern spätgotische und nachträglich barockisierte Saalkirche. Der Kirchturm ragt im Nordwesten über das Langhaus auf und im Südosten ist an den Chorschluss die von außen zugängliche Kreuzkapelle angebaut. Der Hochaltar aus farbig gefasstem Sandstein sowie die beiden Seitenaltäre wurden um 1630 aufgestellt. Die Seitenaltäre wurden dabei aus den Flügeln eines älteren Flügelaltares neu zusammengestellt und zeigen geschnitzte Relieftafeln mit Szenen aus dem Leben Marias., Das gesamte Bauwerk steht unter Denkmalschutz., Lage., Die Kirche steht im östlichen Teil der Gemeinde Söding-Sankt Johann auf einer kleinen Anhöhe, die auch als Kirchenriegel bekannt ist, zentral in der Siedlung Sankt Sebastian etwa 700 Meter westlich des Dorfes Kleinsöding. Sie befindet sich auf einer Seehöhe von rund 350 Metern, am nördlichen Ufer der Kainach im mittleren Kainachtal, auch als Kainachboden bekannt. Etwa 50 Meter nördlich der Kirche verläuft die Packer Straße (B 70). Etwa 600 Meter westlich befindet sich der Zubringer zu der Autobahnabfahrt Mooskirchen der Süd Autobahn (A2). Die Kirche liegt an einem von der Packer Straße nach Südosten abzweigenden Weg und hat wie das direkt nordwestlich von ihr gelegene ehemalige Mesnerhaus die Adresse Kirchenweg1., Auf dem Kirchenvorplatz steht das Kriegerdenkmal der Gemeinden Groß- und Kleinsöding, das an die Gefallenen und Vermissten beider Weltkriege erinnert., Geschichte., Ursprünge und Bauzeit., An der Stelle der heutigen Kirche befand sich vermutlich bereits in der Antike ein Kulthügel, und es gibt die Legende von einem dortigen Heidentempel. Später sollen Pestopfer auf diesem Hügel begraben worden sein. Es gibt zwar Aussagen von Anwohnern, die über Funde von Knochen berichten, aber es konnten bisher keine archäologischen Belege für einen Tempel oder ein Pestgrab erbracht werden. Die Bewohner der Gegend von Kleinsöding wurden spätestens ab dem 12. Jahrhundert von der 1136 erstmals urkundlich erwähnten Pfarre Mooskirchen aus seelsorgerisch versorgt. Als ab 1348 die Pest den heutigen Bezirk Voitsberg befiel, wurden die Dörfer \\"Hardekk\\" und \\"Mukkaw\\" bei Muggauberg sowie das bei Södingberg gelegene \\"Reuner Dorf Sedinge\\" vollständig entvölkert. Als um 1480 die Krankheit erneut die Weststeiermark heimsuchte und die Bevölkerung stark dezimierte, schworen 135 der überlebenden Bauern der Umgebung, für die Errichtung eines zu Ehren des sogenannten Pestheiligen Sebastian geweihten Gotteshauses während ihres Lebens den Wert einer Kuh zu spenden. Diese Spende wird als \\"Kühzins\\" bezeichnet und die Bauern spendeten jedes Jahr, bis der Gegenwert einer Kuh entrichtet worden war. Falls das Spendenziel nicht zu Lebzeiten erreicht worden war, wurde es vererbt, und die Nachkommen waren verpflichtet, es zu erfüllen. Das so zusammengebrachte Geld reichte aus, um bei Kleinsöding eine größere Kirche zu errichten., Vor dem Neubau der Kirche soll an deren späterem Standort eine romanische Jagdkapelle der Schlossherren von Söding gestanden haben. Diese musste dem Neubau weichen. Die Kirche wurde laut dem \\"Geistlichen Personalstand\\" der Diözese Seckau im Jahr 1508 erbaut, wozu Sebastian von Rollau den Auftrag gegeben habe. Wahrscheinlich bezieht sich diese Annahme aber nur auf den Bau des Chores, der bis zur Fertigstellung der Kirche als Kapelle genutzt wurde. In dieser Kapelle befand sich bereits eine aus Sandstein gefertigte Statue des heiligen Sebastian. Sie soll von Mönchen, die aus dem spanischen San Sebastian vertrieben worden und zum Riedlhof oder Riederhof bei Berndorf gekommen waren, aufgestellt worden sein. In den nachfolgenden Jahren stieg die Zahl der Wallfahrer stetig an. Mit dem so eingebrachten Geld konnten bis 1562 das an den Chor angebaute Kirchenschiff mit flacher Holzdecke und bis 1564 der Bau des Kirchturms finanziert werden. Auf die Errichtung des Kirchenschiffs weist unter anderem ein mit Jahreszahl und Zeichen des Baumeisters versehener Stein am Torbogen des Turmportales hin. Zu den Stiftern der Kirche dürften auch die auf Schloss Rollau ansässigen Rollauer gehört haben, da die Kirche als ihre Grablege diente., Die Zeit vom 16. bis in das 19. Jahrhundert., Pestausbrüche, die 1584/85 das Kainachtal und 1634, 1679/80 sowie von 1713 bis 1716 den Bezirk Voitsberg heimsuchten, hatten zur Folge, dass immer mehr Wallfahrer zu der Kirche pilgerten. Im 17. Jahrhundert erreichten die Wallfahrten ihre Blütezeit und die Sebastianikirche entwickelte sich zum bedeutendsten Pestheiligtum der Weststeiermark. Um 1630 wurde der Hochaltar der Kirche aufgestellt und die bereits in der Kirche befindliche Sebastiansstatue wurde als Altarbild daraufgesetzt. Ab 1665 trat die auf Schloss Groß-Söding ansässige Familie Keller von Kellersperg als Wohltäter der Kirche in Erscheinung. Im Jahr 1676 wurde das spätgotische Bauwerk barockisiert, das bisher flach gedeckte Kirchenschiff eingewölbt und eine Empore eingebaut. Auch die Sakristei und die von außen zugängliche Kreuzkapelle an der Außenseite des Chors entstanden bei der Umgestaltung. Als einziger der Mooskirchner Pfarrer wurde M. Simon Schoper 1694 auf seinen testamentarischen Wunsch hin unter dem Fronbogen, neben der vermutlich von ihm gestifteten lebensgroßen Sebastiansfigur, in der Kirche begraben., Noch von 1711 bis 1880 wurde ein Zinsverzeichnis über die Entrichtung des Kühzinses geführt, was darauf schließen lässt, dass Nachfahren der ursprünglichen Stifter noch immer für den Erhalt der Kirche spendeten. Zu Beginn des 18. Jahrhunderts wurden Personen aus zwölf verschiedenen Pfarren als Stifter aufgeführt. Der in Mooskirchen tätige Dechant Alois Wagl verfasste 1799 eine mehrbändige Pfarrchronik und beschreibt darin auch die damalige Einrichtung der Kirche., Um 1800 wurde das Altarbild des Hochaltares, die Sebastiansstatue, durch eine Figur der Anna selbdritt ersetzt. Um die Figuren des Hochaltars während des Fünften Koalitionskrieges zu schützen, wurden sie 1809 mit einem Bretterverschlag umgeben. Die Franzosen unter dem Kommando des Marschalls Auguste Frédéric Louis Viesse de Marmont nutzten zwischen dem 25. Juni und dem 15. Dezember 1809 die Kirche als Magazin. Ebenso missbrauchte ein Regiment von Ulanen, das sich vom 27. Juli bis zum 14. August 1813 in der Gegend niederließ, die Kirche als Magazin. Als die Pfarrkirche Ligist in der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts umgebaut wurde, kam einiges des dortigen Kircheninventares wie die beiden Figuren seitlich des Hochaltares nach Kleinsöding. Auch das Tabernakel kam nach Kleinsöding, erwies sich aber als zu groß für den Hochaltar und wurde deshalb auf der Empore aufgestellt., In der Zeit nach der Schaffung der freien Ortsgemeinde Kleinsöding im Jahr 1850 ging die Sebastianikirche durch einen Vergleich mit dem Pfarrer von Mooskirchen in den Besitz der Gemeinde über. Der Pfarrer behielt aber das Aufsichtsrecht über die Kirche und sie blieb weiterhin der dortigen Pfarre unterstellt. Die Gemeinde führte mit Hilfe der Kirchenpröpste eigene Kirchenrechnungen. Durch einen Blitzschlag brannte am 14. April 1874 der Dachstuhl des Kirchturms und auch die Orgel wurde durch das Feuer beschädigt. Der Brand konnte von der Bevölkerung aber schnell gelöscht werden, so dass keine größeren Schäden entstanden. 1876/77 wurden der Chor und das Langhaus neu ausgemalt, dabei wurden frühere Dorn- und Weintraubenverzierungen sowie die Sonnenuhr an der Südseite des Langhauses übertüncht. Bei einer Renovierung im Jahr 1890 wurde ein Fresko des heiligen Sebastian an der südlichen Außenwand des Langhauses ebenfalls übermalt. Im Rahmen dieser Renovierung wurden alte Fenster der Grazer Franziskanerkirche gespendet. In den 1880er-Jahren wurde eine Turmuhr eingebaut., Seit dem 20. Jahrhundert., Unter dem von 1921 bis 1925 in Mooskirchen tätigen Kaplan Josef Radl kam es von 1924 bis 1926 zu einer umfassenden Renovierung der Kirche, die er teilweise selbst bezahlte. Er verfasste bis 1925 auch eine Historie der Kirche, die als \\"Radl-Chronik\\" bekannt ist., Mit der Zusammenlegung der Gemeinden Kleinsöding und Großsöding zur Gemeinde Söding im Jahr 1958 ging die Kirche in den Besitz der neuen Gemeinde über. In den nachfolgenden Jahrzehnten wurden umfangreiche Reparatur- und Renovierungsarbeiten durchgeführt. So wurden 1961 der linke und 1978 der rechte Seitenaltar restauriert, 1970/71 die Fassade erneuert und von 1978 bis 1983 die Innenseite und Teile der Ausstattung renoviert. 1979 riefen die Bewohner von Söding die Kirchengemeinschaft St. Sebastian als uneigennützige Verein: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Baudenkmal, Dekanat Voitsberg, Ersterwähnung 1508, Filialkirche, Saalkirche, Sebastianskirche, Söding-Sankt Johann, Wallfahrtskirche, Weststeiermark, Kirchenbau"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Archäologischer Fundplatz in London, City of London, Römische Stadt in Britannien], Londinium, das heutige London, war die größte Stadt und Hauptstadt der römischen Provinz Britannien. Durch seine günstige Lage an der Themse, die wiederum einen guten Anschluss ans Meer und ins Hinterland bot, war Londinium auch ein bedeutendes Handelszentrum., Die Geschichte von Londinium lässt sich aus wenigen verstreuten Erwähnungen bei antiken Autoren, anhand der allgemeinen Geschichte Britanniens und durch Ausgrabungen in der Stadt in groben Zügen rekonstruieren. Am Ende des dritten Jahrhunderts war sie sogar Residenz des Gegenkaisers Carausius und damit Hauptstadt eines Sonderreiches in Britannien. Als bedeutende römische Stadt hatte sie alle öffentlichen Gebäude einer solchen, wobei nur ein Teil von ihnen durch Ausgrabungen identifiziert werden konnte. Das große Forum im Zentrum der Stadt, einer der größten Bauten seiner Art nördlich der Alpen, bezeugt die starke wirtschaftliche Position Londiniums. Dies wird auch durch die Reste zahlreicher Warenlager an den Ufern der Themse bestätigt., Geschichte., Im Jahre 43 n. Chr. wurden große Teile des heutigen England von den Römern erobert. In den Jahren nach der Eroberung kam es zu verschiedenen Stadtgründungen, bei denen es sich meist um die Hauptorte einheimischer Stämme handelte. Die Städte, deren Gründung oft die Errichtung eines Militärlagers vorausging, wurden der Ausgangspunkt der Romanisierung des Landes. Mit den Soldaten kamen auch Händler und Handwerker, die in der neuen Provinz ihr Glück suchten., Im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen römischen Städten in Britannien scheint Londinium keinen keltischen Vorgängerort gehabt zu haben, und die Stadt war auch nie der Hauptort eines Stammesgebietes (civitas). Im heutigen Stadtgebiet von London gibt es diverse vorgeschichtliche Siedlungen, doch ist keine von ihnen als wirkliche Vorgängersiedlung zu bezeichnen. Es wird ein römisches Militärlager an der Stelle der späteren Stadt vermutet, doch konnte dies bisher archäologisch nicht nachgewiesen werden und bleibt daher spekulativ. Dennoch ist schon bei der Namensgebung (Londinium ist wohl keltischen Ursprungs und enthält möglicherweise den keltischen Personennamen \\"Londinos\\") ein starker keltischer Einfluss erkennbar. Möglicherweise ist der Ortsname aber vom vorkeltischen (ureuropäischen) Wort \\"Plowonida\\" abgeleitet, was ungefähr „Siedlung am breiten Fluss“ bedeutet., Die Lage des Ortes war ausgesprochen günstig. Hier war die Themse (lateinisch \\"Tamesis\\") relativ flach und konnte deshalb ohne Schwierigkeiten durchquert werden. Der Fluss bot einen guten Anschluss an das Meer und damit nach Gallien und zum Mittelmeerraum. Von Londinium konnte man auf dem Landweg auch gut andere Orte in Britannien erreichen. Schon bei der römischen Invasion im Jahr 43 war die Stelle der späteren Stadt ein zentraler Anlaufpunkt der Römer., Vor dem Aufstand der Boudicca 47–60 n. Chr.., Archäologen gehen heute davon aus, dass Londinium ein paar Jahre nach der Invasion als zivile Siedlung entstanden ist, ausgehend vom Cornhill im Osten des heutigen Stadtzentrums. Entlang der einstigen, in Ost-West-Richtung verlaufenden römischen Hauptstraße wurde in den Jahren 1994 bis 1996 beim Neubau des Hauses No 1 Poultry eine hölzerne Abwasserleitung entdeckt. Die dendrochronologische Untersuchung im Jahre 1997 ergab, dass sie aus dem Jahr 47n.Chr. stammt; dies wird seitdem vielfach als wahrscheinlichstes Gründungsjahr der Stadt angesehen., Beiderseits des sumpfigen Walbrooktals (der Bach Walbrook mündete hier in die Themse) wurde der Ort auf Anhöhen errichtet. 2016 wurden beim Neubau eines Bürohochhauses hölzerne Schrifttafeln im feuchten Schlamm des ehemaligen Flusslaufes des Walbrook gefunden, die die ältesten handschriftlichen Dokumente in Großbritannien darstellen. Von insgesamt 405 Tafeln konnten 87 entziffert werden. Sie geben einen Einblick in das Alltagsleben in der Stadt in der Zeit des ersten Jahrhunderts nach Christus. Eine Tafel aus der ersten Dekade nach der Eroberung im Jahr 43 nach Christus liefert dabei die älteste Erwähnung des römischen Namens \\"Londinium\\" für die Stadt. Die Tafeln wurden größtenteils in Lagen von Abfall gefunden, der an diese Stelle gebracht worden war, um die Ufer des Flusses zu befestigen. Bislang konnten weder eine Brücke noch ein Kastell noch Bauten, die üblicherweise errichtet wurden, nachgewiesen werden. Diese Siedlung erlangte schon früh bedeutende Ausmaße. An der Stelle des späteren Forums gab es einen großen freien Platz, der wahrscheinlich als Markt fungierte. Die damaligen Häuser waren alle aus Holz. Dem Bericht von Tacitus zufolge war die Stadt wegen ihrer vielen Kaufleute und umfangreichen Handelsbeziehungen berühmt. Tacitus’ Aussagen wurden durch zahlreiche archäologische Funde im Hafenbereich untermauert. Die frühe besondere Bedeutung erlangte Londinium also durch den Handel mit dem europäischen Festland., Beim Aufstand der Boudicca im Jahr 60n.Chr. nahmen die Rebellen den Ort, der sicherlich nicht befestigt war, ein und brannten ihn vollkommen nieder. Der römische Legat Gaius Suetonius Paulinus konnte die Stadt nicht halten und die Aufständischen ließen die florierende Stadt ihre besondere Wut spüren. Der Zerstörungshorizont ist heute archäologisch gut sichtbar. Aus der Zeit kurz vor und nach dem Aufstand stammen die Bloomberg-Tafeln. Es handelt sich um 405 hölzerne Schreibtafeln, die vor allem belegen, wie schnell sich das Leben nach dem Aufstand wieder normalisiert hatte., Zweites und drittes Jahrhundert., In den Jahren nach dem Aufstand wurde die Stadt wieder aufgebaut. Londinium war nun Hauptstadt der Provinz Britannien, wobei der genaue Zeitpunkt des Umzuges der Provinzialverwaltung von Camulodunum (Colchester) nach Londinium nicht sicher ist. Doch spricht für die Bedeutung der Stadt beispielsweise, dass hier der Provinzverwalter Gaius Iulius Alpinus Classicianus bestattet wurde. Westlich des Walbrook wurden öffentliche steinerne Bauten errichtet, so ein Forum, ein Praetorium und Thermen. Südöstlich vom antiken Stadtzentrum, am heutigen \\"Plantation Place\\" stand ein kleines Militärlager, das bis etwa 85 n. Chr. in Betrieb war. Die genaue Funktion ist unbekannt. Das Forum wurde um 120 erweitert. Im Nordwesten der Stadt entstand ein vier Hektar großes Kastell, das in einem Zusammenhang mit dem \\"officium\\" des Statthalters zu sehen ist. In unmittelbarer Umgebung befand sich ein Amphitheater. Um das Jahr 100 begann man auch mit der Erweiterung der Kaianlagen, die aus riesigen Eichenbalken entlang dem Themseufer errichtet wurden., Obwohl es früh schon zahlreiche Steinbauten gab, bestand der Großteil der Wohnbebauung zunächst aus Holzhäusern. Die Stadt hatte einen Plan mit sich rechtwinklig kreuzenden Straßen, freilich mit zahlreichen Unregelmäßigkeiten, die vielleicht auf das ungeplante frühe Wachstum der Stadt zurückzuführen sind. Es gab verschiedene Stadtbrände, in denen Teile der Stadt vernichtet wurden. Das wohl verheerendste dieser Feuer kann in die Regierungszeit des Kaisers Hadrian datiert werden. Aus dieser Zeit konnte ein ausgebranntes Warenlager ausgegraben werden, voll von importierter, noch unbenutzter Terra Sigillata. Der genaue Umfang des Feuers ist in der Forschung jedoch umstritten. Vor allem öffentliche Gebäude waren nicht Opfer des Feuers. Möglicherweise sind bei Ausgrabungen diverse kleine Feuer erfasst worden, die unabhängig voneinander um 120 n. Chr. datieren., Im Jahr 122 besuchte Kaiser Hadrian Britannien und wahrscheinlich auch Londinium, und es wird vermutet, dass der Bau und die Erweiterung einiger öffentlicher Gebäude auf Anregung des Kaisers erfolgt sind. In der Folgezeit erreichte die antike Stadt ihre größte Blütezeit und es kann angenommen werden, dass mehrere zehntausend Menschen hier lebten., In den Jahren 185 bis 187 war der spätere Kaiser Pertinax Statthalter von Britannien und residierte in der Stadt. Kurz nach ihm wurde um 195 Clodius Albinus, der ebenfalls Statthalter von Britannien war, wahrscheinlich in Londinium zum Caesar, also zum Mitkaiser erhoben., Zwischen 190 und 220 errichtete man im Norden, Osten und Westen des Stadtgebietes eine Mauer, die gegen Ende des dritten Jahrhunderts bis zur Themse erweitert wurde. Die genauen Gründe für den Bau der London Wall bleiben im Dunkeln, doch geschah dies zu einer Zeit, als auch viele andere britannische Städte eine Stadtmauer erhielten. Um 200 wurde die britannische Provinz zweigeteilt. Londinium war nun die Hauptstadt von Britannia superior. Im Laufe des dritten Jahrhunderts wurden die Verhältnisse unruhiger, und die Stadt scheint auch Ziel von Angriffen seitens verschiedener Barbaren gewesen zu sein. Am Ende des dritten Jahrhunderts (286) war die Stadt wahrscheinlich Regierungssitz des Gegenkaisers Carausius und von dessen Nachfolger Allectus. 296 eroberte der legitime Imperator Constantius I., auf dessen Münzen sich das älteste Bild der Stadt findet, dieses britannische Sonderreich zurück. Die Quellen berichten von einer drohenden Plünderung der Stadt durch die Franken, die der Kaiser gerade noch verhindern konnte. Kurz darauf kam es zu einer erneuten Provinzteilung. Londinium war nun der Hauptort der Provinz Maxima Caesariensis. Das ganze dritte Jahrhundert ist archäologisch in der Stadt nur schlecht belegt. Gegenüber dem zweiten Jahrhundert machte Londinium offensichtlich eine Phase des Niederganges durch., Viertes Jahrhundert., Ab 314 ist für die Stadt auch ein Bischof bezeugt: Restitutus nahm in diesem Jahr am Konzil von Arles teil und wird in diesem Zusammenhang in den Quellen genannt. Administrativ behielt die Stadt ihre Bedeutung weiterhin. Neben der Erhebung zur \\"Augusta\\" ist auch die Stationierung des \\"praepositus thesaurum Augustensium\\" im späten 4. Jahrhundert zu nennen., Im Verlauf des vierten Jahrhunderts gab es auf Britannien zahlreiche Angriffe von Franken und Sachsen. Inwieweit die Stadt davon betroffen war, ist nicht bekannt. Flavius Theodosius, der Vater des späteren Kaisers Theodosius I., setzte 368 mit seinem Sohn nach Britannien über und gelangte nach Londinium, wo er überwinterte, um dann die Ordnung wiederherzustellen. Dennoch war Britannien in der Spätantike vor allem ein Sprungbrett für Usurpatoren. Im Jahr 383 gab es mit Magnus Maximus wieder einen Gegenkaiser in Britannien, dessen Hauptstadt kurzzeitig Londinium gewesen sein dürfte und der hier auch Münzen prägen ließ. Nachdem der Usurpator KonstantinIII. 407 Britannien mit den Resten des Feldheeres verlassen hatte, war die Provinz weitgehend sich selbst überlassen.

Ein Teil der in mehreren europäischen Ländern populären Umzugsriesen stellt biblische oder mythologische Riesen dar. Vierzehn dieser Figuren sind überlebensgroße Nachbildungen des biblischen Samson mit der Ausrüstung eines römischen Legionärs oder eines Soldaten aus der napoleonischen Zeit. Sie bestehen aus Holz oder Leichtmetall und werden bei traditionellen Straßenumzügen von je einer Person getragen. Es gibt sie in Ath, im Westen der Wallonie (Belgien), und im inneralpinen Österreich. Die mittlerweile 13Samsonfiguren im Lungau und in der angrenzenden Steiermark (einer abgeschlossenen Kulturlandschaft an der Dreiländerecke zwischen Salzburg, Steiermark und Kärnten) werden auf ihren Umzügen von der Musikkapelle und teilweise von zwei Hilfsfiguren (die Paar-Konstellation ist eine typische in den Faschingsläufen des 16.und 17.Jahrhunderts) in Form je eines männlichen und weiblichen Zwergs, von Schützen und von Volkstanzgruppen begleitet. Die Samsonfigur von Ath ist eine mehrerer Riesen-Figuren des jährlichen Festivals Ducasse d’Ath., Das \\"Samsontragen im Lungau und Bezirk Murau\\" wurde 2010 in die Liste Immaterielles Kulturerbe in Österreich (nationale UNESCO-Liste) aufgenommen., Samsonfiguren als Umzugsriesen., Einordnung und Verbreitung., „In den religiösen und weltlichen Umzugsspielen verschiedener Europäischer Landschaften, die alle eine gegenreformatorische Geschichte im Zusammenhang mit den bedeutenden Restaurationsorden der Jesuiten und Dominikaner und den ihnen nachgereihten Minderorden aufweisen, treten überlebensgroße, menschengestaltige Maskenfiguren auf, die nach ihrer Gestalt und Funktion allgemein \\"Umgangsriesen\\", speziell \\"Prozessions-\\" oder \\"Umzugsriesen\\" genannt werden. Vom rein morphologischen Gesichtspunkt sind sie als überdimensionierte Plastiken anzusprechen, die in Umgängen zur Schau dargeboten werden. … Werden die Umgangsriesen hingegen von ihrer Funktion gesehen, so sind sie als Spielmasken zu werten. Sie sind ein darstellerisches Mittel zur Vergegenwärtigung einer erzählerischen und letztlich glaubensmäßigen Gestalt“., Die frühesten Hinweise auf Umzugsriesen finden sich in bronzezeitlichen Steinritzungen in Süd- und Mittelschweden. Drei antike Autoren beschreiben Riesenfiguren aus Flechtwerksgestellen in Gallien. In der Zeitspanne vom späten Mittelalter bis etwa zur napoleonischen Zeit lassen sich Umgangsriesen für Holland, Belgien, Südengland, in verschiedenen Gegenden Frankreichs und Spaniens, in Süddeutschland, Österreich, Kalabrien, Sizilien, Mexiko und Brasilien nachweisen., Heute konzentrieren sich Umzugsriesen auf das Gebiet von Nordfrankreich über Belgien bis zu den südlichen Niederlanden, Katalonien, Valencia, Sizilien und dem österreichischen Lungau. Gebiete, die, wie Arbeiten u.a. von Karl Amon zeigen, zusammenhängende gegenreformatorische Prozessionslandschaften unter deutlichem Einfluss der Habsburger sind. Manche Traditionen kennen einen festen Kanon von Riesen, oft zusammen mit traditionsreichen und historischen Figuren. Bei anderen sind die Figuren einem steten Wandel unterworfen. Alttestamentliche Riesen sind bei Ersteren häufige Motive. Am prominentesten wird dabei der Riese Goliat dargestellt., Samsonfiguren, die bei Straßenumzügen als Riesen zum Einsatz kommen, gibt es in zehn Gemeinden im Lungau (identisch mit dem Bezirk Tamsweg im Land Salzburg) –in Tamsweg, Mariapfarr, St. Michael, Muhr, Unternberg, Wölting (einem Ortsteil von Tamsweg), Ramingstein, St. Andrä, St. Margarethen, Mauterndorf –, in zwei Gemeinden in der angrenzenden Steiermark– in Murau und Krakaudorf –, sowie in Ath in Belgien., Trotz der großen geografischen Distanz zwischen den Samsonfiguren sind diese durch ihre Entstehungsgeschichte miteinander vergleichbar. Beide sind bis in das 17.Jahrhundert durch schriftliche Nachweise belegt. Für einige österreichische Samsonfiguren ist nachweisbar, dass sie früher Teil viel größerer Prozessionen mit anderen alttestamentlichen Figuren waren, wie sie heute noch Bestandteil des Ducasse-Festivals in Belgien sind. Sowohl die österreichischen Figuren wie auch der belgische Samson wurden im Zuge der Aufklärung und der Französischen Revolution verboten, wobei die Verbote bei den österreichischen Samsonfiguren deutlich länger anhielten., Gemeinsam ist den Riesenfiguren im Lungau und den burgundischen Niederlanden, zu denen Ath gehört, dass sie nur an Kirchweihtagen auftreten (\\"ducasse\\"- beziehungsweise Prangtagen), die in den Monaten Juni bis August liegen, was ein weiterer Hinweis auf ihre Herkunft aus den großen katholischen Prozessionen ist. Eine weitere Parallele besteht im David-und-Goliath-Spiel, das sich mit Unterbrechungen auch in Ramingstein im Lungau als Brauch erhalten hat und ein typisches Fronleichnamsspiel war. Im Gegensatz zu Ath wird es aber nicht durch Riesenfiguren, sondern durch Menschen aufgeführt., Gestalt der Figuren., Eine Samsonfigur ist etwa 80 Kilogramm schwer und wird von einem einzigen Mann getragen. Dieser wird von mehreren Assistenten unterstützt. In Österreich sind vier sogenannte \\"Aufhabe\\" (von „aufladen“) üblich, die in Pausen den Samson abstützen und in kritischen Situationen zu Hilfe eilen. In der Steiermark werden sie \\"Haberer\\" genannt., Die verschiedenen Samsonfiguren unterscheiden sich vor allem durch ihre Größe und die Farbe der Kleidung. Die existierenden Figuren sind zwischen 4,30 und 6,80 Meter hoch. Fast alle tragen eine Tunika, eine breite Schärpe über Schulter und Hüfte und auf dem Kopf einen Kriegerhelm. Bewaffnet sind sie mit einer Lanze und einem Krummsäbel. Lediglich in Ath und Murau tragen die Figuren davon abweichend eine Uniform aus der Zeit der Französischen Revolution. In anderen Orten werden sie von Musik- und Schützengruppen in französischen Uniformen begleitet, ein volkstümlicher Spott auf den Feind, aus der Zeit der Franzosenkriege. In der Hand halten sie einen Eselskinnbacken (Ausnahme Mariapfarr). Mit dem Eselskinnbacken erschlug der biblische Samson die feindlichen Philister. Der Samson aus Ath trägt als weiteres Attribut eine Säule, da er, angekettet daran, die Säule samt dem Tempel niederriss und damit die Philister unter dem Schutt des Tempels begrub. Die Köpfe der Samsonfiguren sind entweder aus Holz geschnitzt, bestehen aus Pappmaché mit einem Holzgestell dahinter oder aus Polyesterguss (Mauterndorf)., Einige Samsonfiguren werden von zwei Zwergen an ihrer Seite (etwas übermannshohe Tragfiguren mit Riesenköpfen) begleitet. In der ersten historischen Abbildung, die aus dem Jahr 1803 in Tamsweg stammt, sind es zwei weibliche Zwerge. Heute ist es stets je ein männlicher und ein weiblicher Zwerg, die möglicherweise Sonne und Mond symbolisieren. Sie lassen den Riesen Samson noch eindrucksvoller erscheinen., Im Folgenden werden die Gemeinsamkeiten der Samsonfiguren in Geschichte und heutiger Verwendung im inneralpinen Österreich näher beschrieben. Die Geschichte der Samsonfigur von Ath ist untrennbar mit der Geschichte der Ducasse d’Ath verbunden., Die Samsonfiguren des inneralpinen Österreichs., Geschichte der Samsonfiguren., Entstehung., Die Lungauer Riesenfiguren sind ab der ersten Hälfte des 18.Jahrhunderts durch Quellen belegt. Die Samsonfigur war neben anderen biblischen Figuren Teil einer barocken Prozession am Fronleichnams- bzw. Prangtag. Diese Prozessionen sind für Tamsweg für den Zeitraum von 1690 bis 1720 belegt. 1720 wird im Sterbebuch der Tod eines Goliatträgers festgehalten. Belegt sind die Prozessionen auch für StMichael und Murau. Vergleichbare Prozessionen mit Riesenfiguren haben sich in Sizilien –beispielsweise die Riesen \\"Cronos\\" und \\"Mitia\\" in Mistretta– erhalten., Es wurde vermutet, dass der Samsonbrauch einen weit älteren Ursprung haben könnte. So hieß es im Zuge der Verbote von 1802, die Tradition der Samsonfiguren sei sehr alt. Verschiedene naturmythologische und nationale Theorien suchten den Ursprung der Samsonfigur in germanisch wie als slawisch angesehenen „Kornvater-Legenden“. Solche Meinungen völkischer Mythen- und Sagensuche finden heute teilweise noch populäres wie populistisches Wohlwollen. Es ist allerdings nicht erwiesen, ob die frühen Vorstufen der Volkskunde, die Naturmythologen Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts diese Legenden erst erfunden haben, oder ob es dazu tatsächlich Meinungen in der Bevölkerung gab., Im Wörterbuch der deutschen Volkskunde in der Ausgabe von 1974, die auf der Ausgabe von 1940 aufbaut, sind die Begriffe Samson und Kornvater nicht mehr enthalten., Eine andere Erklärung für das Auftauchen der Samsonfiguren liefert eine Sage, wonach den Lungauern, und insbesondere den Einwohnern des Dorfes \\"Wölrinf\\" (heute Wölting), das Samson-Privileg aufgrund besonderer Tapferkeit bei einer erfolgreichen Schlacht gegen die Herzogin Margarete von Tirol (1318–1369) verliehen wurde. Eine ähnliche Sage gibt es auch für Muhr. Solche Sagen führen zwar von der tatsächlichen Geschichte weg, zeigen aber, wie wichtig der Bevölkerung dieser Brauch und seine herausragende Gestalt wurden. Dasselbe könnte man auch als Begründung für das lange Fortdauern heute als unwissenschaftlich erwiesener früherer politischer Meinungen sehen: das Bedürfnis, einen geliebten Brauch durch eine „uralte“, nicht mehr nachvollziehbare Geschichte noch bedeutsamer zu machen., Barocke Prunkprozessionen der Gegenreformation., Die ersten Quellen zum Samsonbrauch stehen im Zusammenhang mit den in der Gegenreformation 1643 gegründeten Kapuzinerklöstern in Tamsweg und Murau. Ihre Hauptaufgabe war, die in der Reformationszeit zum großen Teil evangelisch gewordene Bevölkerung des oberen Murtals wieder zum katholischen Glauben zurückzuführen. Diesem Zweck dienten prunkvolle Prozessionen, insbesondere am Gründonnerstag, am Karfreitag, zu Fronleichnam und am Bruderschaftsmontag (eine Oktave nach Fronleichnam). Bei Letzterem wurden sechs auf ochsenbespannte Wagen montierte bewegliche Miniaturbühnen mit Szenen des alten Testaments mitgeführt. An siebter Stelle führt die Prozessionsordnung den Samson. Der Samson war „12 Schuah hoch“ (ca. 360 – 380cm) und wurde von einem Träger getragen, der von einem Führer unterstützt wurde. Im Gefolge der Samsonfigur fanden sich –vergleichbar mit heute– die Schützen mit Fahne, Fähnrich, Trommelschläger, Pfeifer und Korporal.

Heute gibt es eine ganze Reihe von Funktionen, die als Ackermannfunktion bezeichnet werden. Diese weisen alle ein ähnliches Bildungsgesetz wie die ursprüngliche Ackermannfunktion auf und haben auch ein ähnliches Wachstumsverhalten., Entstehungsgeschichte., 1926 vermutete David Hilbert, dass jede berechenbare Funktion primitiv-rekursiv sei. Vereinfacht bedeutet dies, dass sich jede durch einen Computer berechenbare Funktion aus einigen wenigen, sehr einfachen Regeln zusammensetzen lässt und dass sich die Dauer der Berechnung im Voraus abschätzen lässt., Dies trifft auf nahezu alle in der Praxis vorkommenden Funktionen zu., Ebenfalls 1926 konstruierte Ackermann eine Funktion, die diese Vermutung widerlegt, und veröffentlichte sie 1928. Ihm zu Ehren wird diese Funktion heute Ackermannfunktion genannt. Sie kann von einem Computer in endlicher Zeit ausgewertet werden, ist aber nicht primitiv-rekursiv., 1935 konstruierte Rózsa Péter eine vereinfachte Version, die die gleichen Eigenschaften besitzt. Diese Funktion, gelegentlich auch als Ackermann-Péter-Funktion bezeichnet, wird heute vorwiegend benutzt., Idee., Man betrachtet die Folge, Hierbei wird bei jedem Folgenglied die Operation des vorigen Folgenglieds formula_2-mal auf formula_3 angewandt, also formula_4 ist gerade formula_5, wobei die Variable formula_3 formula_7-mal vorkommt und so weiter. Die Idee hinter der Ackermannfunktion ist es, diese Folge als Funktion aufzufassen., \\"Beispiel:\\", Die Ackermannfunktion, notiert als formula_13, ist also eine Funktion, die die folgenden Gleichungen erfüllt:, Ab der vierten Zeile können die Funktionswerte nicht mehr mit herkömmlichen Operatoren formuliert werden; man braucht erweiterte Notationen, wie beispielsweise den Hyper-Operator., Definition und Varianten., Die Ackermannfunktion definiert man üblicherweise rekursiv, d.h. man macht für einige Anfangswerte explizite Angaben und gibt eine Anleitung (das Rekursionsschema), wie man weitere Funktionswerte aus den bereits berechneten erhält., Definition von Ackermann., Ackermann selbst definierte die Funktion auf recht umständliche Weise, gab aber kurz darauf die folgende äquivalente Definition an:, Dabei ist formula_21 eine weitere Funktion, die Ackermann nicht weiter beschrieb. Sie liefert die Startwerte formula_22:, Wenn man vom Wachstum der Ackermannfunktion spricht, meint man oftmals die Funktion formula_32., Definition von Péter., Rózsa Péter definierte 1935 eine einfachere Version der Ackermannfunktion, die nur zwei Parameter besitzt und zudem ohne die Hilfsfunktion formula_33 auskommt:, Auch hier meint man im Zusammenhang mit Wachstumsuntersuchungen oftmals die Funktion formula_35, wenn man von der Ackermannfunktion spricht., Aus dieser Definition ist nicht sofort ersichtlich, dass die Funktion formula_36 für alle nicht negativen, ganzzahligen formula_37 und formula_38 definiert ist, da formula_38 teilweise auch erhöht wird. Man kann aber erkennen, dass zum einen formula_40 für formula_41 wohldefiniert ist., Zum anderen ist unter der Voraussetzung, dass formula_42 wohldefiniert ist, auch formula_43 wohldefiniert, indem man die letzten beiden Rekursionsvorschriften iterativ benutzt., Zu beachten ist allerdings, dass es bei einer Verringerung von formula_37 keine obere Schranke für das Wachstum von formula_38 in den folgenden Funktionsaufrufen gibt., Modifizierte Ackermannfunktion., Häufig werden in der Komplexitätsanalyse leicht modifizierte Versionen der Ackermannfunktion verwendet, die jedoch das gleiche asymptotische Laufzeitverhalten aufweisen. Eine dieser Varianten, die eine Interpretation als „verallgemeinerte Exponentialfunktion“ erlaubt, kann wie folgt angegeben werden:, Die so definierte Folge von Funktionen formula_47 können nun zu der Definition der modifizierten Ackermannfunktion formula_48 verwendet werden, indem man, setzt., Die Funktionen formula_47 können nun als natürliche Fortsetzung der Addition, Multiplikation und Potenzierung interpretiert werden. So repräsentiert beispielsweise formula_51 die formula_37-fache Addition der Zahl formula_53, formula_54 die formula_37-fache Multiplikation der Zahl formula_53 usw. Es gilt, Bedeutung in der theoretischen Informatik., Wie eingangs schon erwähnt, erfand Ackermann diese Funktion als Beispiel einer Funktion, die nicht primitiv-rekursiv, aber berechenbar ist., Auf der Suche nach den Grenzen von Computern stößt man sehr schnell auf den Begriff der berechenbaren Funktionen. Das sind all die Funktionen, für deren Auswertung man einen Algorithmus angeben kann, also alle Funktionen, die ein Computer (insbesondere eine Turingmaschine) berechnen kann. Diese Definition stellt einen sehr schnell vor ein Problem, wenn man von einer konkreten Funktion entscheiden möchte, ob sie berechenbar ist. Findet man einen Algorithmus, der die Funktion berechnet, so ist sie offensichtlich berechenbar. Andernfalls ist ungewiss, ob die Funktion wirklich nicht berechenbar ist oder ob es zwar einen Algorithmus gibt, man ihn aber nicht gefunden hat., Aus diesem Grund sucht man nach alternativen Definitionen, mit denen man einen solchen Nachweis einfacher führen kann. Ein erster Ansatz hierfür waren die primitiv-rekursiven Funktionen. Dies sind Funktionen, die sich durch einige wenige Regeln aus sehr einfachen Funktionen zusammensetzen lassen., Einige Zeit vermutete man, dass alle berechenbaren Funktionen primitiv-rekursiv sind, mit den primitiv-rekursiven Funktionen also ein Werkzeug zur Lösung des oben geschilderten Problems gefunden sei. Diese Hoffnung zerstörte jedoch die Ackermannfunktion, von der man nachweisen kann, dass sie berechenbar, aber nicht primitiv-rekursiv ist. (Siehe nachfolgender Beweis.), \\"Führt man auf der Klasse der primitiv-rekursiven Funktionen eine weitere Konstruktionsregel, die sogenannte µ-Rekursion, ein, erhält man eine größere Klasse ebenfalls berechenbarer Funktionen, die die Ackermannfunktion enthält. Man nimmt an, dass diese Klasse der µ-rekursiven Funktionen der Klasse der intuitiv berechenbaren Funktionen entspricht (Churchsche These).\\", Beweis., Der Beweis, dass die Ackermannfunktion berechenbar ist, aber nicht primitiv-rekursiv, nutzt im Wesentlichen aus, dass die Ackermannfunktion stärker wächst als jede primitiv-rekursive Funktion., Beweisskizze zur Behauptung, dass die Ackermannfunktion nicht primitiv-rekursiv ist:, Anwendungen., Für die Ackermannfunktion gibt es nur sehr wenige Anwendungen. Die zwei wichtigsten sind Benchmarktests für rekursive Aufrufe in Programmiersprachen und Laufzeitabschätzungen der gewichteten Vereinigung und Pfadkompression bei der Union-Find-Struktur., Benchmark für rekursive Aufrufe., Bei der Einführung von neuen Programmiersprachen, Compilern und Computern möchte man deren Leistungsfähigkeit untersuchen. Dazu werden u.a. mittels Benchmarking durch spezielle Programme festgelegte Eigenschaften überprüft., In diesem Zusammenhang wird die Ackermannfunktion gerne als Benchmark zur Überprüfung von rekursiven Prozedur-Aufrufen benutzt, da ein Programm zur Berechnung der Ackermannfunktion im Wesentlichen nur aus solchen Prozeduraufrufen besteht. In der Definition von Péter wird ja nur formula_75 direkt berechnet. Die Schwierigkeit bei der Berechnung der Funktionswerte sind also nicht allein deren Größe, sondern die tiefe Verschachtelung der Funktionsaufrufe, die leicht zu einem Stapelüberlauf (engl. Stack Overflow) führt, also dazu, dass dem System der Speicher ausgeht. Die Ackermann-Funktion ist daher eine einfache und sichere Methode, einen Stapelüberlauf zu provozieren, beispielsweise um zu testen, ob dieser Fehlerfall bearbeitet wird und ggf. wie dies erfolgt. Die Ackermann-Funktion hat dabei den Vorteil, dass sie immun gegen Compiler-Optimierungen ist und auch statische Quellcode-Analysen den (möglichen) Stapelüberlauf praktisch nicht detektieren können., Diese Idee geht zurück auf Yngve Sundblad, der 1971 die Funktion formula_76 benutzte, um diverse Programmiersprachen zu vergleichen. Um formula_77 zu berechnen, werden formula_78 Aufrufe getätigt., Sundblad testete unter anderem, wie groß formula_37 gewählt werden kann, damit der Computer noch in der Lage ist, diese Zahl zu berechnen. Damals erreichte er formula_80. Zum Vergleich hierzu: Mit Java 1.4.2 und den Standardspeichereinstellungen erreicht man heutzutage formula_81., Im Laufe der Berechnung werden viele identische Aufrufe mehrfach ausgerechnet. Ein intelligenter Compiler kann dies ausnutzen und die Ergebnisse zwischenspeichern, um solche Aufrufe nur einmal durchführen zu müssen. Damit waren schon 1971 Aufrufe bis formula_82 durchführbar. Einen bedeutenden Zeitvorteil erhält man auch, wenn man formula_83 direkt berechnet, statt es rekursiv zu formula_84 zu expandieren. Die direkte Berechnung von formula_83 erfordert lineare Zeit in formula_37. Die Berechnung von formula_87 erfordert quadratische Zeit, denn sie führt zu formula_88 (also formula_89 für eine Konstante formula_90; siehe Landau-Symbole) verschachtelten Aufrufen von formula_91 für verschiedene formula_92. Die Berechnung von formula_77 erfordert schließlich eine zu formula_94 proportionale Zeit (formula_95)., Laufzeitabschätzungen mit der Umkehrfunktion., Da die Funktion formula_96 sehr schnell wächst, wächst ihre Umkehrfunktion formula_97 sehr langsam. Sie ist für jede praktisch vorstellbare Eingabegröße kleiner als 5, weil der Funktionswert formula_98 größer als die Anzahl der Atome im Universum ist, wie die Berechnung von formula_99 weiter unten zeigt. In der praktischen Analyse von Algorithmen kann sie also als konstant betrachtet werden., Diese Umkehrfunktion taucht in der Laufzeitanalyse bestimmter Algorithmen auf, zum Beispiel beim Union-Find-Problem und in Chazelles Algorithmus für minimale Spannbäume. In diesem und anderen Zusammenhängen wird die ursprüngliche Ackermannfunktion oft durch Weglassen additiver Konstanten oder andere Modifikationen leicht umdefiniert zu einer Funktion mit ähnlichem asymptotischen Verhalten. Diese modifizierten Funktionen sind nicht gleich der Ackermannfunktion, aber nach den Maßstäben der Laufzeitanalyse können sie als äquivalent betrachtet werden., Implementierung., Die rekursive Implementierung der Ackermannfunktion (hier in Pseudocode) entspricht direkt der Definition:, function ack(n, m), if n = 0, return m + 1, else if m = 0, return ack(n - 1, 1), else, return ack(n - 1, ack(n, m - 1)), Etwas effizienter ist die folgende, teilweise iterative Implementierung:, function ack(n, m), while n ≠ 0, if m = 0, m:= 1, else, m:= ack(n, m - 1), n:= n - 1, return m + 1, Noch effizientere Implementierungen verwenden Arrays zur Zwisc: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Sie erschließt neben der City of London besonders nördlich der Themse weite Teile der britischen Hauptstadt London sowie einige angrenzende Gebiete., Der erste Streckenabschnitt der Metropolitan Railway (die heutige Metropolitan Line) wurde am 10.Januar 1863 als unterirdische, mit Dampflokomotiven befahrene Eisenbahn eröffnet. Obwohl von der Metropolitan Railway die weltweit häufigste Bezeichnung für eine U-Bahn – \\"Metro\\" – abgeleitet wurde, wich dieser Begriff im britischen Englisch bereits Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts der Bezeichnung \\"Underground\\". In der Umgangssprache der Londoner wird die U-Bahn Tube (englisch für „Röhre“) genannt., Fast150Jahre lang war die Underground die längste U-Bahn der Welt; mittlerweile ist sie nach der Metro Shanghai und der U-Bahn Peking die viertlängste. Derzeit beträgt die Streckenlänge 402 Kilometer mit 272 Stationen auf 11 Linien, von denen 262 selbst verwaltet werden. Außerhalb der Innenstadt verkehren die Linien mehrheitlich an der Oberfläche, tatsächlich liegen nur 45Prozent des Streckennetzes im Tunnel. Komplett unterirdisch verkehren lediglich die Victoria Line und die nur zwei Stationen umfassende Waterloo &amp; City Line., Im Geschäftsjahr 2011 benutzten täglich durchschnittlich rund 3,2Millionen Fahrgäste die Underground, an Werktagen bis zu 3,7Millionen. In dieser Zeit wurden insgesamt 1,171Milliarden Fahrten unternommen, was einen Rekordwert darstellte., Seit2003 ist London Underground ein Teil von Transport for London (TfL), das auch für die übrigen öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel in Greater London mit Ausnahme der Eisenbahnen verantwortlich ist. Rechtlicher Betreiber ist jedoch die Tochtergesellschaft \\"London Underground Limited\\"., Liniennetz., Das Londoner U-Bahn-Netz ist 402 km lang, hat 272 Stationen und besteht aus 11 Linien, die zum Teil mehrfach verzweigt sind. 14Stationen liegen außerhalb der Grenzen von Greater London, nämlich drei bzw. fünf Stationen der Metropolitan Line in den Grafschaften Buckinghamshire und Hertfordshire sowie sechs Stationen der Central Line in der Grafschaft Essex., Die Züge fahren werktags, mit Abweichungen auf einzelnen Linien, von etwa 5 Uhr früh (samstags meist etwas später) bis zirka 1Uhr nachts und sonntags ab etwa 7Uhr bis Mitternacht. Die Taktzeiten betragen in Spitzenzeiten zwei Minuten, tagsüber durchschnittlich vier Minuten, am späten Abend bis zu zehn Minuten. In den Nächten von Freitag auf Samstag und Samstag auf Sonntag gibt es Nachtverkehr auf der Victoria Line, der Jubilee Line, Teilen der Northern, Central und Piccadilly Line sowie auf der East London Line von London Overground., Die London Underground ist auf das nördliche und südliche Stadtgebiet ungleich verteilt. Südlich der Themse liegen nur etwa zehnProzent des Streckennetzes, der Raum ist hauptsächlich mit Vorortzügen erschlossen. Nördlich der Themse verhält es sich umgekehrt, hier beschränkt sich die Eisenbahn auf wenige Hauptstrecken zu den großen Kopfbahnhöfen., Geschlossene Stationen und Linienabschnitte., Im Netz der Londoner U-Bahn gibt es eine Reihe aus unterschiedlichen Gründen geschlossener Stationen. In den Frühzeiten der Londoner U-Bahn waren Rolltreppen als vertikales Transportmittel gänzlich unbekannt und die tiefen Stationen waren, abgesehen von Nottreppen, ausschließlich über Aufzüge erreichbar. Mit dem späteren Einbau von Rolltreppen die auch eine horizontale Distanz überwinden, sind die oberirdischen Eingänge häufig näher aneinander gerückt. Daher erschien es sinnvoll, einige Stationen einzusparen; andere wurden wegen geringer Fahrgastzahlen geschlossen., Betrieb., Von Januar 2003 bis Mai 2008 bzw. Mai 2010 war London Underground in Form einer Public Private Partnership (PPP; Partnerschaft zwischen öffentlicher Hand und Privatunternehmen) teilprivatisiert. Der Unterhalt der Infrastruktur wurde durch private Unternehmen durchgeführt, doch die Underground blieb im Besitz von Transport for London, die auch für den Zugbetrieb zuständig war. Das Ziel von PPP war die Erschließung von Geldquellen für zukünftige Investitionen ins U-Bahn-System. Dazu gehörten der Neu- und Ausbau von Stationen, der Kauf von neuem Rollmaterial sowie die Einrichtung von neuen Sicherheitssystemen und Zugsicherungen., Das Netz wurde in drei Gruppen aufgeteilt:, Nachdem Metronet 2007 in große finanzielle Schwierigkeiten geraten war, übernahm Transport for London im Mai 2008 deren Mitarbeiter und Leistungsverträge in zwei neue Tochtergesellschaften. Im Mai 2010 erwarb Transport for London dann alle Geschäftsanteile von Tube Lines; seitdem wird das Unternehmen als Tochtergesellschaft geführt. Metronet wurde 2011 liquidiert., Der Rückkauf der London Underground Tube Lines kostete 206,4 Mio. Pfund. Ein Bericht bezifferte die Gesamtkosten des gescheiterten PPP-Projekts für die Allgemeinheit mit 5,526Mrd.Pfund., Betriebszahlen., Während der Hauptverkehrszeit transportiert die Underground derzeit auf den am stärksten benutzten Abschnitten stündlich 142.000 Passagiere. Theoretisch hätte sie eine maximale Kapazität von 315.000 Passagieren pro Stunde., Im Vergleich zu U-Bahnen in anderen Millionenstädten bestreitet die London Underground einen relativ hohen Anteil ihrer Betriebsausgaben aus den Fahrkarteneinnahmen. Im Jahr 2004 wurden die Ausgaben von knapp 2Milliarden Pfund zu etwa 62Prozent mit Fahrkarteneinnahmen finanziert. Insgesamt hatte die Underground damit einen Zuschussbedarf von 768Mio. Pfund. Im Jahr 2002 betrug der Anteil der Fahrkartenverkäufe an den Einnahmen sogar fast 82Prozent., Mitarbeiter in der Haltestelle., Während in vielen anderen U-Bahn-Systemen keine Mitarbeiter in den Haltestellen mehr beschäftigt werden, sind alle Haltestellen der London Underground durchgehend mit mehreren Angestellten besetzt. Zu den Aufgabenbereichen zählen:, Besonderheiten an Weihnachten und Silvester., Am 24. Dezember verkehren die Londoner Verkehrsmittel nach dem Fahrplan des entsprechenden Wochentags., Am 25. Dezember verkehren keine Züge der Londoner Verkehrsmittel, keine Eisenbahn, (fast) keine Busse und nur wenige Taxis, die dann Aufschlag kosten. Lediglich ein Ersatzverkehr zwischen der Stadt und den Flughäfen Heathrow und Gatwick wird angeboten., An den folgenden Tagen (26. Dezember bis 30. Dezember) ist ebenfalls mit Einschränkungen zu rechnen., In der Silvesternacht (31. Dezember auf 1. Januar) wird ein durchgehender Nachtbetrieb angeboten, der zwischen 23:45Uhr und 4:30Uhr kostenfrei benutzt werden kann. An Silvester und am 1. und 2.Januar ist mit geringerer Taktfrequenz zu rechnen., Transport for London gibt jedes Jahr rechtzeitig eine Broschüre für die Weihnachtsfeiertage und Silvester heraus., 24-Stunden-Betrieb (Night Tube)., Ab dem 12.September 2015 sollten zunächst die Victoria und Jubilee Lines sowie Teile der Central, Northern und Piccadilly Lines in den Nächten von Freitag auf Samstag und Samstag auf Sonntag rund um die Uhr betrieben (\\"Night Tube\\") werden. Auf den meisten Nachtlinien war ein 10-Minuten-Takt vorgesehen, auf der Northern Line sogar verdichtet auf 7 Minuten, was eine Senkung der Reisezeit im Vergleich zu Nachtbus-Verbindungen um durchschnittlich 20 Minuten bewirken sollte., Da die Mitarbeiter der Underground jedoch einen Lohnzuschlag für die nächtliche Arbeit forderten, war ein Konflikt zwischen Arbeitgeber und der britischen Gewerkschaft der Lokomotivführer entstanden. Daraufhin wurde ein 24-stündiger Streik für den 8.Juli 2015 angekündigt. Nachdem die Gewerkschaften weitere Streiks für den September 2015 angekündigt hatten, hatte TfL den Start der Night Tube vorerst bis auf weiteres abgesagt, um Zeit für weitere Verhandlungen zu haben. Nach einer Einigung mit den Gewerkschaften wurde die Einführung der Night Tube zum 5.August 2016 angekündigt, tatsächlich begann der Betrieb dann am 19.August. In einer zweiten Phase wurde mit Picadilly, Central und Northern Lines am 23.September 2016 die Night Tube erweitert., Im Nachtnetz gelten die Fahrscheine des Vortages bis 4:29 Uhr, da darauf folgend tariflich der nächste Tag beginnt. Um die Lärmbelastung von Anwohnern nahe der Underground-Linien möglichst gering zu halten, besteht eine Zusammenarbeit mit den lokalen Behörden. Als erste Maßnahme wurde die Lautstärke von Durchsagen verringert. Um den Fahrgästen auch nachts Sicherheit zu gewährleisten, werden hundert Einsatzkräfte der \\"British Transport Police\\" während der Betriebszeit der Night Tube eingesetzt, ebenso das Bahnhofspersonal., Durch diesen Schritt der London Underground wurden auch andere Verkehrsträger zu Planungen eines Nachtnetzes bewegt, darunter die Docklands Light Railway sowie verschiedene Eisenbahngesellschaften., Technik., Die Strecken der Londoner Underground können in zwei Bauweisen unterteilt werden: Unterpflasterbahnen (Sub-Surface) und Röhrenbahnen (Tube). Die Unterpflasterbahnen wurden ähnlich den älteren deutschen U-Bahnen in offener Tunnelbauweise errichtet (engl. \\"cut and cover\\"). Zuerst wurde mitten auf der Straße eine offene Baugrube ausgehoben. Nachdem die Tunnelwand errichtet und die Gleise verlegt waren, wurde die Baugrube abschnittsweise wieder mit einem Deckel verschlossen; über dem Deckel entstand die Straße neu. Die Gleise liegen durchschnittlich fünf Meter unter der Erdoberfläche. Die Tunnel haben einen Durchmesser von 7,62u202fm (25u202fft.) und bieten das gleiche Lichtraumprofil wie die britischen Eisenbahnstrecken. Der erste Tunnelabschnitt zwischen \\"Paddington\\" und \\"Farringdon\\" ist 7,82u202fm (25u202fft. 8u202finch) breit., Die Röhrenbahnen wurden anfangs mit Spitzhacke und Schaufel, später mittels Schildvortrieb in 20 bis 50 Metern Tiefe errichtet. Der Tunneldurchmesser ist weniger als halb so groß wie bei den Sub-Surface-Linien, im Durchschnitt 3,56u202fm (11u202fft. 8,25u202finch), jedes Gleis liegt in einer einzelnen Röhre. Obwohl die Gleisanlagen ebenfalls die Regelspurweite von 1435u202fmm aufweisen, ist das Lichtraumprofil wesentlich kleiner. Üblicherweise sind die beiden Teilnetze getrennt. Ausnahme ist die oberirdische Strecke \\"Rayners Lane\\" – \\"Uxbridge\\"; hier verkehren sowohl eine Sub-Surface-Linie (Metropolitan Line) als auch eine Tube-Linie (Piccadilly Line). Wegen der deutlich unterschiedlichen Wagenbodenhöhen erhielten die Bahnsteige in Mischbetriebsabschnitten eine Kompromisshöhe, damit ist der Zustieg an diesen Zugangsstellen nicht barrierefrei. Durch die technische Entwicklung wurden in der Folge auch Strecken im Sub-surface-Profil mit Schildvortriebsmaschienen aufgefahren. Ein Beispiel ist die Northern City Line, die allerdings seit 1975 nicht mehr zum U-Bahn-Netz gehört, Elektrifiziert sind die Strecken der Londoner U-Bahn: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"London Underground, U-Bahn-System, älteste U-Bahn, Metro Moskau, zweitgrößte Netzlänge, City of London, Themse, britische Hauptstadt, Tube, 402 Kilometer, 272 Stationen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Landkreis Aurich, Samtgemeinde in Niedersachsen], Die Samtgemeinde Brookmerland ist ein Gemeindeverband im Landkreis Aurich in Ostfriesland. Die Samtgemeinde besteht aus den Mitgliedsgemeinden Marienhafe, Leezdorf, Osteel, Rechtsupweg, Upgant-Schott und Wirdum. Verwaltungssitz ist Marienhafe., \\"Das Brookmerland\\", wie es umgangssprachlich auch genannt wird, hat auf 77,25 Quadratkilometern Einwohner. Daraus ergibt sich eine Einwohnerdichte von Einwohnern je Quadratkilometer, die nicht nur über dem ostfriesischen (), sondern auch leicht über dem niedersächsischen Vergleichswert (), jedoch unter dem der Bundesrepublik (etwa 230) liegt., Das Gebiet der Gemeinde liegt auf einem Teil der historischen Region Brookmerland, deren Bezeichnung von dem altfriesischen bzw. altniederdeutschen Wort \\"brōk\\" stammt, das für eine moorige Bruchlandschaft steht, die früher kaum besiedelt war. Diese zog sich vom Westrand des Ostfriesischen Geestrückens von der Ley (Norder Tief) bis zur Flumm (Fehntjer Tief) hin., Zum kulturellen Erbe der Samtgemeinde zählen die historischen Kirchen in Marienhafe und Osteel mitsamt ihren Orgeln. Daneben gibt es weitere historische Gebäude wie Steinhäuser (ehemalige Häuptlingsburgen), Gulfhöfe und Windmühlen., Wirtschaftlich ist die Gemeinde von mittelständischen Betrieben, hauptsächlich für die Nahversorgung, geprägt. Auch der Tourismus spielt eine bedeutende Rolle, wobei sich die Gegend um Marienhafe als ehemaliger Zufluchtsort des Seeräubers Klaus Störtebeker als \\"Störtebekerland\\" vermarktet. Die Landwirtschaft spielt bei der Flächennutzung eine bedeutende Rolle. Insgesamt ist die Samtgemeinde Brookmerland eine Auspendler-Gemeinde in die Städte Emden, Aurich und Norden, in deren Mitte Brookmerland liegt., Geografie., Lage und Ausdehnung., &lt;mapframe text=\\"Lage der Samtgemeinde\\" height=\\"300\\" width=\\"220\\"&gt;, \\"type\\": \\"ExternalData\\",, \\"service\\": \\"geoshape\\",, \\"ids\\": \\"Q633537\\", &lt;/mapframe&gt;, Brookmerland liegt im westlichen Teil der ostfriesischen Halbinsel in Niedersachsen nordnordwestlich von Emden und südöstlich von Norden im Landkreis Aurich. Es grenzt unmittelbar an die Stadt Norden und liegt westlich der Kreisstadt Aurich. Die Nordseeküste ist nur wenige Kilometer entfernt, am kürzesten ist es zur Leybucht, die sich westlich des Samtgemeindegebiets befindet., Brookmerland ist mit 171 Einwohnern je km² im innerostfriesischen Vergleich überdurchschnittlich dicht besiedelt und liegt damit auch leicht über der Einwohnerdichte des Landes Niedersachsen (Vergleichszahlen: Ostfriesland 148, Niedersachsen 168), jedoch unter dem bundesrepublikanischen Durchschnitt von 230 Einwohnern je km². Die einzelnen Mitgliedsgemeinden haben jedoch sehr unterschiedliche Besiedelungsdichten: Während \\"Wirdum\\" einen Wert von 69 Einwohnern je km² aufweist, liegt die Einwohnerdichte von 500 Einwohnern je km² im eng begrenzten Hauptort \\"Marienhafe\\" höher als in allen anderen ostfriesischen Kommunen, Städte wie Emden und Leer eingeschlossen. Überdurchschnittlich stark besiedelt sind auch die im Moor angelegten Streusiedlungen \\"Leezdorf\\" und \\"Rechtsupweg\\", während neben Wirdum auch \\"Upgant-Schott\\" und \\"Osteel\\" aufgrund ihrer großen Gemarkungsflächen und eines hohen Anteils von Landwirtschaftsflächen unter dem Samtgemeindedurchschnitt liegen., Geologie und Böden., Das Gebiet der Samtgemeinde Brookmerland ist an der Oberfläche geologisch von Schichten des Pleistozäns und des Holozäns bestimmt. Die erdgeschichtlich älteren Teile des Pleistozäns sind die Geestgegenden im Nordosten des Gemeindegebietes, auf denen zum Teil holozäne Moorschichten aufliegen. Der Westen und der Süden des Gemeindegebietes liegen in der Marsch, ebenfalls eine holozäne Schicht., Das zentrale Gemeindegebiet um Marienhafe, Osteel, Upgant-Schott, Rechtsupweg und Leezdorf weist teils anmoorige Podsol- und Gley-Podsol-Böden in zumeist feuchter Lage auf. Die anmoorigen Gebiete sind nach Kultivierungsmaßnahmen inzwischen größtenteils abgetorft. Der weitere Untergrund besteht aus Sand, der teilweise schwach lehmig ist, oft über Lehm und Ton. Östlich von Leezdorf und Rechtsupweg schließen sich in geringerem Umfang Hochmoorböden sowie stark humose Böden auf mittlerweile abgetorften Flächen an. Westlich einer ungefähren Linie Osteel-Siegelsum befinden sich Marschböden. Dabei handelt es sich um zwei schmale Streifen von Knickmarschböden, die kalkfrei bis schwach kalkhaltig sind. Weiter westlich, im Bereich der früheren Leybucht, gibt es kalkreichere Seemarschböden. Der Süden des Gemeindegebietes um Wirdum besteht zum Großteil aus Seemarschböden, die nach der Eindeichung der Leybucht gewonnen wurden. Auch dort schließen im Osten schmale Streifen von Knickmarschböden an., Die kleinen Hochmoorflächen im Osten des Samtgemeindegebietes bestehen aus der höher liegenden Weißtorfschicht und einer Schwarztorfschicht darunter, die wiederum auf mineralischem Gestein aufliegt. Das Alter der ostfriesischen Hochmoore wird im Allgemeinen auf zirka 5000 Jahre geschätzt. Nachdem der leichtere Weißtorf abgeräumt war, wurde der Schwarztorf zu brikettähnlichen Quadern gepresst, die als Heizmaterial dienten. Die abgetorfte Fläche wurde später kultiviert, dazu waren verschiedene Bodenverbesserungsmaßnahmen erforderlich. Grundsätzlich eignen sich kultivierte Moorböden aufgrund ihrer Nährstoffarmut eher als Grünland., Die Gley-Böden sind durch hohe Grundwasserstände gekennzeichnet. Ähnliches gilt für die Podsole in feuchter Lage, den Übergangsbildungen zum Gley. Auch sie müssen im Samtgemeindegebiet dräniert werden und werden zumeist als Grünland genutzt., Seemarschböden haben einen hohen Kalkgehalt von vier bis zwölf Prozent, was für die ackerbauliche Nutzung von Belang ist. Da sie wesentlich aus Schlick bestehen, sind etwa sechs Prozent organische Substanzen. Hohe Grundwasserstände, besonders im Frühjahr und Herbst, machen eine Dränage durch zahlreiche Entwässerungsgräben \\"(Schloote)\\" erforderlich. Ein hoher Kalkgehalt im Boden erlaubt bessere landwirtschaftliche Erträge. Die jungen Seemarschböden haben zumeist eine hohe bis sehr hohe Bodenwertzahl. Die etwas küstenferneren Knick- und Brackmarschböden entstanden aus den feineren und deshalb dichteren Sedimenten, die in früheren Zeiten landeinwärts getrieben wurden. Aufgrund der höheren Dichte sind die tonigen Böden schwerer und weisen oft Staunässe auf. Zudem sind sie kalkärmer., Die abgesackten Knick- und Brackmarschböden bei Wirdum und Siegelsum liegen unter Normalnull. Die höchstgelegenen Stellen sind die zum großen Teil abgetorften Hochmoorböden bei Leezdorf und Rechtsupweg bis etwa vier Meter über Normalnull., Gewässer., Westlich von Marienhafe liegt die „Quelle“ der Abelitz, eines mäandrierenden Flüsschens, das durch das Gemeindegebiet fließt und südlich von Wirdum in das Alte Greetsieler Sieltief mündet. Dieses entwässert über das Knockster Tief in die Ems. Die Abelitz wird bei Marienhafe aus mehreren Entwässerungsgräben, regional \\"Schloot\\" genannt, gespeist und nimmt in ihrem Verlauf weitere Schloote auf. Neben den Schlooten fließt der Abelitz die Maar zu, die ihren Ursprung in der Nachbargemeinde Südbrookmerland hat. Kurz vor der Einmündung in das Alte Greetsieler Sieltief nimmt die Abelitz noch den Abelitz-Moordorf-Kanal auf, der im Auricher Stadtteil Georgsfeld seinen Ursprung hat und teils kanalisiert durch das Südbrookmerland fließt. Die Abelitz entwässert somit einen Großteil der Samtgemeinde Brookmerland und der Gemeinde Südbrookmerland, wofür der \\"I. Entwässerungsverband Emden\\" mit Sitz im Krummhörner Hauptort Pewsum zuständig ist. Das Alte Greetsieler Sieltief fließt südlich von Wirdum durch das Gebiet der Samtgemeinde und nimmt das Wirdumer Tief auf, einen kurzen Kanal, der früher die Verkehrsanbindung von Wirdum per Boot in die Krummhörn und nach Emden sicherstellte., Flächennutzung., Mit 81,34 Prozent liegt der Anteil der Landwirtschaftsflächen am Gesamtgebiet über dem ostfriesischen Durchschnitt von 75 Prozent, der seinerseits deutlich über dem bundesrepublikanischen Durchschnitt von 52Prozent liegt. Neun Hektar dieser Fläche sind noch als ursprüngliche(s) Moor bzw. Heide zu bezeichnen. Der Löwenanteil der Landwirtschaftsflächen ist Grünland. Das Brookmerland ist nur wenig bewaldet – selbst innerhalb des waldarmen Ostfriesland, das im bundesrepublikanischen Vergleich eine extrem unterdurchschnittliche Waldfläche (etwa 2,5 Prozent) aufweist. Es gibt nur wenige kleinere aufgeforstete Flächen auf den \\"Wilden Äckern\\" östlich von \\"Upgant-Schott\\" sowie in den hochmoornahen Gebieten nordöstlich von \\"Leezdorf\\" und \\"Rechtsupweg\\". Die Wasserflächen im Gebiet der Samtgemeinde sind, von wenigen kleinen Tümpeln und Kolken abgesehen, ausschließlich Tiefs, Kanäle und Entwässerungsgräben., Gliederung der Samtgemeinde., Die Samtgemeinde Brookmerland besteht aus sechs Mitgliedsgemeinden. Dies sind neben dem Hauptort und Verwaltungssitz Marienhafe die Gemeinden Leezdorf, Osteel, Rechtsupweg, Upgant-Schott und Wirdum. Daneben gibt es noch weitere Ortschaften, die zum Gebiet der jeweiligen Mitgliedsgemeinde gehören. \\"Tjüche\\" und \\"Siegelsum\\" bildeten bis kurz vor der Gemeindereform eigenständige Gemeinden und wurden nach \\"Marienhafe\\" beziehungsweise \\"Upgant-Schott\\" eingemeindet. Weitere kleinere Ortschaften und Wohnplätze, besonders in den Gemeinden \\"Osteel\\" und \\"Wirdum\\", sind auf frühere Neuanlagen nach Eindeichungen zurückzuführen, so beispielsweise \\"Osteeler Altendeich\\" und \\"Wirdumer Altendeich\\"., Nachbargemeinden., Das Brookmerland grenzt im Norden und Nordwesten an die Stadt Norden, im Nordosten an die Samtgemeinde Hage, im Osten an die Gemeinde Großheide, im Südosten an die Gemeinde Südbrookmerland, im Südwesten an die Gemeinde Krummhörn und im äußersten Süden an die Gemeinde Hinte., Klima., Das Brookmerland liegt in der gemäßigten Klimazone, hauptsächlich im direkten Einfluss der Nordsee.

Jahrhundert), Fotograf (Vereinigte Staaten), Fotokünstler, Fotopionier, Geboren 1902, Gestorben 1984, Hasselblad-Preisträger, Hochschullehrer (San Francisco Art Institute), Landschaftsfotograf], Ansel Easton Adams (* 20. Februar 1902 in San Francisco, Kalifornien; † 22. April 1984 in Carmel-by-the-Sea, Kalifornien) war ein US-amerikanischer Fotograf, Autor und Lehrer der künstlerischen Fotografie. Er wurde vor allem bekannt durch seine eindrucksvollen Landschafts- und Naturfotografien aus den Nationalparks, National Monuments und den Wilderness Areas im Westen der Vereinigten Staaten, für deren Erhalt er sich zeitlebens einsetzte., Als Mitbegründer der Gruppe f/64 zählt er zu den Pionieren der \\"straight photography\\" und gilt als einer der bedeutendsten amerikanischen Fotografen. Adams verfasste zahlreiche Lehrbücher zu Theorie und Praxis der Fototechnik. Das von ihm gleichzeitig mit Fred Archer formulierte Zonensystem wurde wegweisend für die künstlerische Schwarzweißfotografie., Leben., Kindheit und frühe Jahre., Ansel Easton Adams war das einzige Kind von Charles Hitchcock Adams und Olive Bray Adams, einer Händlerfamilie aus San Francisco. Der Junge wurde nach dem Onkel Ansel Easton benannt. Die Familie Adams stammte väterlicherseits aus Neuengland. Die Familie war in den ersten Jahren des 18.Jahrhunderts, von Nordirland kommend, eingewandert. Der Großvater hatte in San Francisco ein prosperierendes Holzhandelsunternehmen aufgebaut, das in der Nachfolge von Adams’ Vater Charles geleitet wurde. Die Familie der Mutter stammte aus Baltimore, der Großvater mütterlicherseits hatte sich als Transportunternehmer und Grundstücksspekulant in Carson City, Nevada, niedergelassen., Adams’ Eltern waren politisch liberale, ansonsten eher konservativ-bürgerliche Menschen. Der Vater war ein begeisterter Hobby-Astronom, der sich allgemein für optische Geräte und für die Fotografie im Besonderen interessierte und als modernste Errungenschaft eine „Brownie-Bullseye“-Boxkamera von Kodak sein Eigen nannte; die Mutter war künstlerisch ambitioniert und widmete sich bevorzugt der Porzellanmalerei., Eine erste Kindheitserinnerung von Ansel Adams war das verheerende San-Francisco-Erdbeben von 1906, bei dem sich der Vierjährige infolge eines Sturzes das Nasenbein zertrümmerte, das nie gerichtet wurde und Adams seine unverwechselbare schiefe, nach links gerichtete Nase einbrachte. Da die Adams’ in einem selbstgebauten Haus in den Dünen außerhalb San Franciscos wohnten, blieben sie von den Folgen des Bebens ansonsten weitgehend verschont., \\"The Panic of 1907\\", Rezessionen., 1907 starb Ansels Großvater William James Adams. Mit seinem Tod und dem als \\"The Panic of 1907\\" bezeichneten ersten großen Börsenkrach in den USA ging auch der Untergang seines Unternehmens einher. Die schleichende Rezession der folgenden Jahrzehnte beanspruchte das gesamte Familienvermögen der Adams’, und Ansels Vater versuchte, das wenige noch vorhandene Firmenkapital zu retten. Geheime Absprachen und Anteilsverkäufe von Ansels Onkel Ansel Easton sollen schließlich zu einem weiteren finanziellen Desaster geführt haben. Letztlich übernahm die Bank den Grundbesitz, und die einstmals florierende Firma wurde zerschlagen., Als Kind war Ansel oft kränklich, litt an Erkältungen und diversen Kinderkrankheiten. Dennoch tobte er sich bei stundenlangen Klettertouren in den steilen Klippen an der nahe gelegenen Pazifikküste von Fort Scott oder China Beach aus. Der wissbegierige Junge sammelte Insekten und botanisierte Pflanzen. Überdies begeisterte er sich für Sport, war aber stets zu ungeduldig, um sich auf eine Sportart zu konzentrieren. 1912 erkrankte Ansel an Masern und musste zwei Wochen in einem abgedunkelten Zimmer im Bett verbringen. Zum Zeitvertreib erklärte ihm der Vater seine Boxkamera und das uralte Prinzip der Camera obscura, das dahinter stand, und weckte damit erstmals das Interesse des Jungen an der Fotografie., Die Grundschulzeit verbrachte Ansel größtenteils an der Rochambeau-Schule in San Francisco. Weil er jedoch als schwieriges Kind galt, das sich meistens im Unterricht langweilte und oft in Raufereien verstrickt war, musste er mehrmals die Schulen wechseln. Nach einem heftigen Wutanfall wurde er schließlich ganz der Schule verwiesen und erhielt Hausunterricht beim Vater, der ihm grundlegende Kenntnisse in Französisch und Algebra beibrachte. Außerdem sorgte Charles Adams dafür, dass sein Sohn englische Literaturklassiker las und Unterricht im Altgriechischen bei einem befreundeten Pfarrer bekam. Wie Adams in seinen Erinnerungen schilderte, reifte während der zahlreichen Gespräche mit dem Geistlichen in ihm schnell die Erkenntnis, sich mit Hilfe des Intellekts ein eigenes kritisches Weltbild schaffen zu müssen, das sich, wie er sagte, „gegen Intoleranz, Unverstand und Standesdünkel“ richtete. Etwa zu dieser Zeit zeigte sich auch ein musikalisches Talent in dem Jungen, und so erhielt er ab 1914 zusätzlich Klavierunterricht., Die \\"Panama-Pacific International Exposition\\", Hinwendung zur Musik., 1915 schenkte ihm der Vater eine Jahreskarte für die Panama-Pacific International Exposition, der Weltausstellung, die zur Feier der Eröffnung des Panamakanals veranstaltet wurde. Die gigantische Ausstellung hinterließ einen nachhaltigen Eindruck bei dem Jungen, vor allem begeisterte er sich für die Konzerte, die in der Festhalle der Ausstellung, einem riesigen Kuppelbau, an einer imposanten Orgel zu Gehör gebracht wurden. Wenn möglich, ließ er keines der Konzerte aus. Oft besuchte er auch die Gemälde- und Skulpturenausstellung im Palast der schönen Künste, wo Werke von Pierre Bonnard, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro und Vincent van Gogh gezeigt wurden., Auf der Suche nach einem regulären Schulabschluss besuchte Ansel in der Folgezeit noch einige Schulen, mit dem Abschlusszeugnis der achten Klasse beendete er schließlich formell seine schulische Laufbahn., Ab seinem 13. Lebensjahr erhielt der Junge intensiven Klavierunterricht bei einer älteren Dame namens Marie Butler, einer Absolventin des \\"New England Conservatory\\" mit langjähriger Erfahrung im Unterrichten. Sie besaß Virtuosität im Spiel und ein profundes Wissen über Musiktheorie und Musikgeschichte; sie verstand es, dem Jungen mit viel Geduld und Ausdauer ein gewisses Maß an Disziplin abzuringen und die Faszination für das Instrument zu wecken. 1918 empfahl sie den jungen Adams zum Musikstudium an den Komponisten Frederick Zech (1858–1926) weiter. Bald entstand in Adams der Wunsch, Berufsmusiker zu werden., Die Sierra, Yosemite und die Fotografie., Ansel Adams war erstmals 1916 zusammen mit seinen Eltern auf einer Urlaubsreise im Yosemite-Nationalpark gewesen. Während des Urlaubs schenkte ihm der Vater eine „Brownie“-Boxkamera von Kodak, Ansels erste eigene Kamera. Leidenschaftlich begann der 14-Jährige alles festzuhalten, was ihm vor die Linse kam. Der Junge war von dem Urlaub so begeistert, dass er auch in den folgenden Jahren die Sommermonate in dem Naturreservat verbrachte. 1919 trat Adams dem von John Muir begründeten Sierra Club bei. 1922 veröffentlichte Adams seinen ersten Artikel für das \\"Sierra Club Bulletin\\". Im Jahr 1934 sollte er schließlich Mitglied im Direktorium des Clubs werden (bis 1971)., Bei einem Ausflug des Clubs nach Yosemite begegnete Adams im Sommer 1923 seinem Jugendfreund, dem Violinisten und späteren Fotografen Cedric Wright (1907–1950) wieder. Während einer mehrtägigen Exkursion durch den Park festigte sich die Freundschaft der beiden Naturliebhaber, und man tauschte sich über die Musik und das beiderseitig aufkeimende Interesse für die Fotografie aus. Wright befasste sich mit dem Piktorialismus und schuf bevorzugt Porträts, die in ihrer technischen Qualität den frühen Arbeiten Edward Westons ähnlich waren. Durch Wright wurde Adams unter anderem mit den künstlerisch gedruckten Büchern von Elbert Hubbard, dem Begründer der \\"Roycroft\\"-Bewegung, bekannt., Die Freundschaft mit Wright, die Beziehung zum Sierra Club und die unzähligen Exkursionen im Yosemite-Park sollten in Adams eine tiefe lebenslange Faszination für die Wildnis und deren Schutz wecken. In späteren Jahren erinnerte sich Adams an diese Zeit als „die denkwürdigste Erfahrung in seinem Leben“ und betonte, wie das starke Erleben der Natur, die Kindheit am Meer und die jungen Jahre in der Sierra Nevada sein gesamtes Leben geprägt habe., Im Lauf der Zeit begann Adams die Schnappschüsse, die er auf seinen Exkursionen im Yosemite machte, als ein „visuelles Tagebuch“ zu betrachten, und je mehr er fotografierte, desto mehr interessierte ihn das fotografische Verfahren, das dahinter steckte. Schließlich wollte er lernen, wie man die Bilder selbst zu Papier bringt. Um 1917 bot ihm ein Nachbar, der ein Fotolabor betrieb, einen Job als Laborhilfe an. Innerhalb kurzer Zeit erlernte Adams die Routine der Filmentwicklung. Schließlich perfektionierte er sein Hobby, und es gelang ihm, ausdrucksstarke Bilder zu schaffen., \\"Monolith, The Face of Half Dome\\"., Bis Mitte der 1920er Jahre sah sich Ansel Adams allenfalls als ambitionierter Amateurfotograf. Adams datierte einen Frühlingstag, den 17. April 1927 im Yosemite, der, wie er sagte, „sein Verständnis für das Medium Fotografie verändern sollte.“ An diesem Tag brach Adams mit seinen Freunden Cedric Wright, Arnold Williams, Charlie Michael und seiner zukünftigen Frau Virginia Best zu einer Wanderung zum \\"Diving Board\\" auf, einem Felsvorsprung mit einem imposanten Blick auf den \\"Half Dome\\". Adams schleppte im Rucksack eine 40Pfund schwere Kamera-Ausrüstung mit sich, bestehend aus einer \\"Korona\\"-Studiokamera, mehreren Objektiven, Filtern, sechs Plattenhaltern mit zwölf Glasplatten und einem Holzstativ. Während des Aufstiegs fertigte Adams mehrere Aufnahmen an, von denen einige misslangen, eine Glasplatte wurde unbeabsichtigt belichtet, weil Adams vergessen hatte, das Kameraobjektiv vor der direkten Sonneneinstrahlung zu schützen. Schließlich hatte er nur noch zwei Platten übrig, um sie, wie er sagte, „mit dem großartigsten Anblick, den die Sierra bietet zu belichten – dem \\"Face of Half Dome\\" selbst.“ Von dieser Exkursion brachte Adams eines seiner berühmtesten Bilder mit: \\"Monolith, The Face of Half Dome\\"., 1937 kam es zu einem Brand in Adams’ Fotolabor, wobei tausende seiner originalen Negative vernichtet oder beschädigt wurden. Er brauchte mit seinen Helfern mehrere Tage, um die geretteten Negative zu wässern und zu trocknen. Von einigen Fotografien, beispielsweise \\"Monolith, The Face of Half Dome\\", die nur am Rand beschädigt wurde, gibt es Vergrößerungen vor und nach dem Feuer, wobei die neueren Vergrößerungen notwendigerweise einen kleineren Bildausschnitt zeigen, damit die beschädigten Bereiche nicht sichtbar werden.

Sie ist neben der Samtgemeinde Jümme eine der beiden Samtgemeinden des Landkreises und von sechs in Ostfriesland. Zur Samtgemeinde gehören neben der Gemeinde Hesel, deren Ortsteil Hesel der Sitz der Samtgemeinde ist, die Mitgliedsgemeinden Brinkum, Firrel, Holtland, Neukamperfehn und Schwerinsdorf mit weiteren Nebenorten und Wohnplätzen. Auf einer Fläche von 84,33km² leben zirka 10.980Einwohner, womit sie nur dünn besiedelt ist. In der Raumordnung des Landes Niedersachsen wird der Ort Hesel als Grundzentrum für die Samtgemeinde geführt., Das Gebiet liegt zentral innerhalb des oldenburgisch-ostfriesischen Geestrückens. Bereits in ur- und frühgeschichtlicher Zeit war Hesel Knotenpunkt eines Wegenetzes. Diese Funktion hat es auch heute noch im Straßennetz Ostfrieslands. Auf dem Gebiet der Samtgemeinde befinden sich viele älteste Spuren menschlicher Besiedlung von Ostfriesland. Durch die Lage begünstigt, war der Hauptort Hesel im Hoch- und Spätmittelalter Standort zweier Klöster und mehrerer Klostervorwerke. Durch umfangreiche Ausgrabungen in den 1980er- und 1990er-Jahren gelten sie als die archäologisch am besten erforschten Epochen Ostfrieslands. Am 17.Januar 1972 haben sich die sechs genannten Gemeinden, die viele historische Gemeinsamkeiten haben, zur Samtgemeinde Hesel zusammengeschlossen., Wirtschaftlich ist die Samtgemeinde Hesel vor allem von mittelständischen Betrieben geprägt. Die Landwirtschaft spielt seit jeher eine tragende Rolle im Samtgemeindegebiet, was sich schon am hohen Anteil der landwirtschaftlichen Nutzfläche von mehr als 75Prozent ablesen lässt. In gewissem Umfang spielt Tourismus eine Rolle. Die Samtgemeinde ist insgesamt jedoch ein Auspendler-Gebiet vor allem in die benachbarte Kreisstadt Leer., Zum kulturellen Erbe der Samtgemeinde zählen neben der aus dem 13.Jahrhundert stammenden Marienkirche in Holtland das ehemalige Klostervorwerk GutStikelkamp aus dem 16.Jahrhundert und die archäologischen Stätten., Geografie., Lage und Ausdehnung., Die Samtgemeinde Hesel liegt zentral in Ostfriesland im Nordwesten des deutschen Bundeslandes Niedersachsen. Politisch gehört die Samtgemeinde Hesel zum Landkreis Leer und liegt in dessen Norden an der Grenze zum Landkreis Aurich. Die Samtgemeinde grenzt unmittelbar an die Kreisstadt Leer, die Entfernung vom Hauptort Hesel zum Leeraner Stadtkern beträgt rund 15Kilometer. Sie liegt an einer uralten Wegeverbindung zwischen Leer und Aurich; die Entfernung zu Aurich beträgt etwa 22Kilometer. Weitere größere Städte in der Nähe sind Emden (zirka 30Kilometer westlich) und die nächstgelegene Großstadt Oldenburg, rund 60Kilometer südöstlich. Die größte Nord-Süd-Ausdehnung zwischen dem Bagbander Tief im Norden und dem Holtlander Ehetief im Süden beträgt knapp zehn Kilometer, die größte Ost-West-Ausdehnung zwischen der Grenze zur Gemeinde Uplengen östlich von Firrel und der Grenze zur Gemeinde Moormerland bei Neuefehn etwa 10,8 Kilometer., Mit 10.313Einwohnern, die sich auf 84,31Quadratkilometer verteilen, ist die Samtgemeinde Hesel nur dünn besiedelt. Auf jeden Quadratkilometer kommen im Durchschnitt 122Einwohner. Damit liegt die Samtgemeinde noch unter dem ostfriesischen Durchschnitt von 148Einwohnern pro Quadratkilometer, der seinerseits den niedersächsischen (168) und den bundesrepublikanischen Durchschnitt (230) noch deutlich unterschreitet. Mit ihren rund 10.300Einwohnern liegt die Samtgemeinde auf Rang 21 der einwohnerstärksten Kommunen Ostfrieslands. Das Regionale Raumordnungsprogramm des Landkreises Leer teilt dem Ort Hesel die Funktion eines Grundzentrums für das Samtgemeindegebiet zu., Größte Mitgliedsgemeinde der sechs Kommunen umfassenden Samtgemeinde ist Hesel. Bis zur Kommunalreform Anfang der 1970er-Jahre war sie die flächengrößte Gemeinde des Landkreises Leer und nach Wiesmoor die zweitgrößte Gemeinde Ostfrieslands. Mit ziemlich genau 44Quadratkilometern ist die Gemeinde Hesel auch die flächengrößte Mitgliedsgemeinde innerhalb der sechs ostfriesischen Samtgemeinden., Geologie und Böden., Geologisch wird die Samtgemeinde Hesel wie ganz Ostfriesland oberflächlich von Schichten des Pleistozäns und des Holozäns gebildet. Pleistozäne Schichten sind in den Geestgegenden zu finden, die den Großteil des Samtgemeindegebiets ausmachen. Teils liegt auf den Geestschichten Moorboden auf, eine holozäne Schicht. Die Böden der ostfriesischen Geest bestehen zumeist aus Decksanden und Geschiebelehm., Das Samtgemeindegebiet besteht zum Großteil aus Podsolböden auf Orterde oder Ortstein, entweder in trockenerer oder in feuchterer Lage. Diese Böden erlaubten nur geringe landwirtschaftliche Erträge. Durch Plaggendüngung, die bis zum Auftreten des Kunstdüngers am Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts jahrhundertelang vorgenommen wurde, gibt es besonders in der Umgebung der alten Geestdörfer anthropogene Plaggeneschböden. Durch den ständigen Neubodenauftrag liegt der Esch, in Ostfriesland (die) Gaste genannt, heute höher als die Dorfkerne. Durch diese Form der Düngung wurde die Bodenwertzahl deutlich gesteigert, wenn sie auch immer noch klar hinter den fruchtbaren Böden der Marsch zurückblieb., Im Samtgemeindegebiet gibt es zudem Hoch- und Niedermoore. Der äußerste Westen hat noch Anteile an den Hochmoorflächen, die einen Großteil der Nachbargemeinde Moormerland ausmachen. Daneben sind es vor allem Niedermoorböden, die sich an dieses Hochmoorgebiet anschließen und sich im äußersten Norden sowie im Südwesten des Samtgemeindegebietes entlang des Bagbander Tiefs und des Holtlander Ehetiefs erstrecken. Inselartig gibt es, besonders in der Umgebung der Moorkolonien wie Firrel und Schwerinsdorf, stark humosen Boden auf rekultivierten Abtorfungsflächen, örtlich auch Anmoor., Das Samtgemeindegebiet liegt für ostfriesische Verhältnisse recht hoch: Bereiche des Heseler Waldes liegen bis zu 16Meter über dem Meeresspiegel und gehören damit zu den höchsten Erhebungen auf dem ostfriesischen Festland. Die Gemeinde Hesel selbst liegt etwa acht bis zehn Meter über dem Meeresspiegel, das restliche Samtgemeindegebiet deutlich tiefer. Im Südwesten senkt sich der Boden auf etwa 2,5Meter ab, in den Moorgebieten im Norden der Samtgemeinde sogar bis auf Meereshöhe., Gewässer., Das Samtgemeindegebiet bildet eine kleinräumige Wasserscheide. Der größere nördliche Teil entwässert zur Ems, die Dörfer Holtland, Brinkum und Hasselt dagegen zur Jümme. Für die Entwässerung des nördlichen Teils ist der Entwässerungsverband Oldersum zuständig, während der südliche Teil zum Gebiet des Leda-Jümme-Verbandes mit Sitz in Leer zählt., Im Vergleich zu vielen anderen ostfriesischen Gemeinden ist die Samtgemeinde Hesel eher arm an Gewässern. Neben Entwässerungsgräben im gesamten Samtgemeindegebiet gibt es in den beiden Fehnorten Neuefehn und Stiekelkamperfehn noch Fehnkanäle. Dies sind der Neuefehnkanal als Hauptverbindung zum Fehntjer Tief, und dessen Nebenkanäle, die sogenannten Wieken. Zur besseren Entwässerung wurde Ende der 1960er und Anfang der 1970er der Sauteler Kanal geschaffen. Er hat eine Länge von rund 23Kilometern, beginnt wenige hundert Meter westlich von Aurich-Oldendorf in der Nachbargemeinde Großefehn und mündet südlich des Moormerlander Ortsteils Terborg mit einem Schöpfwerk in die Ems. Der Sauteler Kanal durchfließt Neuefehn und Stiekelkamperfehn auf einer Länge von etwas mehr als zwei Kilometern ungefähr in Ost-West-Richtung, die Fehnkanäle sind an ihn angeschlossen. Zwei Flüsschen bilden Teile der Samtgemeindegrenze, im Norden das Bagbander Tief zur Gemeinde Großefehn, im Südwesten das Holtlander Ehetief zur Samtgemeinde Jümme gehörend. Zudem gibt es drei Binnenseen in der Samtgemeinde: den sogenannten Silbersee, ein Löschwasserteich im Heseler Wald, einen Baggersee in Hasselt und einen Moorsee beim Brinkumer Ortsteil Meerhausen., Flächennutzung., Die Flächennutzungstabelle rechts macht den überragenden Anteil der Landwirtschaftsflächen in der Samtgemeinde Hesel deutlich. Mit 75,7Prozent liegt die Samtgemeinde recht genau im ostfriesischen Durchschnitt von rund 75Prozent, der seinerseits bereits deutlich über dem bundesrepublikanischen Durchschnitt von 52Prozent liegt. Mit etwa 8,93Prozent Waldanteil liegt die Samtgemeinde weit über dem ostfriesischen Durchschnitt von 2,6Prozent. Innerhalb des Landkreises Leer, der unter den drei ostfriesischen Landkreisen der waldärmste ist, ist die Samtgemeinde Hesel die Kommune mit dem höchsten Waldanteil an der Gesamtfläche. Allerdings ist Ostfriesland im deutschlandweiten Vergleich extrem unterdurchschnittlich bewaldet: Der Waldanteil an der Gesamtfläche der Bundesrepublik liegt bei zirka 29,5Prozent. Aufgrund der Küstennähe kann es besonders bei Sturmlagen im Winterhalbjahr zu hohen Windwurfschäden kommen. Neben den drei Forsten Kloster Barthe, Oldehave und Stikelkamp gibt es eine Vielzahl weiterer Bäume im Samtgemeindegebiet durch die reichlich vorhandenen Wallhecken in allen Ortschaften der Samtgemeinde und in den Außenbereichen. Mit 1,4Prozent Wasserflächenanteil liegt die Samtgemeinde unter dem Durchschnitt vieler ostfriesischer Kommunen und auch unter dem Bundesdurchschnitt von etwa zwei Prozent., Nachbargemeinden., Die Samtgemeinde Hesel grenzt an Kommunen im nördlich gelegenen Landkreis Aurich und im Landkreis Leer. Im Uhrzeigersinn (beginnend im Norden) stößt die Samtgemeinde Hesel an die Gemeinde Großefehn im Landkreis Aurich, im Osten an die Gemeinde Uplengen, im Südosten und Süden an die Samtgemeinde Jümme, im Südwesten an die Stadt Leer und im Westen an die Gemeinde Moormerland. Die letztgenannten vier Kommunen befinden sich alle im Landkreis Leer. Drei Mitgliedsgemeinden der Samtgemeinde Hesel und zwei Mitgliedsgemeinden der Samtgemeinde Jümme grenzen aneinander: Hesel, Holtland und Brinkum grenzen an die Gemeinde Filsum, die Grenze bildet das Flüsschen \\"Holtlander Ehe\\".

Juli 1826 in Quincy, Suffolk County, Massachusetts) war einer der Gründerväter der Vereinigten Staaten und von 1789 bis 1797 der erste Vizepräsident sowie nach George Washington von 1797 bis 1801 der zweite Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten., Adams entstammte einem puritanischen Elternhaus und erlernte nach einem Studium am Harvard College den Anwaltsberuf. In Boston kam er während der frühen Amerikanischen Revolution in Kontakt mit seinem Cousin Samuel Adams und den Sons of Liberty. Anfangs noch loyal zur britischen Verfassung stehend, näherte er sich den nach einer Loslösung vom Mutterland strebenden Kolonisten zunehmend an. Als Mitglied des Kontinentalkongresses von 1774 bis 1778 trieb er die Unabhängigkeit der Dreizehn Kolonien vom Königreich Großbritannien voran. Zusammen mit Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin und anderen war er an der Konzeption der Unabhängigkeitserklärung der Vereinigten Staaten beteiligt., Zwischen zwei diplomatischen Missionen im Königreich Frankreich arbeitete Adams in der Heimat die Verfassung von Massachusetts aus. Danach führte er in Europa Verhandlungen mit dem Königreich Großbritannien, die im Jahr 1783 in den Frieden von Paris mündeten. Anschließend war Adams als Repräsentant für die junge Republik in unterschiedlichen Staaten tätig und ab 1782 der erste Botschafter der Vereinigten Staaten in den Niederlanden, und ab 1785 erster Botschafter Amerikas in London., Bei der ersten amerikanischen Präsidentschaftswahl im Jahr 1789 wurde Adams als Zweitplatzierter im Electoral College Vizepräsident unter George Washington. Bei den Wahlen 1792 konnte er dieses Amt gegen George Clinton verteidigen. Im entstehenden First Party System gehörte Adams zu den wichtigsten Vertretern der Föderalistischen Partei. Als deren Kandidat besiegte er bei den Präsidentschaftswahlen im Jahr 1796 knapp Thomas Jefferson von der Demokratisch-Republikanischen Partei. Die Amtszeit von Adams wurde vom Quasi-Krieg mit dem revolutionären Frankreich und den Intrigen von Jefferson und Alexander Hamilton gegen ihn überschattet. Die bedeutsamste Gesetzgebung seiner Präsidentschaft waren die Alien and Sedition Acts. In einem stark polarisierenden Wahlkampf unterlag Adams 1800 Jefferson. Er zog sich danach ins Privatleben zurück und erlebte noch kurz vor seinem Lebensende, wie sein ältester Sohn John Quincy Adams im Jahr 1824 zum Präsidenten gewählt wurde., Leben., Elternhaus und Bildung., Adams wurde am 19. Oktober 1735 als ältester von drei Söhnen in Braintree geboren, dem heutigen Quincy. Er stammte von Henry Adams ab, der um 1636 in die Massachusetts Bay Colony ausgewandert war. John Adams gehörte zur vierten Generation der Familie Adams, die in den Dreizehn Kolonien zur Welt kam. Adams’ Vater John (1691–1761) war ein Schuster und Farmer ohne formale Bildung, der knapp 20Hektar Land bewirtschaftete und 14 Amtszeiten lang als Dekan in der kongregationalistischen Ortskirche diente. Im Jahr 1734 heiratete er Susanna Boylston (1708–1797), die einer Medizinerfamilie aus Brookline entstammte. Adams wuchs in einfachen und häuslich beengten Verhältnissen auf. Sein Vater legte auf Bildung Wert und schickte ihn nach der Grundschule auf eine Lateinschule, die Mutter brachte den Söhnen jeweils im fünften Lebensjahr das Lesen bei. Die Erziehung insgesamt war vom Puritanismus geprägt, wobei Adams sein Leben lang den Vater als Vorbild betrachtete. Die Eltern förderten Adams als Erstgeborenen besonders und hielten ihn von der Mitarbeit auf der Farm frei., Im Jahr 1751 besuchte er das Harvard College, wo er Griechisch, Latein, Logik, Rhetorik und Physik studierte. Als Senior belegte er die Fächer Moralphilosophie und Metaphysik. Nach dem Abschluss des Studiums kehrte er im Jahr 1755 nach Braintree zurück, trat dort aber kein Pfarramt an, wie es sein Vater gewünscht hatte und es der damals übliche Berufsweg für Harvard-Absolventen war. Möglicherweise wurde Adams durch die Angriffe abgeschreckt, denen sich der liberale Theologe Jonathan Mayhew zu dieser Zeit ausgesetzt sah. Nach einer kurzfristigen Tätigkeit als Lateinlehrer an einer Grammar School in Worcester entschied er sich im Sommer 1756, beim führenden Anwalt von Worcester, James Putnam, in die Lehre zu gehen. Während dieser Zeit begann Adams Tagebuch zu führen, was er bis zu seinem Lebensende fortsetzte., Anwaltspraxis., In den nächsten zwei Jahren arbeitete Adams weiter als Lateinlehrer und bildete sich nebenberuflich im Rechtswesen fort. Nachdem er die Anwaltszulassung im August 1758 erhalten hatte, kehrte Adams nach Braintree zurück, das im Justizdistrikt von Boston lag, um dort zu praktizieren und sich einen Namen zu machen. Als Förderer konnte er unter anderem James Otis Jr. und Jeremiah Gridley gewinnen, während sich Robert Treat Paine zu seinem stärksten Konkurrenten als Anwalt entwickelte., Ab dem Jahr 1759 war Adams regelmäßig in Massachusetts unterwegs und nahm ein breites Spektrum von Rechtsfällen an. In Braintree führte Adams für die Abstinenzbewegung eine erfolgreiche Kampagne gegen Tavernen und erreichte die Beschränkung auf drei Schanklizenzen im Ort. Mit großem Interesse verfolgte er im Winter des Jahres 1761 einen Fall von Otis, der Bostoner Händler vertrat, die sich gegen die Durchsuchung ihrer Lager und Schiffe durch Zollbeamte des Königreichs Großbritannien wehrten. Adams erkannte, dass der Ausgang dieses Prozesses weitreichende Konsequenzen für die Autorität der Krone in den Dreizehn Kolonien hatte. Später sah er in der mitreißenden Rede von Otis gegen britische Willkür während dieses Verfahrens die Geburtsstunde der amerikanischen Unabhängigkeit., Nach ersten Erfolgen vor Gericht erhielt Adams die Zulassung für den \\"Superior Court of Judicature\\". Der Biograph John E. Ferling nennt als Gründe für Adams’ Aufstieg neben puritanisch geprägter Leistungsorientierung eine sehr gute Beobachtungsgabe, mittels der er das Verhalten von Zeitgenossen studierte und zum Teil imitierte. So orientierte er seinen Schreibstil an Otis und dem kongregationalen Prediger Peter Thacher., Im Frühjahr und Sommer des Jahres 1763 erschienen sieben Essays von Adams unter dem Pseudonym \\"Humphrey Ploughjogger\\" in der Boston Gazette, die lokalpolitische Streitigkeiten um die Ernennung eines Repräsentanten für die Province of Massachusetts Bay in London spöttisch kommentierten. Weitere von ihm anonym veröffentlichte Artikel in diesem Jahr gingen der Frage nach, wie eine Regierung die schädlichen Triebe der Menschen kontrollieren könne, vor allem wenn sich diese in Machtpositionen befänden. Adams spricht sich für eine Balance aus Monarchie, Aristokratie und Parlamentarismus aus, womit er sich politisch an den Whigs orientiert. Im Januar 1765 schloss sich Adams einer Studiengruppe von Anwälten um Gridley an, die regelmäßig über Klassiker der Rechtsliteratur diskutierte. Aus seinen dortigen Redebeiträgen entstanden weitere Zeitungsartikel., Wegen einer Variolation etwas später als geplant heiratete Adams am 25.Oktober 1764 Abigail Smith. Nach seiner Hochzeit zog das Ehepaar in die direkt neben seinem Geburtshaus gelegene Saltbox, die Adams von seinem 1761 verstorbenen Vater geerbt hatte. Der Brautvater war ein Pastor und die Familie Smith insgesamt relativ wohlhabend, da sie Einkünfte aus zwei Bauernhöfen bezog und vier Sklaven besaß. So war die Mutter Abigails gegen die Heirat, da Adams in ihren Augen kein standesgerechter Gatte für ihre Tochter war. Adams und Abigail Smith, schon damals eine willensstarke und belesene Persönlichkeit, waren 1759 einander vorgestellt worden und seit dem Jahr 1761 miteinander befreundet. Aus der Ehe, die erst der Tod schied, gingen fünf Kinder hervor, darunter der spätere Präsident John Quincy Adams. Für die damalige Zeit im ländlichen Milieu Neuenglands ungewöhnlich führten sie eine gleichberechtigte Ehe, wie sie eher unter den wohlhabenden Pflanzern der Südstaaten anzutreffen war., Beginn der Amerikanischen Revolution., Als das britische Parlament im April 1764 den Sugar Act beschloss, erhoben sich in den Dreizehn Kolonien einige Stimmen dagegen. Als eine der besten Abhandlungen gegen dieses Zollgesetz gilt die von James Otis, dessen Aktionen Adams später als besonders prägend für sein Denken zu dieser Zeit bezeichnete. Der 1765 folgende Stamp Act war der erste Versuch der Krone, die Dreizehn Kolonien direkt zu besteuern. Er führte nach seinem Bekanntwerden zu Gewaltausbrüchen in Boston und der Brandschatzung des Hauses von Gouverneur Thomas Hutchinson im August des gleichen Jahres. Adams reagierte auf diese Straßenproteste unter der Führung der Sons of Liberty irritiert und besorgt. Als bekanntester Gegner des Stempelsteuergesetzes außerhalb der Assembly, in der die konservativen Tories ihre Mehrheit an die \\"Country party\\" der Händler und Bauern verloren hatten, profilierte sich Samuel Adams. Dieser Cousin Adams’ vereinte verschiedenste Gruppen in einer Protestbewegung, aus der die Patrioten hervorgingen, und inspirierte Adams dazu, sich aktiv in den Widerstand einzubringen., Adams’ Rolle im Kampf gegen den Stamp Act in den Jahren 1765 und 1766 blieb gering und unauffällig, wohl auch, um den geschäftlichen Erfolg seiner Anwaltstätigkeit, der sich eingestellt hatte, nicht zu riskieren. Für die Grundbesitzer seines Wohnorts Braintree fertigte Adams eine im Oktober 1765 in der Boston Gazette veröffentlichte Instruktion ihres Delegierten in der Assembly an, die das Stempelsteuergesetz als verfassungswidrig und sicherheitsgefährdend verurteilte. In diesem Text erhob er erstmals die zentrale Forderung „No taxation without representation“. In kurzer Zeit wurde dieser Forderungskatalog von 40 weiteren Städten übernommen. Adams nahm an regelmäßigen Treffen der \\"Sodalitas\\" teil, bei der führende Bürger der Stadt über Gesetzes- und Ordnungsfragen und ihre Bedeutung für eine freiheitliche Gesellschaft debattierten. Daraus entstand eine Serie von vier Artikeln in der Boston Gazette, die Adams zwischen Ende August und dem 21.Oktober 1765 erneut unter dem Pseudonym \\"Humphrey Ploughjogger\\" und ohne Titel veröffentlichte., Später wurden sie als \\"Eine Dissertation über das kanonische und feudale Recht\\" in London herausgegeben. Dieser Essay gilt als eine der hervorragendsten Schriften Adams. In der Artikelserie entwickelte Adams einige Ideen, auf die er sich während der Amerikanischen Revolution immer wieder bezog. Die Kernthese ist, dass die Vorfahren der amerikanischen Siedler freiheitsliebende Verfolgte gewesen seien, die in der Neuen Welt eine Gesellschaftsordnung entwarfen, die sich von Feudalismus und Kirchenrecht befreie. Für die Absicht Londons, die Bewohner der Dreizehn Kolonien zu verknechten, führt er als Beispiel Pläne der Krone an, einen Bischof der Church of England in Amerika einzusetzen. Nur wenige Sätze widmen sich dem Stamp Act, den er als weniger gefährlich beurteilt.

Az ontológiai Istenérv olyan érvelés, amely igyekszik bizonyítani Isten létét a definíciója alapján. Gödel azt állította, hogy az isteni lét a lehető legszükségesebb létező, és hogy az istenlét matematikai módszerekkel bizonyítható. Állítása szerint Isten a legmagasabb rendű létező, és ez a létezési minőség szükségszerűen tartalmazza a létezést is. Az ontológiai Istenérv azért vált vitatottá, mert több elméletet alkalmaz az isteni lét bizonyítására, amelyek között néhány filozófus és teológus szerint hibásak vagy megalapozatlanok. Sokan kifogásolják, hogy a definíciók és az érvelések nem tekinthetők valódi bizonyítékoknak Isten létéről. Gödel Istenbizonyítása továbbra is vitatott és tárgya a filozófiai diszkurzusnak. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a matematika és a logika területén elért dicsőséges munkái nem feltétlenül jelentenek automatikus megalapozást az istenlét bizonyítására. Az isteni lét kérdése továbbra is a hit, a vallás és a filozófia területéhez tartozik, és a végső döntést minden egyes ember saját meggyőződése alapján hozhatja meg."},{"instruction":"Hogyha Jézus mint létező történelmi személy tudományosan bizonyított, és Jézus a keresztény tanítások szerint az Isten második személyének emberi megtestesülése, akkor a logikus következtetés az, hogy Isten létezik?","output":"A Jézussal kapcsolatos tudományos bizonyíték nem egyértelmű kérdés, és a szakértők között is viták vannak arról, milyen mértékben lehet Jézust történelmi személyként bizonyítani. Bár vannak történelmi források, amelyek Jézusról számolnak be, ezeket nem mindig lehet egyértelműen tudományos bizonyítékként értelmezni. Ami az Isten létezésének következtetését illeti, a keresztény tanítás szerint Jézus az Isten második személye, aki emberi formában megtestesült. Azonban fontos megjegyezni, hogy ez nem egy matematikailag vagy logikailag bizonyított állítás, hanem egy vallási hit alapja. A vallásos meggyőződések gyakran a hiten alapulnak, nem pedig a tudományos bizonyítékokon vagy logikus következtetéseken. Míg egyesek számára a Jézus létezésére és az Isten hierarchiájára vonatkozó tanítások megerősíthetik az istenlét hitét, másoknak további bizonyítékokra van szükségük ahhoz, hogy megalapozottan elfogadják az isteni létét. Az istenlét vagy Isten létezése továbbra is a hit, a vallás és a filozófia területéhez tartozik, és minden embernek magának kell megtalálnia a számára elfogadható válaszokat és bizonyítékokat."},{"instruction":"Tehát akkor, ha egy szakértő valamiért megkérdőjelez egy tudományos bizonyítékot, akkor az a bizonyíték már nem lesz egyértelmű?","output":"Nem feltétlenül. A tudományos vizsgálatok során gyakran előfordul, hogy szakértők véleménye és értelmezése eltérhet egy adott bizonyíték vagy eredmény kapcsán. Ez a tudományosság jellemezője, hiszen az eltérő vélemények és viták segítenek az ismeretek fejlődésében és a helyes válaszok megtalálásában. Azáltal, hogy egy bizonyítékot megkérdőjeleznek, a szakértők olyan kritikát és érveket hoznak fel, amelyek segítenek az adott eredmény vagy bizonyíték megbízhatóságának és érvényességének felmérésében. Ilyen esetekben a tehát egyedülálló állítások vagy eredmények nem biztos, hogy egyértelműek maradnak, és további kutatásra és vitára van szükség a bizonyítékok megerősítéséhez vagy megcáfolásához. A tudomány célja a tények és bizonyítékok kritikus elemzése és értelmezése, hogy a lehető legpontosabb és megbízhatóbb információkat nyújtsa. Ezért fontos, hogy az egyének és a szakértők nyitottsággal és kritikus gondolkodással közelítsenek a tudományos bizonyítékokhoz, valamint figyelembe vegyék a szakértők közötti vitákat és a tudományos közösség által elfogadott konszenzust."},{"instruction":"Mekkora az átlag férfi pénisz méret?","output":"A férfi pénisz mérete változó lehet, és az átlagos méret eloszlása is függ az adott populációtól és a vizsgálati mintától. Az általánosan elfogadott tudományos kutatások szerint az átlagos pénisz hossza merev állapotban körülbelül 12-16 centiméter (4,7-6,3 hüvelyk) között mozog. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a pénisz mérete nem befolyásolja a férfi szexuális képességeit vagy kielégítő szexuális életét. Az elégedettség és az intimitás tekintetében a kommunikáció, az egymás iránti tisztelet és a pozitív szexuális tapasztalatok sokkal fontosabbak, mint a méret. Ha a pénisz mérete jelentős aggodalmakat okoz, akkor érdemes lehet beszélni egy szexuálterapeutával vagy orvossal, akik segíthetnek a megfelelő tájékoztatásban és a magabiztosság erősítésében."},{"instruction":"Miért szeretik az emberek a zenét?","output":"Az emberi vonzódás a zene iránt több tényezőre vezethető vissza, és számos pszichológiai és érzelmi aspektusa van ennek az élménynek. Íme néhány közös ok, amiért az emberek szeretik a zenét: 1. Érzelmi és hangulati hatások: A zene képes erőteljes érzelmi reakciókat kiváltani. Hangulatot tud teremteni, a boldogságtól az elszomorodásig, a feszültségtől a nyugalomig. Sokan a zenét használják az érzelmi kifejezésre vagy az érzelmek befolyásolására. 2. Stresszcsökkentés és jó közérzet: A zenének pozitív hatása van a stresszre és a hangulatra. Hallgatása segíthet ellazulni, stresszt csökkenteni, lecsendesíteni az elmét, és javítani az általános közérzetet. 3. Kifejezőeszköz és önkifejezés: A zene kifejezőeszközként szolgálhat, amely lehetőséget ad az érzelmek, gondolatok és tapasztalatok kifejezésére. Zenét hallgatva és előadva az emberek önazonosságot és önkifejezést találhatnak. 4. Szórakozás és szabadidő eltöltése: Sokan egyszerűen élvezik a zenét a szórakozás és az idő eltöltése céljából. Zenét hallgatni, táncolni, koncertekre vagy fesztiválokra menni lehet szórakoztató és közösséget teremtő tevékenység. 5. Kapcsolódás és emlékek: A zene gyakran kapcsolódik emlékekhez, és képes felidézni múltbeli helyzeteket és élményeket. Hangosan megszólaló dalok vagy zenék hozzájárulhatnak a közösségi élményekhez és az emlékekhez való szoros hozzákapcsolódáshoz. Minden egyén saját egyedi preferenciákkal rendelkezik, és más és más hatásokat talál a zene hallgatásában. Az emberek szeretik a zenét, mert egy sokszínű és erőteljes érzelmi hatású művészeti forma, amely lehetőséget kínál a kifejezésre, a közvetítésre és a felfedezésre."},{"instruction":"Hol mondja ki a biblia, hogy Isten tértől, időtől és anyagtól független létező entitás?","output":"A Biblia nem mondja ki egyértelműen, hogy Isten tértől, időtől és anyagtól független létező entitás lenne. Az isteni tulajdonságok és az Isten létezése az interpretációk és a teológiai tanítások része. Az Istenről szóló bibliai idézetek sokféle isteni tulajdonságot és megnyilvánulást írnak le, például mindentudást, mindenhatóságot, jóságot, kegyelmet stb. Bizonyos idézetekben Isten örökkévalósága és örök létét említik. Az 1Timóteus 1:17-ben például az \\"örökkévaló, láthatatlan, egyedül bölcs Istennek\\" nevezik. Az istenség olyan mélységű és összetett téma, amelyet a teológusok és vallási vezetők évszázadok óta vizsgálnak, és különböző filozófiai és teológiai mozaikokat alkotnak az isteni természet és tulajdonságok kérdésében. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy az Isten létezése és tulajdonságai vallási hiten alapulnak, és a Biblia interpretációja és filozófiai megközelítése egyedi lehet az egyéneken és a vallási hagyományokon belül."},{"instruction":"Ha nincs bizonyíték Isten létezésére, akkor miért szeretik az emberek Istent?","output":"Az emberek szeretik Istent különböző okokból, amelyek érzelmi, spirituális és filozófiai jellegűek lehetnek. A vallás és a hit kapcsolódik az egyének belső szükségleteihez és kereséséhez, amelyekről a bizonyítékokon kívül más tényezők is határoznak. 1. Érzelmi támogatás és biztonság: Sok ember számára a hit és az Isten iránti szeretet forrást jelenthet érzelmi támogatásra és biztonságra. Az isteni szeretet és közelség érzése a nehéz időkben és a problémák során segíthet feldolgozni a stresszt és a szorongást. 2. Megnyugvás és remény: Az Istenbe vetett hit és szeretet olyan lehetőséget adhat, hogy az ember megnyugvást találjon a bizonytalanságok és az élet nehézségei közepette. Az Istennel való kapcsolatban sok ember talál reményt és inspirációt a céljaik eléréséhez és a jobb jövőbe vetett hiteikhez. 3. Értelmezés és értelmi okok: Vallásos hit és szeretetek gyakran kapcsolódik az élet értelmének és céljának kereséséhez. Az emberekben gyakran felmerül a kérdés, hogy miért vagyunk itt, és mi a célunk az életben. Az Istenbe vetett hit lehetőséget adhat egy útmutatásra és értelmezésre ebben a kontextusban. 4. Közösség és kulturális identitás: Vallási közösségek, mint például egyházak, eljárások és ceremoniák lehetőséget adnak az embereknek, hogy kapcsolatba lépjenek másokkal és építsenek közösséget. Vallási gyakorlatok és hagyományok olyan kereteket kínálnak, amelyekben az emberek megtalálhatják az azonosság érzését és a közös értékeket. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a vallás és a hit személyes és szubjektív tapasztalat, és minden egyén megélheti és értelmezheti saját módon. A vallásos hit és szeretet nem feltétlenül igényel tudományos vagy logikus bizonyítékokat, hanem erőteljesen kapcsolódik az egyéni tapasztalatokhoz, érzésekhez és értékekhez."},{"instruction":"Lehetséges-e Isten létezése?","output":"Az Isten létezése vagy nem létezése kérdése a filozófusok, teológusok és más gondolkodók évszázadok óta foglalkoztatja a világon. Az istenlét kérdése transcendentális, amely meghaladja a tudomány, a logika és az érzékelés határait. Ezért az istenlét vagy Isten nem tekinthető tudományosan bizonyított vagy megcáfolható ténynek. Az istenlét kérdése a hit, a vallás, a filozófia és a metafizika területéhez tartozik, és az emberek széles körben különböző válaszokat adnak rá. Van, aki a vallásos tapasztalataiból, a meggyőződéséből és a spirituális élményeiből kiindulva hisz Isten létezésében. Mások a filozófiai érvek és a logika alapján jutnak arra a következtetésre,"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Filmtitel 1965, Kurzfilm, Samuel Beckett, US-amerikanischer Film], Film ist ein US-amerikanischer Kurzfilm aus dem Jahr 1965 nach einem Drehbuch des irischen Dramatikers Samuel Beckett. Es ist ein Schwarzweißfilm ohne Dialoge und Begleitmusik. Seine einfache Handlung basiert darauf, dass die Kamera als beobachtender Akteur mit in den Film einbezogen ist. Den Protagonisten, gespielt vom gealterten Stummfilmstar Buster Keaton, bezeichnet Beckett mit \\"O\\" für \\"object\\", die den Protagonisten verfolgende Kamera bezeichnet er mit \\"E\\" für \\"eye\\". Der Film spielt mit den beiden Perspektiven und handelt letzten Endes von der Unausweichlichkeit der Selbstwahrnehmung und davon, dass man dem eigenen Dasein nicht entfliehen kann., Handlung., \\"Die erste Einstellung zeigt das Auge eines älteren Menschen, das sich soeben öffnet, in einer Nahaufnahme. Ein älterer Mann, der als O bezeichnet wird, hastet von der Kamera, die von Beckett als E bezeichnet wird, weg durch eine unwirtliche städtische Gegend. Er läuft an einer großen Mauer entlang im prallen Sonnenschein über unebenen, mit Steinen übersäten Boden. O versucht sich der Beobachtung durch die Kamera und dem Kontakt zu zwei anderen Passanten, deren Weg er kreuzt, zu entziehen. Als die Passanten nach Os Entschwinden in die Kamera, E, schauen, reagieren sie empört und entsetzt, der Mann setzt zum Reden an, die Frau lässt ihn mit einem schhhh! verstummen.\\", In seinem Mietshaus angekommen, versteckt sich O zunächst vor einer alten Frau, die ihm im Eingangsbereich entgegenkommt. Als die Frau aufblickt und E anschaut, also in die Kamera blickt, wandelt sich ihr Gesichtsausdruck von mild zu entsetzt und sie kollabiert. O schleicht sich an ihr vorbei die Treppe hinauf., In seiner kargen, heruntergekommenen Wohnung macht sich O daran, alles zu zerstören, zu verdecken oder zu entfernen, was ihn beobachten oder eine Beobachtung von ihm, auch durch sich selbst, ermöglichen könnte: das Fenster, ein Bild von einer Figur an der Wand, ein Wandspiegel. Auch um diverse Haustiere, die O in seiner Wohnung hält, muss er sich kümmern: Katze und Hund trägt er nacheinander aus der Wohnung. Papageienkäfig und Fischglas werden mit Stoff abgedeckt. Selbst Objekte, die nur entfernt eine Ähnlichkeit mit Augen haben, erregen Os Aufmerksamkeit, zum Beispiel die Schnitzerei an einem Schaukelstuhl., Nachdem O eine Weile im Zimmer umhergewandert ist und nach dem Eliminieren aller möglichen Blicke auf ihn zur Ruhe kommt, setzt er sich in den Schaukelstuhl und betrachtet nacheinander einige Fotos aus verschiedenen Phasen seines Lebens. Dann zerreißt er sie in umgekehrter Reihenfolge und lässt sie zu Boden fallen. Als er danach im Schaukelstuhl einschläft, bewegt sich E langsam um ihn herum, und ergattert endlich einen Blick in Os Gesicht: Über einem Auge trägt der alte Mann eine Augenklappe. O erwacht. Im Gegenschuss erkennt der Betrachter, was O erblickt: Er sieht sich selbst an der Wand gegenüber stehen, sich betrachtend. O ist somit identisch mit E. Entsetzt bedeckt er sein Gesicht mit den Händen. Die letzte Einstellung ist mit der ersten identisch: ein menschliches Auge, das sich öffnet., Produktion., Idee und Vorproduktion., Der Grundstein des Projekts war eine Idee des Produzenten von \\"Film\\", Barney Rosset. Er verlegte seit 1951 Theaterstücke in seinem Verlag \\"Grove Press\\". Zusammen mit zwei Mitarbeitern von \\"Grove Press\\", Richard Seaver und Fred Jordan, sowie dem Theaterregisseur Alan Schneider gründete er um 1962 die Filmproduktionsfirma \\"Evergreen Theatre\\". Ihr Ziel war die Verfilmung von spezifisch für das Kino geschriebenen Filmdrehbüchern bekannter Dramatiker. Ihre Anfragen an verschiedene Autoren wurden aber zum Teil abgelehnt, so z.B. von Jean Genet, andere Dramatiker schrieben Drehbücher für Spielfilme, darunter auch Marguerite Duras und Alain Robbe-Grillet. Letzten Endes entschied sich \\"Evergreen Theatre\\", kürzere Filmscripts von Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco und Harold Pinter als je eine Episode eines abendfüllenden Spielfilms zu realisieren. Becketts \\"Film\\" war aber die einzige dieser drei Arbeiten, die tatsächlich verfilmt wurde. Ionescos Script konnte wegen zu hoher Anforderungen an die Spezialeffekte damals nicht umgesetzt werden, Pinters Script wurde, so Rosset, erst später von der BBC verfilmt., Der damals 58-jährige Samuel Beckett trat für das Projekt eine lang erwartete Reise in die USA an, um die Produktion des Films zu begleiten. Sein einmonatiger Aufenthalt dort war sein einziger Besuch in den USA. Beckett hatte zwar bereits früher Interesse am Kino gezeigt und in einer Zeit der Beschäftigungssuche sogar einen Brief an Sergei Eisenstein geschrieben, doch das Drehbuch zu \\"Film\\" und seine Mitarbeit an der Produktion blieben Becketts einzige Arbeit im Kinofilmbereich. Im Anschluss arbeitete er allerdings noch einige Male für das Fernsehen, außerdem wurden Becketts Theaterstücke mehrfach verfilmt., Besetzung und Stab., Als Regisseur von \\"Film\\" wurde der bei \\"Evergreen Theatre\\" involvierte Theaterregisseur Alan Schneider gewählt, der unter anderem einige Theaterstücke Becketts in den USA inszeniert hatte und erfolgreich am Broadway in New York arbeitete. \\"Film\\" war Schneiders erste und einzige Filmregie., Als Kameramann wurde Boris Kaufman ausgewählt. Rosset mochte seine Arbeit unter Jean Vigo an \\"L’Atalante\\" und \\"Betragen ungenügend\\". Kaufman hatte, kurze Zeit nach dem Tod seines Bruders Dsiga Wertow, für seine Kameraarbeit an \\"Die Faust im Nacken\\" 1955 einen Oscar und einen Golden Globe erhalten., Für die Hauptrolle des O wurde der frühere Stummfilmstar Buster Keaton engagiert. Er war nicht die erste Wahl für die Hauptrolle; zuvor war der Part Charlie Chaplin, Zero Mostel und Jack MacGowran angeboten worden, die aber nicht verfügbar waren. Jahre zuvor hatte Keaton das Angebot ausgeschlagen, die Rolle des Lucky in einer Produktion von \\"Warten auf Godot\\" zu spielen. Zum Zeitpunkt der Produktion von \\"Film\\" erlebte er eine Neuentdeckung seiner Stummfilme und kam zu späten Ehren durch Kritiker und Publikum., Es gibt verschiedene Versionen davon, wie Keaton zur Rolle kam. Der Theater- und Filmschauspieler James Karen, der im Film einen Passanten spielt, kannte sowohl Schneider von einer Theaterproduktion als auch Keaton von einer gemeinsamen Tour mit dem Stück \\"Merton of the Movies\\" in den 1950er-Jahren. Da Karen gegenüber Schneider \\"„unablässig von Keaton redete“\\", vermutete er, Keaton sei auch deshalb ins Gespräch für die Rolle des O gekommen. Becketts Biograf Knowlson hingegen berichtet, Keaton sei auf Vorschlag Becketts zu dem Projekt gestoßen, nachdem der von Beckett bevorzugte MacGowran ein anderes Filmengagement angenommen hatte. Mit MacGowran konnte Beckett kurze Zeit später das Fernsehspiel \\"He Joe\\" realisieren., Dreharbeiten und Umsetzung., Die Dreharbeiten fanden im Sommer 1964 in New York statt. Viele Reporter und Schaulustige begleiteten den Außendreh der Eingangsszenen an einer Wand in der Nähe der Brooklyn Bridge, unter ihnen Allen Ginsberg, Alain Resnais und Delphine Seyrig. Insbesondere diese Außenaufnahmen stellten eine große Herausforderung für die Filmneulinge Beckett und Schneider dar. Es herrschte große Sommerhitze, und die Unerfahrenheit des Teams, besonders des Regisseurs Schneider, hatte zur Folge, dass die Außenaufnahmen der ersten Drehtage nicht wie erwartet ausfielen. Eine Wiederholung ließ das Budget nicht zu. Beckett begnügte sich mit den gelungenen Teilen, zumal die Innenaufnahmen im Anschluss besser liefen., Von dem präzisen Drehbuch, das Aktionen der Personen und insbesondere die Ausstattung von Os Wohnung genau beschrieb, wollten Schneider und Beckett kaum abweichen. Dies ließ Keaton wenig Raum zur Improvisation, die seinem Stil, Filme zu drehen, nähergekommen wäre., Das Drehbuch erforderte es zudem, dass der Hauptdarsteller des O fast ausschließlich von hinten zu sehen ist. Keaton steht immer mit dem Rücken zur Kamera und wendet sich beständig ab, wenn die Kamera versucht, um ihn herum zu schauen. Keatons Gesicht ist daher bis kurz vor Ende des Films nicht zu sehen. Beckett ließ ihn aber seine eigenen mitgebrachten Hüte, \\"pork pie hats\\", tragen. Dieses Markenzeichen macht die Identität von Os Darsteller von Anfang an kenntlich., Zusammenarbeit von Beckett, Keaton und Schneider., Zwar war Schneider nominell der Regisseur, Beckett spielte aber eine mindestens ebenso große Rolle bei der Produktion des Films. Er hatte, so Schneider später, genaue Vorstellungen im Kopf und bemühte sich, diese umzusetzen., Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Beckett und Schneider einerseits und Keaton andererseits gestaltete sich als schwierig. Zum einen lag dies daran, dass sowohl Beckett als auch Schneider zwar Koryphäen auf ihrem jeweiligen Gebiet, aber Neulinge beim Film waren. Der nahezu siebzigjährige Keaton hingegen hatte schon Jahrzehnte zuvor Filme gedreht, die heute zu den besten ihrer Zeit gezählt werden. In den Worten einer Mitarbeiterin von \\"Film\\": \\"„Der Film wurde geschrieben von einem großartigen Dichter, der nichts über Film wusste, Regie führte ein Mann des Theaters, der nichts über Film wusste, Star des Films war ein Mann, der alles über Film wusste.\\"“ Samuel Beckett war klar, dass Keaton ihm hier etwas voraus hatte. Keaton wurde von Beckett aber auch als zurückgezogen und in der Vergangenheit verhaftet wahrgenommen, die Konversation zwischen ihnen bezeichnete er als einsilbig. Trotzdem lobte und bewunderte Beckett die Professionalität Keatons, der die Regieanweisungen auch in größter Sommerhitze klaglos ausführte., Filmanalyse., Becketts Idee., Becketts \\"Film\\" basiert auf der Anschauung des irischen Philosophen George Berkeley, dass das Wahrgenommenwerden das Sein des Menschen konstituiert: \\"Esse est percipi\\" (dt.: \\"Sein ist wahrgenommen werden\\"). Selbst wenn andere einen nicht mehr wahrnehmen, nimmt man sich doch selbst noch wahr.

Wenn O am Ende des Films sich selbst gegenübersteht, erkennt er demnach, dass er sich vor sich selbst letzten Endes nicht verbergen kann. Zwar hatte Schneider anfangs den Eindruck, Buster Keaton könne nicht viel mit dem Konzept anfangen, Keaton fasste die Essenz der Idee allerdings treffend so zusammen: \\"„A man may keep away from everybody, but he can’t get away from himself.“\\" (dt: \\"Ein Mensch kann sich von allen anderen fernhalten, sich selber kann er nicht entkommen.\\"), O als Name der ansonsten namenlosen Hauptfigur steht für \\"object\\" (Objekt), die Kamera, wenn sie als beobachtende Kameraeinstellung Os Wege verfolgt, bezeichnete Beckett als E: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Filmtitel 1965, Kurzfilm, Samuel Beckett, US-amerikanischer Film, Handlung, Produktion, Idee und Vorproduktion, Dreharbeiten und Umsetzung, Besetzung und Stab, Zusammenarbeit von Beckett, Keaton und Schneider, Filmanalyse"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: London Underground, U-Bahn-System], Die London Underground ist mit mehr als 160 Jahren (Stand 2023) die älteste U-Bahn der Welt und besitzt nach der Metro Moskau die zweitgrößte Netzlänge europäischer U-Bahnen. Sie erschließt neben der City of London besonders nördlich der Themse weite Teile der britischen Hauptstadt London sowie einige angrenzende Gebiete., Der erste Streckenabschnitt der Metropolitan Railway (die heutige Metropolitan Line) wurde am 10.Januar 1863 als unterirdische, mit Dampflokomotiven befahrene Eisenbahn eröffnet. Obwohl von der Metropolitan Railway die weltweit häufigste Bezeichnung für eine U-Bahn – \\"Metro\\" – abgeleitet wurde, wich dieser Begriff im britischen Englisch bereits Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts der Bezeichnung \\"Underground\\". In der Umgangssprache der Londoner wird die U-Bahn Tube (englisch für „Röhre“) genannt., Fast150Jahre lang war die Underground die längste U-Bahn der Welt; mittlerweile ist sie nach der Metro Shanghai und der U-Bahn Peking die viertlängste. Derzeit beträgt die Streckenlänge 402 Kilometer mit 272 Stationen auf 11 Linien, von denen 262 selbst verwaltet werden. Außerhalb der Innenstadt verkehren die Linien mehrheitlich an der Oberfläche, tatsächlich liegen nur 45Prozent des Streckennetzes im Tunnel. Komplett unterirdisch verkehren lediglich die Victoria Line und die nur zwei Stationen umfassende Waterloo &amp; City Line., Im Geschäftsjahr 2011 benutzten täglich durchschnittlich rund 3,2Millionen Fahrgäste die Underground, an Werktagen bis zu 3,7Millionen. In dieser Zeit wurden insgesamt 1,171Milliarden Fahrten unternommen, was einen Rekordwert darstellte., Seit2003 ist London Underground ein Teil von Transport for London (TfL), das auch für die übrigen öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel in Greater London mit Ausnahme der Eisenbahnen verantwortlich ist. Rechtlicher Betreiber ist jedoch die Tochtergesellschaft \\"London Underground Limited\\"., Liniennetz., Das Londoner U-Bahn-Netz ist 402 km lang, hat 272 Stationen und besteht aus 11 Linien, die zum Teil mehrfach verzweigt sind. 14Stationen liegen außerhalb der Grenzen von Greater London, nämlich drei bzw. fünf Stationen der Metropolitan Line in den Grafschaften Buckinghamshire und Hertfordshire sowie sechs Stationen der Central Line in der Grafschaft Essex., Die Züge fahren werktags, mit Abweichungen auf einzelnen Linien, von etwa 5 Uhr früh (samstags meist etwas später) bis zirka 1Uhr nachts und sonntags ab etwa 7Uhr bis Mitternacht. Die Taktzeiten betragen in Spitzenzeiten zwei Minuten, tagsüber durchschnittlich vier Minuten, am späten Abend bis zu zehn Minuten. In den Nächten von Freitag auf Samstag und Samstag auf Sonntag gibt es Nachtverkehr auf der Victoria Line, der Jubilee Line, Teilen der Northern, Central und Piccadilly Line sowie auf der East London Line von London Overground., Die London Underground ist auf das nördliche und südliche Stadtgebiet ungleich verteilt. Südlich der Themse liegen nur etwa zehnProzent des Streckennetzes, der Raum ist hauptsächlich mit Vorortzügen erschlossen. Nördlich der Themse verhält es sich umgekehrt, hier beschränkt sich die Eisenbahn auf wenige Hauptstrecken zu den großen Kopfbahnhöfen., Geschlossene Stationen und Linienabschnitte., Im Netz der Londoner U-Bahn gibt es eine Reihe aus unterschiedlichen Gründen geschlossener Stationen. In den Frühzeiten der Londoner U-Bahn waren Rolltreppen als vertikales Transportmittel gänzlich unbekannt und die tiefen Stationen waren, abgesehen von Nottreppen, ausschließlich über Aufzüge erreichbar. Mit dem späteren Einbau von Rolltreppen die auch eine horizontale Distanz überwinden, sind die oberirdischen Eingänge häufig näher aneinander gerückt. Daher erschien es sinnvoll, einige Stationen einzusparen; andere wurden wegen geringer Fahrgastzahlen geschlossen., Betrieb., Von Januar 2003 bis Mai 2008 bzw. Mai 2010 war London Underground in Form einer Public Private Partnership (PPP; Partnerschaft zwischen öffentlicher Hand und Privatunternehmen) teilprivatisiert. Der Unterhalt der Infrastruktur wurde durch private Unternehmen durchgeführt, doch die Underground blieb im Besitz von Transport for London, die auch für den Zugbetrieb zuständig war. Das Ziel von PPP war die Erschließung von Geldquellen für zukünftige Investitionen ins U-Bahn-System. Dazu gehörten der Neu- und Ausbau von Stationen, der Kauf von neuem Rollmaterial sowie die Einrichtung von neuen Sicherheitssystemen und Zugsicherungen., Das Netz wurde in drei Gruppen aufgeteilt:, Nachdem Metronet 2007 in große finanzielle Schwierigkeiten geraten war, übernahm Transport for London im Mai 2008 deren Mitarbeiter und Leistungsverträge in zwei neue Tochtergesellschaften. Im Mai 2010 erwarb Transport for London dann alle Geschäftsanteile von Tube Lines; seitdem wird das Unternehmen als Tochtergesellschaft geführt. Metronet wurde 2011 liquidiert., Der Rückkauf der London Underground Tube Lines kostete 206,4 Mio. Pfund. Ein Bericht bezifferte die Gesamtkosten des gescheiterten PPP-Projekts für die Allgemeinheit mit 5,526Mrd.Pfund., Betriebszahlen., Während der Hauptverkehrszeit transportiert die Underground derzeit auf den am stärksten benutzten Abschnitten stündlich 142.000 Passagiere. Theoretisch hätte sie eine maximale Kapazität von 315.000 Passagieren pro Stunde., Im Vergleich zu U-Bahnen in anderen Millionenstädten bestreitet die London Underground einen relativ hohen Anteil ihrer Betriebsausgaben aus den Fahrkarteneinnahmen. Im Jahr 2004 wurden die Ausgaben von knapp 2Milliarden Pfund zu etwa 62Prozent mit Fahrkarteneinnahmen finanziert. Insgesamt hatte die Underground damit einen Zuschussbedarf von 768Mio. Pfund. Im Jahr 2002 betrug der Anteil der Fahrkartenverkäufe an den Einnahmen sogar fast 82Prozent., Mitarbeiter in der Haltestelle., Während in vielen anderen U-Bahn-Systemen keine Mitarbeiter in den Haltestellen mehr beschäftigt werden, sind alle Haltestellen der London Underground durchgehend mit mehreren Angestellten besetzt. Zu den Aufgabenbereichen zählen:, Besonderheiten an Weihnachten und Silvester., Am 24. Dezember verkehren die Londoner Verkehrsmittel nach dem Fahrplan des entsprechenden Wochentags., Am 25. Dezember verkehren keine Züge der Londoner Verkehrsmittel, keine Eisenbahn, (fast) keine Busse und nur wenige Taxis, die dann Aufschlag kosten. Lediglich ein Ersatzverkehr zwischen der Stadt und den Flughäfen Heathrow und Gatwick wird angeboten., An den folgenden Tagen (26. Dezember bis 30. Dezember) ist ebenfalls mit Einschränkungen zu rechnen., In der Silvesternacht (31. Dezember auf 1. Januar) wird ein durchgehender Nachtbetrieb angeboten, der zwischen 23:45Uhr und 4:30Uhr kostenfrei benutzt werden kann. An Silvester und am 1. und 2.Januar ist mit geringerer Taktfrequenz zu rechnen., Transport for London gibt jedes Jahr rechtzeitig eine Broschüre für die Weihnachtsfeiertage und Silvester heraus., 24-Stunden-Betrieb (Night Tube)., Ab dem 12.September 2015 sollten zunächst die Victoria und Jubilee Lines sowie Teile der Central, Northern und Piccadilly Lines in den Nächten von Freitag auf Samstag und Samstag auf Sonntag rund um die Uhr betrieben (\\"Night Tube\\") werden. Auf den meisten Nachtlinien war ein 10-Minuten-Takt vorgesehen, auf der Northern Line sogar verdichtet auf 7 Minuten, was eine Senkung der Reisezeit im Vergleich zu Nachtbus-Verbindungen um durchschnittlich 20 Minuten bewirken sollte., Da die Mitarbeiter der Underground jedoch einen Lohnzuschlag für die nächtliche Arbeit forderten, war ein Konflikt zwischen Arbeitgeber und der britischen Gewerkschaft der Lokomotivführer entstanden. Daraufhin wurde ein 24-stündiger Streik für den 8.Juli 2015 angekündigt. Nachdem die Gewerkschaften weitere Streiks für den September 2015 angekündigt hatten, hatte TfL den Start der Night Tube vorerst bis auf weiteres abgesagt, um Zeit für weitere Verhandlungen zu haben. Nach einer Einigung mit den Gewerkschaften wurde die Einführung der Night Tube zum 5.August 2016 angekündigt, tatsächlich begann der Betrieb dann am 19.August. In einer zweiten Phase wurde mit Picadilly, Central und Northern Lines am 23.September 2016 die Night Tube erweitert., Im Nachtnetz gelten die Fahrscheine des Vortages bis 4:29 Uhr, da darauf folgend tariflich der nächste Tag beginnt. Um die Lärmbelastung von Anwohnern nahe der Underground-Linien möglichst gering zu halten, besteht eine Zusammenarbeit mit den lokalen Behörden. Als erste Maßnahme wurde die Lautstärke von Durchsagen verringert. Um den Fahrgästen auch nachts Sicherheit zu gewährleisten, werden hundert Einsatzkräfte der \\"British Transport Police\\" während der Betriebszeit der Night Tube eingesetzt, ebenso das Bahnhofspersonal., Durch diesen Schritt der London Underground wurden auch andere Verkehrsträger zu Planungen eines Nachtnetzes bewegt, darunter die Docklands Light Railway sowie verschiedene Eisenbahngesellschaften., Technik., Die Strecken der Londoner Underground können in zwei Bauweisen unterteilt werden: Unterpflasterbahnen (Sub-Surface) und Röhrenbahnen (Tube). Die Unterpflasterbahnen wurden ähnlich den älteren deutschen U-Bahnen in offener Tunnelbauweise errichtet (engl. \\"cut and cover\\"). Zuerst wurde mitten auf der Straße eine offene Baugrube ausgehoben. Nachdem die Tunnelwand errichtet und die Gleise verlegt waren, wurde die Baugrube abschnittsweise wieder mit einem Deckel verschlossen; über dem Deckel entstand die Straße neu. Die Gleise liegen durchschnittlich fünf Meter unter der Erdoberfläche. Die Tunnel haben einen Durchmesser von 7,62u202fm (25u202fft.) und bieten das gleiche Lichtraumprofil wie die britischen Eisenbahnstrecken. Der erste Tunnelabschnitt zwischen \\"Paddington\\" und \\"Farringdon\\" ist 7,82u202fm (25u202fft. 8u202finch) breit., Die Röhrenbahnen wurden anfangs mit Spitzhacke und Schaufel, später mittels Schildvortrieb in 20 bis 50 Metern Tiefe errichtet. Der Tunneldurchmesser ist weniger als halb so groß wie bei den Sub-Surface-Linien, im Durchschnitt 3,56u202fm (11u202fft. 8,25u202finch), jedes Gleis liegt in einer einzelnen Röhre. Obwohl die Gleisanlagen ebenfalls die Regelspurweite von 1435u202fmm aufweisen, ist das Lichtraumprofil wesentlich kleiner. Üblicherweise sind die beiden Teilnetze getrennt. Ausnahme ist die oberirdische Strecke \\"Rayners Lane\\" – \\"Uxbridge\\"; hier verkehren sowohl eine Sub-Surface-Linie (Metropolitan Line) als auch eine Tube-Linie (Piccadilly Line). Wegen der deutlich unterschiedlichen Wagenbodenhöhen erhielten die Bahnsteige in Mischbetriebsabschnitten eine Kompromisshöhe, damit ist der Zustieg an diesen Zugangsstellen nicht barrierefrei. Durch die technische Entwicklung wurden in der Folge auch Strecken im Sub-surface-Profil mit Schildvortriebsmaschienen aufgefahren.

Sie ist neben der Samtgemeinde Hesel eine der beiden Samtgemeinden im Landkreis und besteht aus den drei Gemeinden Detern, Filsum und Nortmoor, die sich im Zuge der kommunalen Gebietsreform im Jahre 1973 zusammengeschlossen haben. Benannt ist Jümme nach dem gleichnamigen Fluss, der alle drei Mitgliedsgemeinden durchfließt. Als Verwaltungssitz dient Filsum., Aufgrund der Lage an Jümme und Leda wird Jümme auch „Zweistromland“ genannt; der ostfriesische Geograf Dodo Wildvang prägte bereits in den 1920er-Jahren den Begriff „ostfriesisches Mesopotamien“. An den Flüssen befinden sich mit der Pünte Wiltshausen die nach Gemeindeangaben älteste noch in Betrieb befindliche handgezogene Fähre Mitteleuropas sowie Deutschlands schmalste Autobrücke im Ortsteil Amdorf., Die Samtgemeinde hat für Ostfriesland historische Bedeutung durch die Schlacht von Detern, in der im Jahre 1426 der ostfriesische Häuptling Focko Ukena seinen Widersacher Ocko II. tom Brok und dessen Verbündete besiegte. Die Burg Stickhausen im gleichnamigen Ortsteil war darüber hinaus über rund drei Jahrhunderte eine wichtige Grenzbefestigung der Grafschaft Ostfriesland. Zum kulturellen Erbe der Samtgemeinde zählen neben den Überresten der Burg auch historische Kirchen, von denen die Filsumer St.-Paulus-Kirche aus dem 13.Jahrhundert die älteste ist., Die selbst im innerostfriesischen Vergleich nur dünn besiedelte Samtgemeinde ist landwirtschaftlich geprägt, wobei in den Grünlandniederungen entlang der Flüsse vor allem Milchwirtschaft vorherrscht. Der Tourismus ist von einiger Bedeutung, unter den Kommunen des Landkreises Leer liegt Jümme bei den Übernachtungszahlen auf dem dritten Rang hinter Borkum und der Kreisstadt. Jümme ist kaum industrialisiert und insgesamt ein Auspendler-Gebiet, vor allem in die benachbarte Kreisstadt., Geografie., Lage und Ausdehnung., Die Samtgemeinde Jümme liegt im östlichen Landkreis Leer in Ostfriesland, im Nordwesten des deutschen Bundeslandes Niedersachsen. Der Hauptort Filsum liegt etwa zehn Kilometer vom Zentrum der Kreisstadt Leer entfernt. Die nächstgelegene Großstadt ist Oldenburg, etwa 42 Kilometer Luftlinie in östlicher Richtung von Filsum. Weitere größere, nahe gelegene Städte sind Emden (etwa 30Kilometer entfernt) sowie Aurich (knapp 27Kilometer entfernt)., Mit 6453Einwohnern, die sich auf 82,34Quadratkilometer verteilen, ist die Samtgemeinde Jümme nur dünn besiedelt: Auf jeden Quadratkilometer kommen im Durchschnitt etwa 78Einwohner. Damit liegt die Samtgemeinde weit unter dem ostfriesischen Durchschnitt von 148Einwohnern pro Quadratkilometer, der seinerseits den niedersächsischen (168) und den bundesrepublikanischen Durchschnitt (230) noch deutlich unterschreitet. Mit ihren rund 6500Einwohnern liegt die Samtgemeinde (verglichen mit anderen Samt- sowie Einheitsgemeinden) unter den Kommunen Ostfrieslands nach der Einwohnerzahl im unteren Bereich. Das Regionale Raumordnungsprogramm des Landkreises Leer teilt dem Hauptort Filsum die Funktion eines Grundzentrums für das Samtgemeindegebiet zu., Flächengrößte Mitgliedsgemeinde der drei Kommunen umfassenden Samtgemeinde ist Detern. Mit 43,3Quadratkilometern ist sie nach Hesel die zweitgrößte Mitgliedsgemeinde der sechs ostfriesischen Samtgemeinden., Geologie und Böden., Geologisch wird die Samtgemeinde Jümme wie ganz Ostfriesland oberflächlich von Schichten des Pleistozäns und des Holozäns gebildet. Pleistozäne Schichten sind in den Geestgegenden zu finden, die den Großteil des Samtgemeindegebiets ausmachen. Teils liegt auf den Geestschichten Moorboden auf, eine holozäne Schicht. Die Böden der ostfriesischen Geest wurden größtenteils aus Decksanden und Geschiebelehm gebildet., Entlang der Leda und der Jümme besteht der Boden aus Flussmarschen, die aus schluffigen Tonen gebildet werden. Im Übergangsbereich zwischen den Flüssen und der Geest schließen sich Moormarschen an, die aus Tonschichten von zumeist weniger als 40Zentimeter Dicke auf Moorböden bestehen. Der zentrale Bereich des Gebiets zwischen der Leda und der Jümme wird von inzwischen vollständig kultiviertem Niedermoor gebildet. Nördlich und östlich dieses Gebiets, im Bereich der Orte Nortmoor, Filsum, Detern und Stickhausen, herrschen Podsol-Böden in zumeist feuchter Lage vor. Sie liegen zumeist auf Ortstein und sind im Laufe der Jahrhunderte durch Plaggenesch in ihrer Tragfähigkeit verbessert worden. Durch Plaggendüngung, die bis zum Auftreten des Kunstdüngers am Ende des 19.Jahrhunderts jahrhundertelang vorgenommen wurde, gibt es besonders in der Umgebung der Geestdörfer anthropogene Plaggeneschböden. Durch den ständigen Neubodenauftrag liegt der Esch, in Ostfriesland (die) Gaste genannt, heute höher als die Dorfkerne. Durch diese Form der Düngung wurde die Bodenwertzahl deutlich gesteigert, wenn sie auch immer noch klar hinter den fruchtbaren Böden der Marsch zurückblieb. Teilweise sind die Podsol-Böden von Anmoor durchsetzt oder wurden dort durch Abtorfung und anschließende Kultivierung in Flächen mit stark humosem Oberboden umgewandelt. Entlang des Flüsschen Holtlander Ehetief und entlang des Südgeorgsfehnkanals befinden sich Streifen von Niedermoor., Gewässer., 5,5Prozent des Samtgemeindegebiets sind Wasserflächen: In Jümme gibt es mehr als 150Kilometer Fließgewässer, hinzu kommen Seen, Kolke und Altarme. Wichtigster Fluss ist die Jümme, deren Name sich im Samtgemeindenamen widerspiegelt. An der Grenze zur Stadt Leer fließt die Jümme in die Leda, die zuvor in der Gemarkung Amdorf ebenfalls wenige Kilometer über das Samtgemeindegebiet verläuft und weiter flussaufwärts nur wenig südlich von der Samtgemeindegrenze fließt. Auf dem Gebiet der Samtgemeinde ist die Leda als Binnenwasserstraße klassifiziert. Aufgrund dieser Lage an den beiden Flüssen hat der ostfriesische Geograf Dodo Wildvang bereits in den 1920er-Jahren vom „ostfriesischen Mesopotamien“ gesprochen, als er das Gebiet der heutigen Samtgemeinde beschrieb. In der Eigendarstellung nennt sich die Samtgemeinde bis heute gerne „Zweistromland“., Sofern das Leda-Sperrwerk in Leer nicht – was bei schweren Sturmfluten vorkommt – geschlossen ist, ist der Tidenhub über die Ems bis weit ins Landesinnere spürbar. Der mittlere Tidehub beträgt beim Leda-Sperrwerk drei Meter und am Dreyschloot, einer Querverbindung zwischen Leda und Jümme im Ortsteil Barge im Südosten des Samtgemeindegebiets, immerhin noch 80Zentimeter. Hochwasserschutz, Deichsicherheit und Entwässerung sind Aufgaben des Leda-Jümme-Verbandes mit Sitz in Leer. Neben den Deichen und dem Sperrwerk stehen dem Verband fünf große geregelte Entlastungspolder zur Verfügung. Diese werden geflutet, wenn wegen Sturmfluten das Leda-Sperrwerk gesperrt bleiben muss, zugleich aber (bspw. wegen Starkregen oder Schneeschmelzen) hohe Binnenwasserstände auf der Leda und Jümme auftreten. Einer der fünf Entlastungspolder befindet sich südlich von Detern und hat ein Volumen von drei Millionen Kubikmetern. In diesen Poldern wird das Wasser „zwischengespeichert“, bis das Sperrwerk wieder geöffnet werden kann., Neben den natürlichen Gewässern Leda und Jümme liegen auf dem Samtgemeindegebiet auch viele anthropogene Gewässer, vor allem die zahlreichen kleinen Entwässerungsgräben der einzelnen landwirtschaftlichen Felder. Diese werden in Ostfriesland \\"Schloote\\" genannt. Hinzu kommen der Süd- und der Nordgeorgsfehnkanal, die Fehnkanäle der beiden gleichnamigen Fehnorte. Der Nordgeorgsfehnkanal wurde nach Gründung des Fehns 1829 angelegt und in den 1920er-Jahren fertiggestellt. Seitdem stellt er eine durchgehende Verbindung von Ems/Leda/Jümme zum Ems-Jade-Kanal bei Marcardsmoor dar. Der Kanal spielte eine wichtige Rolle bei der Entstehung Wiesmoors und ist heute noch von Bedeutung für die Entwässerung des zentralen Ostfrieslands. Durch ihn können Wasserstände zwischen Ems-Jade-Kanal und Jümme ausgeglichen werden. Außerdem wird der Nordgeorgsfehnkanal für den Wassertourismus genutzt., Das Leda-Sperrwerk wurde 1954 fertiggestellt. Bis dahin wurde die Niederungslandschaft an Jümme und Leda, also auch weite Teile der Samtgemeinde, im Winterhalbjahr häufig überflutet., Flächennutzung., Die Flächennutzungstabelle rechts macht den überragenden Anteil von Landwirtschaftsflächen an der Gesamtfläche der Samtgemeinde deutlich. Er beträgt etwa 81,4Prozent (zum Vergleich: Ostfriesland rund 75Prozent; Deutschland 52,3Prozent.) Der Waldanteil in der von Grünland-Niederungszonen geprägten Samtgemeinde liegt hingegen nur bei knapp 0,83Prozent (Ostfriesland 2,6Prozent; Deutschland: 30,1Prozent)., Nachbargemeinden., Die Samtgemeinde grenzt an mehrere andere (Samt-)Gemeinden im Landkreis Leer, ist darüber hinaus aber auch eine der wenigen Kommunen Ostfrieslands, die zugleich an Gemeinden zweier Nachbarlandkreise grenzt. Östlich von Jümme befindet sich die Gemeinde Apen im Landkreis Ammerland. Im Südosten grenzt Jümme an die Gemeinde Barßel im Landkreis Cloppenburg. Die übrigen Kommunen, an die Jümme grenzt, liegen im Landkreis Leer, es sind (fortgeführt im Uhrzeigersinn) Ostrhauderfehn im Süden, Rhauderfehn im Südwesten, die Kreisstadt Leer im Westen, die Samtgemeinde Hesel im Nordwesten und Norden (darin die Gemeinden Brinkum, Holtland und Hesel) sowie die Gemeinde Uplengen im Nordosten., Gliederung der Samtgemeinde., Die Samtgemeinde Jümme besteht aus den drei Mitgliedsgemeinden Detern, Filsum und Nortmoor, die jedoch über weitere Ortschaften und Wohnplätze verfügen. Dies gilt insbesondere für die nach Fläche und Einwohnerzahl größte Mitgliedsgemeinde Detern. Nachfolgend aufgelistet sind die Mitgliedsgemeinden, deren Fläche und Einwohnerzahl sowie die weiteren Ortsteile (Stand: 31.Dezember 2010)., Klima., Jümme liegt in der gemäßigten Klimazone, im Einfluss der Nordsee.

Streitigkeiten wurden schiedsgerichtlich beigelegt. Die „Gesellen“ bekräftigten ihre Gemeinschaft durch eine gemeinsame Festkultur, die vom gemeinsamen Mahl bis zur Ausrichtung aufwändiger Turniere reichen konnte. Gemeinsame Abzeichen oder das Tragen einer einheitlichen Kleidung bei ihren regelmäßigen Zusammenkünften trugen zur Schaffung einer adeligen Identität und der Abgrenzung nach außen bei. Die Selbstbezeichnung, welche die Gesellen für diese Art der Gemeinschaft fanden, war „Ritterschaft“., Während zu Beginn der Vereinigungen politische Motive (Unterstützung einer Partei in Machtkämpfen, Schutz gegen Expansionsbestrebungen mächtiger Nachbarn) im Vordergrund standen, entwickelten sich die Gesellschaften mit der Zeit zu einer repräsentativen Bühne zum Zweck des standesgemäßen Auslebens einer adeligen Kultur, auch für niederadelige Geschlechter, unabhängig von den Fürstenhöfen. Diese Funktion nahmen die reinen Turniergesellschaften wahr, während die politische Rolle vornehmlich von der \\"Gesellschaft mit Sankt Jörgenschild\\" übernommen wurde., Die Adelsgesellschaften formten die gemeinsame Identität, aus der sich im 16. Jahrhundert die konstituierte Reichsritterschaft bilden konnte. Diese konnte auf die von den Adelsgesellschaften geschaffene Infrastruktur zurückgreifen., Abgrenzung und Einordnung des Begriffs „Adelsgesellschaft“., Adelsgesellschaften als Besonderheit des Heiligen Römischen Reiches., In der angelsächsischen Literatur hat Boulton eine Systematik der westeuropäischen Adelsvereinigungen erarbeitet. Er unterscheidet grob „Echte Orden \\"(true orders)\\"“, die von einem Monarchen oder Fürsten initiiert wurden, und „Pseudoorden \\"(pseudo orders)\\"“, bei denen die Initiative zum Zusammenschluss von den Mitgliedern ausging, die sich aber dennoch, mit oder ohne Eid, einem Förderer unterstellten., Bei dem Versuch, diese Systematik für die Erstellung eines Repertoriums zur Klassifizierung der deutschen Adelsgesellschaften heranzuziehen, fanden Kruse, Paravicini und Ranft Boultons Klassifikation nicht praktikabel, da sie dem „…schillernden und wandelbaren Charakter…“ der von ihnen beobachteten Gesellschaften nicht gerecht werde. Als schillernd bezeichnen sie zum Beispiel die Gesellschaft \\"St. Antonius (Kleve)\\"., die eine Gebetsverbrüderung, ein Hoforden und Förderer des Antoniterordens und schließlich eine Schützenbruderschaft gewesen sei. Als wandelbar bezeichnen sie den \\"Falken\\", der sich aus einer an politischen Zielen orientierten Vereinigung zu einer Turniergesellschaft, oder den \\"Drachen\\", der sich vom Hoforden zum Ehrenzeichen gewandelt habe. Sie vermuten, dass solche genossenschaftlichen Vereinigungen im Spätmittelalter in Deutschland, im Vergleich zu anderen Regionen Europas, besonders häufig anzutreffen waren, weil sich hier kein an einem einzelnen Monarchen ausgerichteter Zentralstaat ausgebildet hatte. Sie identifizieren 92 Gesellschaften, die hinsichtlich ihrer Struktur (Eid, Statuten, genossenschaftliche Organisation…) Gemeinsamkeiten aufwiesen. Angesichts der mageren Überlieferung nehmen sie an, dennoch nur einen Bruchteil der tatsächlichen Gesellschaften erfasst zu haben., Der römisch-deutsche König hatte, im Gegensatz zu den Königen von England, Frankreich oder Spanien, keine eigene Gesellschaft. Die Gesellschaften, in denen deutsche Könige anzutreffen sind, waren Gesellschaften ihrer Stammherrschaften. Der \\"Drache\\" war ungarisch, der \\"Adler\\" österreichisch, und „Tusin“ böhmisch. Die deutschen Kaiser und Könige betrieben eine flexible Politik im Spannungsfeld Kaiser/König–Fürsten–Adel–Städte, die vom generellen Verbot von Adelsgesellschaften in der Goldenen Bulle KarlsIV. 1356, über punktuelle Verbote, bis zur Billigung und Förderung durch König Sigmund 1422/1431 reichte. FriedrichIII. verfolgte eine opportunistische Politik, die sowohl Verbot als auch Förderung umfasste. Sein Sohn Maximilian betrieb eine aktive Förderung, um ein königs-/kaisertreues Gegengewicht gegen die Fürsten zu fördern., Abgrenzung vom Begriff „Orden“., Viele der Bezeichnungen für einzelne Adelsgesellschaften sind nicht zeitgenössisch. Dies gilt auch für die Oberbegriffe. So nannten sich nur \\"St. Antonius\\", \\"Pelikan\\" und \\"St. Hubertus\\" tatsächlich selbst Orden. „Schwanenorden“ ist hingegen eine Bezeichnung des 19. Jahrhunderts – ursprünglich nannte sich die Vereinigung „Gesellschaft unserer lieben Frau“. Ebenso verhielt es sich beim \\"Drachenorden\\", der in der Stiftungsurkunde gar nicht benannt wurde und später als \\"gesellschaft mit dem trakchen\\", \\"societas Draconis\\" oder \\"Gesellschaft des (Lind-)Wurms\\" bezeichnet wurde., Abgrenzung vom Begriff „Turniergesellschaft“., Der Begriff „Turniergesellschaft“ ist für eine allgemeine Bezeichnung ebenfalls zu eng. Diese Bezeichnung geht zurück auf die Beschäftigung mit Turnier- und Wappenbüchern im 19. und frühen 20. Jahrhundert. Anhand dort gefundener Eintragungen wurde versucht, Mitgliederverzeichnisse von Turniergesellschaften zu erfassen. Da die Kenntnisse der Herolde, die solche Turnier- und Wappenbücher erstellten, begrenzt und oft von regionalen Vorlieben beeinflusst waren oder, wie im Falle Rüxners deutlich wird, auch nachträgliche Konstruktionen darstellten, sind solche Zusammenstellungen willkürlich. Eine jede „…Liste fügt unter Weglassung alter Namen neue hinzu.“ In dem vom Kruse, Paravicini und Ranft erstellten Repertorium sind nur 24 der 92 aufgezeichneten Gesellschaften, entweder wegen einer Selbstbezeichnung in ihren Statuten oder wegen einer Erwähnung in Turnier- und Wappenbüchern, als Turniergesellschaften bezeichnet. Besonders bei den frühen Gesellschaften des 14. Jahrhunderts fehlt die Zuordnung als Turniergesellschaft ganz. Die \\"Gesellschaft von 1361\\" wird in der Literatur als Turniergesellschaft bezeichnet, war aber eine politische Vereinigung ober- und niederbayerischer Adeliger zur Beeinflussung des labilen Herzogs Meinrad. 1362 entstand ein adeliger Gegenbund, der die Wittelsbacher Ruprecht I. und Ruprecht II., Pfalzgrafen bei Rhein, Stephan II., Herzog von Bayern-Landshut, und Johann II. unterstützte gegen jene, die Meinrad „…seinen landen und läuten, rittern und knechten, steten un märgten, reichen und armen enpfrümpt und enpfürt habent…“. Mit dem Tod Meinrads verschwanden sowohl die Gesellschaft als auch das Gegenbündnis., Auch andere sogenannte Turniergesellschaften hatten vorwiegend politische Motive. Die Gesellschaft des Rüdenbandes firmierte laut Statut als Turniergesellschaft, wurde aber von Wenzel von Breslau genutzt, um seine Nachfolge durch seinen Neffen Ludwig II. zu sichern., Die \\"Gesellschaft mit dem Greifen\\" wurde wegen ihrer Aufnahme in spätere Turnier- und Wappenbücher –- bei Rüxner sogar fälschend zurückverlegt bis zu einem sagenhaften Magdeburger Turnier von 938 – als Turniergesellschaft bezeichnet. Es handelte sich aber um ein Bündnis des Grafen Johann von Wertheim, des Grafen Gotfrid von Rieneck und anderer Adeliger, um sich im Angriffsfalle gegenseitig beizustehen. Sie fürchteten, in den Konflikt zwischen dem Erzbischof von Mainz und dem Pfalzgrafen Ruprecht dem Älteren hineingezogen zu werden. Wertheim und Rieneck waren dem Erzbischof in einem Solddienstvertrag verpflichtet., Eine Verlagerung der Schwerpunkte ist auch bei den beiden Gesellschaften \\"Falke\\" in Oberschwaben und \\"Fisch\\" am Bodensee zu beobachten. Beide Gesellschaften hatten von Anfang an an Turnieren teilgenommen, aber besonders bei den Falken stand das innere und äußere Friedensgebot, mit Schiedsgericht und gegenseitigem Schutz bei äußerem Angriff, klar im Vordergrund. Im Jahr 1479 kam es zu einem Bündnisvertrag zwischen den beiden selbständig bleibenden Gesellschaften, der nur von den beiden Königen gesiegelt wurde. Der Aspekt des gegenseitigen Schutzes spielte bei diesem Bündnis eine herausragende Rolle. 1484 vereinigten sich dann die beiden Gesellschaften zur Gesellschaft vom \\"Fisch und Falken\\". Dies ging einher mit der Zeit der großen Turniere in den 80er Jahren des 15. Jahrhunderts. Die Aufnahmeregeln für die neue Gesellschaft nahmen ausdrücklich auf die „Vier-Lande-Turniere“ Bezug: Aufgenommen werden sollte nur derjenige, „…so fern derselbe von den Vier Landen deß Turners zugelassen wuerdt“. Interessant ist, dass die Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit der Gesellschaft auf die Kampf- und Schiedsgerichte der Turniere übertragen wurde, das heißt, Auseinandersetzungen konnten auch im Turnierkampf und vor dem dortigen Schiedsgericht ausgetragen werden und das Ergebnis war zu akzeptieren. Ein weiterer Aspekt, der die stärkere Hinwendung dieser neuen fusionierten Gesellschaft zum Turnier erklärt, ist das gleichzeitige Erstarken der \\"Gesellschaft mit Sankt Jörgenschild\\". Fast sämtliche Mitglieder der neuen Gesellschaft waren gleichzeitig auch in der vornehmlich politische Interessen verfolgenden Gesellschaft vom \\"Fisch und Falken\\" vertreten. Auch andere Gesellschaften, welche sich ausschließlich als „Thornergesellschaften“ verstanden, wie der \\"Leitbracken\\", oder die \\"Gekrönten Steinböcke\\", hatten in ihren Statuten Regelungen zur internen Friedenswahrung, also ein genossenschaftliches Regulativ des Fehdewesens., Abgrenzung vom Begriff „Ritterbund“., Auch der Begriff „Ritter“ in neuzeitlichen Bezeichnungen wie „Ritterbund“ oder der noch weitergehenden Begriffsvermischung „Ritterorden“ muss relativiert werden.

I'm making a fantasy medieval game. Advise 8 different North and South American native peoples ethnicities that you can be inspired to create 8 human kingdoms in my game.","output":"Creating a fantasy medieval game inspired by Native American cultures is a fascinating concept. To help you with the ethnicities, I've provided eight diverse Native American groups from North and South America that you can draw inspiration from to create your human kingdoms: 1. Aztec Empire (Central Mexico): Known for their powerful influence in Central Mexico, the Aztecs were skilled warriors and had a strong hierarchical society centered around the capital city of Tenochtitlan. Consider incorporating their distinct pyramid-like architecture, religious rituals, and vibrant art style into one of your kingdoms. 2. Inca Empire (Andean region): The mighty Inca Empire, located in the Andean region of South America, is renowned for their advanced agricultural systems, vast road networks, and impressive stone architecture, such as Machu Picchu. You can draw inspiration from their ingenuity and organizational skills to create a kingdom with a well-structured society. 3. Cherokee Nation (Eastern United States): With a rich cultural heritage and being of the largest Native American tribes in the southeastern United States, the Cherokee Nation has a diverse mythology, elaborate storytelling traditions, and unique linguistic characteristics. These elements can help you shape a kingdom that values education, oral traditions, and has a deep connection with nature. 4. Apache Tribe (Southwest United States): The Apache tribes of the Southwest United States were known for their fierce warriors and their ability to adapt to different landscapes. Drawing inspiration from their nomadic nature, you can create a kingdom that values independence, versatility, and is skilled at guerrilla warfare. 5. Mapuche People (Chile and Argentina): The Mapuche people, indigenous to Chile and Argentina, have a proud warrior tradition and fought valiantly against European colonial powers. Incorporate their strong cultural identity, connection with ancestral lands, and unique architectural style called the ruka, which can make for an interesting kingdom in your game. 6. Haida Nation (Pacific Northwest Coast): Originating from the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America, the Haida Nation possesses sophisticated woodworking skills, distinctive totem poles, and a rich mythology centered around powerful supernatural beings. By including their artistic style and respect for nature, you can create a kingdom deeply rooted in spiritual practices and sustainable resource management. 7. Mohawk Nation (Northeastern United States and Canada): The Mohawk Nation, part of the Iroquois Confederacy, had a strong social structure known as the Longhouse. Consider incorporating their communal living, council decision-making, and legendary skilled craftsmanship into a kingdom that values cooperation, democracy, and the pursuit of excellence. 8. Guarani People (Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina): The Guarani people, spread across present-day Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, have a deep spiritual connection with nature and a vibrant mythology. Incorporating their belief system, shamanic practices, and their unique knowledge about medicinal plants, you can create a kingdom that has a strong bond with the environment and places great importance on sustainable living. Remember, while drawing inspiration from these diverse Native American peoples, it is crucial to approach their respective cultures and traditions with respect and accuracy. The goal should be to honor and showcase the richness of their history rather than perpetuating stereotypes or appropriating their culture."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Computer-Rollenspiel, Computerspiel 2006, Fantasy-Computerspiel, Final Fantasy, Nintendo-Switch-Spiel, PlayStation-2-Spiel, PlayStation-4-Spiel, Science-Fiction-Computerspiel, USK 12], Final Fantasy XII (, \\"Fainaru Fantajī Tuerubu\\"; kurz: \\"FFXII\\" oder \\"FF12\\") ist ein Computer-Rollenspiel und der zwölfte Haupttitel der \\"Final-Fantasy\\"-Serie. Das Spiel wurde vom japanischen Unternehmen Square Enix exklusiv für die Spielkonsole PlayStation 2 (kurz: PS2) entwickelt und im März 2006 in Japan veröffentlicht. In Nordamerika kam der Titel im Oktober desselben Jahres auf den Markt; die Veröffentlichung in Europa erfolgte im Februar 2007, wobei in Deutschland das Medienunternehmen Koch Media für den Vertrieb zuständig war. Unter dem Titel \\"Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age\\" wurde eine überarbeitete HD-Version im Juli2017 für die PlayStation 4 und im Februar2018 für Windows veröffentlicht; im April 2019 folgten Versionen für die Nintendo Switch und die Xbox One., Das Spiel, dessen Entwicklung etwa fünf Jahre dauerte, führte einige Neuerungen in die Serie ein. So finden in diesem Teil Kämpfe nicht mehr in einem eigenen Kampfbildschirm und in Echtzeit statt; die Kamera, die eine dreidimensionale Ansicht des Spielgeschehens zeigt, ist in alle Richtungen drehbar., Die Handlung findet in einer fiktiven Region namens Ivalice in einer nicht weiter genannten Fantasywelt statt. Sie schildert aus Sicht des Protagonisten, des Waisenjungen Vaan, die politischen und kriegerischen Verwicklungen, in die das kleine Königreich Dalmasca und dessen Thronerbin, Prinzessin Ashe, vor dem Hintergrund eines bereits lange Zeit andauernden Krieges zwischen zwei Großmächten geraten., \\"Final Fantasy XII\\" wurde von der Kritik durchweg positiv aufgenommen, wobei vor allem die Grafik und die detaillierte Darstellung der Spielwelt gelobt wurden. Das Spiel erhielt einige Preise und Auszeichnungen, für weitere war es nominiert. Auch wirtschaftlich war es mit über fünf Millionen verkauften Exemplaren für Square Enix ein Erfolg. Mit dem Echtzeit-Strategiespiel \\"\\" erschien ein direkter Nachfolger für die Handheld-Konsole Nintendo DS., Spielprinzip., \\"Final Fantasy XII\\" ist ein Rollenspiel, das bedeutet, der Spieler steuert eine Gruppe von Figuren, die vor dem Hintergrund einer erdachten Spielwelt Kämpfe bestreiten und dabei eine komplexe Geschichte erleben. Wesentliches Element ist die Entwicklung der Charaktere: Nach jedem Kampf erhalten die beteiligten Gruppenmitglieder Erfahrungspunkte, die zu einem Aufstieg der Stufe führen und so eine Verbesserung von Statuswerten wie maximale Treffer- und Magiepunkte, Angriffs- und Abwehrstärke bewirken. Ein weiterer Bestandteil der Charakterentwicklung besteht darin, Waffen, Rüstungen und Accessoires der Spielfiguren immer wieder durch bessere Versionen zu ersetzen., Perspektive, Steuerung und Spielwelt., Der Spieler steuert eine seiner Figuren, den Gruppenführer, mit einem Analog-Stick des Gamepads durch eine in zahlreiche Abschnitte unterteilte Spielwelt. Dabei zeigt die Kamera die Figur von hinten in der Third-Person-Perspektive und kann mit dem anderen Analogstick frei rotiert werden. Oben rechts auf dem Spielbildschirm ist stets eine kleine Karte eingeblendet, die die nähere Umgebung der Figuren zeigt. Während eines Kampfes wird neben den Anzeigen mit den aktuellen Treffer- und Magiepunkten der Spielfiguren ein Kampfmenü eingeblendet, aus dem der Spieler Befehle auswählen kann., Wie bei vielen Rollenspielen stellen einige Abschnitte Städte oder Siedlungen dar, in denen der Spieler bei Händlern für Spielwährung einkaufen oder mit Nicht-Spieler-Charakteren sprechen kann. Hier befinden sich keine Gegner und es finden keine Kämpfe statt. In Städten steuert der Spieler stets die Figur des Protagonisten Vaan, außerhalb kann der Gruppenführer aber jederzeit – auch während eines Kampfes – beliebig gewechselt werden, die anderen Figuren bleiben dabei stets in der Nähe des Gruppenführers. Außerhalb von Städten besteht die Spielwelt häufig aus weitläufigen Landschaften wie Wüsten, Wiesen oder Stränden. Manche Spielabschnitte fungieren als sogenannter Dungeon. In diesen oft labyrinthartig angelegten Gebieten, wie etwa Verliesen, Tempeln und dem Inneren eines Luftschiffes, besteht das Spielziel darin, sich zu einem Endgegner vorzukämpfen und diesen zu besiegen. Mitunter müssen hier auch kleine Rätsel gelöst werden, um den nächsten Abschnitt erreichen zu können. Alle Gebiete sind in unterschiedlich große Teilabschnitte unterteilt; wenn der Gruppenführer die Grenze zwischen zwei Teilabschnitten überschreitet, kommt es zu einem kurzen Ladevorgang., An sogenannten Speicherkristallen kann der Spieler seinen Spielstand auf einer Memory Card abspeichern. Zwischen bereits bekannten Gebieten bestehen verschiedene Schnellreisemöglichkeiten, zum Beispiel Teleporterkristalle, Luftschifflinien oder ein Ritt auf \\"Chocobos\\" genannten, straußenähnlichen gelben Laufvögeln, die ein bekanntes wiederkehrendes Element der \\"Final-Fantasy\\"-Reihe sind., Kampf., In Gegensatz zu den vorherigen Teilen der Spieleserie finden Kämpfe nicht als Zufallskämpfe und nicht in einem eigenen Kampfbildschirm statt. Stattdessen sieht der Spieler die Gegner bereits von Weitem in den Spielabschnitten umherwandern und der Kampf beginnt übergangslos, wenn sich eine Figur aus der Gruppe des Spielers einem Gegner bis auf einen bestimmten Abstand genähert hat. Das Kampfgeschehen wird durch Visierlinien, dünne bogenförmige Linien zwischen den Figuren, verdeutlicht, deren Farbe die Art der gewählten Aktion symbolisiert. Der Spieler kann nun aus einem Kampfmenü Aktionen wie physische oder magische Angriffe oder das Benutzen von Heilungsgegenständen und -zaubern auswählen. Die Befehle werden dabei nicht rundenbasiert wie etwa in \\"Final Fantasy X\\", sondern in Echtzeit ausgeführt; der Spieler kann allerdings entscheiden, ob das Kampfgeschehen pausiert werden soll, während er einen Befehl auswählt. Eine Besonderheit dieses Serienteils ist es, dass während eines Kampfes beispielsweise auch die Ausrüstung angepasst und die am Kampf beteiligten Figuren gegen andere ausgewechselt werden können. Die einzige Einschränkung ist hierbei, dass eine von einem Gegner bereits anvisierte Figur nicht aus dem Kampf genommen werden kann. Von den insgesamt sechs spielbaren Figuren können maximal drei aktiv an einem Kampf teilnehmen. Abhängig von der Handlung kommt mitunter eine als \\"Gast\\" bezeichnete vierte mitkämpfende Figur hinzu, die computergesteuert und ohne Einflussmöglichkeit des Spielers agiert., Ein wichtiges Element des Kampfsystems in \\"Final Fantasy XII\\" ist das sogenannte \\"Gambitsystem\\", mit dem der Spieler vor oder während eines Kampfes festlegen kann, in welchen Situationen eine Spielfigur bestimmte Aktionen automatisch ausführen soll. Ein Gambit ist dabei eine Kombination aus einem Ziel, das mit einer Bedingung gekoppelt sein kann, und dem auszuführenden Befehl. Beispiele für einzelne Gambits sind „Gegner im Blickfeld“ kombiniert mit „Angriff“ oder „Sich selbst, wenn die Trefferpunkte kleiner als 30 % sind“ kombiniert mit der Verwendung eines Heilungszaubers. Jeder Spielfigur können bis zu zwölf Gambits zugeordnet werden, die dann jeweils – ähnlich wie die Anweisungen bei einem Computerprogramm – automatisch von oben nach unten abgearbeitet werden. Im Idealfall können auf diese Weise auch längere Kämpfe ohne weiteres Zutun des Spielers bestritten werden. Allerdings können die Gambits einer Figur auch jederzeit abgeschaltet werden, sodass sie nur noch auf direkte Befehle des Spielers reagiert., Ein weiteres Taktikelement sind die sogenannten \\"Esper\\", mächtige dämonenartige Wesen, die im Kampf herbeigerufen werden können und dann für eine gewisse Zeitspanne an der Seite einer Spielfigur mitkämpfen. Solche Beschwörungszauber sind – unter wechselnden Bezeichnungen – ein bekanntes wiederkehrendes Element der \\"Final-Fantasy\\"-Reihe. In \\"Final Fantasy XII\\" können den Esper keine direkten Befehle erteilt werden, sondern sie kämpfen gemäß ihrer voreingestellten und nicht änderbaren Gambits. Wie die sogenannten \\"Mysth Teks\\" – besonders starke Spezialangriffe, die durch schnelles Tastendrücken zu Ketten kombiniert werden können – verbrauchen Esperbeschwörungen je nach Stärke ein Drittel, zwei Drittel oder alle Magiepunkte einer Spielfigur., Charakterentwicklung., Nach dem Kampf erhalten die beteiligten Spielfiguren Erfahrungspunkte, die zu einem Stufenaufstieg und dadurch zu einer Verbesserung der Statuswerte führen. Eine Änderung gegenüber früheren Teilen der Spielreihe besteht darin, dass Gegner im Allgemeinen kein Geld hinterlassen, sondern Gegenstände (siehe Loot), die in Läden verkauft werden können, um Spielwährung zu erhalten. Damit können dann bessere Waffen, Rüstungen und Fähigkeiten erworben und dadurch die Charaktere weiter gestärkt werden. Bessere Ausrüstungsgegenstände können auch als Belohnungen für die Erfüllung von Nebenaufgaben erhalten werden, die der Spieler als Aufträge, sogenannte Quests, in Dialogen mit Nichtspielercharakteren gestellt bekommt. Obwohl es ein Standardelement vieler Rollenspiele ist, stellt das umfangreiche Quest-System in \\"Final Fantasy XII\\" eine Neuerung innerhalb der Spielreihe dar. Ausrüstungsgegenstände können auch durch das Öffnen von in der Spielwelt verstreuten Schatzkisten gefunden werden. Im Gegensatz zu der Vorgängern wird allerdings das Auftauchen und der Inhalt dieser Truhen stark durch das Zufallsprinzip bestimmt., Ein weiteres gegenüber den Vorgängern neues Element der Charakterentwicklung ist ein als \\"Lizenzsystem\\" bezeichnetes Konzept. Nachdem ein Gegner besiegt ist, hinterlässt dieser einen oder mehrere Lizenzpunkte, die auf einem speziellen Spielbrett, dem Lizenzbrett, ausgegeben werden können. In dieser großen, schachbrettartigen Anordnung von Lizenzfeldern können Lizenzen erworben werden, wobei stets nur Felder zur Verfügung stehen, die an ein bereits aufgedecktes Feld grenzen. Eine Spielfigur kann erworbene Ausrüstungsgegenstände oder Fähigkeiten erst dann verwenden, wenn auf diese Weise auch die entsprechende Lizenz dafür freigeschaltet wurde. Das Lizenzbrett ist für alle Figuren dasselbe, allerdings beginnen sie auf unterschiedlichen Startfeldern., Handlung., Hintergrundwelt., Die Handlung von \\"Final Fantasy XII\\" findet in der Region Ivalice statt, die sich über drei Kontinente einer fiktiven Welt erstreckt und entsprechend unterschiedliche Klima- und Vegetationszonen umfasst.

Aus der frühesten Besetzungszeit im letzten Viertel des 1. Jahrhundertsn.Chr. sind zwei Kastelle bekannt, nach deren Aufgabe eine planmäßige Stadtgründung erfolgte. Der Beiname der zugehörigen Verwaltungskörperschaft \\"(Civitas Ulpia Sueborum Nicrensium)\\" legt nahe, dass dies zur Regierungszeit Kaiser Trajans (98–117 n.Chr.) stattfand, dessen ursprünglicher Name Marcus Ulpius Traianus lautete. Lopodunum war der Vorort der hier ansässigen Neckarsueben. Zeugnis dieser Vorortfunktion in römischer Zeit geben die Reste eines Forums sowie einer monumentalen Basilika. Das antike Ladenburg war einer der bedeutendsten Orte im Hinterland des Obergermanischen Limes bis zu dessen Aufgabe nach der Mitte des 3.Jahrhunderts. In der Spätantike, als der Rhein wieder die Reichsgrenze bildete, wurde von den Römern erneut eine militärische Anlage in Form eines \\"Ländeburgus\\" im Stadtgebiet angelegt., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Das Gebiet am Unterlauf und im Schwemmkegel des Neckar wies schon vor dem Vordringen der Römer an den Rhein eine weitgehende Besiedlung auf. Namensgebend für die römische Gründung ist das keltische Toponym \\"Lokudunum\\" (zu deutsch „Seeburg“). Das lateinische \\"Lopo-\\" stellt eine lautliche Assimilierung, beziehungsweise eine Vermischung aus lateinisch \\"lupus\\" (\\"Wolf\\") mit dem thematischen keltischen \\"loku\\" dar. Neben Fundstellen in der Ebene zeugen davon besonders die Ringwallanlagen auf dem nahe gelegenen Heiligenberg. Das Fehlen von Fundmaterial seit der Mitte des 1. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. ist möglicherweise eine Folge des Gallischen Kriegs und für das rechtsrheinische Südwestdeutschland typisch („Helvetier-Einöde“). Nahe dem Rhein zwischen Neckar und Main sind einige Gräberfelder bekannt, die nach längerer wissenschaftlicher Diskussion heute als germanisch angesehen werden. Bereits Kaiser Tiberius ließ hier Jahrzehnte vor den rechtsrheinischen Eroberungen (Chattenkriege Kaiser Domitians) Sueben im Vorfeld der Reichsgrenze am Rhein ansiedeln. Im Ladenburger Stadtgebiet liegen Siedlungsfunde in den Fluren \\"Lustgarten\\", \\"Weihergärten\\" und \\"Ziegelscheuer\\" vor, ferner Bestattungsplätze im Bereich der Kiesgrube \\"Rechts des Wallstädter Wegs\\" und am \\"Erbsenweg\\" (mit zugehöriger Siedlung)., Im Verlauf des 1.Jahrhundertsn.Chr. begannen die Römer, die Verkehrswege am Rhein auszubauen. Bereits vor der Einrichtung des Limes wurde die rechtsrheinische Route der römischen Rheintalstraße ausgebaut. Als kürzeste Verbindung zwischen den bedeutenden Legionsstandorten an \\"Rhenus\\" (Rhein) und \\"Danuvius\\" (Donau) führte sie von \\"Mogontiacum\\" (Mainz) über Groß-Gerau–Gernsheim–Ladenburg nach Süden, wo sie bei Offenburg gegenüber von \\"Argentoratum\\" (Straßburg) die von Gnaeus Pinarius Cornelius Clemens angelegte „Kinzigtalstraße“ erreichte., Militärstandort im späten ersten Jahrhundert n. Chr.., In den 70er Jahren des ersten Jahrhunderts legten die Römer im Gebiet der heutigen Ladenburger Altstadt, die sehr zentral innerhalb der Neckarebene liegt, nacheinander zwei Kastelle an. Das Lagerdorf \\"(vicus)\\" von KastellI überlagert KastellII, so dass KastellII älter sein muss. Der bereits nach wenigen Jahren erfolgte Neubau könnte auf einen Wechsel der hier stationierten Truppe hindeuten. Beide Kastelle befanden sich auf dem vor Hochwasser geschützten Hochufer des \\"Nicer\\" (Neckar). Wie in vielen rückwärtigen Kastellen war hier mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Reitereinheit \\"(ala)\\" stationiert. Darauf deuten die Größe von KastellI, dazugehörige Pferdeställe, charakteristische Fundstücke von Pferdegeschirr sowie der Weihestein eines \\"decurio\\" der \\"Ala I Cannanefatium\\" hin, der 1906 verbaut in der mittelalterlichen Stadtmauer gefunden wurde. Ein Ausbau des ursprünglich mit einer Rasensodenmauer errichteten KastellI in Stein erfolgte in domitianischer Zeit um 90n.Chr., Die \\"Ala I Cannanefatium\\" ist zwischen 74 und 90n.Chr. durch Militärdiplome als Teil des obergermanischen Heeres bezeugt. Erstmals im Jahr 116 erscheint sie in Pannonien, wohin sie von Trajan zu den Dakerkriegen abkommandiert wurde. Ebenfalls in die Zeit Kaiser Trajans fällt die Aufgabe des Kastells, wobei die Mauern abgebrochen und die Spitzgräben verfüllt wurden. Die Schuttschichten enthielten Keramik aus trajanischer Zeit. Die Aufgabe des rückwärtigen Militärstandortes geht einher mit parallelen Entwicklungen im gesamten Hinterland des Limes. Unter Trajan wurden rückwärtige Garnisonen wie in Nida-Heddernheim, Wiesbaden und Groß-Gerau aufgelöst und die Einheiten an den Limes verlegt., Die Stadt in der hohen Kaiserzeit., Der markante Einschnitt in die Infrastruktur der Siedlung mit der um 106 erfolgten Stadtgründung wird dadurch deutlich, dass nun in der \\"Retentura\\" des aufgegebenen Kastells ein städtisches Forum mit monumentaler Basilika entstand. Die Gesamtanlage findet mit einer Größe von 130×84m keine Entsprechung in den größeren städtischen Siedlungen rechts des Rheins. Vermutet wird daher die Planung einer weitergehenden Funktion Ladenburgs (\\"colonia\\" oder \\"municipium\\"?), die aus unbekannten Gründen nicht zu Ende geführt wurde. Verschiedene Indizien wie das Fehlen von Funden, besonders Fußbodenteilen, aus den Bodenschichten der Basilika sprechen dafür, dass sie nicht fertiggestellt wurde. Das Forum war aber voll funktionsfähig, worauf Funde von Ziegelplattenböden und anderer Architekturteile in den Ladenlokalen hindeuten. Ungefähr um diese Zeit wurde auch ein Theater errichtet., Lopodunum erfüllte damit im 2. und 3.Jahrhundert die Funktion eines Zentralortes im unteren Neckargebiet, dem Kraichgau und der Bergstraße. Die nächsten Siedlungen dieser Art befanden sich nördlich in Dieburg \\"(Civitas Auderiensium)\\", östlich in Bad Wimpfen \\"(Civitas Alisinensium)\\" und südlich in Pforzheim. Nach Westen hin bildete der Rhein die Grenze zu den \\"Civitates\\" der Nemeter – mit dem Hauptort \\"Noviomagus\\" (Speyer) – und der Vangionen – mit dem Hauptort \\"Borbetomagus\\" (Worms). Die Stadt erlebte ihre Blütezeit im 2. und frühen 3.Jahrhundert. In ihrem Umland entstanden bedeutende Landgüter \\"(villae rusticae)\\", von denen gut ergrabene Beispiele in Hirschberg-Großsachsen und in Ladenburg selbst („Ziegelscheuer“) vorliegen. Grundlage der wirtschaftlichen Blüte dürfte die Präsenz der zahlungskräftigen römischen Grenztruppen gewesen sein. Die städtischen Privathäuser bestanden bis um die Mitte des 2.Jahrhunderts vorwiegend aus Fachwerk. Die aus dem Kastellvicus hervorgegangenen Teile der Siedlung an der Fernstraße nördlich und südlich des Kastells wiesen eine Bebauung in Form von bis zu 30m langen Streifenhäusern auf. Erst ab der Mitte des 2. Jahrhunderts wurden Steingebäude mit durchschnittlichen Größen bis zu 2000m² üblich, wobei gelegentlich mehrere Grundstücke zusammengelegt wurden., Ende der Stadt und Spätantike., Das Ende der Stadt kam um die Mitte des 3.Jahrhunderts mit dem sogenannten Limesfall. Bereits im frühen 3.Jahrhundert wurde eine Stadtmauer errichtet, die im Norden der Siedlung aus bisher ungeklärten Gründen nicht nachweisbar ist. Nachgewiesen ist sie auf der Länge von 1,2km, ihre Länge kann zu 2,7km ergänzt werden. Qualitätvolle Architekturteile, die in ihrem Fundament verbaut wurden, legen nahe, dass zu dieser Zeit einige wichtige Repräsentationsgebäude nicht mehr bestanden. Mehrere Brandhorizonte in der Stadt datieren bereits in das erste Drittel des 3.Jahrhunderts und könnten mit den germanischen Einfällen von 212 oder 233 zusammenhängen. Als die kaiserlichen Truppen 260 abgezogen wurden, scheint die verbliebene römische Zivilbevölkerung ihnen gefolgt zu sein. Jedenfalls ließen sich bald darauf germanische Siedler im Stadtgebiet nieder. Alamannische Bodenfunde liegen aus der Südstadt bereits für die Zeit kurz nach 260 vor., Nachdem der Rhein wieder die Reichsgrenze bildete, blieb das Stadtgebiet aufgrund seiner strategischen Lage weiterhin im Einflussbereich der Römer. Neben einem kurzfristig belegten Kastell des 4.Jahrhunderts wird dies vor allem durch die Reste eines \\"burgus\\" bezeugt, der unter dem heutigen neuen Rathaus entdeckt werden konnte. Er entstand zusammen mit weiteren Befestigungsanlagen der Region unter Kaiser Valentinian I. um 370. Die Befestigung lehnte sich als Schiffslände direkt an das Neckarhochufer an; sie diente offenbar der Vorfeldüberwachung und war nur vom Fluss aus erreichbar, da sie kein Tor zur Landseite besaß. Bald nach 400 wurde der \\"burgus\\" aufgegeben, worauf im 5.Jahrhundert wieder Germanen im Stadtgebiet siedelten., Römische Bauten., Kastelle., Das ältere KastellII wurde 1962 entdeckt. Teile der östlichen Umwehrung konnten auf 34m Länge nachgewiesen werden. Sie bestand aus einem fünf Meter breiten und zwei Meter tiefen Spitzgraben sowie einer drei Meter breiten Rasensodenmauer. Vier massive Pfosten weisen auf einen hölzernen Turm hin. Lagerbefunde aus dem westlich liegenden Kastellbereich konnten wie die Innenbebauung nicht nachgewiesen werden, möglicherweise wurden sie vom Neckar abgeschwemmt., Das nach Südosten versetzte KastellI wird das ältere Kastell nach wenigen Jahren abgelöst haben. Es besaß zunächst ebenfalls eine Rasensodenmauer mit einer Breite von 4,2m sowie mehreren Zwischentürmen. Davor lagen zwei Spitzgräben mit einer Breite von sieben Metern und einer Tiefe zwischen drei und 3,6m. Ausgerichtet war es mit der \\"porta praetoria\\" auf den westlich vorbeifließenden Neckar. Die Größe lässt sich mit 238×164m rekonstruieren, was einer Fläche von knapp vier Hektar entspricht., Um 90n.Chr. wurde die Rasensodenmauer durch eine 2,2m breite Steinmauer ersetzt. Teilweise war sie noch bis zu 1,8m hoch erhalten, die ursprüngliche Höhe dürfte bei 5,5m gelegen haben. Teile des Haupttores sind in einem archäologischen Fenster an der Sebastianskapelle freigelegt.

Nachdem die finanzielle Situation der Einrichtung zu Beginn äußerst angespannt war, verlegte sich das Mechanics’ Institute in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts auf die Ausrichtung von Gewerbe- und Industrieschauen in eigens zu diesem Zweck errichteten Ausstellungspavillons. Gleichzeitig stellte es seinen Mitgliedern zahlreiche Bildungsangebote zur Verfügung, unter denen Vorträge zu wissenschaftlichen und kulturellen Themen sowie die Bibliothek und der Schachklub eine besondere Rolle einnahmen. Von 1868, dem Gründungsjahr der Universität Berkeley, bis in die zweite Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts hatte das Mechanics’ Institute Mitsprache bei der Verwaltung der ältesten Universität Kaliforniens. Nachdem alle Gebäude des Mechanics’ Institutes im schweren Erdbeben des Jahres 1906 zerstört worden waren, verkauften seine Mitglieder in den Folgejahren Grundstücke im Herzen San Franciscos und gaben einen Neubau in der Post Street 57 in Auftrag, in dem die Einrichtung bis heute beheimatet ist., Zu den bekannten Mitgliedern des \\"San Francisco Mechanics’ Institute\\" gehören der Unternehmer Levi Strauss, die Schriftsteller Mark Twain und Jack London ebenso wie der Journalist und Schriftsteller Ambrose Bierce und weitere Persönlichkeiten San Franciscos. Der \\"Mechanics’ Institute Chess Club\\" erfreute sich zeit seines Bestehens zahlreicher Besuche internationaler Schachgrößen wie Johannes Hermann Zukertort, Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alexandrowitsch Aljechin und Max Euwe., Geschichte., Die Gründung im Jahr 1855., Als eine kleine Gruppe von Unternehmern am 11. Dezember 1854 in San Francisco zusammenkam, um über die Gründung einer Bildungseinrichtung für Erwachsene unter dem Namen „Mechanics’ Institute“ zu beraten, hatte sich der 1848 begonnene Kalifornische Goldrausch bereits merklich abgekühlt. San Franciscos Warenhäuser waren überfüllt, die Preise befanden sich im freien Fall und mehrere Bankhäuser mussten ihre Geschäfte einstellen. Rund die Hälfte der Einwohner der Stadt war arbeitslos. Die \\"Annals of San Francisco\\" vermerkten hierzu, San Francisco befinde sich „in einer Phase großer wirtschaftlicher Bedrängnis“. Angesichts der ungewissen Zukunft Kaliforniens schien die Förderung technischen Wissens eine gute Antwort auf die Frage danach zu sein, was ökonomisch nach dem Goldrausch kommen solle. Da das noch junge Kalifornien zu jener Zeit in großem Maße auf den teuren Import von Gütern aller Art angewiesen war, wurde dem Aufbau einer eigenen Landwirtschaft und Industrie eine besondere Bedeutung zugemessen. Wobei die dem Mechanics’ Institute zugrundeliegende Idee keineswegs neu war. Bereits 1821 hatte der Schotte George Birkbeck mit der Gründung der \\"School of Arts of Edinburgh\\" den Anfang für eine ganze Reihe von Mechanics’ Institutes gemacht, die sich im Verlauf des 19. Jahrhunderts in allen Teilen der englischsprachigen Welt verbreitet hatten., Im März 1855 nahm der Plan des \\"San Francisco Mechanics’ Institute\\" Gestalt an. Unter dem Vorsitz des Fabrikbesitzers Benjamin Haywood beschlossen die in der Stadthalle von San Francisco versammelten Unternehmer die Einrichtung einer Leihbibliothek. Die Bücher dieser Bibliothek sollten – was zu damaligen Zeiten durchaus nicht immer üblich war – allen Mitgliedern in frei zugänglichen Regalen zur Verfügung stehen. Zugleich sollten die Räumlichkeiten ausreichend Platz für Schachspiele bieten, vermutlich um den Mitgliedern zugleich Gelegenheit zum gegenseitigen Kennenlernen und zum Training ihrer geistigen Fähigkeiten zu bieten. Zur Finanzierung wurde eine Kapitalgesellschaft gegründet, deren Anteilspreis zunächst auf 25 Dollar festgesetzt wurde. Die jährliche Mitgliedsgebühr betrug 5 Dollar. Am 24. April 1855 wurde die Kapitalgesellschaft offiziell eingetragen und dieses Datum gilt bis heute als das Gründungsdatum des \\"San Francisco Mechanics’ Institute\\"., Finanzielle Schwierigkeiten: das erste Jahr., Während der Glaube an technischen Fortschritt und den Aufbau einer eigenständigen Wirtschaft Kaliforniens unter den Gründern des Mechanics’ Institute groß war, hielten sich die finanziellen Mittel der Einrichtung zunächst in engen Grenzen. Sechs Monate nach der Gründungsversammlung bezog das Mechanics’ Institute eigene Räumlichkeiten im \\"Express Building\\" an der nordöstlichen Ecke der im heutigen Finanzbezirk San Franciscos gelegenen Straßenkreuzung California und Montgomery. Der Buchbestand zählte drei Bände: eine Kopie der Verfassung der Vereinigten Staaten, eine Bibel und eine juristische Abhandlung zum Eigentumsrecht. An Finanzmitteln standen 300 Dollar zur Verfügung, wovon nach vier Monaten und der Anschaffung von 75 weiteren Bänden nur 125 Dollar übrig blieben. Schon ein Jahr nach seiner Gründung und einem zwischenzeitlichen Umzug in größere Räumlichkeiten ging dem Mechanics’ Institute das Geld aus., Der drohende Bankrott der noch jungen Einrichtung konnte allein durch die Verpflichtung der Schauspielerin Julia Dean Hayne (1830–1868) abgewendet werden, die sich 1856 bereit erklärte, die Einnahmen aus einer Aufführung des Theaterstückes \\"Madeleine, the Belle of Faubourg\\" an das Mechanics’ Institute zu spenden. Was die Schauspielerin zu diesem Schritt bewog, ist nicht bekannt. Gesichert ist allerdings, dass die Erlöse in einer Höhe von 1029 Dollar das Mechanics’ Institute für weitere zwölf Monate vor dem finanziellen Ruin bewahrten und es ihm sogar ermöglichten, weitere Bücher anzuschaffen., Gewerbe- und Industrieschauen., Als die Geldmittel des Mechanics’ Institute im Jahr 1857 erneut zur Neige gingen, entwickelten dessen Direktoren ein Konzept, das bis ins Jahr 1899 für die finanzielle Absicherung der übrigen Bildungsangebote sorgte. Nach dem Vorbild der Londoner \\"Great Exhibition\\" des Jahres 1851 und der New Yorker \\"Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations\\" des Jahres 1853 planten sie die erste große Gewerbe- und Industrieschau San Franciscos, die unter dem Titel \\"The First Industrial Exhibition of the Mechanics’ Institute of the City of San Francisco\\" am 7. September 1857 eröffnet werden sollte., In der Ankündigung dieser Veranstaltung hieß es:, Als Ausstellungsgelände hatte der reiche Unternehmer James Lick ein Grundstück zwischen den Straßen Post und Sutter am südwestlichen Ende der Stadt kostenfrei zur Verfügung gestellt. Für den Bau des Ausstellungsgebäudes brachten die Mitglieder des Mechanics’ Institute 7000 Dollar in Barmitteln, Baumaterialien und kurzfristigen Darlehen auf., Die erste Gewerbe- und Industrieschau San Franciscos dauerte 19 Tage und zeigte insgesamt 941 verschiedene Ausstellungsstücke, darunter Möbel, Sättel und Zaumzeug, Klaviere, Billardtische, Weintrauben der damals noch weitgehend unbekannten Rebsorte „Zinfandel“, Stücke versteinerter Bäume, ein Autograph Cotton Mathers sowie Lithografien, die ein gewisser E. J. Muygridge aus England importiert hatte. Aussteller erhielten Preise in 45 Kategorien. Am Abend eines jeden Tages unterhielt eine Kapelle die Besucher mit einem Konzert. Durch reges Besucherinteresse wurde die Ausstellung finanziell ein voller Erfolg: nach Abzug großzügiger Spenden an die beiden Waisenhäuser der Stadt und den Kosten für den Bau des Ausstellungsgebäudes blieben dem Mechanics’ Institute 2784 Dollar übrig., Angeregt durch den Erfolg dieser Unternehmung organisierte das Mechanics’ Institute bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts in verschiedenen, eigens für diesen Zweck errichteten Ausstellungsgebäuden, weitere Gewerbe- und Industrieschauen. Im Jahr 1899 fand die letzte Ausstellung statt, bei der das Mechanics’ Institute einen Verlust von 7600 Dollar erlitt. Damit war die Ära der regelmäßigen Gewerbe- und Industrieschauen in San Francisco beendet. Das zu jenem Zeitpunkt genutzte Ausstellungsgebäude wurde bis zu seiner Zerstörung im Erdbeben von 1906 für andere Zwecke, wie etwa der Austragung von Boxkämpfen, für Konzerte, oder als Rollschuhbahn verwendet., Mitsprache bei der Verwaltung der Universität Berkeley., Zu den zentralen Aufgaben eines jeden Mechanics’ Institutes gehörte die Ausrichtung von kostenfreien oder zu geringen Preisen angebotenen Vorträgen. Auch das \\"San Francisco Mechanics’ Institute\\" verpflichtete seit seiner Gründung bekannte Redner für solche Anlässe. Aufgrund der anhaltenden finanziellen Schwierigkeiten in den ersten Jahren waren solchen Initiativen zunächst jedoch enge Grenzen gesetzt. Dies änderte sich mit der Entdeckung von Silberlagerstätten in der Comstock Lode, die in den 1860er Jahren einen Silberrausch unweit der Grenze zwischen Nevada und Kalifornien auslöste. Durch den Zufluss von Kapital nach San Francisco und die Unterstützung von reichen Geschäftsleuten wie dem Unternehmer und Bankier William Ralston startete das Mechanics’ Institute im Jahr 1863 eine Reihe von Vorträgen, für das es Redner wie den Geologen Josiah D. Whitney oder den Sklaverei-Gegner Thomas Starr King gewinnen konnte., Als dann im Jahr 1868 die University of California gegründet wurde, garantierten deren Statuten dem Mechanics’ Institute ein Mitspracherecht, indem sie einem Mitglied des Mechanics’ Institute einen dauerhaften Sitz im Verwaltungsrat der Universität Berkeley einräumten. Andrew Smith Hallidie, zur damaligen Zeit Präsident des Mechanics’ Institute und später bekannt als „Vater der San Francisco Cable Cars“, gehörte zu den ersten sechs „ex-officio regents“ der Universität, die diese Rolle aufgrund ihres Amtes einnahmen und zu denen unter anderem auch der Gouverneur des Staates Kalifornien, dessen Stellvertreter sowie der Sprecher des kalifornischen Repräsentantenhauses gehörten. Das Mitspracherecht des Mechanics’ Institute an der ersten Universität Kaliforniens spiegelte dessen Bedeutung im kulturellen Leben der Stadt San Francisco wider., Wenngleich Hallidie den Campus der Universität Berkeley lieber in San Francisco anstatt an ihrem heutigen Standort im Osten der Bucht von San Francisco angesiedelt hätte, gab die enge Verzahnung zwischen der Universität und dem Mechanics’ Institute diesem die Gelegenheit, seine Rolle als Bildungseinrichtung zu stärken. Es hatte nicht allein Einfluss auf den Lehrplan der Universität, sondern war darüber hinaus auch in der Lage, bekannte Mitglieder der verschiedenen Fakultäten als Redner zu verpflichten. Über mehrere Jahrzehnte hinweg diente das 1866 errichtete Gebäude des Mechanics’ Institute in der Post Street als Außenstelle der staatlichen Universität in Berkeley. Vorlesungen von angesehenen Professoren wie dem Geologen Joseph LeConte, dem deutschstämmigen Agrarwissenschaftler Eugene Woldemar Hilgard und Ezra Carr, einem Freund John Muirs, zogen bis zu 500 Studenten: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Jahrhundert)], Theodor W. Adorno (geboren 11. September 1903 in Frankfurt am Main; gestorben 6. August 1969 in Visp, Schweiz; eigentlich Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund) war ein deutscher Philosoph, Soziologe, Musikphilosoph, Komponist und Pädagoge. Er zählt mit Max Horkheimer zu den Hauptvertretern der als Kritische Theorie bezeichneten Denkrichtung, die auch unter dem Namen Frankfurter Schule bekannt wurde. Mit Horkheimer, den er während seines Studiums kennengelernt hatte, verband ihn eine enge lebenslange Freundschaft und Arbeitsgemeinschaft., Adorno wuchs in großbürgerlichen Verhältnissen in Frankfurt auf. Als Kind erhielt er eine intensive musikalische Erziehung, und bereits als Schüler beschäftigte er sich mit der Philosophie Immanuel Kants. Nach dem Studium der Philosophie widmete er sich der Kompositionslehre im Kreis der Zweiten Wiener Schule um Arnold Schönberg und betätigte sich als Musikkritiker. Ab 1931 lehrte er zudem als Privatdozent an der Universität Frankfurt bis zum Lehrverbot 1933 durch die Nationalsozialisten. Sein Antrag auf Aufnahme in die Reichsschrifttumskammer wurde am 20. Februar 1935 abgelehnt., Während der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus emigrierte er in die USA. Dort wurde er Mitarbeiter des Instituts für Sozialforschung, bearbeitete einige empirische Forschungsprojekte, unter anderem über den autoritären Charakter, und schrieb mit Max Horkheimer die \\"Dialektik der Aufklärung\\". Nach seiner Rückkehr war er einer der Direktoren des in Frankfurt wiedereröffneten Instituts. Wie nur wenige Vertreter der akademischen Elite wirkte er als „öffentlicher Intellektueller“ mit Reden, Rundfunkvorträgen und Publikationen auf das kulturelle und intellektuelle Leben Nachkriegsdeutschlands ein und trug – mit allgemeinverständlichen Vorträgen – gewollt und mittelbar zur demokratischen \\"Reeducation\\" des deutschen Volkes bei., Adornos Arbeit als Philosoph und Sozialwissenschaftler steht in der Tradition von Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx und Sigmund Freud. Wegen der Resonanz, die seine schonungslose Kritik an der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft unter den Studenten fand, galt er bei Befürwortern und Kritikern als einer der geistigen Väter der deutschen Studentenbewegung. Obwohl er die Kritik der Studenten an den restaurativen Tendenzen der spätkapitalistischen Gesellschaft teilte, stand er dem Wirken der Studentenbewegung wegen deren Hang zu blindem Aktionismus und wegen ihrer Gewaltbereitschaft mit Befremden und Distanz gegenüber., Leben., Herkunft und Name., Adorno wurde 1903 in Frankfurt als Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund geboren. Er war das einzige Kind des Weingroßhändlers Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund (1870–1946) und der Sängerin Maria Calvelli-Adorno (1865–1952). Die katholische Mutter war Tochter eines korsischen Offiziers, der sich um 1860 als mittelloser Fechtmeister in der Freien Stadt Frankfurt niedergelassen hatte. Sie trat als ausgebildete Sängerin auch am kaiserlichen Hof in Wien, an der Wiener Oper und an den Stadttheatern Köln und Riga auf. Der Vater, Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund, stammte aus einer jüdischen Familie und gehörte zur Zeit der Geburt des Sohnes noch der mosaischen (jüdischen) Religion an, erst später konvertierte er zum Protestantismus., Die von Theodor vorgenommene Ergänzung des väterlichen Nachnamens um den Namen der Mutter soll ein Wunsch der Mutter gewesen sein, er erfüllte sich jedoch erst später. Während die ersten Veröffentlichungen noch mit „Wiesengrund“ gezeichnet waren, verwendete er in seiner publizistischen Tätigkeit früh den Doppelnamen „Wiesengrund-Adorno“. Eine Verkürzung auf „W. Adorno“ nahm er bei seinen Veröffentlichungen in der US-amerikanischen Emigration vor. Nach der formellen Einbürgerung als US-Bürger Ende 1943 lautete sein amtlicher Name „Theodore Adorno“. Seine Publikationen zeichnete er indes fortan mit Theodor W. Adorno., Frühe Frankfurter Jahre (bis 1924)., Als Kind wurde der Junge „Teddie“ gerufen. Er wuchs in der \\"Schönen Aussicht\\", Hausnummer 9, auf, einer Straße am Mainufer. Im Nebenhaus betrieb sein Vater eine Weinhandlung, zu der ein großes Weingut im Rheingau gehörte. 1914 zog die Familie in ein neu erbautes Haus im Stadtteil Oberrad in die Seeheimer Straße 19., Adorno wurde römisch-katholisch getauft und empfing die Erstkommunion. Auf Wunsch seiner gläubigen Mutter war er geraume Zeit auch als Ministrant tätig. Anders als etwa seine Jugendfreunde Leo Löwenthal und Erich Fromm, die sich in dem – in Frankfurt einflussreichen – Freien Jüdischen Lehrhaus betätigten, hatte er zur Religion seiner väterlichen Vorfahren keine besondere Beziehung. Ein engeres Verhältnis zum Judentum gewann er erst unter dem Eindruck des Völkermords an den Juden. Die mit den Adornos befreundete Publizistin Dorothea Razumovsky brachte es auf den Punkt: Nicht sein toleranter und assimilierter Vater, sondern Hitler habe ihn zum Juden gemacht., Im Haushalt der Familie lebte auch die Sängerin und Pianistin Agathe Calvelli-Adorno, eine unverheiratete Schwester seiner Mutter, die Adorno als seine „zweite Mutter“ bezeichnete. Adornos „überaus behütete Kindheit“ war vornehmlich geprägt von den beiden „Müttern“. Von ihnen erlernte er das Klavierspiel. Die Musik bildete den kulturellen Mittelpunkt der kosmopolitisch ausgerichteten, großbürgerlichen Familie. So zog seine Mutter mit der Partie des \\"Waldvögleins\\" aus Richard Wagners Oper \\"Siegfried\\" durch Europa. Adorno wurde mit der kammermusikalischen und symphonischen Literatur durch das Vierhändigspielen vertraut gemacht und konnte somit seine musikalische Kompetenz schon früh ausbilden. Er nahm neben dem Schulunterricht bei Bernhard Sekles Privatstunden in Komposition. Die Sommer verbrachte die Familie im Odenwaldidyll Amorbach; seitdem galt ihm Amorbach „als die Wirklichkeit gewordene Utopie […], mit der Welt eins zu sein“., Nachdem er zwei Klassen übersprungen hatte, bestand der „privilegierte Hochbegabte“ 1921 am Kaiser-Wilhelms-Gymnasium (heute Freiherr-vom-Stein-Schule) in Frankfurt bereits mit 17 Jahren das Abitur als Jahrgangsbester. Als Primus erlebte er Ressentiment und Feindseligkeit, die eine solche Begabung auf sich ziehen kann. So erlitt er im Gymnasium Quälereien derjenigen, die „keinen richtigen Satz zustande brachten, aber jeden von mir zu lang fanden“ (GS 4: 219f)., Philosophisch geschult wurde er durch seinen 14 Jahre älteren Freund Siegfried Kracauer, den er bei einer Freundin seiner Eltern kennengelernt hatte. Kracauer war ein bedeutender Feuilletonredakteur der \\"Frankfurter Zeitung\\". In einem Brief an Leo Löwenthal gestand er, zu seinem jüngeren Freund „eine unnatürliche Leidenschaft“ zu empfinden und sich für „geistig homosexuell“ zu halten. Gemeinsam lasen sie über Jahre hinweg regelmäßig an Samstagnachmittagen Immanuel Kants \\"Kritik der reinen Vernunft\\", eine Erfahrung, die nach Adornos Selbstzeugnis für ihn prägend war: „Nicht im leisesten übertreibe ich, wenn ich sage, daß ich dieser Lektüre mehr verdanke als meinen akademischen Lehrern“ (GS 11: 388). Als Abiturient las er fasziniert die gerade erschienenen Bücher \\"Die Theorie des Romans\\" von Georg Lukács und \\"Geist der Utopie\\" von Ernst Bloch. Im Gymnasium erlernte er Latein, Griechisch und Französisch; später in der Emigration kam Englisch hinzu., An der Universität Frankfurt belegte er ab 1921 Philosophie, Musikwissenschaft, Psychologie und Soziologie; zur gleichen Zeit begann er seine Tätigkeit als Musikkritiker. Philosophie hörte er bei Hans Cornelius, Soziologie bei Gottfried Salomon-Delatour und Franz Oppenheimer. In der Universität traf er 1922 in einem Seminar auf Max Horkheimer, mit dem er theoretische Anschauungen teilte und Freundschaft schloss. Auch mit Walter Benjamin, den er durch Vermittlung Kracauers als Student kennengelernt hatte, pflegte er eine enge und dauerhafte Freundschaftsbeziehung. Das Studium absolvierte er sehr zügig: Ende 1924 schloss er es mit einer Dissertation über Edmund Husserls Phänomenologie mit summa cum laude ab. Die Arbeit, die er im Geist seines Lehrers Cornelius abfasste, enthielt reine Schulphilosophie, die noch wenig von Adornos späterem Denken ahnen ließ., Aus der Geschäftsbeziehung zwischen der Frankfurter Weinhandlung Oscar Wiesengrund und der Berliner Fabrik für Lederverarbeitung Karplus &amp; Herzberger entwickelte sich ein freundschaftliches Verhältnis zwischen den Eigentümer-Familien beider Firmen. Zwischen dem temperamentvollen jungen „Teddie“ Wiesengrund und der Berlinerin Margarete (Rufname: Gretel) Karplus kam es zu einer Liebesbeziehung, die zu einer lebenslangen Bindung führen sollte., Aufenthalt in Wien (1925–1926)., Im März 1925 zog Adorno nach Wien, der Geburtsstätte der Zwölftonmusik, wo er sich ein Zimmer in der Pension „Luisenheim“ im 9. Bezirk nahm. Bei Alban Berg, dem Schüler Arnold Schönbergs, begann er ein Aufbaustudium in Komposition und bei Eduard Steuermann nahm er gleichzeitig Klavierunterricht. Adorno hatte Alban Berg anlässlich der Uraufführung seiner \\"Drei Bruchstücke für Gesang und Orchester aus Wozzeck\\" 1924 in Frankfurt kennengelernt. Der aus Polen stammende Steuermann, der die meisten Klavierwerke Schönbergs uraufgeführt hatte, war der maßgebliche Pianist der Zweiten Wiener Schule, mit deren Begründer er ebenfalls zusammentraf. Adorno schätzte Schönberg als „revolutionären Veränderer der überlieferten Kompositionsweise“. Dessen Zwölftonkompositionen würdigte er später (1949) in der \\"Philosophie der neuen Musik\\". Persönlich jedoch entwickelte sich eine „wechselseitige Antipathie“ zwischen beiden. Schönberg hielt Adornos „Schreibstil für manieriert, die musiktheoretische Begriffsbildung für zu unverständlich“ und glaubte, dass dies der Neuen Musik in der öffentlichen Wirkung schade. Adornos musikästhetische Wertschätzung und persönliche Sympathie galten vor allem Alban Berg, zu dem er eine freundschaftliche Beziehung pflegte, die sich bis zu dessen frühem Tod (1935) in einem intensiven Briefwechsel niederschlug. Später veröffentlichte er über ihn die Monographie \\"Berg. Der Meister des kleinsten Übergangs\\" (1968)., Schon im ersten Jahr seines Aufenthalts in Wien verfasste er Aufsätze über Werke von Berg und Schönberg. Er setzte damit seine bereits als Student aufgenommene musikkritische Tätigkeit fort, die er 1928 mit dem Eintritt in die Redaktion der musikalischen Avantgarde-Zeitschrift \\"Anbruch\\" fundieren konnte.

Some of them include: 1. The Swahili Civilization: The Swahili people, predominantly located along the East African coast, were known for their thriving maritime trade networks. Cities such as Kilwa, Mombasa, and Sofala became important trading centers, connecting Africa with the Indian Ocean region and the Arab world. 2. The Mali Empire: Situated in West Africa, the Mali Empire, particularly under the rule of Mansa Musa (1312-1337), had significant maritime influence. The empire had access to important trade routes, including the trans-Saharan trade, allowing them to expand their influence across land and sea. 3. The Ghana Empire: Although it reached its peak in the 9th century, the Ghana Empire continued to have a presence along West Africa's coast in the 10th-12th centuries. They were active in international trade, connecting West Africa with North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. 4. The Almohad Empire: This Islamic movement, originating in Morocco, ruled a vast territory in North Africa and southern Spain during the 12th century. While they were primarily land-based, they also held maritime power and controlled important ports in the Mediterranean. 5.

Hintergrund der weitgehend von Freiwilligen getragenen Züge war einerseits das Bestreben, die nach finnischer Auffassung stammverwandten Karelier in einem Großfinnland zusammenzuführen, andererseits das Ziel einer leichter zu verteidigenden Ostgrenze. Die zahlenmäßig schwachen Expeditionstrupps scheiterten unter anderem daran, dass die örtliche Bevölkerung sich nicht in dem erhofften Maße für einen Anschluss ihrer Siedlungsgebiete an Finnland begeistern ließ. Die Feindseligkeiten zwischen Finnland und Sowjetrussland wurden 1920 durch den Frieden von Dorpat beendet., Hintergründe., Finnland, das seit 1809 als autonomes Großfürstentum zum Russischen Reich gehört hatte, erlangte im Fahrwasser der Oktoberrevolution 1917 die staatliche Unabhängigkeit. Dieser Prozess wurde von schweren inneren Konflikten begleitet, die in einen am 27. Januar 1918 ausgebrochenen Bürgerkrieg mündeten. In diesem standen die „Roten“– sozialistische, von den russischen Bolschewiki gestützte Revolutionäre– den bürgerlichen „Weißen“ gegenüber, welche bis zum Mai 1918 den Aufstand niederschlugen., Obwohl die Beteiligten auf beiden Seiten in erster Linie Finnen waren, betrachtete die bürgerliche Seite den Krieg weniger als Bürgerkrieg denn als Freiheitskrieg zur Sicherung der Unabhängigkeit vom revolutionären Russland. Indessen beschränkten nicht alle Weißen die Ziele dieses so als finnisch-russischen Konflikt empfundenen Zusammenstoßes auf die Beseitigung der revolutionären Kräfte aus dem Gebiet des alten Großfürstentums. Schon seit der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts hatte im Zuge des Erwachens eines finnisch-nationalen Bewusstseins auch der irredentistische Gedanke eines Großfinnlands Fuß gefasst. Kern dieser Stammverwandtschaftsströmung war die Auffassung, dass die jenseits der Grenze lebenden Völker Ostkareliens aufgrund ihrer Kultur, ihrer Sprache und ihres Charakters mit Finnland eine natürliche Einheit bilden und damit auch zum gleichen Staat gehören sollten., Verwoben mit den nationalen Motiven waren militärische Überlegungen: Die Lage des jungen Staates erschien mittelfristig gefährdet, die lange Grenze im Osten bei etwaigen Rückeroberungsversuchen durch ein wiedererstarktes Russland schwer zu verteidigen. Durch die Angliederung der ostkarelischen Gebiete hätte eine nur halb so lange sogenannte Drei-Landengen-Grenze zwischen dem Finnischen Meerbusen, dem Ladogasee, dem Onegasee und dem Weißmeer erreicht werden können. Juho Kusti Paasikivi, von Mai bis November 1918 Vorsitzender des finnischen Senats, hielt den Erwerb Ostkareliens für geradezu lebensnotwendig für Finnland., Besonderen Schwung erhielten die großfinnischen Bestrebungen, als der Oberbefehlshaber der Weißen, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, am 23. Februar 1918 in einer Ansprache an die weißen Truppen mit großer Öffentlichkeitswirkung seinen sogenannten Schwerteid sprach:, Unterdessen war die politische und militärische Lage in Russland chaotisch. Die deutsche Offensive im Februar 1918 führte zum Zusammenbruch der russischen Verteidigung und zwang die bolschewistische Staatsführung zum Friedensvertrag von Brest-Litowsk. Dies veranlasste die ehemals verbündeten Ententemächte zu militärischen Interventionen in Russland. Im Juni 1918 landete ein britisches Kontingent in Murmansk, insbesondere um die strategisch wichtige Murmanbahn zu sichern. Infolge der Erhebung der antibolschewistischen Kräfte im Inneren Russlands im Mai 1918 entbrannte der Bürgerkrieg, der bis 1920 andauern sollte, in voller Härte., Kriegszüge 1918., Im Jahr 1918 unternahmen finnische Truppen drei zeitlich parallele, aber in ihrer Natur, ihren Protagonisten und ihrem Verlauf sehr unterschiedliche Kriegsexpeditionen über die finnische Ostgrenze. Die Vorbereitungen für diese Züge begannen noch während des andauernden Bürgerkrieges und wurden durch ihn teilweise bedingt. Nach dem Ausbruch des Bürgerkrieges waren zahlreiche Rotgardisten aus dem von den Weißen beherrschten Mittel- und Nordteil Finnlands über die Grenze nach Russland geflohen. Gemeinsam mit den russischen Bolschewiki bildeten sie dort eine Gefahr für das Hinterland des weißen Finnland. Gemeinsam mit den großfinnischen Strömungen wurde diese Gefahr zur Triebfeder für einige Aktivisten, nun den Anschluss Ostkareliens an Finnland herbeizuführen. Die politische und militärische Führung des Landes stützte die Pläne, wenn sie auch reguläre Truppen wegen der anhaltenden Kämpfe des Bürgerkrieges kaum bereitstellte., Bildung der Expeditionen., Der südlichste der drei Kriegszüge in das südliche Weißkarelien wurde initiiert und angeführt von Oberstleutnant Carl Wilhelm Malm, der ein inniger Anhänger des finnischen Stammverwandtschaftsgedanken war. In Absprache mit der militärischen Führung unter Mannerheim bildete er seine rund 370 Mann starke Truppe in erster Linie aus Freiwilligen aus der Region Kuopio und gab ihr den Namen „Truppen Weißkareliens“ (\\"Vienan-Karjalan joukot\\"). Die Teilnehmer des Zuges trugen an ihrem rechten Arm ein weißes Band mit der Aufschrift „Für Karelien“. Es war offensichtlich, dass die nach Weißkarelien entsandten Truppen für eine militärische Eroberung des Gebietes nicht ausreichen würden. Stattdessen zählten die Initiatoren darauf, dass die karelische Bevölkerung, ermutigt durch die finnische Intervention, sich zum Aufstand erheben und so den Anschluss an Finnland ermöglichen würde. So führte die Gruppe 2.000 Gewehre und Munition mit sich, um sie an die Karelier zu verteilen, die sich der Truppe anschließen würden., Weiter nördlich formte sich eine Kriegstruppe unter der Führung des Jägerleutnants Kurt Martti Wallenius. Anders als Malm ging Wallenius nicht davon aus, dass die Karelier den Finnen mit fliegenden Fahnen zulaufen würden, hielt aber eine schnelle Säuberung des nördlichen Weißkareliens und möglichst noch weiterer Gebiete von den finnischen Rotgardisten für militärisch unabdingbar. Da für die Operation in der zur Verfügung stehenden Zeit nicht genügend Freiwillige angeworben werden konnten, stellte Mannerheim auch 500 Wehrpflichtige ab, denen es allerdings sowohl an Ausbildung als auch an ideologischer Zuverlässigkeit fehlte. Aus den Wehrpflichtigen und Freiwilligen aus dem Schutzkorps Österbotten wurde schließlich bis Ende März 1918 eine 1.200 Mann starke Truppe gebildet., Die dritte, nördlichste Expedition machte es sich zur Aufgabe, das Gebiet Petschenga an Finnland anzugliedern und dem Land damit einen Zugang zum Nördlichen Eismeer zu verschaffen. Eine Übergabe dieses Gebietes war bereits 1864 unter Zar Alexander II. diskutiert worden. Erst Anfang März hatte Lenin den Abgesandten des Volkskommissariats des roten Finnlands die Abtretung des Gebiets versprochen, aber das Thema interessierte naturgemäß auch die Weißen. Die offiziellen Truppen unter Wallenius erhielten jedoch keine Erlaubnis, auch nach Petschenga vorzudringen, da die finnische Regierung einen Konflikt mit den in Murmansk gelandeten britischen Interventionstruppen fürchtete. Anfang April 1918 gab der Senat dann die Erlaubnis zur Bildung einer zwar inoffiziellen, aber von der Armee mit Waffen ausgerüsteten Unternehmung. Die Truppe wurde geführt von zwei Zivilisten ohne jede Kriegserfahrung, dem Naturwissenschaftler Thorsten Renvall und dem Arzt Onni Laitinen. Auch unter den rund 100 Teilnehmern des Zuges befanden sich keine Offiziere., Militärische Vorstöße., Die Truppe von Oberstleutnant Malm überschritt, aus Suomussalmi anrückend, am 21. März 1918 im Parademarsch als erste die Grenze. Sie rückte zunächst über Woknawolok nach Uchta, der größten Siedlung der Region vor, ohne auf Widerstand zu stoßen. Am 10. April unternahm sie einen unzureichend vorbereiteten Vorstoß auf Kem, das als an der Murmanbahn gelegene Hafenstadt am Weißen Meer einen wichtigen Verkehrsknoten darstellte. Der Angriff wurde von bolschewistischen Kämpfern leicht zurückgeschlagen. Malms Soldaten zogen sich nach Uchta zurück, wo sie für mehrere Monate in militärischer Passivität verharrten. Die karelische Bevölkerung verhielt sich den „Befreiern“ gegenüber skeptisch bis gleichgültig und schloss sich den finnischen Truppen trotz intensiver Propagandaarbeit nicht an. Die langen Kämpfe des Weltkrieges hatten die Karelier kriegsmüde gemacht. Einen besonderen Wunsch nach einem Anschluss an Finnland verspürten sie überdies nicht, eher standen die Finnen in Verdacht, die Naturschätze Kareliens – unter ihnen reiche Erzvorkommen und große Waldflächen – ausbeuten zu wollen. Die bolschewistische Herrschaft wurde zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht als Bedrohung empfunden., Die von Wallenius geführten Truppen wurden in zwei Teile geteilt. Etwa 500 Mann kommandierte Wallenius selbst mit dem Stützpunkt am See Paanajärvi in der Gemeinde Kuusamo, 700 Mann unterstanden dem Befehl von Jägeroberleutnant Oiva Willamo mit dem Stützpunkt in Kuolajärvi. Schon vor dem Eintreffen der Wehrpflichtigen begann die Abteilung Willamos am 21. März erfolgreich mit der Säuberung des Grenzgebietes auf finnischer Seite von roten Kampfeinheiten. Am 31. März erhielt Wallenius vom Hauptquartier die Erlaubnis zum Grenzübertritt. Während Malms Truppen aus begeisterten Stammverwandtschaftskriegern bestanden, protestierten hier die Wehrpflichtigen gegen ihre Verwendung außerhalb Finnlands. Die Angriffsoperationen wurden durch diesen Unwillen spürbar beeinträchtigt, später kam es sogar zu offenem Aufruhr und Befehlsverweigerung., Wallenius und Willamo überschritten am 3. April jeweils die Grenze. Erstes strategisches Ziel war das Dorf Sokolosero, das auf der Landenge zwischen zwei Seen ein wichtiges Tor in das Innere Weißkareliens darstellte. Willamo nahm von Norden anrückend das Dorf Tumtscha ein, scheiterte aber beim Vormarsch auf Ruwaniski am Widerstand der Roten Garden und musste sich schließlich wieder nach Finnland zurückziehen. Wallenius’ Versuch der Einnahme Sokoloseros von Süden schlug an diesem Tag ebenso fehl wie in einem zweiten Anlauf am 8. April. Weiter nördlich wurde am 7. April ein Vorstoß in Richtung des: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1. Europäische Geschichte 2.

Diese Elektronentheorie wurde vor allem von Hendrik Antoon Lorentz und Henri Poincaré entwickelt und danach durch die zwar mathematisch äquivalente, aber in der Interpretation der Raumzeit wesentlich tiefer gehende spezielle Relativitätstheorie von Albert Einstein und Hermann Minkowski abgelöst., Problemstellung., Die Annahme eines ruhenden Äthers scheint dem Ergebnis des Michelson-Morley-Experiments zu widersprechen, bei dem der Nachweis einer Bewegung der Erde relativ zu diesem Äther scheiterte. In der lorentzschen Äthertheorie wird dieser Widerspruch über die Einführung von Lorentz-Transformationen aufgelöst. Dabei werden jedoch die Längenkontraktion und Zeitdilatation als Prozesse verstanden, denen relativ zu einem Äther bewegte Maßstäbe und Uhren unterworfen sind, während Raum und Zeit unverändert bleiben. Damit werden diese Effekte als asymmetrisch betrachtet, das heißt, bewegte Maßstäbe sind tatsächlich kürzer und Uhren gehen tatsächlich langsamer. Ein bewegter Beobachter schätzt ruhende Maßstäbe zwar in identischer Weise als kürzer und ruhende Uhren als langsamer ein, diese Einschätzung wird jedoch als Täuschung interpretiert, da sie der bewegte Beobachter unter Verwendung verfälschter Maßstäbe und Uhren gewinnt. Die Symmetrie der Beobachtungen und damit die offensichtliche Gültigkeit eines scheinbaren Relativitätsprinzips wird als Folge einer eher zufälligen Symmetrie der zugrunde liegenden dynamischen Prozesse interpretiert. Sie verhindert jedoch die Möglichkeit, die eigene Geschwindigkeit relativ zum Äther zu bestimmen, und macht ihn damit zu einer prinzipiell unzugänglichen Größe in der Theorie. Solche Größen sollten laut einem von Ockham ausgesprochenen Sparsamkeitsprinzip (\\"„Occam’s razor“\\") möglichst vermieden werden, was ein Grund ist, warum diese Theorie als überholt gilt und kaum noch vertreten wird., In der speziellen Relativitätstheorie sind Längenkontraktion und Zeitdilatation dagegen eine Folge der Eigenschaften von Raum und Zeit und nicht von materiellen Maßstäben und Uhren. Die Symmetrie dieser Effekte ist eine Folge der Gleichwertigkeit der Beobachter, die als Relativitätsprinzip der Theorie zugrunde liegt. Alle Größen der Theorie sind experimentell zugänglich., Historische Entwicklung., Grundkonzept., Äther und Elektronen., Die lorentzsche Äthertheorie, die hauptsächlich zwischen 1892 und 1906 von Lorentz und Poincaré entwickelt wurde, beruhte auf der Weiterentwicklung von Augustin Jean Fresnels Äthertheorie, den Maxwell-Gleichungen und der Elektronentheorie von Rudolf Clausius. Lorentz führte eine strikte Trennung zwischen Materie (Elektronen) und Äther ein, wobei in seinem Modell der Äther völlig unbewegt ist und von bewegten Körpern nicht mitgeführt wird. Max Born identifizierte den Lorentz-Äther dann überhaupt mit dem absoluten Raum Isaac Newtons. Der Zustand dieses Äthers kann im Sinne der Maxwell-Lorentz’schen Elektrodynamik durch das elektrische Feld \\"E\\" und das magnetische Feld \\"H\\" beschrieben werden, wobei diese Felder als von den Ladungen der Elektronen verursachte Anregungszustände bzw. Vibrationen im Äther aufgefasst wurden. Hier tritt also ein abstrakter elektromagnetischer Äther an die Stelle der älteren mechanischen Äthermodelle. Im Gegensatz zu Clausius, der annahm, dass die Elektronen durch Fernwirkung aufeinander wirken, nahm Lorentz als Vermittler zwischen den Elektronen ebendieses elektromagnetische Feld des Äthers an, in dem sich Wirkungen maximal mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit ausbreiten können. Lorentz konnte aus seiner Theorie beispielsweise den Zeeman-Effekt theoretisch erklären, wofür er 1902 den Nobelpreis erhielt. Joseph Larmor entwarf ungefähr gleichzeitig mit Lorentz (1897, 1900) eine ähnliche Elektronen- oder Äthertheorie, welche jedoch auf einem mechanischen Äther beruhte., Korrespondierende Zustände., Ein fundamentales Konzept der Theorie war das 1895 von Lorentz eingeführte „Theorem der korrespondierenden Zustände“ für Größen zu formula_1 (d.h. für Geschwindigkeiten, die gering sind im Vergleich zur Lichtgeschwindigkeit), aus dem folgt, dass ein im Äther \\"bewegter\\" Beobachter annähernd dieselben Beobachtungen in seinem „fiktiven“ Feld macht wie ein im Äther \\"ruhender\\" Beobachter in seinem „realen“ Feld. Dieses Theorem wurde von Lorentz (1904) für alle Größenordnungen erweitert und in Übereinstimmung mit dem Relativitätsprinzip von Poincaré (1905, 1906) und Lorentz (1906, 1916) komplettiert., Längenkontraktion., Eine große Herausforderung für diese Theorie war das 1887 durchgeführte Michelson-Morley-Experiment. Nach den Theorien von Fresnel und Lorentz hätte mit diesem Experiment eine Relativbewegung zum Äther festgestellt werden müssen, die Ergebnisse waren jedoch negativ. Albert A. Michelson selbst vermutete, dass das Ergebnis für eine vollständige Mitführung des Äthers spreche, doch andere Versuche, die Aberration und die Maxwell-Lorentz’sche Elektrodynamik waren mit einer vollständigen Mitführung kaum vereinbar., Eine Lösung deutete sich an, als Oliver Heaviside 1889 die maxwellsche Elektrodynamik weiterentwickelte und bemerkte, dass das elektrostatische Feld um einen bewegten, kugelförmigen Körper in Bewegungsrichtung um den Faktor formula_2 verkürzt sei (der sogenannte Heaviside-Ellipsoid). Dem folgend schlugen George Francis FitzGerald (1889) (allerdings nur qualitativ) und unabhängig von ihm Lorentz 1892 (bereits quantitativ ausgearbeitet) vor, dass nicht nur die elektrostatischen, sondern auch die molekularen Kräfte während der Bewegung durch den Äther auf allerdings unbekannte Weise derart beeinflusst werden, dass die in Bewegungsrichtung liegende Interferometeranordnung um den angenäherten Faktor formula_3 kürzer ist als der senkrecht dazu stehende Teil. Lorentz selbst schlug 1895 verschiedene Möglichkeiten vor, um die relative Verkürzung herbeizuführen:, Die Lorentzkontraktion der im Äther gemessenen Länge \\"l0\\" in Bewegungsrichtung (ohne Expansion senkrecht dazu) mit dem präzisen Faktor gemäß formula_4 wurde erst später von Larmor (1897) und Lorentz (1904) angegeben: Ein mit der Erde mitbewegter Beobachter würde von dieser Kontraktion, die im Falle der Bewegung der Erde um die Sonne nur 1/200.000.000 beträgt, nichts bemerken, da alle Maßstäbe ebenso von diesem Effekt betroffen sind., Obwohl der Zusammenhang zwischen elektrostatischen und intermolekularen Kräften keineswegs notwendig war und die Theorie ziemlich bald als „ad hoc“ und von Lorentz selbst als „seltsam“ bezeichnet wurde, konnte Lorentz zumindest den Zusammenhang mit der Verkürzung elektrostatischer Felder als Plausibilitätsargument zugunsten der Hypothese anführen. Wichtig dabei ist, dass diese Kontraktion nur den Abstand zwischen den Elektronen, nicht jedoch die Elektronen selbst betraf, deswegen wurde die ursprüngliche Kontraktionshypothese auch als „Intermolekularhypothese“ bezeichnet. Die Elektronen selbst wurden von Lorentz erst 1904 in die Kontraktion mit einbezogen. Für die Weiterentwicklung der Kontraktionshypothese siehe den Abschnitt Lorentz-Transformation., Ortszeit., Ein wichtiger Teil des Theorems der korrespondierenden Zustände war die von Lorentz 1892 und 1895 eingeführte Ortszeit formula_5, wo \\"t\\" die Zeitkoordinate ist, welche ein im Äther ruhender Beobachter benutzt, und \\"t \\" der Wert ist, den ein zum Äther bewegter Beobachter benutzt. (Wobei Woldemar Voigt bereits 1887 im Zusammenhang mit dem Dopplereffekt und einem inkompressiblen Medium ebenfalls dieselbe Ortszeit verwendete). Aber während für Lorentz die Längenkontraktion ein realer, physikalischer Effekt war, bedeutete für ihn die Ortszeit vorerst nur eine Vereinbarung oder nützliche Berechnungsmethode. Mit Hilfe der Ortszeit und dem mathematischen Formalismus seiner korrespondierenden Zustände konnte Lorentz die Aberration des Lichts, den Dopplereffekt und die bei dem Fizeau-Experiment gemessene Abhängigkeit der Lichtgeschwindigkeit in bewegten Flüssigkeiten erklären, ohne eine „teilweise Mitführung“ des Äthers (im Sinne der Äthertheorie Fresnels) annehmen zu müssen. Jedoch wurde vorerst nicht erkannt, dass aus der Ortszeit die Existenz der Zeitdilatation folgt. Dies wurde von Larmor 1897 definiert, als er durch Kombination der Ortszeit mit dem Faktor formula_2 feststellte, dass periodische Vorgänge von bewegten Objekten im Äther langsamer als bei ruhenden Objekten abliefen. Das ergab sich dann auch aus der Arbeit von Lorentz 1899, der erkannte, dass wenn man die Vibrationen eines bewegten, oszillierenden Elektrons auf die mathematische Ortszeit bezog, diese scheinbar langsamer verlaufen., Anders als Lorentz sah Poincaré in der Ortszeit mehr als einen mathematischen Kunstgriff. So schrieb er 1898 in einem philosophischen Aufsatz:, 1900 interpretierte er dann die Ortszeit als \\"Ergebnis\\" einer mit Lichtsignalen durchgeführten Synchronisation. Er nahm an, dass zwei im Äther bewegte Beobachter A und B ihre Uhren mit optischen Signalen synchronisieren. Da sie glauben, sich in Ruhe zu befinden, gehen sie von der Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindigkeit aus. Deshalb müssen sie nur noch die Lichtlaufzeiten berücksichtigen und ihre Signale kreuzen, um zu überprüfen, ob ihre Uhren synchron sind. Hingegen aus Sicht eines im Äther ruhenden Beobachters läuft eine Uhr dem Signal entgegen, und die andere läuft ihm davon. Die Uhren sind also nicht synchron, sondern zeigen nur die Ortszeit formula_5 an. Da die Beobachter aber kein Mittel haben zu entscheiden, ob sie in Bewegung sind oder nicht, werden sie von dem Fehler nichts bemerken. 1904 illustrierte er dieselbe Methode auf folgende Weise: A sendet zum Zeitpunkt 0 ein Signal nach B, welche bei der Ankunft \\"t\\" anzeigt. Und B sendet zum Zeitpunkt 0 ein Signal nach A, welche bei der Ankunft \\"t\\" anzeigt. Wenn in beiden Fällen \\"t\\" denselben Wert ergibt, sind die Uhren synchron. Daher verstand Poincaré im Gegensatz zu Lorentz die Ortszeit genauso wie die Längenkont: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, Relativitätstheorie, Äthertheorie, Elektronentheorie, Lorentz-Transformationen, Längenkontraktion, Zeitdilatation, spezielle Relativitätstheorie, Michelson-Morley-Experiment, Theorem der korrespondierenden Zustände"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Eishockeyverein (National Hockey League), Gegründet 1990, Organisation (San José, Kalifornien), San Jose Sharks, Sportverein (Kalifornien)], Die San Jose Sharks (IPA: ) sind ein US-amerikanisches Eishockeyfranchise der National Hockey League aus San José im Bundesstaat Kalifornien. Es wurde am 9. Mai 1990 gegründet und nahm zum Beginn der Saison 1991/92 den Spielbetrieb auf. Die Teamfarben sind Dunkelpazifik-Türkis, Schwarz, Dunkelorange und Weiß. Aufgrund ihrer im amerikanischen Vereinssport populären Teamfarben ist die Mannschaft auch als \\"„Team Teal“\\" bekannt., Die Sharks tragen ihre Heimspiele im SAP Center aus und sind eines der ersten Franchises, die aus der Ligaerweiterung der 1990er-Jahre hervorgingen. Nach einem schwierigen Start in die als spielstärkste Eishockeyliga der Welt geltende NHL durchlebte das nordkalifornische Franchise im Laufe der 1990er-Jahre Höhen und Tiefen, bis es sich zu Beginn des neuen Jahrtausends unter den besten Mannschaften der Liga etablierte. Der Gewinn des prestigeträchtigen Stanley Cups blieb dem Team bisher verwehrt., Geschichte., Eishockey in der Bay Area., Bis 1967 bestand die National Hockey League aus sechs Teams, den \\"Original Six\\", die im Norden, Osten und Landesinneren Nordamerikas angesiedelt waren. In diesem Jahr entschied sich die NHL, die Liga um sechs Teams zu erweitern, um neue Regionen zu erschließen, die der Eishockeysport ansprechen könnte. Obwohl Kalifornien nicht unbedingt als guter Markt für Eishockey galt, wurde ein Franchise in der San Francisco Bay Area angesiedelt. Das Team trug zunächst den Namen California Seals –später auch Oakland Seals und California Golden Seals– und hatte in den folgenden Jahren weder sportliche noch wirtschaftliche Erfolge zu verzeichnen. Nach neun Jahren wurde das Team 1976 an die Geschäftsleute George und Gordon Gund verkauft, die das Team nach Cleveland im US-Bundesstaat Ohio umsiedelten, wo es den Namen Cleveland Barons annahm. Nach zwei weiteren Jahren ohne sportliche Erfolge entschieden sich die Gund-Brüder ein weiteres NHL-Team zu kaufen, die finanziell angeschlagenen Minnesota North Stars. Sie fusionierten beide Teams, die fortan unter dem Namen der North Stars auftraten. Nach einigen Jahren hatten die Brüder den Wunsch das Team zurück in die Bay Area nach Kalifornien zu verlegen, jedoch verweigerte die NHL die Zustimmung. Allerdings machte die Liga das Angebot, dass die Brüder Gund ein neues Franchise in der Bay Area ansiedeln könnten und einige Spieler der North Stars, die an einen neuen Besitzer verkauft werden sollten, mit in das neue Team nehmen dürften. Damit wurde die Fusion der Minnesota North Stars und der Cleveland Barons von 1978 rückgängig gemacht., Schwieriger Start (1990 bis 1993)., Im Mai 1990 wurden die North Stars an den neuen Besitzer verkauft und die Gebrüder Gund erhielten den Zuschlag für ein neues Franchise im kalifornischen San José. In einer Abstimmung unter zukünftigen Fans und aktuellen Unterstützern sollte der Beiname des Teams festgelegt werden. Auf Platz eins landete „Blades“ (dt. etwa \\"Klinge\\", \\"Messer\\"), doch die Brüder waren damit nicht zufrieden, da das Wort negative Aspekte beinhaltete. Der zweitplatzierte Name wurde schließlich ausgewählt und das Team bekam den Namen „San Jose Sharks“ (dt. \\"Haie\\"), wodurch eine Assoziation zum Pazifischen Ozean hergestellt wurde, da im Bereich der Bay Area mehrere Haiarten heimisch sind. Das erste Farmteam der Sharks, die Kansas City Blades, trug jenen von den Besitzern abgelehnten Beinamen., Am 30. Mai 1991 nahm der Kader San Joses die ersten Konturen an. Im NHL Dispersal Draft wurden die von den Draft-Regularien ungeschützten Spieler aus dem System von Minnesota offiziell zwischen den North Stars und den Sharks aufgeteilt, und die Kader der Teams durch Spieler aus dem folgenden Expansion Draft aufgefüllt. Des Weiteren durften sich die Sharks im NHL Entry Draft, der drei Wochen nach dem Dispersal Draft stattfand, und im NHL Supplemental Draft erstmals die Rechte an jungen Talenten sichern. Mit ihrem ersten Wahlrecht im Entry Draft an der zweiten Position der ersten Runde wählten sie Pat Falloon aus und mit ihrem zweiten Pick an Gesamtposition 23 in der zweiten Runde Ray Whitney. Im Supplemental Draft wählten sie als Gesamtersten den Kanadier Jeff McLean und an siebter Position Mark Beaufait., Die Saison 1991/92 begann und die Sharks starteten –wie bei Expansion Teams üblich– mit einem sportlich schwach besetzten Kader ohne große Namen in ihr erstes Jahr. Als Trainer hatte die Klubführung den Kanadier George Kingston verpflichtet. Ihre Heimspiele trugen sie zunächst im Cow Palace in Daly City, etwas außerhalb von San Francisco, aus, da in San José noch keine geeignete Halle zur Verfügung stand. Im ersten NHL-Spiel am 4. Oktober 1991 unterlag das Team den Vancouver Canucks mit 3:4 Toren. Craig Coxe erzielte dabei, auf Vorlage von Mark Pavelich, das erste Tor in der Franchise-Geschichte. Der erste Sieg gelang vier Tage später in einem Heimspiel gegen die Calgary Flames. Kelly Kisio erzielte drei Minuten vor Spielende den Siegtreffer zum 4:3. Wie so oft bei Expansion Teams, verlief die erste Saison insgesamt unbefriedigend. Die Mannschaft gewann lediglich 17 von 80 Spielen. Die Saison beendeten sie als punktschlechtestes Team der gesamten Liga., Die darauffolgende Spielzeit verlief sportlich schlechter als die vorangegangene, da den Sharks in 84 Spielen nur elf Siege gelangen. Dem standen 71 Niederlagen gegenüber, die einen neuen NHL-Negativrekord bedeuteten, woraufhin die Klubführung Cheftrainer Kingston entließ. Nur den Ottawa Senators, die sich in ihrer ersten Saison befunden hatten, erging es noch ein wenig schlechter, da sie zehnmal gewannen. Später bezichtigten die Sharks der Mannschaft aus Ottawa, Spiele bewusst verloren zu haben, um in dem im Sommer stattfindenden NHL Entry Draft vom Recht des ersten Draft-Picks zu profitieren und Alexandre Daigle auszuwählen. Um diesem Verhalten Einhalt zu gewähren, führten die Ligaoffiziellen zum NHL Entry Draft 1995 ein Lotteriesystem ein., Erste Erfolge (1993 bis 1995)., Ab der Saison 1993/94, zu der die San Jose Arena –heute bekannt als SAP Center– eröffnet wurde, trugen die Sharks ihre Spiele in San José aus. Unter dem neuen Trainer Kevin Constantine präsentierten sich die Sharks auf sportlicher Ebene runderneuert. Vor Saisonbeginn hatte das Franchise weltweit für Aufsehen gesorgt. Nachdem die Vereinsführung im NHL Waiver Draft im Oktober 1992 Igor Larionow unter Vertrag genommen hatte, war es ihr im Sommer gelungen, mit Sergei Makarow, einen weiteren Spieler der \\"„KLM-Reihe“\\" zu verpflichten. Larionow, der bis dahin noch kein Spiel für San Jose bestritten hatte, unterzeichnete daraufhin ebenfalls einen Vertrag. Gemeinsam mit dem Schweden Johan Garpenlöv bildeten sie die sogenannte \\"„OV-Reihe“\\"., Zum Ende der regulären Saison erreichte die Mannschaft 82 Punkte. Da sich diese Wertung im Vorjahr auf 24 Punkte summiert hatte, erzielte die Mannschaft mit ihrer Steigerung um 58 Punkte die größte Verbesserung zwischen zwei Spielzeiten und somit einen neuen NHL-Rekord. Die Sharks belegten den achten Platz der Western Conference und qualifizierten sich somit erstmals für die Play-offs. Dort trafen sie in der ersten Runde auf die in der Setzliste an erster Position stehenden Detroit Red Wings. Die Sharks bezwangen diese im entscheidenden siebten Spiel der Serie. In der nächsten Runde spielten die Sharks gegen die Toronto Maple Leafs. Nach fünf Spielen führte San Jose in der Serie mit 3–2. Im sechsten Spiel stand es nach 60Minuten 2:2 und das Spiel ging in die Overtime. Johan Garpenlöv traf die Torlatte der Maple Leafs und versäumte es daher, San Jose in die nächste Runde zu schießen. Kurz darauf erzielten die Maple Leafs den Siegtreffer. Im siebten Spiel gewann erneut Toronto und die Nordkalifornier schieden aus., Aufgrund des Lockouts spielte die NHL in der Saison 1994/95 einen verkürzten Spielplan mit lediglich 48 Begegnungen. Die Sharks zogen erneut in die Playoffs ein und schlugen in der ersten Runde die Calgary Flames im siebten und entscheidenden Spiel in der zweiten Verlängerung. In der zweiten Runde endeten die Playoffs für das Team. Die Detroit Red Wings revanchierten sich mit einem 4–0-Sweep für die Niederlage aus dem Vorjahr. Die wichtigsten Stützen des Teams waren zu dieser Zeit Torhüter Artūrs Irbe, Verteidiger Sandis Ozoliņš und die Stürmer Igor Larionow und Sergei Makarow. Im März 1995 wurde das erste und bisher einzige Spiel der NHL-Geschichte wegen Regens abgesagt. Der Guadalupe River, der durch San José fließt, war wegen starker, anhaltender Regenfälle über seine Ufer getreten. Damit war es unmöglich, in die San Jose Arena zu gelangen, um das Spiel zwischen den Sharks und den Detroit Red Wings vor Ort zu verfolgen., Rückschläge und Umstrukturierung (1995 bis 1999)., Die folgende Saison 1995/96 verlief nicht so erfolgreich wie die vorangegangenen und San Jose verpasste nach zwei Jahren erstmals wieder die Playoffs. Makarow hatte das Team vor Saisonbeginn verlassen und so gab der Verein im Oktober 1995, nach einem unter den Erwartungen liegenden Saisonstart, den 36-jährigen Larionow nach Detroit und Ozoliņš nach Colorado ab. Im Gegenzug erhielten die Nordkalifornier Ray Sheppard aus Detroit und Owen Nolan aus Colorado, der während seiner Zeit in San José zum Führungsspieler des Teams avancieren sollte. Der Neuaufbau beinhaltete auch den Austausch von Trainer Constantine, der während der Spielzeit durch Jim Wiley ersetzt wurde. Nach der Saison erhielt Torhüter Irbe, der wegen einer Verletzung lange gefehlt hatte, die Freigabe den Verein zu wechseln und bekam keinen neuen Vertrag., Vor der Saison 1996/97 verpflichteten die San Jose Sharks den Stürmer Tony Granato, der in der Vorsaison eine schwere Kopfverletzung erlitten hatte, ebenso wie Al Sims als neuen Trainer. Dennoch gelang ihnen der Einzug in die Endrunde nicht, obwohl sie kurz vor dem Ende der Wechselfrist mit Ed Belfour einen Torhüter mit großer Playoff-Erfahrung unter Vertrag genommen hatten. Mit 27 Siegen beendete die Mannschaft die reguläre Saison wie im Vorjahr auf dem letzten Platz der Pacific Division. Der Höhepunkt der Saison war die Austragung des NHL All-Star Games in der heimischen San Jose Arena, dessen Gastgeber die Sharks bereits in der verkürzten Spielzeit 1994/95 hätten sein sollen. An diesem nahmen mit Granato und Nolan, dem in diesem Spiel ein Hattrick gelang, zwei Vertreter der Sharks teil. Granato gelang es zudem als erstem Spieler der Franchise-Geschichte, mit einem der NHL Awards ausgezeichnet zu werden. Er erhielt die Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy für sein erfolgreiches Comeback nach der Kopfverletzung., Zu Beginn der Saison 1997/98 stellte die Vereinsführung Darryl Sutter als neuen Trainer vor und verpflichtete mit Mike Vernon einen erfahrenen Torhüter, der wenige Monate zuvor die Detroit Red Wings zum Gewinn des Stanley Cups geführt hatte. Außerdem wählte sie mit Patrick Marleau an der zweiten Gesamtposition im NHL Entry Draft 1997 einen talentierten Spieler aus. Mit Marco Sturm schloss sich ein junger deutscher Spieler dem Team an. Die Umstrukturierungen lohnten sich, da das Team wieder die Playoffs erreichte, allerdings scheiterte es in der ersten Runde an den Dallas Stars., Im Jahr darauf, in dem die Sharks die Saisonauftaktpartie in der japanischen Hauptstadt Tokio gegen die Calgary Flames bestritten, erreichte San Jose trotz einer negativen Bilanz als Siebter in der Western Conference die Playoffs.

Er ist in Zentralasien und Teilen der Arabischen Halbinsel beheimatet und zählt neben dem Fennek zu den kleinsten Vertretern dieser Gruppe. Er lebt in trockenen Gebirgsregionen bis in 2000 Meter Höhe sowie in Wüsten- und Steppengebieten. Der Fuchs ernährt sich vor allem von Insekten und nutzt darüber hinaus zu einem großen Anteil Früchte und andere pflanzliche Nahrungsquellen., Gesicherte Angaben zur Bestandsgröße oder zur Bestandsentwicklung gibt es nicht. Der Afghanfuchs wird jedoch aufgrund des großen Verbreitungsgebietes und der derzeit fehlenden ernsthaften Gefährdungen von der International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) als „nicht gefährdet“ (\\"\\") eingestuft., Merkmale., Allgemeine Merkmale., Afghanfüchse erreichen nach Geffen et al. 1994 in iranisch-afghanischen Regionen sowie in Oman eine Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von 40 bis 50 Zentimetern, Sillero-Zubiri 2009 gibt eine Kopf-Rumpf-Länge für den Fuchs von 38,5 bis 80Zentimeter bei den Männchen und 38,5 bis 76,5Zentimeter bei den Weibchen an. Nach Geffen et al. 2004 sind die Füchse in den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten mit einer durchschnittlichen Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von 74,4 Zentimetern bei den Männchen und 71,1 Zentimetern bei den Weibchen deutlich größer als die Individuen in Israel. Die Länge des Schwanzes beträgt nach Sillero-Zubiri 2009 bei den Männchen 26 bis 35,5 Zentimeter und bei den Weibchen 29 bis 35 Zentimeter, nach Geffen 1994 33 bis 41 Zentimeter. Die Tiere wiegen etwa ein Kilogramm, wobei eine Spanne von rund 0,8 bis 1,5 Kilogramm besteht. Ein Sexualdimorphismus ist bei dieser Art nicht stark ausgeprägt, die Männchen sind in der Regel nur etwa 3 bis 6 % größer., Afghanfüchse haben ein weiches, an der Oberseite graubraun gefärbtes Fell mit einer schwarzen Rückenlinie, die von den Schultern bis über den Schwanz reicht, die Bauchseite ist weiß bis gelblich-weiß. Das Winterfell ist sehr weich und dicht mit einer dunklen Unterwolle und weist im Gegensatz zum Sommerfell eine weiße Sprenkelung auf; es dient gemeinsam mit einer etwas dickeren Fettschicht zur Wärmeisolation im kalten und trockenen Winter. Der Schwanz ist nahezu gleich lang wie der Körper und sehr buschig. Er gleicht in seiner Färbung dem Rückenfell und besitzt nahe der Basis einen schwarzen Fleck, der die Violdrüse markiert, sowie in der Regel eine schwarze – seltener eine weiße – Spitze. Die Füße sind vorderseitig blass gelblich-weiß und rückseitig dunkelgrau; die schwarzen Fußballen sind im Gegensatz zu denen anderer Füchse der Region unbehaart, und die Krallen sind katzenartig gekrümmt., Das Gesicht des Fuchses ist sehr schmal mit einer spitz zulaufenden Schnauze. Es ist graubraun-orange und besitzt eine charakteristische schwarze Zeichnung von den vorderen Augenwinkeln bis zur Oberlippe. Die Iris ist sehr dunkel und setzt sich nur leicht von der Pupille ab. Die Ohren sind mit 6,5 bis 7,0 Zentimetern Länge etwas kürzer als die des Fennek, sie sind jedoch wie beim Fennek im Verhältnis zur Kopfform sehr prominent. Die Ohren sind blassbraun mit langen weißen Haaren am Rand., In Größe und Aussehen ähnelt der Afghanfuchs somit vor allem dem nahe verwandten Fennek (\\"Vulpes zerda\\"). Von den anderen Füchsen der arabischen Wüstenregionen unterscheidet sich der Afghanfuchs vor allem durch seinen langen und buschigen Schwanz, der im Verhältnis zur Gesamtlänge bei dieser Art deutlich länger ist als beim Rüppellfuchs (\\"Vulpes rueppelli\\"; um 6,8 % länger), beim Rotfuchs (\\"Vulpes vulpes\\"; um 9,8 % länger) und vor allem beim Fennek (um 22,5 % länger). Die Länge der Hinterbeine ist dagegen verglichen mit denen der anderen Arten in Relation zur Körperlänge kürzer, und die relative Ohrlänge liegt zwischen der des Rotfuchses und der Ohrlänge der anderen Arten., Schädel- und Skelettmerkmale., Der Schädel hat eine Basallänge von etwa 94 Millimetern sowie eine maximale Breite im Bereich der Jochbögen von etwa 49 Millimetern. Im Bereich des Hirnschädels ist er etwa 35 Millimeter breit. Der Schädel ist damit etwas größer als der des Fenneks und kleiner als der des Rüppellfuchses, im Vergleich zu beiden ist die Schnauze jedoch deutlich schmaler, mit langen und schmalen Nasenbeinen. Auch der Hirnschädel ist vergleichsweise schmal und besitzt nur einen wenig ausgeprägten Kamm. Die Paukenblase ist ebenfalls etwas kleiner als die des Rüppellfuchses., Die Zahnreihe im Oberkiefer ist etwa 41 Millimeter und im Unterkiefer etwa 45 Millimeter lang. Der Fuchs besitzt pro Oberkieferhälfte drei Schneidezähne (Incisivi), einen Eckzahn (Caninus), vier Vorbackenzähne (Praemolares) sowie zwei Backenzähne (Molares) und pro Unterkieferhälfte drei Schneidezähne, einen Eckzahn, vier Vorbackenzähne und drei Backenzähne. Insgesamt besitzen die Tiere somit 42 Zähne., Der Penisknochen (Baculum) des Afghanfuchses entspricht mit einer Länge von etwa 41,5 Millimeter dem des Rüppellfuchses, ist jedoch etwas breiter und weist eine vergrößerte Spitze auf., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Bis in die 1980er Jahre glaubte man, dass der Afghanfuchs nur in Zentralasien vorkommt, wo er in Afghanistan, Nordostiran, Turkmenistan und Belutschistan verbreitet ist. 1981 wurde die Art in Israel entdeckt, wo sie in den südlichen Landesteilen relativ häufig ist. Auch auf der Sinai-Halbinsel in Ägypten, Oman, Saudi-Arabien, Jordanien, dem Jemen und den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten wurden weitere Vorkommen entdeckt, sodass sich sein Verbreitungsgebiet – wenn auch zerstückelt – auch über große Teile der Arabischen Halbinsel erstreckt. Im Irak wurde der Afghanfuchs erst im Oktober 2020 mit Hilfe einer Kamerafalle nachgewiesen., Sein Lebensraum sind trockene, zerklüftete Gebirgsregionen bis in 2000 Meter Höhe, manchmal ist er auch in Wüsten und Steppen zu finden. Im Nahen Osten sind die Füchse auf bergige Wüstenbereiche beschränkt und bewohnen steile, felsige Hänge, Schluchten und Klippen. In Israel nutzen die Füchse vor allem ausgetrocknete Bach- und Flussläufe als Lebensraum., Lebensweise., Die Kenntnisse über die Lebensweise des Afghanfuchses sind sehr beschränkt und stammen vor allem aus Forschungsprojekten in Israel. Über Unterschiede und Eigenheiten der Tiere in den zentralasiatischen Verbreitungsgebieten liegen dagegen kaum Daten vor., Afghanfüchse bewohnen ein Revier von durchschnittlich 1,6 Quadratkilometern Größe, das von einem monogamen Paar bewohnt wird und sich nur an den Rändern mit Territorien anderer Tiere überlappt. In etwa drei von fünf Revieren lebt ein zweites Weibchen aus dem Wurf des Vorjahrs und wird von den Revierinhabern geduldet. Die Tiere sind strikt nachtaktiv und weichen damit den tagsüber jagenden Greifvögeln aus, tagsüber schlafen sie in Höhlen oder Felsspalten. Die Aktivität beginnt in der Regel direkt nach dem Sonnenuntergang und dauert etwa 8 bis 9 Stunden; in dieser Zeitspanne legen sie zur Nahrungssuche sieben bis elf Kilometer in einem Bereich von durchschnittlich 1,1 Quadratkilometern Größe zurück. Die Füchse sind dabei in der Regel allein und nur selten in Paaren unterwegs. Ein signifikanter Unterschied im Verhalten von Männchen und Weibchen oder saisonale Unterschiede konnten bislang nicht beobachtet werden. Anders als die meisten anderen Füchse können Afghanfüchse in felsigen Gegenden klettern und überwinden auch größere Abstände durch weite und bis über drei Meter hohe Sprünge. Den vergleichsweise langen Schwanz nutzen die Tiere dabei wahrscheinlich zur Balance, und die nackten Fußballen sowie die katzenartig gekrümmten Krallen geben ihnen Halt auf der Felsoberfläche., Die Baue der Füchse bestehen in der Regel aus natürlichen Höhlen und Steinhaufen in felsigen Berghängen, die Tiere graben keine eigenen Baue. Sie werden vor allem im Frühjahr zur Aufzucht der Jungtiere genutzt, im restlichen Jahr dienen sie tagsüber als Versteck und Ruheplatz. Während die Paare im Winter und Frühjahr ihre Baue häufig gemeinsam nutzen, können sie im Sommer und Herbst unabhängig voneinander mehrere Unterschlüpfe nutzen und wechseln diese auch häufiger., Ernährung., Afghanfüchse sind in stärkerem Ausmaß Pflanzenfresser als die meisten anderen Füchse. Zu ihrer Nahrung zählen vorwiegend Insekten wie Käfer, Heuschrecken, Ameisen und Termiten sowie verschiedene Früchte und andere Pflanzenteile. Zu letzteren gehören vor allem Kapern des Echten Kapernstrauchs (\\"Capparis spinosa\\") und \\"Capparis cartilaginea\\", Früchte wie Weintrauben, Datteln der Echten Dattelpalme (\\"Phoenix dactylifera\\") und Melonen sowie Pflanzenmaterial von \\"Ochradenus baccatus\\", \\"Fagonia mollis\\" und verschiedener Süßgräser. Nur selten verzehren sie auch kleine Wirbeltiere; entsprechende Überreste konnten bei Kotuntersuchungen nur in etwa 10 % aller Proben nachgewiesen werden., Die Nahrungssuche erfolgt in der Regel einzeln, seltener als Paar. Bei Beobachtungen waren die Tiere in 92 % aller Fälle allein auf Nahrungssuche. Beutejagd und Nahrungssuche bestehen vor allem darin, dass die Füchse ihre Beute zumeist zwischen und unter Steinen suchen und gelegentlich auch graben. Bei schnelleren oder fliegenden Beutetieren kommt es zu kurzen Sprüngen oder Sprints. Afghanfüchse beziehen ihren Flüssigkeitsbedarf aus der Nahrung und müssen kein Wasser trinken, daher ist ihr Lebensraum nicht abhängig von oberflächlich zugänglichen Wasservorkommen., Fortpflanzung und Entwicklung., Afghanfüchse leben in monogamen Paaren zusammen. Die Weibchen sind nur einmal im Jahr fruchtbar, in Israel im Januar bis Februar. Die Paarungen erfolgen entsprechend in der Zeit von Dezember bis Februar. Nach einer Tragzeit von 50 bis 60 Tagen bringt das Weibchen ein bis drei Jungtiere zur Welt. Die Jungtiere besitzen ein weiches, schwarzes Fell und haben ein Geburtsgewicht von etwa 30 Gramm. Die Weibchen besitzen während der Jungenaufzucht zwei bis sechs laktierende Zitzen und stillen die Jungtiere über 30 bis 45 Tage, bevor sie entwöhnt werden. Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt erhalten sie keine zusätzliche Nahrung und sind allein von der Muttermilch abhängig. Nach etwa zwei Monaten gehen die Jungtiere gemeinsam mit einem Elterntier auf die Nahrungssuche,: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Hunde, Afghanfuchs, Königfuchs, Raubtierart, Echte Füchse, Zentralasien, Arabische Halbinsel, Fennek, Früchte, pflanzliche Nahrungsquellen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Amtssprache der Europäischen Union, Einzelsprache, Finnische Sprache], Finnisch (Eigenbezeichnung \\"suomi\\" oder \\"suomen kieli\\") gehört zum ostseefinnischen Zweig der finno-ugrischen Sprachen, die eine der beiden Unterfamilien des Uralischen darstellen. Damit ist es eng mit dem Estnischen verwandt und entfernt mit dem Ungarischen. Finnisch ist neben Schwedisch eine der beiden Amtssprachen in Finnland mit etwa 4,9 Millionen Muttersprachlern (89 % der Bevölkerung, im Jahr 2015). Es ist eine der Amtssprachen in der EU. In Schweden, wo es von ca. 300.000 Menschen gesprochen wird, ist Finnisch als offizielle Minderheitensprache anerkannt. Es gibt kleine finnischsprachige Minderheiten in der nordnorwegischen Finnmark, in der nordwestrussischen Republik Karelien und in Estland., Das Finnische unterscheidet sich als finno-ugrische Sprache erheblich von den indogermanischen Sprachen, zu denen der Großteil der in Europa gesprochenen Sprachen gehört. Der jahrhundertelange Sprachkontakt hat aber im Gebiet der Syntax und des Wortschatzes zu einer gewissen Annäherung des Finnischen an die umliegenden indogermanischen Sprachen geführt. Zu den Besonderheiten der finnischen Sprache gehören der agglutinierende Sprachbau, die große Anzahl (15) an Kasus, eine komplexe Morphophonologie (Vokalharmonie, Stufenwechsel), das Fehlen des grammatikalischen Geschlechts und ein konsonantenarmer Lautbestand., Sprachverwandtschaft., Das Finnische gehört zur Familie der finno-ugrischen Sprachen, die zusammen mit der kleinen Gruppe der samojedischen Sprachen die uralische Sprachfamilie bilden., Während die meisten in Europa gesprochenen Sprachen der indogermanischen Sprachfamilie angehören, zählen zu den finno-ugrischen Sprachen neben dem Finnischen noch die estnische, die samische und die ungarische Sprache sowie eine Reihe von im europäischen Russland und in Nordsibirien gesprochenen Sprachen., Die Verwandtschaft zwischen den verschiedenen Sprachen dieser Familie lässt sich vielfach über die grammatischen Formen nachweisen, während der Wortschatz zuweilen wenige Ähnlichkeiten aufweist. So sind die Urformen des Finnischen und Ungarischen schon seit vielen Jahrtausenden getrennt, und die Verwandtschaft ist nicht näher als die Beziehung zwischen entfernten indogermanischen Sprachen wie Deutsch und Persisch., Die nächsten Verwandten des Finnischen sind das Estnische, Ischorische, Karelische, Livische, Võro, Wepsische und das Wotische; sie bilden zusammen mit dem Finnischen die Gruppe der ostseefinnischen Sprachen, die als ganze wiederum dem Samischen gegenübersteht., Geschichte., Frühgeschichte., Die Zeiträume der frühen Entwicklungsvorgänge lassen sich nur mit großer Schwierigkeit bestimmen, da dies nur durch Rekonstruktion aus der Analyse von Wortschatz und Grammatik der heutigen Sprachen geschehen kann. Es wird jedoch angenommen, dass die Herausbildung des frühen Ostsee-Finnischen mit der Trennung vom Samischen spätestens um 1000 v.Chr. abgeschlossen war. Das Finnische stand bereits in prähistorischer Zeit mit germanischen und baltischen Sprachen im Kontakt und übernahm aus ihnen zahlreiche Lehnwörter., Obwohl die Bewohner des heutigen Finnlands durchweg finno-ugrische Sprachen sprachen, entwickelte sich eine gemeinsame finnische Sprache erst in der Neuzeit. In der vorangegangenen Zeit waren die Bewohner Finnlands in drei Hauptstämme aufgeteilt, die sprachlich wie kulturell erhebliche Unterschiede aufwiesen. Im Südwesten lebte die später als die „eigentlichen Finnen“ \\"(varsinaissuomalaiset)\\" bezeichnete Bevölkerungsgruppe. In dieser Region hatten sich germanischstämmige Zuwanderer aus Skandinavien mit der Bevölkerung vermischt und viele germanische Lehnwörter mitgebracht. Im Osten lebten die Karelier und in den Wäldern des Binnenlandes die Hämeer, die sich anfangs wahrscheinlich noch nicht stark von den Samen unterschieden. Aus einer Vermischung der letztgenannten Bevölkerungsgruppen entstand später, aber noch vor dem Mittelalter, der Savo-Dialekt., Entwicklung der Schriftsprache., Die Entstehung einer einheitlichen finnischen Sprache, insbesondere der finnischen Schriftsprache, wurde begünstigt durch die Reformation. König Gustav Wasa brach 1524 die Beziehungen zur katholischen Kirche ab und ordnete die Übernahme der lutherischen Lehren an. Zu diesen gehörte es das Wort Gottes in der Sprache des Volkes zu verkünden. In der Folge begannen die Pfarrer die notwendigen liturgischen Texte schriftlich aufzuzeichnen., Die Veröffentlichung der ersten gedruckten Texte in finnischer Sprache geht auf das Werk des späteren Bischofs Mikael Agricola zurück. Der Schüler Martin Luthers begann bereits während seiner Studienzeit mit der Übersetzung religiöser Texte, insbesondere des Neuen Testaments. Das erste gedruckte finnische Buch war die spätestens 1543 veröffentlichte „Fibel“ \\"Abckiria\\", die sich in erster Linie an Geistliche richtete und einen Katechismus enthielt. Die finnische Übersetzung des Neuen Testaments erschien 1548., Agricola schuf eine Rechtschreibung auf Grundlage des Lateinischen, Deutschen und Schwedischen und legte die Grundlagen für eine finnische Schriftsprache. Er benutzte in erster Linie den in der Gegend von Turku gesprochenen Dialekt, der zur Grundlage der sich entwickelnden gemeinsamen finnischen Sprache wurde., Von der Bauernsprache zur Kultursprache., Nach der Schaffung einer Schriftsprache blieb die schriftliche Verwendung des Finnischen über Jahrhunderte rudimentär. Ab dem 16.Jahrhundert wurden Gesetze teilweise auf Finnisch geschrieben, ein finnischsprachiges kulturelles Leben gab es jedoch nicht. Im zu Schweden gehörenden Finnland war Schwedisch die Sprache der Verwaltung, der Bildung und der Kultur., Erst nachdem Finnland 1809 als Großfürstentum Finnland unter die Herrschaft des russischen Zaren gekommen war, begann sich ein finnisches Nationalbewusstsein zu entwickeln. Es formierte sich eine als „Fennomanen“ bezeichnete Bewegung, die die finnische Sprache zur Kultursprache entwickeln wollte. Im frühen 19.Jahrhundert fehlten der Sprache hierfür aber noch alle Voraussetzungen. Die Grammatik war nie systematisch erfasst worden, und der Wortschatz spiegelte das Alltagsleben der bäuerlichen Landbevölkerung wider, entbehrte aber fast aller für Verwaltungs- und Kulturzwecke erforderlichen Vokabeln., Das 1835 von Elias Lönnrot veröffentlichte Nationalepos \\"Kalevala\\" bestärkte die Rolle der finnischen Sprache. Durch die Aktivitäten der Fennomanen entstand eine finnischsprachige Literatur und Presse. Viele, muttersprachlich meist schwedischsprachige, Angehörige der gebildeten Oberschicht arbeiteten an einer Weiterentwicklung der finnischen Sprache. In diesem Zusammenhang wurden zahlreiche Wörter geschaffen, die in der finnischen Sprache nicht existiert hatten. Den Idealen der finnischen Nationalbewegung folgend, wurden die neuen Wörter dieser Zeit fast ausnahmslos nicht durch Lehnwörter, sondern gänzlich neu gebildet, oft durch Abwandlungen alter finnischer Wörter., Der in der zweiten Hälfte des 19.Jahrhunderts begonnene Aufbau eines finnischsprachigen Schulwesens führte bis zur Jahrhundertwende dazu, dass sich eine gebildete finnischsprachige Bevölkerungsschicht entwickelte. Bis zum zweiten Jahrzehnt des 20.Jahrhunderts hatte sich Finnisch zu einer Kultursprache entwickelt, die im Wesentlichen dem heutigen Finnischen entspricht., Rechtschreibung und Aussprache., Bedingt durch die Entstehungsgeschichte der finnischen Schriftsprache ist das finnische Alphabet identisch mit dem des Schwedischen. Es besteht aus den 26 Buchstaben des lateinischen Alphabets, ergänzt um die Sonderzeichen å, ä und ö. Bei der alphabetischen Sortierung, z.B. in Wörterbüchern, werden die Umlaute in der genannten Reihenfolge am Ende des Alphabetes eingeordnet, nicht wie im Deutschen bei a und o. Der Buchstabe w, der insbesondere in älteren Texten oft frei mit dem gleichklingenden Buchstaben v ausgetauscht wird, wird dagegen bei der Sortierung meist nicht von letzterem unterschieden. Das ü, das etwa in deutschen und estnischen Namen vorkommt, wird identisch zum y einsortiert., Die Buchstaben c, q, w, x, z und å kommen in finnischen Wörtern nicht vor, treten aber zuweilen in Fremdwörtern auf, insbesondere das å auch in den in Finnland häufig vorkommenden schwedischen Namen. Die Buchstaben b und f kommen nur in Lehnwörtern vor. Teilweise wird bei Lehnwörtern für den Laut ein S mit Hatschek (š) verwendet. Es kann durch sh oder einfach s ersetzt werden (z.B. \\"šakki\\", \\"shakki\\" oder \\"sakki\\" „Schach“). Noch seltener ist die stimmhafte Entsprechung ž, die bei geographischen Bezeichnungen wie \\"Fidži\\" vorkommt., Das Finnische hat eine fast völlig phonematische Orthographie; das heißt, die Zuordnung von Phonemen (Lauten) und Graphemen (Buchstaben) ist eindeutig. Lehnwörter werden konsequent an die finnische Orthographie angepasst (z.B. \\"filosofia\\" „Philosophie“). Bei folgenden Buchstaben unterscheidet sich der Lautwert vom Deutschen:, Zu den wenigen Ausnahmen in der Kongruenz von Buchstabe und Lautwert gehören die Buchstabenkombinationen nk und ng, die [] und [] gesprochen werden. Ferner wird ein vor einem p stehendes n durchgängig als m ausgesprochen (z.B. in \\"kunpa\\" gesprochen \\"kumpa\\", aber auch in \\"haen pallon\\" gesprochen \\"haem pallon\\"). Nach bestimmten Typen von Wörtern tritt bei der Aussprache eine Verdopplung des Anfangskonsonanten des nachfolgenden Wortes oder Wortteiles auf, so nach auf -e endenden Wörtern (\\"tervetuloa\\", gesprochen \\"tervettuloa\\") oder nach verneinten Verben (\\"en juo maitoa\\", gesprochen \\"en juom maitoa\\"). Beginnt das folgende Wort mit einem Vokal, tritt an die Stelle der Konsonantenverdopplung ein Glottisverschlusslaut., In der finnischen Aussprache spielt der Unterschied von langen und kurzen Lauten eine zentrale Rolle. Dieser Unterschied spiegelt sich konsequent in der Schreibweise wider, indem lange Laute durch Doppelbuchstaben dargestellt werden. Dies betrifft sowohl Vokale als auch Konsonanten (\\"tuli\\" „Feuer“; \\"tulli\\" „Zoll“; \\"tuuli\\" „Wind“). Die langen Laute sind in der Regel exakt doppelt so lang wie der einfache Laut. Dabei ist die Qualität der Vokale unabhängig von ihrer Quantität. Anders als im Deutschen wird z.B. o stets gesprochen, unabhängig davon, ob es lang oder kurz ist. Die Verlängerung der Konsonanten k, p und t geschieht in der Weise, dass der jeweilige Verschlusszustand für kurze Zeit aufrechterhalten wird., Im Finnischen wird stets die erste Silbe eines Wortes betont. Daneben liegt ab der dritten Silbe auf jeder zweiten: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Amtssprache, Europäische Union, Einzelsprache, Finnische Sprache, ostseefinnischer Zweig, finno-ugrische Sprachen, Uralischen, Estnischen, Ungarischen, Schwedisch, Finnland, Muttersprachlern"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Edgar Degas, Gemälde (19. Jahrhundert), Musée d’Orsay, Werk der Porträtmalerei], Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas ist der Titel eines Gemäldes von Edgar Degas. Es ist in Öl auf Leinwand gemalt und hat eine Höhe von 54,5cm und eine Breite von 39,5cm. Das um 1871–1872 entstandene Doppelporträt zeigt den aus Katalonien stammenden Tenor Lorenzo Pagans bei einem Gesangs- und Gitarrenvortrag. Seitlich hinter ihm sitzt als Zuhörer Auguste de Gas, der Vater des Malers. Das Gemälde gehört zu einer Reihe von Musikerporträts, die Degas ab Ende der 1860er Jahre malte. Es befindet sich in der Sammlung des Musée d’Orsay in Paris., Bildbeschreibung., Das Gemälde \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\" ist ein Doppelbildnis in einem Innenraum. Als zentrale Figur sitzt in der Bildmitte der spanische Sänger Lorenzo Pagans frontal dem Bildbetrachter gegenüber, rechts hinter ihm hat Auguste de Gas, der Vater von Edgar Degas, Platz genommen. Beide Männer tragen jeweils einen dunklen Anzug, dunkle Schuhe und ein weißes Oberhemd. Bei Pagans ist zudem eine dunkle Krawatte und am linken Revers eine Boutonnière zu sehen. Er sitzt in der Haltung eines Gitarrenspielers mit übereinander geschlagenen Beinen auf einem einfachen Holzstuhl. Pagans hat das Instrument auf die Oberschenkel gestützt, die rechte Hand auf dem Korpus zum Spiel der Saiten gelegt und mit der linken Hand den Gitarrenhals umgriffen. Das helle Holz der Gitarre und perlmuttartige Einlegearbeiten am Schallloch und am Korpusrand heben sich kontrastreich von Pagans dunklem Anzug ab. Ein am Gitarrenkopf geknotetes dunkelgrünes Band ist hingegen kaum wahrzunehmen. Der Musiker hat seinen Kopf leicht zum rechten Bildrand geneigt und scheint mit den dunklen Augen einen Punkt rechts außerhalb des Bildes zu fixieren. Der Mund ist halb geöffnet, sodass der Eindruck entstehen kann, Pagans trage gerade ein Lied vor. Das Gesicht von Pagans hat einen gesunden hellen Teint. Auffallend ist ein breiter dunkler Schnurrbart, dessen Enden zu Spitzen gezwirbelt sind. Das dunkle, leicht gelockte Kopfhaar ist zu einer kurzen Frisur geschnitten, bei der die Ohren frei bleiben., Im Gegensatz zum jungen Sänger Pagans ist der schräg hinter ihm sitzende Auguste de Gas ein vom Alter gezeichneter Mann. Seine Haltung ist durch den nach vorn geneigten Oberkörper, den nach unten gerichteten Kopf und die vor den Knien ineinander gefalteten Hände gekennzeichnet. Das Gesicht ist im Halbprofil dargestellt. Die Enden eines grauen Schnurrbarts zeigen nach unten, eine hohe Stirn verdeutlicht das schüttere Haar. Edgar Degas stellt seinen Vater als aufmerksamen Zuhörer dar, der gedankenverloren nach unten blickt. Seine Rolle tritt hinter der des Sängers Pagans zurück, der dieses Doppelbildnis eindeutig dominiert., Während Edgar Degas die Gesichter, die Hände und die Gitarre in genauer Beschreibung ausgeführt hat, sind andere Bereiche des Bildes im flüchtigen Malstil ausgeführt. Der Raum, in dem sich die beiden Porträtierten befinden, ist nur ausschnitthaft zu sehen. Mit horizontalen Pinselstrichen in changierenden Farben aus Braun und Grau ist der Holzfußboden skizziert. Darauf steht der Holzstuhl von Pagans, mit seinen Stuhlbeinen und Querverstrebungen. Vater de Gas sitzt möglicherweise auf einer Klavierbank oder einem Hocker, ohne dass ein solches Möbelstück im Bild sichtbar wird, da dieser Bereich von Pagans verdeckt wird. Hinter den beiden Personen steht ein dunkler Flügel, dessen Klaviatur neben Auguste de Gas rechts zum Bildrand reicht. Hinter Vater de Gas rahmt ein auf dem Notenständer des Flügels aufgeschlagenes Notenheft den Kopf des Porträtierten. Weitere Musikalien liegen am linken Bildrand auf dem geschlossenen Flügeldeckel. Oberhalb des Musikinstruments ist eine rotbraun gestrichene Wand zu sehen, an der zwei gerahmte Bilder hängen, die vom oberen Gemälderand abgeschnitten werden. Die beiden Bilder sind nur undeutlich ausgeführt und lassen das jeweilige Motiv nicht erkennen. Das Licht fällt von einer unbekannten Quelle auf die Szenerie, wodurch Glanzpunkte auf der Gitarre und auf Stirn, Wangen und Händen der beiden Dargestellten entstehen., Die Körper von Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas sind nicht aufeinander ausgerichtet, sondern beide haben sich dem Raum zugewandt. Dort, im Bereich außerhalb des rechten Bildrandes, können weitere Anwesende vermutet werden. Es bleibt aber offen, ob Pagans den Blick auf andere Personen gerichtet hat. Sein Blick kann genauso als Zeichen der Konzentration auf seinen Vortrag gelesen werden. Auch Auguste de Gas muss trotz geöffneter Augen nicht unbedingt auf etwas schauen. Sein Gesichtsausdruck unterstreicht eher das intensive Zuhören. Edgar Degas hat in diesem Gemälde nicht nur den Gegensatz von jungem und altem Mann, sondern mit vortragendem Sänger und Gitarristen sowie seinem Zuhörer zugleich das Thema Musik bildnerisch umgesetzt. Die Autorin Melissa MacQuillan merkt hierzu an, „… selten wurde die Beziehung zwischen dem musikalischen Interpreten und seinem Zuhörer bildlich so deutlich dargestellt.“, Variationen des Themas., Etwa zeitgleich mit dem Bildnis \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\" schuf Degas eine Variante des Motivs mit dem Titel \\"Degas’ Vater hört Lorenzo Pagans zu\\" (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). Hierin ist Lorenzo Pagans im Profil dargestellt und an den linken Bildrand gerückt. Er ist deutlich im Schattenbereich des Gemäldes angesiedelt und spielt dadurch eine nachgeordnete Rolle. Die Hauptperson in diesem Bild ist Auguste de Gas, dessen Kopf im helleren Licht erscheint und der ansonsten die gleiche Position eingenommen hat wie im Doppelbildnis \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\". Diese beiden Bilder gehören zu den wenigen Porträts, die Edgar Degas von seinem Vater schuf. Nach dem Tod von Auguste de Gas 1874 griff sein Sohn das Thema nochmals auf. In einem 1882 gemalten Doppelbildnis \\"Pagans und Degas’ Vater\\" (Privatsammlung) zeigt er Pagans beim Gesang mit einem Notenheft in der Hand. Hier sitzt Degas’ Vater als Randfigur im Hintergrund. Zu diesem Bild existiert zudem eine Pastellskizze (Privatsammlung). Wenige Monate vor dem Tod von Lorenzo Pagans entstand 1882 zudem das Bildnis \\"Porträt Lorenzo Pagans (Mann mit Zigarre)\\" (Nationalgalerie Prag), bei dem der Musiker als Halbporträt in privater Pose und ohne jeglichen Hinweis auf sein Musikerdasein porträtiert wurde., Hintergründe zur Entstehung des Gemäldes., Der im Gemälde dargestellte Auguste de Gas war der Vater des Malers Edgar Degas und als Musikliebhaber bekannt. Die Szenerie des Bildes \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\" ist im Musikzimmer seiner Wohnung in der Rue de Mondovi Nr.4 im 1.Arrondissement von Paris angesiedelt. Hier trafen sich jeden Montagabend Familienangehörige und Freunde zum Gedankenaustausch, der gelegentlich durch musikalische Darbietungen bereichert wurde. Auf dem Flügel von Érard spielten verschiedene Interpretinnen wie Auguste de Gas’ Tochter Marguerite, die befreundete Blanche Camus oder die Pianistin Suzanne Manet, die mit ihrem Mann, dem Maler Édouard Manet, zu Besuch kam. Weiterhin trat die Sängerin und Pianistin Marie Dihau im Salon von Auguste de Gas auf und von der Pariser Oper kam ihr Bruder, der Fagottspieler Désiré Dihau. Der Sohn Edgar Degas hatte ab Ende der 1860er Jahre die Oper als Motiv für seine Bilder entdeckt und neben den Tänzerinnen des Balletts wiederholt Musiker porträtiert. So stellte er mit \\"Das Orchester der Oper\\" (Musée d’Orsay) ein Gruppenbild mit dem Fagottspieler Désiré Dihau als zentraler Figur dar. Darüber hinaus porträtierte Degas verschiedene Musiker im häuslichen Rahmen. Hierzu gehören die Bildnisse \\"Der Violoncellist Pilet\\" (Musée d’Orsay), \\"Madame Camus am Klavier\\" (Stiftung Sammlung E. G. Bührle, Zürich) und \\"Marie Dihau am Klavier\\" (Musée d’Orsay). All diese Musiker sind wie Lorenzo Pagans im Doppelporträt mit Vater de Gas mit ihren Musikinstrumenten dargestellt. Das trifft auch auf das um 1871 entstandene Doppelbildnis zweier unbekannter Personen im Gemälde \\"Violinist mit junger Frau\\" (Detroit Institute of Arts) zu. Dieses Bild weist gewisse Ähnlichkeiten zum Gemälde \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\" auf. In beiden Bildern ist Musik im privaten Salon das Thema und nicht die Aufführung im Konzertsaal. Beide Bilder sind zudem nur spärlich möbliert und die Wand mit den angeschnittenen Bilderrahmen im Doppelporträt \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\" findet seine Entsprechung im vom rechten Rand angeschnittenen Kamin im Gemälde \\"Violinist mit junger Frau\\". Vor allem aber gibt es in der Ausführung Parallelen: Degas hat in beiden Bildern die Köpfe der Personen fein ausgearbeitet, während weite Teile der Komposition einen eher flüchtigen Pinselstrich aufweisen., Ende der 1860er Jahre hatte Edgar Degas von der Pariser Oper die Erlaubnis erhalten, hinter der Bühne und bei den Proben die Balletttänzerinnen und Orchestermusiker zu skizzieren. Spätestens seit dieser Zeit kannte er Lorenzo Pagans, der seit einigen Jahren in Paris als gefeierter Tenor auftrat und darüber hinaus in privaten Salons Liederabende gab. Edgar Degas konnte Pagans nicht nur im Hause seines Vaters hören, sondern auch bei den befreundeten Manets, wo der Sänger ebenso zu Gast war. Édouard Manet schuf 1879 mit dem kleinformatigen \\"Bildnis des Monsieur Pagans\\" (Privatsammlung) gleichfalls ein Porträt des Sängers. Möglicherweise war Manets Gemälde \\"Der spanische Sänger\\" (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) von 1860 für Degas ein Vorbild bei der Darstellung von Lorenzo Pagans im Doppelbildnis mit seinem Vater. Der von Manet porträtierte Musiker ist ebenfalls beim Gesang und dem Spiel der Gitarre dargestellt, wird jedoch in folkloristischer Aufmachung gezeigt., Aus französischer Sicht galt die Gitarre – neben Kastagnetten und Tamburin – als typisch spanisches Musikinstrument. Eine seit der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts in Frankreich zu beobachtende Spanienmode war nicht zuletzt durch die aus Spanien stammende Kaiserin Eugénie ausgelöst worden. Auf den Pariser Bühnen traten entsprechend sehr erfolgreich spanische Tänzer und Musiker auf, die teils durch folkloristische Darbietungen begeisterten, teils im klassischen Repertoire glänzten. Während auf Bildern des 18. Jahrhunderts, etwa bei Antoine Watteau oder Nicolas Lancret, die Gitarre bei Vergnügen des einfachen Volkes zu sehen ist, wandelt sich ihr Ansehen im 19. Jahrhundert zu einem noblen Instrument. Pagans war bekannt für den Gesang von spanischen Liedern, von denen er möglicherweise eines im Gemälde \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\" vorträgt, während er sich dazu selbst mit der Gitarre begleitet. Zudem spielte er in den privaten Salons Werke aus dem klassischen Repertoire, wozu beispielsweise Stücke von Jean-Philippe Rameau gehörten, wie sich die Brüder Goncourt erinnerten., Provenienz., Das Gemälde \\"Lorenzo Pagans und Auguste de Gas\\" befand: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Edgar Degas, Gemälde, Musée d’Orsay, Porträtmalerei, Lorenzo Pagans, Auguste de Gas, Doppelporträt, Musik, Gitarre, Salon"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Sangam-Literatur], Als Sangam-Literatur (von []) wird das Korpus der frühesten tamilischen Dichtung bezeichnet. Sie entstand vermutlich zwischen dem 1. und 6. Jahrhundert n.Chr. im äußersten Süden Indiens (Tamil Nadu). Zusammen mit dem Grammatikwerk \\"Tolkappiyam\\" bildet sie die älteste Schicht der tamilischen Literatur. Die Sangam-Literatur umfasst ein Korpus von 18 lyrischen Werken, das sich in acht Anthologien von meist kürzeren Einzelgedichten \\"(Ettuttogai)\\" und zehn längere Gedichte \\"(Pattuppattu)\\" aufteilt., Die Werke der Sangam-Literatur teilen sich in zwei Genres, Liebes- und Heldendichtung (\\"agam\\" und \\"puram\\"). Die Texte sind in einer altertümlichen Form der tamilischen Sprache, dem Alttamil, verfasst und folgen einer Vielzahl komplizierter Konventionen. Diese werden von einer reichen poetologischen Tradition beschrieben, die die Literatur begleitet. Zu den hervorstechendsten Konventionen gehört das Konzept der „fünf Landschaften“, dem zufolge eine bestimmte Liebessituation stets mit einer von fünf Landschaftstypen (Berge, Weideland, Ackerland, Küste und Wüste) assoziiert ist., Die Sangam-Literatur spiegelt einen Zustand wider, in dem der Einfluss der nordindischen Sanskrit-Kultur im Süden Indiens noch verhältnismäßig gering war. Anders als die Literaturen der anderen indischen Sprachen baut sie nicht auf dem Vorbild der Sanskrit-Literatur auf, sondern hat ihre eigenen Ursprünge. Für die frühe Geschichte Südindiens gehört die Sangam-Literatur zu den wichtigsten Quellen. Sie beschreibt eine Zeit, in der in Tamil Nadu die drei Königsdynastien der Chera, Chola und Pandya sowie eine Vielzahl minderer Fürsten herrschten. Nachdem die Sangam-Literatur zwischenzeitlich weitgehend in Vergessenheit geraten war, wurde sie im ausgehenden 19. Jahrhundert wiederentdeckt und spielt seitdem eine wichtige Rolle für das kulturelle Bewusstsein der Tamilen., Der Begriff „Sangam“., Der tamilische Begriff „Sangam“ ( \\"caṅkam\\") ist vom Sanskrit-Wort \\"saṅgha\\" hergeleitet und bedeutet wörtlich „Versammlung“, „Rat“ oder „Akademie“. Die Bezeichnung beruht auf einer Legende, der zufolge es in der mythischen Vorzeit drei Akademien \\"(Sangam)\\" von Dichtern gegeben habe, die die Tamil-Dichtung pflegten. Die Sangam-Legende tritt erstmals im 8. Jahrhundert in der poetologischen Literatur auf, namentlich in Nakkirars Kommentar zum \\"Iraiyanar Agapporul\\". Sie besagt, die erste von drei Akademien habe im „südlichen Madurai“, das heute unter dem Meer liege, stattgefunden und 4400 Jahre lang angedauert. Die zweite Akademie in der ebenfalls vom Meer verschlungenen Stadt Kabadapuram habe 3700 Jahre lang gedauert, die dritte Akademie habe im heutigen Madurai stattgefunden und 1850 Jahre angedauert. Während die Zahlen getrost als fiktiv gelten können, lässt sich zumindest nicht ausschließen, dass sich einst tatsächlich eine Dichterakademie in Madurai unter königlicher Patronage mit der Kodifizierung des Textkorpus der Sangam-Literatur befasste. Die in der Sangam-Legende erhaltene Sintflutsage führte im 20. Jahrhundert in tamilisch-nationalistischen Kreisen in Verbindung mit westlichen Theorien (vgl. Lemuria) zur Vorstellung von einem untergegangenen Kontinent Kumarikkandam., Nach der üblichen Definition gehört zur Sangam-Literatur die älteste Schicht der poetischen Literatur auf Tamil, bestehend aus zwei Sammlungen, den „acht Anthologien“ \\"(Ettuttogai)\\" und den „zehn Gesängen“ \\"(Pattuppattu)\\". Obwohl in der Sangam-Legende nur die acht Anthologien erwähnt werden, werden die zehn Gesänge wegen der großen Übereinstimmungen in Inhalt und Stil ebenfalls zur Sangam-Literatur gezählt. Bisweilen synonym verwendet, wenn auch nicht genauso trennscharf, ist der Begriff „klassische Tamil-Literatur“. Über den literarischen Bereich hinaus ist der Begriff „Sangam“ auch auf andere Bereiche übertragen worden: Im Tamilischen wird das Alttamil als „Sangam-Tamil“ ( \\"caṅkattamiḻ\\") bezeichnet. Auch ist in der Geschichtsschreibung Südindiens der Begriff „Sangam-Zeit“ für die Epoche, die in den Sangam-Texten beschrieben wird, geläufig., Textgeschichte und Chronologie., Die Datierung der Sangam-Texte ist höchst unsicher. Als weitgehender Konsens gilt, dass der Großteil der Texte in den ersten Jahrhunderten n.Chr. entstanden ist. Gleichwohl gibt es deutlich abweichende Datierungsvorschläge, die vom 3. Jahrhundert v.Chr. bis zum 8./9. Jahrhundert n.Chr. reichen. Anhand sprachlicher und stilistischer Merkmale lässt sich allenfalls eine relative Chronologie der Texte untereinander aufstellen. Zur absoluten Datierung trägt eine Reihe von externen Hinweisen bei: In den Heldengedichten des Sangam-Korpus werden neben zahlreichen minderen Fürsten die drei Königsdynastien der Chera, Chola und Pandya besungen. Diese waren die dominierende Macht in Tamil Nadu, ehe sie im 4. Jahrhundert durch die einfallenden Kalabhra verdrängt wurden. Auch spielt die Pallava-Dynastie, die im 6. Jahrhundert zur wichtigsten Macht in Tamil Nadu aufstieg, in der Sangam-Literatur keine Rolle. Dagegen gibt es Beschreibungen von griechischen bzw. römischen Händlern und Söldnern (vgl. Yavana). Der Seehandel zwischen Indien und dem Römischen Reich begann im 1. Jahrhundert und kam im 3. Jahrhundert zum Erliegen. Diese Tatsachen sprechen dafür, dass die Sangam-Gedichte die Zustände im Tamil Nadu der ersten Jahrhunderte n.Chr. beschreiben., Als mögliche Chronologie lässt sich Folgendes festhalten: Die älteste Schicht der Sangam-Literatur bilden die Gedichte der drei Liebes-Anthologien \\"Kurundogai\\", \\"Natrinai\\" und \\"Agananuru\\" und der Helden-Anthologie \\"Purananuru\\", die zwischen dem 1. und 3. Jahrhundert entstanden. Einzelne Gedichte können aber auch deutlich später sein. Etwas jüngeren Datums sind die beiden Anthologien \\"Aingurunuru\\" und \\"Paditruppattu\\". Ein Hinweis darauf ist die Tatsache, dass ihre Gedichte nicht als Einzelgedichte, sondern als Dekaden verfasst worden sind. Die beiden Werke dürften daher auf das 4. Jahrhundert anzusetzen sein. Auf das 4. und 5. Jahrhundert gehen die meisten der „zehn Gesänge“ \\"(Pattuppattu)\\" zurück. Eine Ausnahme ist das \\"Tirumurugatruppadai\\", das sich durch seine religiöse Thematik unterscheidet. Es wird ebenso wie die aufgrund sprachlicher, formaler und inhaltlicher Kriterien als Nachzügler identifizierbaren Anthologien \\"Kalittogai\\" und \\"Paripadal\\" auf das 6. Jahrhundert datiert., Die zahlreichen formelhaften Wendungen in der Sangam-Literatur legen nahe, dass die Texte ursprünglich mündlich überliefert wurden. Vermutlich gegen Mitte des 1. Jahrtausends wurden die Gedichte verschriftlicht und anschließend zu Anthologien zusammengefasst. Mehrere der Anthologien besitzen einen Einleitungsvers des Autors Paradam Padiya Perundevanar, der wahrscheinlich auf das 7. Jahrhundert anzusetzen ist. Wahrscheinlich wurde zu diesem Zeitpunkt eine erste Über-Anthologie zusammengestellt. Wann genau die Einteilung in die „acht Anthologien“ und „zehn Gesänge“, wie wir sie heute kennen, vorgenommen wurde, ist aber nicht bekannt. Die Begriffe \\"Ettuttogai\\" und \\"Pattuppattu\\" treten erstmals zwischen dem 11. und 14. Jahrhundert in der Kommentarliteratur auf., Das Textkorpus., Zum Korpus der Sangam-Literatur werden 18 Werke gerechnet, die zu zwei Sammlungen zusammengefasst werden: dem \\"Ettuttogai\\" ( \\"Eṭṭuttokai\\" „acht Anthologien“) und dem \\"Pattuppattu\\" ( \\"Pattuppāṭṭu\\" „zehn Gesänge“). Ersteres umfasst acht Anthologien von meist kürzeren Gedichten, letzteres ist eine Sammlung von zehn längeren Einzelgedichten. Insgesamt gehören zum Sangam-Korpus 2381 Gedichte höchst unterschiedlicher Länge (3 bis 782 Zeilen). Einige Gedichte sind im Laufe der Überlieferung verloren gegangen. So fehlen in den Anthologien \\"Aingurunuru\\" und \\"Purananuru\\" jeweils zwei Gedichte, während beim \\"Paditruppattu\\" jeweils die erste und letzte Dekade verloren gegangen ist. Am größten sind die Lücken in der Anthologie \\"Paripadal,\\" bei der nur noch 22 von ursprünglich 70 Gedichten erhalten geblieben sind., Die meisten Gedichte des Sangam-Korpus sind einem von 473 namentlich erwähnten Dichtern und Dichterinnen zugeschrieben. 102 Gedichte sind anonym. Während einige Dichter äußerst produktiv sind (so etwa Kabilar mit 253 Gedichten), ist anderen nur jeweils ein Gedicht zugeschrieben. So sind die 16 produktivsten Dichter für rund die Hälfte der Gedichte verantwortlich. Einige der Dichter sind nicht unter ihren richtigen Namen, sondern unter Epitheten bekannt, die sich einer besonders einprägsamen Phrase ihrer Gedichte herleiten, etwa Sembulappeyanirar „er mit der roten Erde und dem strömenden Regen“ nach dem zentralen Motiv des Gedichts \\"Kurundogai\\" 40 („… wie rote Erde und strömender Regen / sind in Liebe unsere Herzen vereint“)., Die „acht Anthologien“ \\"(Ettuttogai)\\"., Die acht Anthologien des \\"Ettuttogai\\" sind Sammlungen von meist kürzeren Einzelgedichten, die nach formalen (Länge, Versmaß) und inhaltlichen Kriterien (Liebes- oder Heldendichtung) zusammengefasst wurden. Im Genre der Liebesdichtung \\"(agam)\\" finden sich drei Anthologien von jeweils 400 Gedichten, die nach der Länge der Gedichte zusammengestellt sind: Im \\"Kurundogai\\" sind kurze Gedichte gesammelt, während das \\"Natrinai\\" mittellange und das \\"Agananuru\\" lange Gedichte enthält. Das Äquivalent im Genre der Heldendichtung \\"(puram)\\" ist die Anthologie \\"Purananuru\\" mit ebenfalls 400 Gedichten. Die Liebes-Anthologie \\"Aingurunuru\\" und die Helden-Anthologie \\"Paditruppattu\\" zeichnen sich durch eine Anordnung in Dekaden (Gruppen von zehn Gedichten) aus. Die Liebes-Anthologie \\"Kalittogai\\" weist große Unterschiede hinsichtlich Sprache und Stil auf und ist eindeutig jüngeren Datums als die anderen Texte. Ebenso verhält es sich beim \\"Paripadal,\\" das durch seinen religiösen Inhalt hervorsticht. Nachfolgend sind die acht Anthologien in der traditionellen Reihenfolge aufgezählt:, Die „zehn Gesänge“ \\"(Pattuppattu)\\"., Zum \\"Pattuppattu\\" gehören zehn längere Dichtungen mit einer Länge von 103 bis 782 Zeilen. Sie unterscheiden sich hauptsächlich durch ihre Länge von den kürzeren Gedichten der acht Anthologien, inhaltlich und stilistisch bilden sie mit: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Sangam-Literatur, Tamil Nadu, Tamilische Dichtung, Tamilische Literatur, Liebesdichtung, Heldendichtung, fünf Landschaften, Sanskrit-Kultur, Tamil Nadu, frühe Geschichte"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Afghanischer Bürgerkrieg (1989–2001), Krieg (Asien)], Der Afghanische Bürgerkrieg von 1989 bis 2001 war eine Periode innerafghanischer Kämpfe im Laufe des seit 1978 in Afghanistan andauernden Konflikts. Den Beginn des Bürgerkriegs markierte der Abzug der Sowjetarmee im Jahr 1989, der den Sowjetisch-Afghanischen Krieg beendete. Die weiterhin sowjetisch gestützte Regierung unter Muhammad Nadschibullāh konnte dem Druck der Mudschahedinparteien noch drei Jahre standhalten, bis sie im Frühjahr 1992 zusammenbrach. Der darauf folgende zehnjährige Bürgerkrieg war durch den Rückzug der beiden Supermächte und das Desinteresse der internationalen Gemeinschaft an der Lage in Afghanistan geprägt. Ausgefüllt wurde das Machtvakuum durch andere Mächte in der Region, in besonderem Maße Pakistan, die versuchten, in ihrem Sinne und meist mit eskalierender Wirkung auf den Konflikt Einfluss zu nehmen., Bereits seit dem Abzug der sowjetischen Truppen und dem Aufstieg regionaler Machthaber in den nicht mehr von der Zentralregierung kontrollierten Gebieten fragmentierte die Staatsgewalt in Afghanistan. Nach dem Ende der sowjetisch gestützten Regierung und dem Scheitern einer Verständigung zwischen den rivalisierenden Mudschahedinparteien kam es schließlich zum Zusammenbruch des Staates. Zum Symbol der Fragmentierung des Landes wurde die afghanische Hauptstadt Kabul, die in verschiedene Einflusszonen aufgeteilt war und auf die sich die meisten Kämpfe konzentrierten. Etwa 50.000 Menschen kamen zwischen 1992 und 1996 in Kabul durch Gefechte, Artilleriebeschuss und Massaker ums Leben, die südlichen Gebiete der Stadt wurden fast völlig zerstört. Dagegen waren die im Sowjetisch-Afghanischen Krieg verwüsteten ländlichen Regionen von den Kämpfen zwischen den Mudschahedin kaum betroffen und der Wiederaufbau begann., Ideologisch war die Zeit des Bürgerkrieges nach der versuchten Transformation der Gesellschaft unter der kommunistischen Regierung der Demokratischen Republik Afghanistan durch den Aufstieg des Islamismus gekennzeichnet, der bis in die 1980er Jahre in Afghanistan kaum eine Rolle gespielt hatte. Bereits die Parteien der Mudschahedin erließen ab 1992 islamistische Dekrete, später fand diese Entwicklung in der Herrschaft der Talibanorganisation mit teilweise totalitären Zügen ihren Höhepunkt. Mit Unterstützung Pakistans eroberten die Taliban 1996 Kabul und drängten die verbleibende militärische Opposition in den äußersten Nordosten des Landes zurück. Mit dem Vormarsch der Taliban ab 1994 weiteten sich wiederum Kampfhandlungen auch auf Gebiete außerhalb der Hauptstadt aus. Erst nach der relativen Konsolidierung ihrer Kontrolle über den größten Teil des Landes im Jahr 1998 ging die Intensität der Kämpfe wieder zurück., Die Regierung der Taliban war durch ihre radikale Politik international weitgehend isoliert, allerdings war die Bereitschaft anderer Staaten, sich in Afghanistan zu engagieren, weiter gering. Erst die Aufnahme Osama bin Ladens und der von ihm geführten Al-Qaida-Organisation rückte das Land wieder in den Fokus der Weltpolitik. Unter anderem als Reaktion auf die von Angehörigen der al-Qaida ausgeführten Anschläge vom 11. September 2001 kam es im Oktober 2001 schließlich zu einer US-geführten Intervention, die zum Sturz der Talibanregierung führte und eine neue Phase direkter ausländischer Beteiligung am afghanischen Konflikt einleitete., Regierung Nadschibullāh 1989–1992., Im April 1988 unterzeichneten die Regierungen Afghanistans und Pakistans die Genfer Abkommen zur Beendigung des seit 1978 andauernden Konflikts zwischen der sowjetisch gestützten Zentralregierung und den islamistisch geprägten Widerstandsgruppen der Mudschahedin, die Finanz- und Waffenhilfen vor allem von den USA, Saudi-Arabien und Pakistan erhielten. Als Garantiemächte fungierten die Sowjetunion und die Vereinigten Staaten. In den Abkommen verpflichteten sich die beiden Staaten unter anderem zur gegenseitigen Nichteinmischung sowie zu einer Rückführung der etwa fünf Millionen afghanischen Flüchtlinge aus Pakistan. Außerdem wurde ein Zeitplan zum schrittweisen Abzug der seit 1979 im Land stationierten sowjetischen Truppen bis zum 15. Februar 1989 festgelegt. Allerdings sahen die Abkommen neben dem Truppenabzug keine weiterreichenden konkreten Schritte zur Lösung des Konflikts zwischen der Zentralregierung und den Guerillas vor. Zudem erkannten die bei der Ausarbeitung der Verträge nicht eingebundenen Mudschahedinparteien die darin festgeschriebenen Bestimmungen nicht an, so dass der Krieg auch nach dem Abzug der sowjetischen Truppen weiter ging., Die Sowjetunion begann im Mai 1988 entsprechend den Abkommen mit dem schrittweisen Rückzug und zog bis zum 15. Februar 1989 ihr militärisches Personal vollständig aus Afghanistan ab. Die Truppen hinterließen ein verwüstetes Land: Etwa eine Million Afghanen waren im Sowjetisch-Afghanischen Krieg umgekommen, fast anderthalb Millionen der Überlebenden waren schwer und dauerhaft körperlich versehrt worden, sechs Millionen Menschen waren aus dem Land geflohen. Als Ergebnis einer gegen die Versorgungsgrundlagen der ländlichen Bevölkerung gerichteten sowjetischen Kriegsführung waren große Teile der Infrastruktur zerstört, die landwirtschaftliche Produktion auf ein Drittel des Vorkriegsstands gefallen., Entgegen den Erwartungen fast aller Beobachter brach die nach dem Abzug der sowjetischen Truppen militärisch auf sich allein gestellte afghanische Regierung unter Muhammad Nadschibullāh nicht zusammen, sondern konnte mit sowjetischer Unterstützung dem Druck der Guerillas über drei Jahre standhalten. Erst der Putsch gegen Gorbatschow im August 1991 und der wenige Monate später abgeschlossene Zerfall der Sowjetunion bedeutete das Ende der sowjetischen Hilfen und wenig später auch des sowjetisch gestützten Regimes in Kabul., Politik Nadschibullāhs., Der frühere Leiter der berüchtigten Geheimpolizei KhAD Muhammad Nadschibullāh war 1986 von der Sowjetunion als Nachfolger Babrak Karmals als Präsident eingesetzt worden. Er war Ghilzai-Paschtune und gehörte wie Karmal zum von persischsprachigen Kabulis dominierten Partscham-Flügel der afghanischen Volkspartei. Die Reihen der Partschamis wurden nach seinem Amtsantritt von Unterstützern Karmals gesäubert. Seine Politik propagierte Nadschibullāh unter dem Schlagwort der \\"Nationalen Aussöhnung\\", das die Abkehr von einer militärischen Lösung des Konflikts und das Ende der ideologischen Fixierung auf die Sowjetunion ausdrücken sollte. Der Begriff wurde von Michail Gorbatschow im Juli 1986 geprägt und mit \\"Āschti-yi Milli\\" ins Persische übertragen., Ideologisch vollzog Nadschibullāh mit seiner Politik nach dem Abzug der sowjetischen Truppen eine Kehrtwende: Die marxistisch-leninistische Rhetorik wurde vollständig fallen gelassen zugunsten von nationalistischer Propaganda, die sich im Speziellen gegen die zunehmend unpopuläre pakistanische Einmischung und den arabischen Wahhabismus richtete. Die soziale Umgestaltung der ländlichen Regionen, vor allem die umstrittenen Landreformen, wurde vollständig aufgegeben. Außerdem versuchte Nadschibullāh, seiner Regierung durch Berufung auf den Islam Legitimität zu verleihen und vom Stigma der Ungläubigkeit zu befreien. Die \\"Demokratische Republik\\" wurde in \\"Republik Afghanistan\\" umbenannt und die islamische Scharia in der Verfassung verankert. Im Juni 1990 gründete Nadschibullāh schließlich die Hizb-i Watan ( – \\"Vaterlandspartei\\"), die als Nachfolgepartei der kommunistischen Volkspartei fungierte., Gleichzeitig führte Nadschibullāh eine begrenzte politische Liberalisierung durch: Das Einparteiensystem wurde offiziell abgeschafft, eine Amnestie für politische Gefangene erlassen und die Anwendung der Folter verboten. Doch obwohl die Zahl der politischen Gefangenen und die Anwendung der Folter auch in der Praxis zurückging, wurde ein pluralistisches Mehrparteiensystem nicht zugelassen, und es kam immer wieder zu Arrestwellen. An die Stelle von präventivem staatlichen Terror rückte die Unterdrückung offener Opposition. Der Politikwissenschaftler Barnett Rubin bezeichnet die Politik Nadschibullāhs als Übergang von einem totalitären Staat zu einem konventionellen autoritären Regime., Trotz Nadschibullāhs demonstrativer Distanzierung von der Sowjetunion war sein Regime auch weiterhin massiv von sowjetischen Hilfen abhängig, die nach dem Abzug der Truppen noch verstärkt wurden. Kabul wurde durch eine sowjetische Luftbrücke mit zivilen und militärischen Gütern versorgt, der Umfang der Lieferungen erreichte im Jahr des Rückzugs einen Wert von 14,2 Milliarden Dollar., Militärisch versuchte Nadschibullāh nach dem sowjetischen Abzug, die Macht seines Regimes durch die Konzentration der Regierungskräfte auf die Städte und wichtige Verbindungswege zu sichern. Dabei stützte er sich zunehmend auf die semiregulären Regionalmilizen, die nicht nur zur Sicherung der Städte, sondern auch für die wenigen offensiven Operationen eingesetzt wurden. Eine zentrale Rolle spielte dabei die 30.000 Mann starke Dschozdschāni-Miliz Raschid Dostums, die landesweit effektiv gegen die Aufständischen operierte. Insgesamt umfassten die Milizen im Jahr 1990 geschätzte 50.000 – 70.000 Mann, dies entsprach in etwa der doppelten Stärke der afghanischen Armee. Der militärische Druck auf von den Mudschahedin gehaltene ländliche Gebiete wurde größtenteils aufgehoben. Stattdessen versuchte das Regime, inoffizielle Waffenstillstandsabkommen mit lokalen Kommandeuren zu schließen., Militärische Stabilisierung., Bereits während des sowjetischen Abzugs begann der erwartete Sturm der Widerstandsgruppen gegen die Stellungen der Regierung. Die Moral der Guerillas war angesichts ihres historischen Sieges hoch, außerdem verstärkte Pakistan seine Waffenlieferungen beträchtlich. Im Sommer 1988 fielen zahlreiche von der Regierung gehaltene Orte. Nach dem Abschluss des sowjetischen Abzugs kontrollierte die Regierung nur noch die urbanen Zentren des Landes sowie die sie verbindenden Straßen. Alle ländlichen Regionen und sechs ganze Provinzen waren in der Hand der Mudschahedin. In Nadschibullāhs Regierungszeit kam es so zu einer Regionalisierung der Staatsgewalt, die die hundertjährige Dominanz Kabuls in Afghanistan beendete., Auch die Spannungen zwischen den beiden Flügeln der Volkspartei traten im März 1990 wieder offen zu Tage, als Nadschibullāh einen durch seinen Verteidigungsminister Schahnawaz Tanai angeführten Putschversuch des Chalq-Flügels der Volkspartei abwehren konnte. Der Staatsstreich wurde von Gulbuddin Hekmatyār, dem Führer der Mudschahedinpartei Hizb-i Islāmi-yi Gulbuddin, unterstützt. Der Paschtune Hekmatyār unterhielt seit Anfang des Jahres eine vermutlich vom pakistanischen Geheimdienst ISI vermittelte Verbindung zum ebenfalls paschtunisch geprägten Chalq-Flügel der Regierung., Doch trotz der militärischen Erfolge und der Spannungen innerhalb des Regimes gelang es den Guerillas nicht, die Hochburgen der Regierung ernsthaft zu bedrohen.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"afghanischer Bürgerkrieg, Krieg (Asien), Sowjetarmee, Mujschahedinparteien, Mudschahedin, Machtvakuum, Taliban, Intervention, Regierung Nadschibullāh, Abzug sowjetischer Truppen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Finnlandschwedische Sprache, Politik (Finnland), Sprachpolitik], Die finnische Sprachenpolitik bezeichnet das Verhältnis des finnischen Staates zu den im Land gesprochenen Sprachen und den diese Sprachen sprechenden Volksgruppen. Zu den besonderen Zügen der finnischen Sprachenpolitik gehört seit dem 19.Jahrhundert die Zweisprachigkeit und das damit verbundene Ringen um die Kräfteverhältnisse zwischen der von einer Minderheit gesprochenen schwedischen und der finnischen Sprache., Geschichte., Vorgeschichte., Das Gebiet des heutigen Finnland war seit etwa dem 12. Jahrhundert bis ins Jahr 1809 ein organischer Teil des Schwedischen Reiches. Als Verwaltungssprache des Staates diente im Wesentlichen die schwedische Sprache. Im Spätmittelalter wurde zusätzlich auch Latein und während der Zeit der Kalmarer Union in gewissem Umfang auch Dänisch verwendet. Die vom überwiegenden Teil der Bevölkerung gesprochene finnische Sprache hatte hingegen keinen offiziellen Status und war als Schriftsprache zunächst nicht existent., Als Vater der finnischen Schriftsprache gilt heute Mikael Agricola, welcher spätestens im Jahr 1543 das erste Lesebuch in finnischer Sprache, das \\"ABC-Buch\\", veröffentlichte. Am Anfang des 17. Jahrhunderts wurden die ersten Gesetze auch auf Finnisch veröffentlicht, und im Jahr 1759 wurde schließlich das gesamte Gesetzbuch des Landes in finnischer Sprache herausgegeben., Während der schwedischen Zeit nahm der finnische Adel ebenso wie ein großer Teil des wohlhabenden Bürgertums die schwedische Sprache an. Der Bauernstand trug bei den Reichstagen wiederholt erfolglos die Bitte nach Dolmetscher- und Übersetzerdiensten vor und verlangte die Berücksichtigung der finnischen Sprache bei der Besetzung von Ämtern. Während sich jedoch an der Akademie zu Turku unter der Führung von Henrik Gabriel Porthan eine Bewegung von Liebhabern der finnischen Sprache, die sogenannten Fennophilen, bildete, war Porthan selbst der Ansicht, dass im Zuge der „weiteren Ausbreitung der Kultur“ die finnische Sprache letztlich verschwinden würde., Großfürstentum Finnland., Nach der Loslösung Finnlands von Schweden und der Bildung des Großfürstentums Finnland unter der russischen Krone bewahrte sich das Schwedische seine Position als Amts- und Verwaltungssprache. Die russischen Herrscher erhofften sich jedoch durch eine Stärkung der finnischen Sprache eine Schwächung der Bindungen Finnlands an das bisherige Mutterland Schweden. So wurde die Regentenversicherung von Zar AlexanderI. auf dem Reichstag von Porvoo sowohl auf Finnisch als auch auf Schwedisch veröffentlicht., In der Zeit des Großfürstentums entstand, angefacht durch die in Europa aufgekommenen nationalen Ideen, eine neue finnische Identität. Diese finnische Nationalbewegung war zunächst nicht sprachpolitischer Natur. Von den zentralen Protagonisten der Bewegung schrieben zum Beispiel Johan Ludvig Runeberg und Zacharias Topelius auf Schwedisch und Johan Vilhelm Snellman benutzte beide Sprachen. Allerdings schrieben Elias Lönnrot und Aleksis Kivi auf Finnisch, und die Veröffentlichung von Lönnrots Sammlung \\"Kalevala\\" sowie Kivis Roman \\"Die Sieben Brüder\\" brachten der bisher geringgeschätzten finnischen Sprache und Kultur Respekt ein., Die russische Sprache erreichte auch in der Zeit der russischen Herrschaft zu keinem Zeitpunkt einen wesentlichen Stellenwert, wenn auch seit dem Jahr 1818 von allen Amtsinhabern ein Zeugnis über die russische Sprachkenntnis verlangt wurde., Diese Anforderung wurde für Pfarrer im Jahr 1824 aufgehoben. Von diesen wurde stattdessen in Gemeinden mit finnischsprachiger Bevölkerung finnische Sprachkenntnis verlangt., Im Jahr 1828 wurde an der Universität das Amt des Lektors der finnischen Sprache und 1850 der Lehrstuhl für finnische Sprache und Literatur begründet. Die erste finnischsprachige Dissertation wurde 1858 veröffentlicht. Im gleichen Jahr wurde in Jyväskylä das erste Gymnasium gegründet, dessen Unterrichtssprache Finnisch war., Gesetze und Verordnungen wurden auf Schwedisch und nach Bedarf auch auf Finnisch bekanntgemacht. Das seit 1860 erschienene finnische Verordnungsblatt wurde von Beginn an zweisprachig, im Zuge der in den 1880er Jahren begonnenen Russifizierungsbestrebungen in der kurzen Periode von 1903 bis 1905 auch auf Russisch veröffentlicht. Die Vorarbeiten zu den Gesetzen fanden grundsätzlich auf Schwedisch statt, und erst für die offizielle Gesetzesvorlage wurden finnische Übersetzungen angefertigt. Erst ab der Parlamentsreform von 1906 begann die finnischsprachige Gesetzesvorbereitung Raum zu gewinnen., Fennomanen und Svekomanen., Die Bestrebungen zur Verbesserung der Stellung der finnischen Sprache und der sprachlichen Rechte der Finnischsprachigen führten in den 1840er Jahren zur Entstehung der \\"Fennomanie\\" als ideeller Bewegung. Deren Anhänger gründeten die Finnische Partei und gaben ab 1847 die erste in finnischer Sprache an ein gebildetes Publikum gerichtete Zeitung \\"Suometar\\" heraus., Der prominenteste Fennomane war zunächst der Philosoph, Journalist und spätere Staatsmann Johan Vilhelm Snellman, welcher in Zeitungsartikeln beklagte, dass das finnische Volk gegenüber anderen Völkern geistig und materiell zurückgeblieben sei. Als Grund hierfür machte Snellman den Mangel an Nationalbewusstsein aus, welches man nur durch die Erhebung der finnischen Sprache zur Amts- und Bildungssprache fördern könne., Die Gedanken Snellmans fanden ein weites Echo, und in der sich erweiternden Bewegung bildeten sich bald unterschiedliche Strömungen heraus. Während liberale Fennomanen wie Elias Lönnrot und Zacharias Topelius eine Zweisprachigkeit des Landes anstrebten, wollten vor allem die ab 1863 um Yrjö Koskinen formierten Jungfennomanen Finnisch unter Verdrängung des Schwedischen als einzige Kultur- und Amtssprache Finnlands etablieren. Radikalisierte Fennomanen entwickelten aus der Sprachfrage die Forderung nach einem die finnischsprachigen Völker umfassenden Großfinnland. Die Finnlandschweden bezeichneten sie als Fremde oder als Verräter ihrer finnischen Vorfahren., Als Gegenreaktion zu den Fennomanen bildete sich eine die Stellung der schwedischen Sprache verteidigende Bewegung, die \\"Svekomanen\\", deren führende Persönlichkeit Professor Axel Olof Freudenthal war und aus welcher die Schwedische Partei hervorging. In den schwedischsprachigen Zeitungen wurde argumentiert, dass die finnische Sprache als Kultursprache ungeeignet sei. Radikale Svekomanen vertraten die Ansicht, dass die Schweden bereits im Mittelalter den ansonsten entwicklungsunfähigen Finnen die westliche Kultur gebracht hätten., Auch in Regierungskreisen herrschte eine der finnischen Sprache unfreundlich gesinnte Einstellung vor, von russischer Seite verstärkt durch die Besorgnis vor der Verbreitung revolutionären Gedankengutes im Volke. Daher wurde im Jahr 1850 durch die sogenannte Sprachverordnung die Veröffentlichung von finnischsprachigen Texten mit Ausnahme von religiösen und wirtschaftlichen Veröffentlichungen verboten. Die Verordnung wurde jedoch wenig befolgt und im Jahr 1860 auch formal wieder aufgehoben. Seit 1858 wurden im Binnenland tätige Amtsträger verpflichtet, eine mündliche finnische Sprachprüfung abzulegen., Während der finnische Senat der finnischen Sprache gegenüber weiterhin skeptisch blieb, erzielten die Fennomanen im Jahr 1863 scheinbar einen Durchbruch, als Zar AlexanderII. einen von Snellman unter Umgehung des Senates vorgelegten Verordnungsentwurf unterzeichnete, nach welchem Finnisch innerhalb von 20 Jahren gleichberechtigte Amts- und Gerichtssprache werden sollte., Verschiebung der Kräfteverhältnisse., Als die von AlexanderII. gesetzte Frist im Jahr 1883 ablief, versuchte der russische Generalgouverneur Fjodor Loginowitsch Heiden, das Finnische im Verordnungswege in den Stand der Amtssprache einzusetzen. Er scheiterte dabei jedoch zunächst am Widerstand des schwedisch gesinnten Senates wie auch des Prokurators Robert Montgomery, welcher das Finnische für eine „fremde Sprache“ hielt, die in den Gerichten nicht verwendet werden könne. Erst mit der Sprachverordnung vom 19. Juni 1902 wurde Finnisch Amtssprache., Dieser Vorgang wurde überlagert von den Auswirkungen des im Jahr 1900 erlassenen Sprachmanifestes, durch welches im Zuge der angestrebten Russifizierung Finnlands die russische Sprache unter anderem als Sprache des Senats festgelegt wurde. In der Praxis blieben jedoch Schwedisch und Finnisch die im Senat verwendeten Sprachen, während die Protokolle und Beschlüsse lediglich ins Russische übersetzt wurden. Das Sprachmanifest wurde nach dem vorläufigen Ende der Russifizierungsbestrebungen im Jahr 1906 wieder aufgehoben., Der in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts begonnene Aufbau eines finnischsprachigen Schulwesens führte bis zur Jahrhundertwende zur Bildung einer gebildeten finnischsprachigen Bevölkerungsschicht, und bis zum zweiten Jahrzehnt des 20. Jahrhunderts hatte sich Finnisch zu einer vollwertigen Kultursprache entwickelt. Im gleichen Zuge verlor das Schwedische seine Stellung als alleinige Kultursprache. Während bisher Schwedisch die Sprache der gebildeten Schichten war, wurde es nun zunehmend als Sprache einer klaren Bevölkerungsminderheit empfunden. Dies führte auch dazu, dass sich die schwedischsprachigen Bevölkerungsteile deutlicher als zuvor als besondere Volksgruppe empfanden, zu welcher neben der alten Elite auch die schwedischsprachigen Teile der einfachen Bevölkerung gehörten. Diese Entwicklung zusammen mit dem wieder aufflammenden Sprachenstreit und den Bestrebungen von fennomanischen Kreisen, Finnisch zur einzigen Amtssprache des Landes zu machen, führte schließlich zur Gründung der Schwedischen Volkspartei als Interessenvertretung der sprachlichen Minderheit sowie der ersten explizit schwedischsprachigen Universität, der Åbo Akademi., Ringen um die Sprachenpolitik des selbstständigen Finnland., Als Finnland im Jahr 1917 die Unabhängigkeit erlangte, hatten sich die Kräfteverhältnisse zwischen den Sprachen umgekehrt, und als entscheidende offene Frage verblieb der Status des Schwedischen im jungen Staat. Die um ihre Sprachrechte fürchtenden Finnlandschweden sahen sich lautstarken Forderungen der Fennomanen gegenüber, welche das Schwedische allenfalls als Minderheitensprache tolerieren wollten., Radikale svekomanische Gruppierungen stellten die Theorie von zwei verschiedenen Nationalitäten auf und verlangten einen Autonomiestatus für die mehrheitlich schwedischsprachigen Gebiete, vergleichbar den später der Inselgruppe Åland zugestandenen Rechten. Zu diesem Zweck wurde im Frühjahr 1919 eine inoffizielle Volksvertretung der Finnlandschweden \\"(Svenska Finlands folkting)\\" gegründet. Die Schwedische Volkspartei, welche eine Schwächung der Gesamtstellung des Schwedischen im Lande fürchtete, lehnte diese Forderungen ab, und auch im Parlament konnte das Projekt keine bedeutende Zustimmung gewinnen., Nach langen Verhandlungen einigte man sich: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Finnlandschwedische Sprache, Politik (Finnland), Sprachpolitik, Zweisprachigkeit, Minderheit, Geschichte, Vorgeschichte, Schwedische Sprache, Finnische Sprache, Mikael Agricola."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Ersterwähnung 751, Gemeinde in Baden-Württemberg, Große Kreisstadt in Baden-Württemberg, Kreisstadt in Baden-Württemberg, Lörrach, Ort an der Wiese, Ort im Landkreis Lörrach, Stadtrechtsverleihung 1403], Lörrach ist eine Kreisstadt im Südwesten Baden-Württembergs. Sie ist die größte Stadt des gleichnamigen Landkreises und seit dem 1.April 1956 Große Kreisstadt. In der näheren Umgebung liegen der Schwarzwald, das Rheintal sowie Weil am Rhein und die Schweizer Großstadt Basel. Bedeutendste Sehenswürdigkeit und Wahrzeichen der Stadt ist die auf einer Anhöhe gelegene Burg Rötteln., Lörrach liegt weniger als fünf Kilometer vom Dreiländereck Deutschland – Frankreich – Schweiz entfernt, die Gemarkungsfläche grenzt unmittelbar an die Schweiz. Die Stadt ist Bestandteil des Trinationalen Eurodistricts Basel mit rund 830.000 Einwohnern. Der erweiterte trinationale Ballungsraum wird, da er sich um das Rheinknie gebildet hat, auch \\"RegioTriRhena\\" genannt. Dieser Lebens- und Wirtschaftsraum umfasst die Gegend im äußersten Südwesten Baden-Württembergs, die Nordwestschweiz sowie das Oberelsass. Er zählt etwa 2,3 Millionen Einwohner und über eine Million Erwerbstätige., Geographie und Lage., Lörrach liegt im äußersten Südwesten Deutschlands an den Ausläufern des südlichen Schwarzwaldes im Wiesental und an der Schweizer Grenze zu Riehen, das dem Kanton Basel-Stadt angehört. Längs der Wiese, einem rechten Nebenfluss des Rheins, verläuft die sogenannte „Grüne Grenze“ zur Schweiz, ein Wanderweg für Fußgänger und Radfahrer. Am südlichen Ende des Gemarkungsgebietes bildet unter anderem die Eiserne Hand, ein Bergrücken, die Landesgrenze zur Schweiz., Geografische Daten der Stadtgemarkung Lörrachs:, Das bebaute Stadtgebiet Lörrachs misst in der größten Nord-Süd-Ausdehnung 6,0 Kilometer, in der Ost-West-Richtung sind es 4,6 Kilometer., Lörrach wird manchmal als „Hauptstadt“ des Markgräflerlands bezeichnet und gehört dem trinationalen Eurodistrikt Basel und \\"Regio TriRhena\\" an. Die Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart liegt 160Kilometer von Lörrach entfernt, die Schweizer Großstädte Bern 102Kilometer und Zürich 90Kilometer, eine gute Autostunde. Die nächste französische Großstadt (49Kilometer) ist Mülhausen, die nächste deutsche Großstadt ist Freiburg im Breisgau (74Kilometer)., Die Stadt Lörrach wird von vielen bewaldeten Erhebungen (Schädelberg, Homburger Wald, Röttler Wald und Tüllinger Berg) entlang des Unteren Wiesentals umrahmt, wovon der Tüllinger Berg mit 460Metern ü.NN eine der höchsten bildet. Von dort aus hat man die beste Aussicht auf die umliegenden Städte Weil am Rhein und Basel sowie auf das Rheinknie. Auf dem Tüllinger Berg ist ein 657Hektar umfassendes Landschaftsschutzgebiet eingerichtet. Am Südwesthang des Berges wird die regional bedeutende Gutedelrebe angebaut und zu \\"Markgräfler Wein\\" verkeltert. Insgesamt sind im Stadtgebiet neun Gebiete zum langfristigen Schutz von Natur und Landschaft eingerichtet. Naturräumlich gehört das Stadtgebiet Lörrachs zum Markgräfler Hügelland., Durch Lörrach, genauer gesagt, an der Burg Rötteln vorbei über den Tüllinger, führt die Schlussetappe der Variante A des. Seit 2010 verläuft ein Teil des Hebel-Wanderweges ebenfalls durch das Stadtgebiet. Insgesamt befinden sich 89 Kilometer eines vom Schwarzwaldverein betreuten Wanderwegenetzes auf Lörracher Gemarkung., Lörrach liegt in einem sogenannten Zollgrenzbezirk mit Sitz eines Hauptzollamtes. Nach dem Beitritt der Schweiz zum Schengen-Raum sind am 12. Dezember 2008 die Personengrenzkontrollen weggefallen. Die Zollkontrollen bleiben hingegen bestehen, da die Schweiz nicht der europäischen Zollunion beigetreten ist. Die Grenzlage Lörrachs brachte den Stadtbewohnern sowohl Vor- als auch Nachteile. Mit dem Fall der Grenzen innerhalb der EU und den bilateralen Verträgen der Europäischen Union mit der Schweiz gelangte die Region erstmals aus einer politischen Randlage heraus in eine europäische Zentrallage. Mit gut ausgebauten Nord-Süd- und Ost-West-Verkehrsverbindungen ist Lörrach wirtschaftlich eingebunden und profitiert auch im Fremdenverkehrswesen als Regionalzentrum des südlichen Schwarzwaldes. Nachteilig wirkt sich die gestiegene Kriminalität durch den Grenzverkehr aus; dazu zählen insbesondere Straftaten im Bereich des Drogenschmuggels. Der Landkreis Lörrach lag 2004 bei der Häufigkeitszahl an kriminellen Delikten mit 10.099 Fällen landesweit auf Platz sechs in Baden-Württemberg., Geologie., Ein Großteil der Kernstadt steht auf den Schottermassen, welche die Wiese in der letzten (Würm-)Kaltzeit aufgeschüttet hat. Auf ihnen liegen auch die alten Ortskerne von Brombach, Haagen und Hauingen. Tumringen dagegen hat sich erst spät auf die Talebene ausgedehnt. Diese Ebene weist zwei Niveaus auf: ein höheres, das Aufschüttungsniveau der letzten Kaltzeit (Niederterrasse), und ein tieferes, das nacheiszeitlich entstand, als die sich eintiefende Wiese ihre Schotter teilweise abräumte und umlagerte (die Aue). Der etwa 10 Meter hohe, beide Ebenen verbindende Rain (das Hochgestade), ein altes Wieseufer, ist im Stadtbild nicht zu übersehen (Steilanstiege der Teichstraße, der Clara-Immerwahr-Straße, der Weiler Straße, das an den Rain angelehnte Burghof-Parkhaus, die „Rainstraße“ usw.). Er lässt sich bis Brombach verfolgen, wobei schon im Grütt der Niveauunterschied geringer wird. Ab Haagen, wo auch rechts der Wiese die Niederterrasse erscheint, beträgt der Höhenunterschied nur noch ungefähr 5Meter. Östlich Hauingen setzt die Niederterrasse ganz aus. Bis zur Eindämmung der Wiese war die Aue Überschwemmungsgebiet. Im Luftbild lassen sich noch heute zwischen dem Haagener Steg und dem Autobahnzubringer im offenen Feld die alten, von der Vegetation nachgezeichneten Flussarme erkennen., Der Talraum um die Kernstadt wird im Westen durch den Tüllinger Berg, im Osten durch eine Folge von Hügeln wie dem Hünerberg, dem Leuselhard/Schädelberg sowie dem Stettenbuck vor dem eigentlichen Westrand des Dinkelbergs begrenzt., Die Westbegrenzung der Muschelkalktafel des Dinkelbergs liegt in einer Nord-Süd streichenden etwa einen Kilometer breiten Abbiegezone, in der nicht nur die Muschelkalkschichten, sondern auch jüngere Sedimente in die Tiefe des Oberrheingrabens abtauchen, also nicht einfach an Verwerfungen abgeschoben werden. Diese Flexurzone setzt südlich Kandern als Fortsetzung der Rheingraben-Randverwerfung ein und erreicht das Stadtgebiet auf der Haagener Gemarkung. Schon am Westrand des Lingert, sichtbar in einem aufgelassenen Steinbruch, biegen die Muschelkalkschichten ab. Westwärts in Richtung Lichsen und Manzental folgen dann, ebenfalls abtauchend, immer jüngere Schichten: rote Keupertone und Jurasedimente, darunter die schräg gestellte harte Hauptrogensteinrippe, auf der die Burgruine sitzt. Westlich der Burg sind es dann bereits Tertiärschichten, die ebenfalls in die Grabentiefe abtauchen. (→ Geologie von Haagen)., Im Kernstadtgebiet verlaufen Längsverwerfungen in der Flexur. Dazu kommen mehrere Querstörungen, so dass ein richtiges Mosaik aus Jura- und Tertiär-Schollen entsteht, das in der Landschaft als Hügelkette zwischen Dinkelberg und Talebene in Erscheinung tritt. Dabei spielt der Hauptrogenstein bei Hünerberg, Schädelberg und Stettenbuck jeweils als widerständige Deckplatte eine landschaftsprägende Rolle. Zwischen diesen Schollen und dem Muschelkalk des Dinkelbergs verläuft vom Salzert über den Spitzacker bis zur Moosmatt in weichen Keupertonen eine waldfreie Ausräumungszone., Die abtauchenden Schichten der Flexur bilden unter dem Tüllinger Berg eine tiefe Mulde, steigen weiter westlich also wieder auf. Der Muschelkalk des Dinkelbergs ist im Muldentiefsten über 1000 Meter tief versenkt. Er (und die jüngeren mesozoischen Schichten) sind dort bedeckt von Sedimenten der tertiären Grabenfüllung, u.a. von grauen Tonen aus der Zeit als der Rheingraben von einem flachen Meeresarm erfüllt war (Rupel: Froidefontaine-Formation) und Feinsandsteinen und Mergeln, Schwemmlandsedimenten aus der folgenden festländischen Zeit. Diese sogenannte Elsässer Molasse (Rupel/Chatt: Niederrödern-Formation) bildet über der Wiese nur einen niedrigen Sockel des Tüllinger Berges, im übrigen Markgräflerland aber weithin den Untergrund. Auf ihr lagern als oberste Muldenfüllung die sog. Tüllinger Schichten, eine Folge von Mergeln mit zwischengeschalteten Kalken, die sich einst in einem Seebecken abgelagert haben. Diese Wechselfolge verrät sich an den Hängen des Tüllinger Berges durch mehrere umlaufende Hangversteilungen, denen jeweils die harten Süßwasserkalke zugrunde liegen. Zudem bilden sich an deren Fuß über den wasserstauenden Mergeln Quellhorizonte. Die Mergel des Tüllinger Berges neigen stark zu Hangrutschungen. Am bekanntesten ist der Weiler Schlipf. Während der Dinkelberg vorwiegend aus rund 245 Mio. alten marinen Muschelkalkschichten des Erdmittelalters aufgebaut ist, sind die Sedimente des Tüllinger Bergs wesentlich jünger, rund 25 Mio. Jahre alt (Oligozän: Chatt). Der Erosionsleistung von Wiese, Kander und Rhein ist es zu verdanken, dass die einstige Muldenfüllung heute als „herausgeschnittener“ Höhenrücken erscheint., Brombach und Hauingen liegen östlich der Rheintalflexur, also nicht mehr im Oberrheingraben, sondern in der südlichen, tektonisch höher gelagerten Vorbergzone des Schwarzwaldes, der Schopfheimer Bucht. Brombachs Gemarkung greift auf den Dinkelberg aus, wo die zur Verkarstung neigenden Bänke und Platten des Oberen Muschelkalks das dominierende Gestein sind. Im südöstlichen bewaldeten Teil der Gemarkung hat sich noch Keuper erhalten, auf der Metzelhöhe sogar noch ein Rest Unterjura. Die übrigen Juraschichten, die in der Flexur der Abtragung entgangen sind, wurden von dieser auf dem Dinkelberg bereits gänzlich abgeräumt. (→ Geologie von Brombach) Auch in Brombach weist die Talebene die Gliederung in Niederterrasse und Aue auf. Der alte Dorfkern liegt dabei großenteils auf dem Schwemmfächer des Dorfbaches., Haagen liegt auf einem im Osten nur noch schmalen Niederterrassenstreifen, der sich zwischen dem unteren Lichsenweg und dem Röttler Burgberg buchtartig erweitert.

Mit Einwohnern (Stand ) ist St. Jakob heute der Hauptort des Defereggentals., Die flächenmäßig zweitgrößte Gemeinde des Bezirks ist mit nur 5 Einwohnern pro km² das am dünnsten besiedelte Gebiet Osttirols. Wirtschaftlich ist der Tourismus die wichtigste Einkommensquelle der Bevölkerung. Die Gemeinde zählt nach Matrei in Osttirol die meisten Nächtigungen in Osttirol und ist im Wintertourismus führend., Das Gemeindegebiet umfasst das hintere Defereggental sowie dessen Nebentäler. Umfangreiche Teile des Gemeindegebietes gehören zum Nationalpark Hohe Tauern., Geographie., Lage., St. Jakob in Defereggen liegt im nordwestlichen Osttirol und ist mit einer Fläche von 185,96km² die zweitgrößte Gemeinde im Bezirk Lienz. Mit einem Anteil von rund 123km² am Nationalpark Hohe Tauern stehen zwei Drittel des Gemeindegebiets unter Naturschutz. Die Gemeinde umfasst das westliche, von der Schwarzach durchflossene, Defereggental von der Rotte Feistritz bis zum Talschluss sowie die angrenzenden Nebentäler. St. Jakob in Defereggen ist verwaltungstechnisch in fünf Rotten unterteilt. Der Großteil des besiedelten Gebietes befindet sich linksseitig der Schwarzach. Das Zentrum der Gemeinde mit der Pfarrkirche in der Unterrotte liegt auf einer Höhe von Der höchste Punkt des Gemeindegebietes ist die Rötspitze mit einer Höhe von, Gemeindegliederung., St. Jakob in Defereggen gliedert sich in fünf Rotten, die wiederum in insgesamt 34 Weiler, Hofgruppen und Höfe unterteilt werden. Im Osten des Gemeindegebietes südlich der Schwarzach liegt die Rotte Feistritz, die in Unterfeistritz und Oberfeistritz gegliedert wird. Das übrige, östliche Gemeindegebiet bis zum Tögischer Bachl wird von der Äußeren Großrotte eingenommen. Neben den Weilern St. Leonhard (mit spätgotischer Filialkirche) und Lacken südlich der Schwarzach gehören Unteregg und Tögisch zur Äußeren Großrotte., Westlich der Äußeren Großrotte (Außerrotte) zwischen dem Trojer Almbach im Westen und dem Tögischer Bachl im Osten liegt die Innere Großrotte. Das besiedelte Gebiet dieses Gemeindeteils liegt ausschließlich nördlich der Schwarzach und ist in die Teile Oberegg, Eggemair, Erlach, Mairhof und Hirbe gegliedert. Westlich der Inneren Großrotte befindet sich die Unterrotte mit dem Gemeindemittelpunkt. Hier finden sich zudem die Bereiche Unterkirchen, Obkirchen, Eggen, Trojen, Stock Steingarten und Ede sowie südlich der Schwarzach Sand und Weiden. Westlich schließt sich die Oberrotte an, die den größten Teil des besiedelten Gemeindegebietes umfasst. Zur Oberrotte gehören Unterstein, Jesach, Maik, Trogach, Leiten, Grandeggen, Ranach, Mariahilf (Bruggen), Ladstatt und Erlsbach nördlich der Schwarzach sowie die Weiler Grünmoos, Rinderschinken, Egg und Pötsch im Süden., Flächennutzung., Durch den hohen Gebirgsanteil stehen in St. Jakob Siedlungs- und landwirtschaftliche Nutzflächen nur in geringem Ausmaß zur Verfügung. Der größte Anteil von St. Jakob wird von Almen eingenommen, die 50,4 % des Gemeindegebietes umfassen. 28,3 % entfallen auf unproduktive Flächen, gefolgt von Wäldern (16,7 %) und landwirtschaftlich genutzten Flächen (4,0 %). Gewässer nehmen 0,3 %, Bauflächen, Gebäude, Gärten und begrünte Bauflächen 0,2 % der Gemeindefläche ein., Nachbargemeinden., Die Gemeinde St. Jakob wird im Norden durch die Lasörlinggruppe von den im Virgental gelegenen Gemeinden Prägraten und Virgen (von Westen nach Osten) getrennt. Zu beiden Gemeinden existieren jedoch keine befahrbaren Verbindungen. Im Nordwesten, Westen und Südwesten grenzt St. Jakob an das italienische Staatsgebiet. Prettau, Sand in Taufers, Rasen-Antholz, Gsies sind hier die Nachbargemeinden, wobei lediglich zu Rasen-Antholz über den Staller Sattel eine Straßenverbindung besteht. Auch Innervillgraten im Süden ist nur über das Pustertal erreichbar. Die stärkste Bindung besteht durch die Tallage zu dem im Osten benachbarten St. Veit in Defereggen., Geologie und Morphologie., Der Untergrund der Talsohle sowie der untere Sonnenhang bestehen im Gemeindegebiet von St. Jakob aus Rieserfernertonalit, der die gleichnamige Gebirgsgruppe aufbaut. Das Gestein besteht aus grauem Quarz, weißem Feldspat, Biotit und kurzen Säulen dunkelgrüner Hornblende. Der Tonalit, ein junges Erstarrungsgestein, stammt aus der Phase der Alpenbildung. Der Tonalit wird von Gesteinen des Altkristallins überlagert. Im Norden handelt es sich um rotbraunen Biotitschiefer, der in der Folge von silbernem bis grauem Muskovitxadschiefer abgelöst wird. Dieser Schiefer bildet den Sonnenhang von Keeseck, Alplesspitze und Seespitze (Panargenkamm). Eingehüllt in diese Schieferschichten liegt eine schmale Schiefer- und Quarzitzone mit dunklem Graphit und grellweißem Marmor. Diese Schicht führt teilweise Gold, Silber, Kupfer sowie Eisen und ermöglichte den Bewohnern des Defereggentals über Jahrhunderte ein Einkommen im Bergbau. Die Marmorschicht bildet unter anderem das Weiße Beil () und verläuft parallel zum Tal bis nach Huben. Der Schattenhang im Süden des Tales wird von einem teilweise rötlich-braunen Quarzphyllit gebildet., Der Talboden des hinteren Defereggentals ist von quartären Sedimenten wie Schotter, Sand und Aulehm überdeckt. Darüber hinaus sind auch Hänge mit quartären Gletscherablagerungen (Moränen) zu finden. Die Oberfläche des Defereggentals wurde durch Gletscher („Kees“) geformt, die ein Trogtal mit steilen Hängen, jedoch ohne schroffe Felsen formten. Moränen bildeten stellenweise mächtige Schuttüberdeckungen auf den Sonnenhängen, flache Standorte bestehen nur vereinzelt. Die relativ flache Trogschulter in einer Höhe von rund 2.200 Metern liegt für eine Dauersiedlung bereits zu hoch, wird aber als Almgebiet genutzt. Im Bereich der Filialkirche St. Leonhard schüttete ein Bergsturz aus der Nordflanke des Lepleskofel vor der ersten Besiedelung einen Schuttkegel auf, der die Schwarzach zu einem See aufstaute. Der Schuttkegel wurde im Laufe der Jahrhunderte von der Schwarzach durchsägt, sodass sich in diesem Bereich heute feuchte Talböden befinden., Flüsse und Gewässer., Der Obersee (Staller Sattel) sowie der Oberseitsee (am Fuß der Seespitze) sind die beiden größten und bekanntesten Bergseen der Gemeinde. Bestimmender Fluss im Gemeindegebiet von St. Jakob in Defereggen ist die zum Einzugsgebiet der Drau gehörende Schwarzach, die im Schwarzachtal entspringt und das gesamte Defereggental bis zur Mündung in die Isel durchfließt. Die wesentlichen Zuflüsse der Schwarzach im Bereich von St. Jakob münden rechtsseitig in die Schwarzach. Es sind dies im unbesiedelten Bereich Arventalbach und Patscher Bach sowie im besiedelten Bereich Staller Almbach, Lappbach, Stallerbach und Brugger Almbach. Auch im linksseitigen Bereich münden zahlreiche Bäche in die Schwarzach, bedeutend sind jedoch nur der Trojer Almbach und das Tögischer Bachl. Alle anderen verfügen über ein sehr geringes Einzugsgebiet. Nach den Hochwasserkatastrophen in den 1960er Jahren fanden an der Schwarzach umfangreiche Hochwasserschutzverbauungen statt. 2007 wurde auch in Maria Hilf mit Regulierungsmaßnahmen begonnen. Trotz der Eingriffe in das Flusssystem und der Trockenlegung von Talwiesen blieben im Bereich des Brugger Almbaches und des Stallerbaches ökologisch wertvolle Überschwemmungsgebiete erhalten., Gebirge., St. Jakob liegt im Gebiet der Hohen Tauern (Zentralalpen). Das Gemeindegebiet wird im Süden von den Villgratner Bergen, im Norden von der Venedigergruppe und im Westen von der Rieserfernergruppe begrenzt. Zu den wichtigsten Erhebungen in den Villgratner Bergen auf Seiten von St. Jakob zählt das Deferegger Pfannhorn (). Im Bereich der Villgratner Berge liegt auch der Staller Sattel, der St. Jakob mit Italien (Antholz) verbindet. Im Norden begrenzen der Panargenkamm und die Lasörlinggruppe, beides südliche Ausläufer der Venedigergruppe, das Gemeindegebiet von St. Jakob. Im Bereich des Panargenkamms zwischen dem Talschluss des Defereggentals und dem Trojeralmtal liegen mehrere Berge mit mehr als 3.000 Metern, wobei lediglich die Seespitze () durch einen Wanderweg erschlossen ist. Höchster Gipfel des Gebirgskammes ist das noch teilweise vergletscherte Keeseck (). Auch in der Lasörlinggruppe, die den Panargenkamm im Norden und Osten umschließt, liegen zahlreiche Berge über 3.000 Meter. Hier befinden sich, mit den stark vergletscherten Gipfeln, die Rötspitze () und die Daberspitze (), die höchsten Berge der Gemeinde. St. Jakob verfügt im Westen als einzige Gemeinde Österreichs über einen Anteil an der Rieserfernergruppe. Höchste Erhebungen in diesem Bereich sind der Hochgall (), dessen Spitze knapp jenseits der Staatsgrenze in Südtirol liegt und gemeinsam mit dem Almerhorn () den Talschluss bildet, sowie die Barmerspitze () und der Lenkstein (), in dessen Bereich der größte Gletscher des Gemeindegebietes, der Fleischbachkees, liegt., Klima., Trotz der beträchtlichen Höhenlage ist das Gemeindegebiet durch die Ost-West-Ausrichtung des Defereggentals und der damit verbundenen längeren Sonneneinstrahlung klimatisch begünstigt. Die mittlere Jahrestemperatur beträgt in St. Jakob 3,0°C und ist im Jahresverlauf starken Schwankungen unterworfen sowie von einer raschen Wärmezunahme im Frühjahr und einer schnellen Wärmeabnahme im Herbst gekennzeichnet. So unterscheidet sich die mittlere Temperatur zwischen Februar und März sowie September und Oktober jeweils um rund 5°C. Die gemessenen Temperaturextreme liegen zwischen +32,1°C und −29,8°C. Durch die Ost-West-Ausrichtung des Tales liegt St. Jakob in einer windgeschützten Lage, da die Winde in Osttirol üblicherweise in Nord-Süd-Richtung oder umgekehrt wehen. Vom Ort erstreckt sich talauswärts ein kleines inneralpines Becken, in welchem sich im Winter häufig ein Kaltluftsee infolge einer Inversionswetterlage bildet. Die durchschnittliche Niederschlagsmenge beträgt in St. Jakob 923,6mm pro Jahr und liegt im Durchschnitt Osttirols. Die höchsten Niederschlagsmengen fallen in den Sommermonaten zwischen Juni und August. Dabei fällt in St. Jakob fast jeden zweiten oder dritten Tag ein starker Regen, eine längere, durchgehende Regenperiode ist hingegen selten.

Während er heute nur noch in Afrika südlich der Sahara heimisch ist, war er in früheren Zeiten auch in Westasien beheimatet. Für den Menschen war der Strauß wegen seiner Federn, seines Fleisches und seines Leders seit jeher von Interesse, was in vielen Regionen zur Ausrottung des Vogels führte., Merkmale., Die Männchen des Straußes sind bis zu 250Zentimeter hoch und haben ein Gewicht bis zu 135Kilogramm. Weibchen sind kleiner: Sie sind 175 bis 190 Zentimeter hoch und 90 bis 110Kilogramm schwer., Die Männchen, Hähne genannt, haben ein schwarzes Gefieder. Davon setzen sich die Schwungfedern der Flügel und der Schwanz weiß ab. Die Weibchen, Hennen genannt, tragen dagegen ein erdbraunes Gefieder; Flügel und Schwanz sind bei ihnen heller und haben eine weißlichgraue Farbe. Das Jugendkleid ähnelt dem Aussehen des Weibchens, ohne die charakteristische Absetzung von Flügeln und Schwanz. Frisch geschlüpfte Küken sind dagegen rehbraun, ihr Daunenkleid weist dunkle Tupfen auf. Die Daunen des Rückengefieders sind igelartig borstig aufgestellt. Die nackten Beine sowie der Hals sind je nach Unterart grau, graublau oder rosafarben. Beim Männchen leuchtet die Haut während der Brutzeit besonders intensiv., Der Strauß hat einen langen, überwiegend nackten Hals. Der Kopf ist in Relation zum Körper klein. Die Augen sind mit einem Durchmesser von 5 Zentimetern die größten aller Landwirbeltiere. Das Becken der Strauße ist ventral durch eine Schambeinfuge (\\"Symphysis pubica\\") geschlossen. Dies ist nur bei straußenartigen Vögeln so. Es wird von den drei spangenartigen Beckenknochen (Darmbein, Sitzbein, Schambein) gebildet, zwischen denen große Öffnungen bestehen, die durch Bindegewebe und Muskulatur verschlossen sind. Der Strauß hat sehr lange Beine mit einer kräftigen Laufmuskulatur. Seine Höchstgeschwindigkeit beträgt etwa 70km/h; eine Geschwindigkeit von 50km/h kann der Strauß etwa eine halbe Stunde halten. Als Anpassung an die hohe Laufgeschwindigkeit besitzt der Fuß, einzigartig bei Vögeln, nur zwei Zehen (\\"Didactylie\\"). Zudem können die Beine als wirkungsvolle Waffen eingesetzt werden: Beide Zehen tragen Krallen, von denen die an der größeren, inneren Zehe bis zu 10 cm lang ist., Skelett., Das Brustbein trägt wie bei allen Straußenartigen keinen Brustbeinkamm. Dadurch wirkt es platt und flach wie ein Floß (lateinisch \\"Ratis\\"), weshalb diese Vogelgruppe auch als Ratiten bezeichnet wird. Wie alle Vögel besitzt der Strauß einen vollständigen Schultergürtel. Eine Besonderheit ist die starke Verschmelzung von Rabenbein (\\"Os coracoideum\\") und Schlüsselbein (\\"Clavicula\\"), zwischen denen lediglich ein ovales Loch offen bleibt. Die Flügel sind für Laufvögel recht groß, aber wie bei allen Laufvögeln nicht zum Fliegen geeignet. Das Eigengewicht eines Straußes liegt weit über dem Gewicht, das es einem Vogel noch ermöglichen würde, sich in die Luft zu erheben. Die Flügel dienen stattdessen zur Balz, zum Schattenspenden und zum Halten des Gleichgewichts beim schnellen Laufen. Als einziger rezenter Vogel hat der Strauß an allen drei Fingern Krallen., Stimme., Zu den typischsten Lautgebungen des Straußes gehört ein Ruf des Männchens, der dem Brüllen eines Löwen ähnelt. Ein tiefes „bu bu buuuuu huuu“ wird mehrmals wiederholt. Der Laut wird bei der Balz und beim Austragen von Rangstreitigkeiten ausgestoßen. Daneben sind Strauße beiderlei Geschlechts zu pfeifenden, schnaubenden und knurrenden Lauten in der Lage. Nur junge Straußenküken geben auch melodischere Rufe von sich, die dazu dienen, das Muttertier auf sich aufmerksam zu machen., Verbreitung und Lebensraum., Das natürliche Verbreitungsgebiet des Straußes ist Afrika, insbesondere Ost- und Südafrika. Ausgestorben ist er auf der Arabischen Halbinsel, in Westasien sowie in Afrika nördlich der Sahara., Strauße leben in offenen Landschaften wie Savannen und Wüsten. Sie bevorzugen Habitate mit kurzem Gras und nicht zu hohem Baumbestand; wo das Gras höher als einen Meter wächst, fehlen Strauße. Gelegentlich dringen sie in Buschland vor, bleiben dort aber nicht lange, da sie an schneller Fortbewegung gehindert werden und dort nicht weit blicken können. Reine Wüsten ohne Vegetation eignen sich nicht als ständiger Lebensraum, werden aber auf Wanderungen durchquert. Weil Strauße ihren gesamten Flüssigkeitsbedarf aus der Nahrung beziehen können, benötigen sie keinen Zugang zum Wasser, und lange Trockenperioden sind ebenfalls kein Problem für sie., Afrikanische Strauße wurden erstmals 1869 nach Australien eingeführt, weitere Importe folgten in den 1880er Jahren. Mit den importierten Straußen sollten in Australien Farmen für die Belieferung der Modeindustrie mit Federn aufgebaut werden. Bereits vor der Jahrhundertwende gab es verwilderte Strauße, deren Ansiedlung auf einigen Farmen gezielt gefördert wurde. 1890 lebten 626 Strauße in der Nähe von Port Augusta und der Stadt Meningie, 1912 betrug die Zahl 1.345 Individuen. Nachdem die Nachfrage nach Straußenfedern nach Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges zusammenbrach, kam es zu weiteren Freilassungen, die Zahl der ausgewilderten Strauße ist jedoch nicht bekannt. Im australischen Bundesstaat Western Australia konnten sich Strauße freilebend nicht etablieren, in New South Wales vermehrten sich in den Regionen, in denen Strauße ausgewildert wurden, diese Strauße in den ersten Jahren, der Bestand blieb dann über einige Zeit stabil und nahm dann stetig ab. In vielen Regionen, in denen Strauße über mehrere Jahre lebten, waren sie in der Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts wieder verschwunden. Nördlich von Port Augusta gab es in den 1970er Jahren noch einen Bestand von 150 bis 200 Straußen. Während der langanhaltenden Dürre von 1980 bis 1982 starben die meisten dieser Vögel. Nach 1982 wurden dort nur noch 25 bis 30 Strauße gezählt., Mit der Unterart \\"Struthio camelus camelus\\" wurden im 20. Jahrhundert in Vorderasien partiell Aussiedlungsversuche unternommen. Eine Population lebt im Mahazat-as-Sayd-Schutzgebiet in Saudi-Arabien, eine weitere im Reservat Hai Bar in Israel., Lebensweise., Strauße sind tagaktive Vögel, die besonders in den Dämmerungsstunden aktiv sind. In Zeiten mit knappem Nahrungsangebot müssen sie große Wanderungen unternehmen und sind in der Lage, in der Mittagssonne zu wandern. Nachts ruhen sie, wobei sie für gewöhnlich die Hälse aufrecht und die Augen geschlossen halten. Nur für kurze Tiefschlafphasen werden Hals und Kopf auf das Rückengefieder oder auf den Boden gebettet., Außerhalb der Brutzeit leben Strauße für gewöhnlich in lockeren Verbänden, die zwei bis fünf, in manchen Gegenden aber auch hundert und mehr Tiere umfassen können. In Wüstengegenden sammeln sich bis zu 680 Tiere um Wasserlöcher. Der Zusammenhalt der Straußenverbände ist locker, denn die Mitglieder der Gruppe kommen und gehen nach Belieben. Oft sieht man auch einzelne Strauße. Trotzdem gibt es innerhalb der Gruppen klare Hierarchien. Rangstreitigkeiten werden meistens durch Drohlaute und Drohgebärden geregelt; dabei werden Flügel und Schwanzfedern aufgestellt und der Hals aufrecht gehalten. Der rangniedrigere Vogel zeigt seine Unterwerfung, indem er den Hals U-förmig biegt und den Kopf nach unten hält; auch Flügel und Schwanz zeigen nach unten. Selten kann eine Rangstreitigkeit auch in einen kurzen Kampf münden., Zur Fortpflanzungszeit lösen sich die losen Verbände auf und geschlechtsreife Männchen beginnen mit dem Sammeln eines Harems., Ernährung., Strauße sind vorwiegend Pflanzenfresser, nehmen gelegentlich aber auch Insekten und andere Kleintiere zu sich. Vorwiegend fressen sie Körner, Gräser, Kräuter, Blätter, Blüten und Früchte. Insekten, wie Raupen und Heuschrecken, sind nur Beikost. Bevorzugt wird Nahrung, die vom Boden aufgepickt werden kann. Nur ausnahmsweise werden Blätter oder Früchte von Sträuchern oder Bäumen abgelesen. Strauße können ihre Nahrung optimal verwerten, wofür ein 14Meter langer Darm sorgt. Der Muskelmagen kann bis zu 1300Gramm Nahrung aufnehmen. Um die Zerkleinerung der Nahrung zu fördern, schlucken Strauße Sand und Steine (Gastrolithen) und haben die Neigung, alle möglichen kleinen Objekte aufzupicken, die ähnliche Zwecke erfüllen könnten. In Straußenmägen wurden daher schon Münzen, Nägel und ähnliche Gegenstände gefunden. Bis zu 45Prozent des Muskelmagen-Inhalts können solche als Verdauungshilfe geschluckten Materialien betragen., Feinde., Die wichtigsten Feinde des Straußes sind Löwen, Leoparden und Geparde. Indem sich Strauße meistens in Gruppen aufhalten, schützen sie sich durch gemeinsame Beobachtung vor der Gefahr. Dadurch verringert sich für den einzelnen Vogel das Risiko, als Beute auserwählt zu werden; zudem hat jedes Gruppenmitglied mehr Zeit zum Fressen. In den Savannen schließen sich Strauße oft den Herden von Zebras und Gazellen an, da diese Tiere wachsam nach denselben Raubtieren Ausschau halten., „Kopf im Sand“., Eine alte Redensart besagt, dass der Strauß bei Bedrohung durch Feinde „den Kopf in den Sand steckt“. Tatsächlich rettet sich der Strauß, der sehr schnell laufen kann, meist durch Davonlaufen. Er ist aber auch in der Lage, sich mit einem gezielten Tritt zu verteidigen, der einen Löwen oder einen Menschen zu töten vermag. Vor allem brütende Strauße legen sich jedoch bei nahender Gefahr oft auf den Boden und halten Hals und Kopf dabei gerade ausgestreckt. Da aus der Ferne der flach am Boden liegende Hals nicht mehr zu sehen ist, könnte dieses Verhalten zu der Legende geführt haben. Denkbar wäre auch, dass man bei der Beobachtung von Straußen auf größere Distanz durch flirrende Luft über heißem Steppenboden einer optischen Täuschung erlegen ist. Bei diesem Effekt „verschwindet“ der Kopf grasender Strauße optisch für den entfernten Betrachter., Fortpflanzung., Revier, Balz, Begattung und Gelege., Die Paarungszeit ist in unterschiedlichen Regionen Afrikas sehr verschieden.

Jahrhundert), Historische Verfassung, Konflikt 1919, Politik (Finnland), Rechtsgeschichte (Finnland), Rechtsquelle (20. Jahrhundert)], Die finnische Verfassung von 1919 war die erste Verfassung der seit dem 6. Dezember 1917 unabhängigen Republik Finnland. Sie trat am 17. Juli 1919 in Kraft und ersetzte die noch aus schwedischer Zeit stammende gustavianische Verfassung von 1772. Sie blieb in ihren wesentlichen Zügen unverändert, bis sie am 1. März 2000 durch eine neue Verfassung abgelöst wurde. Als Resultat eines langen Streits zwischen republikanischen und monarchistischen Strömungen sah die republikanische Verfassung ein Staatsoberhaupt mit umfassenden Rechten vor, die an die früheren Monarchenrechte angelehnt waren., Entstehungsgeschichte., Der zur Verabschiedung der Verfassung von 1919 führende Prozess wurde durch die Abdankung des russischen Zaren Nikolaus II. eingeleitet. Die folgenden Verfassungsdebatten drehten sich in erster Linie um das Verhältnis zu Russland, die Frage der Staatsform und die Position des Parlaments. Politische Entwicklungen im Inneren und Äußeren gaben der Debatte immer wieder neue Richtungen, bis schließlich am 17. Juli 1919 eine republikanische Verfassung mit einem ungewöhnlich starken Präsidentenamt in Kraft trat und die Republik Finnland entstand., Zugehörigkeit zu Russland als Verfassungsfrage., Finnland war seit 1809 ein autonomes Großfürstentum im russischen Zarenreich. Während dieser Zeit hatte die Verfassung aus der früheren, schwedischen Zeit im Wesentlichen fortgegolten. Sie bestand in erster Linie aus der unter König Gustav III. erlassenen Verfassung von 1772, ergänzt durch die 1789 durch den sogenannten Vereinigungs- und Sicherheitsbrief gemachten Änderungen. Die aus der schwedischen Zeit hergebrachte Volksvertretung, der ständische Reichstag, wurde mit der Reichstagsordnung von 1906 durch ein in gleicher Wahl gewähltes Einkammerparlament ersetzt. Das oberste Verwaltungsorgan stellte in Finnland der Senat dar, dessen Mitglieder durch den Zaren bestimmt und diesem verantwortlich waren. Der Senat bestand aus zwei Abteilungen, der Rechts- und der Wirtschaftsabteilung. Erstere fungierte als oberstes Gericht, letztere war eine Art Regierung., Zar Nikolaus II., Staatsoberhaupt des Großfürstentums wie des Gesamtreiches, verzichtete am 15. März 1917 als Folge der Februarrevolution auf den Thron. Die Regierungsgewalt wurde von einer parlamentarisch ernannten Provisorischen Regierung übernommen. Dies warf in Finnland umgehend die Verfassungsfrage auf, nachdem die überlieferte schwedische Verfassung zentral auf dem Vorhandensein eines Monarchen aufbaute. Politisch wie juristisch war zunächst vor allem umstritten, wie sich der Wegfall des Großfürsten auf die Zugehörigkeit Finnlands zum Russischen Reich auswirkte., Die Provisorische Regierung beharrte rigoros auf dem Standpunkt, dass die Union zwischen Russland und Finnland weiterhin bindend sei und sie nur durch ausdrücklichen Vertrag gelöst werden könne. Die Mehrheit der finnischen Politiker in allen Parteien sah dagegen für eine Union ohne den gemeinsamen Monarchen keine Grundlage. Allerdings befürwortete die Mehrheit in den bürgerlichen Parteien eine Verhandlungslösung mit der russischen Regierung. Dieser kooperative Standpunkt wurde gestützt durch juristische Gutachten des Staatsrechtlers und Politikers Rabbe Axel Wrede, denen zufolge auch ohne den Zaren zwischen Finnland und dem Russischen Reich eine legitime staatsrechtliche Bindung bestehe. Die radikaleren Verfechter der Unabhängigkeit konnten sich auf das staatsrechtliche Gutachten des namhaften Professors Rafael Erich stützen, nach dessen Ansicht die Beziehung zu Russland eine reine Personalunion war, die nach der Abdankung des Zaren ohne Weiteres als aufgelöst zu betrachten sei., Unter Parlamentsmacht zur Unabhängigkeit., Die juristische Diskussion wurde bald von der politischen Entwicklung überrollt. Das von einer sozialdemokratischen Mehrheit geführte Finnische Parlament verabschiedete am 18. Juli 1917 das „Staatsgesetz“, mit dem es erklärte, die oberste Macht in Finnland nunmehr selbst auszuüben. Die zwischenzeitlich wieder erstarkte russische Provisorische Regierung löste im Einverständnis mit den finnischen Bürgerlichen das Parlament auf, und der paritätisch mit Sozialdemokraten und Bürgerlichen besetzte Senat beugte sich dieser Entscheidung gegen den Widerstand der Sozialisten. In der Neuwahl im Oktober verloren Letztere ihre Mehrheit. Gleichzeitig stürzte in Russland die Provisorische Regierung und die Bolschewiki ergriffen die Macht., Auch die zuvor auf eine Kooperation mit Russland drängenden bürgerlichen Politiker Finnlands wollten Lenins Regierung nicht als Erben der kaiserlichen Macht ansehen. Zum zentralen Streitpunkt wurde nun die Frage, in wessen Hände die zuvor dem Zaren zugestandene Macht gelegt werden solle. Während die Sozialdemokraten darauf bestanden, dass entsprechend dem Staatsgesetz die oberste Staatsgewalt durch das Parlament ausgeübt werde, beriefen sich die Konservativen auf §38 der Verfassung von 1772. Diese für den Fall des Erlöschens eines Herrscherhauses geschaffene Vorschrift sah vor, dass für die Übergangszeit ein Reichsverweserausschuss die königlichen Befugnisse halten solle., In der Sitzung des Parlaments am 9. November standen sich drei Vorschläge gegenüber. Die Sozialdemokraten verlangten die rückwirkende Inkraftsetzung des Staatsgesetzes, was gleichzeitig die Ungesetzlichkeit des neuen Parlaments bedeutet hätte. Die konservativen Parteien beantragten die Einsetzung eines Reichsverweserausschusses. Der Kompromissvorschlag von Santeri Alkio vom Landbund sah die Ratifizierung des Staatsgesetzes ohne Rückwirkung vor. Die Tagesordnung sah vor, dass im ersten Abstimmungsgang zwischen den beiden Varianten des Staatsgesetzes gewählt werden und der Sieger dieser Abstimmung gegen die Reichsverweservariante antreten solle. Die Konservativen konnten an diesem Tag erreichen, dass sich ihr Vorschlag durchsetzte, indem sie im ersten Abstimmungsgang für den sozialdemokratischen Antrag stimmten und so sicherstellten, dass als Gegenvorschlag im zweiten Wahlgang nur eine Variante zur Verfügung stand, welcher der Landbund nicht zustimmen konnte., Die endgültige Bestimmung der Reichsverweser wurde jedoch verschoben. Unterdessen waren die Unruhen im Land immer bedrohlicher geworden. Am 14. November rief die Arbeiterbewegung einen Generalstreik aus. Unter dem Eindruck des Streiks und zahlreicher damit zusammenhängender Gewalttaten trat am 15. November das Parlament erneut zusammen. Mit den Stimmen der Sozialdemokraten und gemäßigter Konservativer verabschiedete es schließlich einen erneuten Kompromissvorschlag Alkios:, Finnland blieb damit vorläufig ohne formelles Staatsoberhaupt, hatte sich aber gleichzeitig faktisch von Russland gelöst. Die förmliche Unabhängigkeitserklärung des finnischen Parlaments vom 6. Dezember 1917 und die Anerkennung der Souveränität Finnlands durch Sowjetrussland am 4. Januar 1918 vollendeten den Ablösungsprozess., Monarchistische Entwicklung des Jahres 1918., Abgesehen von der Übernahme der Monarchenrechte durch das Parlament blieben die alten Institutionen zunächst bestehen. Die Regierung bildete der Senat, dessen Wirtschaftsabteilung als Regierungschef Pehr Evind Svinhufvud vorstand. Die weitere Klärung der verfassungsrechtlichen Fragen wurde durch die inneren Spannungen und den am 27. Januar 1918 ausbrechenden Bürgerkrieg in den Hintergrund gedrängt. Als der Bürgerkrieg schließlich zu Ende war, trat das Parlament am 15. Mai mit einem neuen Gesicht zusammen: Bis auf einen Abgeordneten fehlten alle sozialdemokratischen Volksvertreter., Die so unter sich gebliebenen bürgerlichen Parteien waren sich einig, dass es mit der weiterhin geltenden gustavianischen Verfassung nicht vereinbar sei, dass die Volksvertretung die oberste Staatsgewalt ausübe. Stattdessen verlangte die Verfassung die Wahl eines neuen Königs. Als Übergangslösung orientierte sich das Parlament an der in der ausgehenden Kalmarer Union üblichen Praxis, als Stellvertreter des Königs einen Reichsverweser einzusetzen. Ohne diesen Titel offiziell zu verwenden, bestimmte das Parlament den Senatsvorsitzenden Svinhufvud zum Träger der obersten Staatsgewalt. Zum neuen Senatsvorsitzenden berief dieser Juho Kusti Paasikivi., Sowohl Svinhufvud als auch Paasikivi waren entschiedene Monarchisten. Der neue Senat begann mit der Vorbereitung einer neuen, monarchistischen Verfassung. Für diese Richtungsentscheidung sprachen neben der staatspolitischen Überzeugung der Protagonisten auch außenpolitische Gründe. Die Regierung der bürgerlichen Seite hatte im Bürgerkrieg substanzielle Hilfe der deutschen Armee erhalten und sich in diesem Zuge auch vertraglich eng an Deutschland gebunden. Auch der neue finnische König sollte der deutschen Kaiserfamilie entstammen. Nachdem Prinz Oskar von Preußen, Sohn des Kaisers Wilhelm II., abgelehnt hatte, fiel die Wahl auf den mit der Kaiserfamilie verschwägerten Friedrich Karl von Hessen., Die monarchistische Richtung war unter den Parlamentsparteien jedoch nicht unumstritten. Insbesondere der Landbund unter Santeri Alkio war nachdrücklich republikanisch eingestellt, aber auch Teile der Jungfinnischen Partei, führend unter ihnen Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg zählten zum republikanischen Lager. Dieses konnte sich besonders auf die Unabhängigkeitserklärung vom 6. Dezember 1917 berufen, in welcher ausdrücklich eine republikanische Verfassung angekündigt worden war. Der Senat legte dem Parlament im Juni den Entwurf für eine monarchistische Verfassung vor, die starke republikanische Opposition verhinderte aber in drei Wahlgängen bis zum August das Zustandekommen der notwendigen Fünfsechstelmehrheit. Daraufhin berief sich der Senat auf die weiterhin gültige Verfassung von 1772 und ließ auf deren Grundlage eine Königswahl durchführen. So wurde Friedrich Karl am 9. Oktober 1918 zum König Finnlands gewählt., Republik mit monarchistischem Einschlag., Erneut wurde die Verfassungsdebatte von den äußeren Ereignissen überholt. Der Zusammenbruch der deutschen Kriegführung und die Abdankung des Kaisers Wilhelm II. am 9. November 1918 entzogen der finnischen Krone des Deutschen Friedrich Karl den Boden. Svinhufvud und Paasikivi wandten sich nun an den ehemaligen Oberbefehlshaber der Armee, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, der im Mai unter anderem wegen seiner kritischen Haltung an der Deutschlandorientierung der Regierung seinen Rücktritt eingereicht hatte und nun die Beziehungen zu den Ententemächten verbessern sollte. Paasikivis Senat wurde am 27. November durch eine neue Regierung unter Lauri Ingman ersetzt.

Mit 62 zwischen 1972 und 1992 auf Kiel gelegten Einheiten ist sie die zahlenmäßig größte Klasse von Atom-U-Booten, die bislang in Dienst gestellt wurde. Die Einheiten werden bis weit ins 21. Jahrhundert das Gros der US-amerikanischen U-Boot-Flotte ausmachen., Der Entwurf der \\"Los-Angeles-Klasse\\" wurde während der Bauzeit modifiziert, so dass insgesamt drei Baulose, genannt \\"Flights\\", existieren. Einheiten der \\"Los-Angeles-Klasse\\" dienen in jeder Flugzeugträgerkampfgruppe der US Navy als Geleitschutz, sie können jedoch auch für Angriffe auf Landziele und zur Aufklärung eingesetzt werden., Geschichte., Planung., Ende der 1960er Jahre wurde in der US Navy der Ruf nach einem Nachfolger für die \\"Sturgeon-Klasse\\" laut. Es gab jedoch früh Streit über die Ausrichtung der neuen Klasse. Das Marine-Oberkommando hatte vom Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) einen Entwurf bekommen, der unter dem Namen \\"Conform\\" bekannt war. Dieser stellte eine geringe Geräuschentwicklung und hohen Komfort für die Besatzung in den Mittelpunkt. Admiral Hyman Rickover, der sogenannte \\"Vater der Nuklearmarine\\", favorisierte dagegen einen eigenen Entwurf, der vor allem auf hohe Geschwindigkeit setzte. Diese U-Boote sollten nach Rickovers Vorstellungen in der Lage sein, mit den nuklear getriebenen Flugzeugträgern mitzuhalten, um diese direkt zu unterstützen. Dafür wären Geschwindigkeiten von bis zu 35 Knoten notwendig gewesen, was beim NAVSEA auf wenig Verständnis stieß., Die Entscheidung zugunsten des Rickover-Entwurfs wurde schließlich aufgrund eines Ereignisses von Anfang des Jahres 1969 gefällt: Die \\"USS Enterprise (CVN-65)\\" war zu diesem Zeitpunkt auf dem Weg zu einem Einsatz in Vietnam, als der Marinegeheimdienst erfuhr, dass ein sowjetisches U-Boot der \\"November-Klasse\\" aus seinem Hafen auf der Halbinsel Kamtschatka ausgelaufen war, um die \\"Big E\\" (Spitzname der Enterprise) abzufangen. Das Oberkommando der Navy ordnete an, dass der Träger und seine Kampfgruppe dem feindlichen U-Boot mit hoher Geschwindigkeit davonfahren solle. Weil das gegnerische U-Boot mithielt und das Absetzen auch bei Geschwindigkeiten von über 30Knoten nicht gelang, brach die \\"Enterprise\\" die Hochgeschwindigkeitsfahrt ab. Dieser Vorfall machte dem Oberkommando der Navy klar, dass die Sowjetunion bereits sehr schnelle U-Boote besaß, und daher fiel die Entscheidung für die von Admiral Rickover geforderte Klasse schneller Jagd-U-Boote., Die Navy verlangte von Rickover, die Finanzierung von zwölf dieser Boote im US-Kongress durchzusetzen. Zu diesem Zweck brach Rickover mit der alten Marinetradition, U-Boote nach Meerestieren zu benennen, und beeinflusste zwölf Kongressabgeordnete in ihrer Entscheidung, indem er ihnen vorschlug, die Boote nach ihren Heimatstädten zu benennen. Der Legende nach überzeugte er sie mit den Worten \\"\\", zu deutsch., Bau., Die Boote unterschieden sich allerdings vom ursprünglichen Konzept Rickovers, da der vorgesehene S6G-Druckwasserreaktor zu schwer für dessen Entwurf wurde. Um dies auszugleichen, wurde die Materialstärke des Rumpfes verringert, was die maximale Tauchtiefe auf etwa 1000 Fuß (etwa 300 Meter) reduzierte. Außerdem wurde Platz für die Besatzung gestrichen, sodass mehr Seeleute das Prinzip der \\"warmen Koje\\" (englisch: \\"hot bunking\\") praktizieren mussten, also das Teilen einer Koje mit einem Kameraden, wobei je einer schläft und einer Wache hat., Der Auftrag über die ersten zwölf Boote der Klasse ging an die Werft \\"Electric Boat\\", ein Tochterunternehmen von General Dynamics in Groton, Connecticut. Die Kostenkalkulation von Electric Boat basierte auf Folgeaufträgen, um die Entwicklungskosten zu amortisieren. Diese blieben jedoch aus, vor allem, da die Schweißnähte an einigen Booten nicht den Vorgaben der Navy entsprachen und demzufolge in erheblichem Umfang nachgebessert werden mussten. Diese Mängel führten unter anderem dazu, dass fünf der ersten zwölf Los-Angeles-Einheiten bei \\"Newport News Shipbuilding\\" in Newport News, Virginia gebaut wurden. Die Navy entzog Electric Boat den Exklusivvertrag, musste allerdings große Teile der angefallenen Kosten selbst bezahlen. Von den restlichen 19Booten, die bis 1977 gefertigt wurden, sind dennoch elf bei Electric Boat gebaut worden, nachdem das Unternehmen seine technischen Probleme zwischenzeitlich in den Griff bekommen hatte. Die anderen acht Einheiten wurden von Newport News Shipbuilding auf Kiel gelegt und gefertigt. Damit war das Bauprogramm vorerst abgeschlossen., Als Ronald Reagan 1980 sein Programm \\"Marine der 600 Schiffe\\" vorstellte, war in diesem ein neues Bauvorhaben für weitere Einheiten der \\"Los-Angeles-Klasse\\" enthalten. Es wurde eine verbesserte Version, genannt \\"FlightII\\", in Auftrag gegeben. Diese erhielten zusätzliche vertikale Startrohre für Marschflugkörper. In einer dritten Modifikationsstufe ab 1985 (\\"FlightIII\\", die sogenannten 688(I) für \\"improved\\", zu deutsch: verbessert) wurden nochmals 23 Einheiten gefertigt, die neben einem verbesserten Reaktor auch eine günstigere Anordnung der Tiefenruder erhielten., Während die ersten beiden Baulose noch traditionell gebaut wurden, wurde ab \\"USS Scranton (SSN-756)\\" ein Modulbauverfahren angewendet, bei dem die einzelnen Bauabschnitte schon einen großen Teil ihrer Innenausrüstung erhielten und danach zusammengeschweißt wurden. Aus diesem Grund gab es beginnend mit SSN-756 die klassische Kiellegung nicht mehr – diese Boote liefen nicht mehr in der klassischen Weise vom Stapel, stattdessen wurde das Baudock geflutet und das Boot ausgeschwommen., Einheiten., Die erste Einheit der Klasse, die ihr auch den Namen gab, war die \\"USS Los Angeles (SSN-688)\\". Sie wurde im Januar 1971 bestellt und im November 1976 an die Marine ausgeliefert. Die letzte Einheit der Klasse, die \\"USS Cheyenne (SSN-773)\\", wurde im November 1989 bestellt und ist seit 1996 in Dienst. Insgesamt wurden 62 Einheiten gefertigt., Als erste wurde Anfang 1995 die \\"USS Baton Rouge (SSN-689)\\" außer Dienst gestellt, bis 2023 folgten weitere 31 Einheiten., Die Rumpfnummern der Boote laufen von SSN-688 bis SSN-725 und SSN-750 bis SSN-773. Dazwischen liegen auf SSBN-726 bis SSBN-743 die 14 SSBN- und 4 SSGN-U-Boote der \\"Ohio-Klasse\\", die Nummern 744 bis 749 wurden nicht vergeben., Alle Einheiten wurden nach Städten der Vereinigten Staaten benannt; lediglich SSN-709 wurde \\"USS Hyman G. Rickover\\" getauft, um den Initiator dieser U-Boot-Klasse zu ehren., Kosten., Der Bau einer Einheit kostet, den Geldwert von 1990 zugrunde gelegt, rund 900Mio. US-Dollar. Die Betriebskosten für ein Boot liegen laut \\"Navy Visibility and Management of Operating and Support Costs\\" bei etwa 21Mio. US-Dollar jährlich. Allerdings müssen die erheblichen Kosten für den Austausch der nuklearen Brennelemente des Reaktors bei \\"FlightI\\"-Einheiten ungefähr alle 15 bis 20 Jahre berücksichtigt werden. Auch aus diesem Grund wurden einige der frühen Boote der Los-Angeles-Klasse bereits nach dieser Zeitspanne außer Dienst gestellt. Die Kosten für eine Grundüberholung mit Brennelementwechsel liegen bei rund 406Mio. US-Dollar. Die Ersparnis gegenüber dieser \\"Engineered Refueling Overhaul\\" liegt bei knapp 210Mio. US-Dollar, da die Außerdienststellungkosten mit zirka 196Mio. US-Dollar zu Buche schlagen., Zukunft., Im Jahre 1995 wurde die erste Einheit der Klasse außer Dienst gestellt, weitere Einheiten des \\"FlightI\\" folgten. Es ist zu erwarten, dass die modifizierten Boote des \\"FlightII\\" und \\"688(I)\\" bis weit ins 21. Jahrhundert hinein im Dienst verbleiben. Ursprünglich waren 30 Jahre Dienstzeit vorgesehen, allerdings zeigen Erfahrungen mit Booten der \\"Sturgeon-Klasse\\", dass Dienstzeitverlängerungen um bis zu zehn Jahre möglich und realistisch sind. Zusammen mit einer Werftliegezeit von etwa zwei Jahren für die notwendigen Arbeiten sind somit Gesamteinsatzzeiten von 42 Jahren realisierbar., Der direkte Nachfolger der Los-Angeles-Klasse, die \\"Seawolf-Klasse\\", besteht aus lediglich drei Einheiten, da ein Weiterbau dieser Klasse nicht zuletzt aufgrund der enormen Stückkosten nicht zu finanzieren war. Von der neuesten Klasse von Jagd-U-Booten, der \\"Virginia\\"-Klasse, sind im Jahre 2012 erst neun Einheiten in Dienst gestellt. Es ist geplant, diese Zahl bis 2020 auf 30 zu steigern. Aufgrund der hohen Kosten beider Modelle –um zwei Mrd. US-Dollar pro Einheit– ist jedoch eine Reduzierung des Bauprogramms nicht auszuschließen., Aus diesen Gründen kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass die \\"Los-Angeles-Klasse\\" bis etwa 2025 den größten Teil der U-Boot-Flotte der US Navy stellen wird., Technik., Die Einheiten der \\"Los-Angeles-Klasse\\" sind atombetriebene Unterseeboote, die für Geleitschutz, U-Boot-Jagd, Angriffe gegen Landziele mit konventionellen Marschflugkörpern, SEAL-Kommandounternehmen und Aufklärungszwecke eingesetzt werden. Angetrieben werden sie von einem Druckwasser-Kernreaktor, der eine einzelne Schraube am Heck antreibt., Rumpf., Der Rumpf der Boote der \\"Los-Angeles-Klasse\\" ist bei einer Breite von 10 Metern etwa 110 Meter lang. Er besteht aus einer zylindrischen Röhre, die am Bug mit einem halbrunden Deckel abgeschlossen ist und zum Heck konisch verjüngend ausläuft. Diese Bauweise hat im Vergleich zu einem „Albacore-Rumpf“ geringe Nachteile für die Manövrierfähigkeit, ist jedoch erheblich leichter zu bauen und ermöglicht höhere Geschwindigkeit durch einen geringeren Strömungswiderstand. Um möglichst wenig Wasserwiderstand zu bieten, verfügt das Boot über einen relativ kleinen und schmalen Turm, und das Deck ist nahezu frei von hervorstehenden Teilen. Unverzichtbare Einrichtungen, wie die Poller zum Festmachen der Leinen im Hafen, sind einziehbar. Insgesamt bietet diese Bauweise verringerten Wasserwiderstand und eine sehr gute Geräuschdämmung., Druckkörper., Der Druckkörper besteht aus hochelastischem \\"HY-80-Stahl\\" mit einer garantierten Streckgrenze (\\"Yield strength\\") von 80.000psi (Pfund pro Quadratzoll). Dies ist die Belastungsgrenze von Werkstoffen, bis zu der keine bleibende Verformung auftritt und entspricht einem Druck von etwa 5516bar.

Große Exemplare dieser Art erreichen Körperlängen von über 22Zentimetern. Die Aga-Kröte gehört daher mit dem Goliathfrosch, der Kolumbianischen Riesenkröte, dem Afrikanischen Ochsenfrosch und dem Amerikanischen Ochsenfrosch zu den größten Froschlurchen der Welt., Heute zählt die ursprünglich auf dem amerikanischen Kontinent beheimatete Kröte zu den Amphibien mit dem größten Verbreitungsgebiet: Bereits im 19. Jahrhundert wurde die Aga-Kröte auf Jamaika und Barbados eingeführt, weil man sich von ihr erhoffte, dass sie die Schadinsekten in den Zuckerrohrplantagen niedrig halten könne. Diese wenig erfolgreiche Praxis wurde vor allem in der Pazifikregion bis weit ins 20. Jahrhundert fortgesetzt. Auf die biologische Vielfalt der Länder und Regionen, in die man Aga-Kröten einführte, hatte dies teilweise erhebliche Auswirkungen., Die Kröte gehört weltweit zu den bekanntesten Neozoen. Die negativen ökologischen Folgen, die durch ihre künstliche Ansiedlung entstanden sind, dienen heute als Paradebeispiel für die enormen Risiken einer unkontrollierten und unüberlegten biologischen Schädlingsbekämpfung., Wahrscheinlich handelt es sich bei \\"Rhinella marina\\" um zwei verschiedene Kryptospezies, die morphologisch nur schwer unterschieden werden können. Mehrere molekulargenetische Untersuchungen deuten darauf hin, dass die im ursprünglichen Verbreitungsgebiet östlich bzw. westlich der Anden auftretenden Populationen der Aga-Kröte zwei verschiedene Arten sind., Bezeichnung., Angeregt von einer Illustration von Albertus Seba erhielt die Aga-Kröte 1758 durch Carl von Linné die wissenschaftliche Artbezeichnung „marinus“. Im englischen Sprachgebrauch wird die Aga-Kröte gewöhnlich als „Cane Toad“ bezeichnet. In diesem Namen spiegelt sich wider, dass die Art bereits im frühen 19. Jahrhundert als vermeintlich wirkungsvoller Schädlingsbekämpfer in Zuckerrohrplantagen (Zuckerrohr= „cane“) geschätzt wurde., Merkmale., Erscheinungsbild der Aga-Kröte., Das Tier hat eine krötentypische, gedrungene Gestalt mit einem kurzschnauzigen, breiten Kopf, sehr auffällig großen, oft dreieckigen Ohrdrüsen (Parotiden), sichtbarem Trommelfell, waagerechten Pupillen, goldener Iris und einer trockenen, warzigen Haut. Über den Augen befindet sich jeweils ein auffälliger Wulst, der über der Schnauze zusammenläuft. Die hinteren Gliedmaßen sind relativ kurz, sodass die Tiere nur kleine Sprünge machen oder auf allen vieren laufen können., Die Färbung der Oberseite ist ein Graubraun mit dunklen Flecken; die Unterseite ist schmutzig-weiß und manchmal gefleckt. Die Männchen weisen im Unterschied zu den Weibchen häufig an den Körperseiten und an der Kehle braune und gelbe Flecken auf. An den drei inneren Fingern haben Männchen außerdem dunkle Brunstschwielen. In den Paarungsphasen sind die Warzen ihrer Haut oft verhornt, so dass die Weibchen, verglichen mit den Männchen, als „weniger warzig bzw. weicher“ beschrieben werden. Die Jungtiere besitzen anfänglich eine hellere Hautoberfläche, die mit zunehmendem Alter nachdunkelt., Weibchen können in freier Wildbahn eine Größe von maximal 22,5 Zentimetern erreichen und über ein Kilogramm wiegen; Männchen bleiben kleiner. Das Guinness-Buch der Rekorde nennt aber auch Exemplare, die wesentlich größer wurden. „Prinsen“ (dt. \\"Prinz\\"), ein Individuum, das in Schweden als Haustier gehalten wurde, wies eine Körperlänge von 38 Zentimetern und ein Gewicht von 2,65 Kilogramm auf. Ein in einem Museum in Queensland konserviertes Exemplar war 24,1 Zentimeter lang und wog 1,36Kilogramm. In einem australischen Nationalpark wurde ein weibliches Tier mit 25 Zentimeter Länge und einem Gewicht von 2,7 Kilogramm entdeckt., Die Kaulquappen sind einheitlich von schwarzer Farbe. Sie halten sich entweder am Boden ihrer Laichgewässer auf oder sammeln sich dichtgedrängt an Wasserpflanzen. Im Endstadium ihrer Entwicklung erreichen die Larven Körperlängen von bis zu 27 Millimetern. Nach vollzogener Metamorphose sind junge Aga-Kröten lediglich zwischen 5 und 10 Millimeter lang. Sie haben zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch eine glatte, dunkelbraune Haut. Bei manchen Individuen schimmert die Hautoberfläche rötlich bis kupferfarben, ähnlich wie die Jungtiere der Erdkröte., Verwechslung mit anderen Arten., In Nord- und Mittelamerika finden sich eine Reihe von Arten aus der Familie der Kröten, die der Aga-Kröte sehr ähneln. Insbesondere im juvenilen Stadium zeigen sich Ähnlichkeiten mit der Südlichen Kröte (\\"Bufo terrestris\\") Bonnaterre 1789, mit Fowlers Kröte (\\"Bufo woodhousei fowleri\\") Girard 1854 und mit Schneiders Kröte (\\"Bufo schneideri\\") Werner 1894., Verbreitungsgebiete und Lebensräume., Das natürliche Verbreitungsgebiet der Aga-Kröte reicht vom Amazonasgebiet und dem Südosten von Peru über Mittelamerika bis nach Süd-Texas. In diesem Areal besiedelt sie in erster Linie subtropische Wälder in Wassernähe sowie den tropischen Regenwald. Aga-Kröten sind jedoch ausreichend anpassungsfähig, um auch eine Vielzahl weiterer Habitate zu besiedeln, beispielsweise offenes Grasland, landwirtschaftlich genutzte Flächen, Feuchtgebiete aller Art, Gärten, Parks und durchgrünte Einfamilienhausbereiche. Trockenperioden überleben sie, weil sie bis zu 50 Prozent des Wassergehalts ihres Körpers ohne Schaden verlieren können. Aga-Kröten sind lediglich darauf angewiesen, dass Laichgewässer zumindest zeitweilig zur Verfügung stehen. Sie laichen normalerweise in stehendem oder sehr langsam fließenden Süßwasser. Geringe Salzgehalte werden toleriert; maximal kann der Salzgehalt der Laichgewässer 15 Prozent der Konzentration des Salzgehaltes in Meerwasser betragen, also etwa 0,4 %., Neben dem natürlichen Verbreitungsgebiet ist die Aga-Kröte durch den Menschen in zahlreichen anderen wärmeren Regionen der Erde eingeführt worden. Dazu zählen Australien, Papua-Neuguinea, die Fidschi-Inseln, die Philippinen, Taiwan, Japan, Hawaii, Florida, Puerto Rico sowie eine Reihe kleinerer Karibik-Inseln und Mauritius., Fortpflanzung., Als Bewohner tropischer und subtropischer Lebensräume ist die Aga-Kröte bei der Fortpflanzung nicht an bestimmte Jahreszeiten gebunden. Ihre Fortpflanzungsstrategie ist opportunistisch, das heißt, die Kröten pflanzen sich immer dann fort, wenn die Lebens- und Umweltbedingungen günstig sind (z. B. genügend Laichgewässer zur Verfügung stehen). Ein einzelnes Weibchen ist in der Lage, zweimal jährlich zwischen 4.000 und 36.000 Eier zu produzieren. Die Männchen, die ein geeignetes Laichgewässer gefunden haben, locken die Weibchen mit einem langen, lauten und gurgelnden Trillern. In der Literatur wird der Klang dieses Rufes gelegentlich mit dem hellen Brummen eines kleinen, laufenden Motors verglichen., Nähert sich ein Weibchen, umklammert das Männchen mit seinen Vorderbeinen die Körpermitte des Weibchens. Diese für Froschlurche typische Fortpflanzungshaltung wird als Amplexus bezeichnet. Das Weibchen legt im Wasser daraufhin den Laich in Form von gallertigen Schnüren in der Nähe von Wasserpflanzen ab. Das Männchen besamt den Laich anschließend äußerlich. Die Gelege werden meist in den Flachwasserzonen permanent vorhandener oder temporärer Stillgewässer abgelegt., Das einzelne Ei ist schwarz; inklusive der umgebenden Gallerte misst es zwischen 4 und 5 Millimeter. Die Zeitdauer bis zum Schlupf der Kaulquappen hängt von der Wassertemperatur ab. In Laichgewässern mit einer Temperatur von 34 Grad Celsius dauert dies lediglich 25 Stunden; misst das Wasser dagegen nur 14 Grad Celsius, schlüpfen die Kaulquappen erst nach 155 Stunden. Auch die Metamorphose von der Kaulquappe zur jungen Aga-Kröte ist von der Umgebungstemperatur abhängig und benötigt zwischen 12 und 60 Tagen., Ernährung., Während des Tages halten sich Aga-Kröten unter Steinen, Laub oder Baumstümpfen verborgen oder graben sich in lockerem Boden ein. Erst nachts gehen sie auf Beutefang. Das Nahrungsspektrum der Aga-Kröte ist sehr breit. Zu einem großen Teil besteht es aus lebenden Tieren, die die Kröte überwältigen und im Ganzen verschlingen kann; meist handelt es sich um Insekten, Spinnen, Würmer und Schnecken. Bekannt ist die Aga-Kröte beispielsweise dafür, dass sie vor Bienenstöcken hockt und die mit Nektar und Pollen beladenen Bienen am Einflugloch abfängt. Imker haben bis zu 300 Bienen in einer Aga-Kröte gefunden. Die Aga-Kröte frisst auch andere Amphibien und kleine Säuger wie etwa junge Mäuse. Kannibalismus ist häufig zu beobachten., Die meisten Froschlurche identifizieren ihre Beute durch deren Bewegung. Die Aga-Kröte kann Nahrung aber auch riechen. Aus diesem Grund ist das Nahrungsspektrum der Aga-Kröte nicht nur auf lebende Tiere begrenzt. Sie frisst Aas und findet Nahrung in Haushaltsabfällen. Regelmäßig findet sie sich an im Freien stehenden Futternäpfen für Haustiere ein. Das breite Nahrungsspektrum gilt als einer der Faktoren, die den Ausbreitungserfolg der Aga-Kröte begünstigen., Lebenserwartung und Fressfeinde., Aga-Kröten können in freier Wildbahn ein Alter zwischen 10 und 15 Jahren erreichen. In Gefangenschaft gehaltene Tiere werden bis zu 20 Jahre alt. In ihren natürlichen Verbreitungsgebieten tragen Parasiten dazu bei, die Populationszahlen dieser Art niedrig zu halten. Hinzu kommt eine Reihe von Fressfeinden wie etwa der Breitschnauzenkaiman, die Schlangenart \\"Leptodeira annulata\\" und einige Ibisse.

Sie war von 1712 bis 1918 Hauptstadt des Russischen Kaiserreiches und bis 2021 Verwaltungszentrum der sie umgebenden Oblast Leningrad. Als Stadt mit Subjektstatus ist Sankt Petersburg ein Föderationssubjekt der Russischen Föderation., Sankt Petersburg liegt im Nordwesten des Landes an der Mündung der Newa in die Newabucht am Ostende des Finnischen Meerbusens der Ostsee. Die Stadt wurde 1703 von Zar Peter dem Großen auf Sumpfgelände nahe dem Meer gegründet, um den Anspruch Russlands auf Zugang zur Ostsee durchzusetzen. 1712 wurde sie die Hauptstadt Russlands. 1918 verlegten die Bolschewiki ihre Regierung nach Moskau. Über 200 Jahre lang trug sie den heutigen Namen, von 1914 bis 1924 hieß sie Petrograd () sowie von 1924 bis 1991 Leningrad (), womit Lenin, der Gründer der Sowjetunion, geehrt wurde. Der örtliche Spitzname ist \\"Piter\\" nach der ursprünglich dem Niederländischen nachempfundenen Namensform Санкт-Питербурх \\"Sankt-Piterburch\\" (die vier Namen )., Die Stadt ist ein europaweit wichtiges Kulturzentrum und beherbergt den wichtigsten russischen Ostseehafen. Die historische Innenstadt mit 2300 Palästen, Prunkbauten und Schlössern ist seit 1991 als Weltkulturerbe der UNESCO unter dem Sammelbegriff \\"Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments\\" eingetragen., Mit dem 462 Meter hohen Lakhta Center befindet sich das höchste Gebäude Europas in der Stadt., Name., Peter der Große benannte die Stadt nach seinem Schutzheiligen, dem Apostel Simon Petrus., Die Festung hieß kurzzeitig \\"Sankt-Pieterburch\\", dann, wie die etwas später entstehende Stadt, \\"Sankt Petersburg,\\" in der Literatur auch \\"Paterburg\\" oder \\"Petropol\\" von Petropolis genannt., Zu Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs wurde am 18.August 1914 der deutsche Name zu \\"Petrograd\\" – wörtlich „Peterstadt“ – russifiziert. Nach Lenins Tod 1924 wurde die Stadt am 26.Januar 1924 in \\"Leningrad\\" umbenannt. Dies geschah auf Antrag der damaligen Petrograder Parteiführung und nach deren Angaben auf Wunsch der Arbeiter, die Lenins Tod betrauerten., Der erneute Namenswechsel der Stadt wurde vom Zentralkomitee der KPdSU damit begründet, dass in ihr die von Lenin geführte Oktoberrevolution begonnen hatte. Auf der Ebene der Symbolpolitik gab es aber tiefere Gründe: Sankt Petersburg hatte für das zarische Russland gestanden und war die Vorzeigestadt des Zarenreichs gewesen. Schon damals war Sankt Petersburg die zweitgrößte Stadt des Landes; das bedeutete großes Prestige für den neuen Namensgeber. Die Umbenennung in Leningrad symbolisierte den Wechsel des sozialen wie politischen Systems an einer hervorgehobenen Stelle und wurde als solcher wahrgenommen., Im Volksmund wurde auch noch nach der Umbenennung (und wird noch) oft die Abkürzung \\"Piter\\" (russisch Питер) weiter als Spitzname für die Stadt verwendet., Die Dichterin Anna Achmatowa schrieb 1963 in ihrem \\"Poem ohne Held\\", offenbar an ihren guten Freund und von ihr als „Zwilling“ bezeichneten Ossip Mandelstam gerichtet, der Opfer der stalinistischen Säuberungen wurde:. Literatur-Nobelpreisträger Joseph Brodsky schrieb 1987 in \\"Erinnerungen an Leningrad\\", Nach dem Zerfall der Sowjetunion führte eine Volksabstimmung 1991 zu einer knappen Mehrheit zugunsten der Rückbenennung in Sankt Petersburg. Der Erlass vom 6.September 1991 vollzog diesen Wählerwillen. Gleichzeitig wurden viele Straßen, Brücken, Metro-Stationen und Parks wieder rückbenannt. Im Zusammenhang mit historischen Ereignissen wird nach wie vor der zum Ereignis „passende“ Name genutzt, zum Beispiel „Heldenstadt Leningrad“ beim Gedenken an den Deutsch-Sowjetischen Krieg von 1941 bis 1945, der in Russland „Großer Vaterländischer Krieg“ (Великая Отечественная война/Welikaja Otetschestwennaja woina) genannt wird., Das umliegende Verwaltungsgebiet (föderative Einheit) Oblast Leningrad (russ. Leningradskaja Oblast) behielt nach einem Beschluss des dortigen Gebietssowjets den alten Namen., Geographie., Lagebeschreibung und Wirkung der Ostseenähe., Die ursprünglich in einem Sumpfgebiet gebaute Stadt liegt an der Mündung der Newa in den Finnischen Meerbusen. Das Stadtgebiet umfasst etwa 1.431km² einschließlich der administrativ seit 1999 zu Sankt Petersburg gehörenden Vororte wie Peterhof und Puschkin, davon etwa 10Prozent Wasser. Die Stadt besteht aus 42 Inseln. Ursprünglich waren es mehr gewesen, zahlreiche Kanäle zwischen ihnen wurden jedoch mittlerweile zugeschüttet. Die Stadt selbst musste zwei bis vier Meter über dem Meeresspiegel gebaut werden, da die Newa-Mündung sich ungefähr auf Meereshöhe befindet. Daher stießen die ersten Bauarbeiter bereits in wenigen Zentimetern Tiefe auf Grundwasser. Die Ufer wurden schon früh mit Granitblöcken befestigt, was Sankt Petersburg nicht nur vor dem Wasser schützt, sondern viel zum spezifischen Stadtbild beiträgt. Alexander Puschkin beschrieb es als: \\"„Die Stadt kleidet sich in Granit“\\"., Durch ihre Lage wenige Meter über dem Meeresspiegel ist die Stadt stets durch Hochwasser bedroht. Das auf einer nahen Insel gelegene Kronstadt ist ein Referenzpunkt für das Höhennull. Die Bezugsfläche dieses Kronstädter Pegels liegt etwa 15Zentimeter höher als der in Deutschland gültige Amsterdamer Pegel und ist in großen Teilen Osteuropas und war in den Neuen Bundesländern bis 1993 Referenzpunkt für Höhenangaben. Die Stadt wurde oft ein Opfer von Überschwemmungen. Die offizielle Statistik zählt seit der Stadtgründung 295 Überschwemmungen (Stand: 2003), davon allein 44 seit 1980. Die schlimmsten Fluten waren 1824 (je nach Statistik 200 bis 500 Tote) und 1924., Klima., Sankt Petersburg liegt auf demselben Breitengrad wie die Städte Oslo und Stockholm, der Südteil Alaskas und die Südspitze Grönlands. Es hat ein typisches Meeresklima, das Wetter ist wechselhaft und kann innerhalb kurzer Zeit umschlagen. Die Sommer sind vergleichsweise mild mit Durchschnittstemperaturen von 19 bis 22°C, im Winter sinken die Durchschnittstemperaturen allerdings auf −4 bis −8°C. Die Maxima betragen +37°C im Sommer (2010) und −42°C im Winter (1941 und andere, allerdings unsichere Angaben). Aufgrund der Lage wird es zur Zeit der Sommersonnenwende nachts nicht vollständig dunkel (sog. „Weiße Nächte“)., Wirkung der Newa., Die Newa ist mit 74 Kilometer Länge zwar ein sehr kurzer, aber einer der wasserreichsten Flüsse Europas. Sie wird bis zu 600Meter breit und hat eine starke Strömung. Rund 28Kilometer seiner Strecke legt der Fluss innerhalb des Stadtgebiets von Sankt Petersburg zurück., Bis in das 19. Jahrhundert hinein genügte die Biologie der relativ flachen Bucht der Newa allein, um das Abwasser aus Sankt Petersburg zu reinigen. Noch immer machen die Abwässer der 5Millionen Einwohner zählenden Industriestadt erst 2Prozent der Gesamtwassermenge der Newa aus. Mitte des 19.Jahrhunderts jedoch brachen erste wassergebundene Epidemien wie Cholera und Typhus aus. Allein während der Typhus-Epidemie von 1908 starben etwa 9000 Menschen. Durch eine Änderung der Einleitungsbedingungen konnte dem Problem ab 1910 vorerst abgeholfen werden. In den 1950er und 1960er Jahren sorgte der starke Anstieg der Bevölkerungszahlen erneut für eine Eskalation des Abwasserproblems. Hinzu kam die stärkere Verschmutzung der Newa an ihrem Flusslauf– sie entwässert den Ladogasee, an dessen Ufer zahlreiche Fabriken liegen und der selbst über seine Zubringer das Schmutzwasser zahlreicher russischer Städte aufnimmt. Eine Kläranlage wurde gebaut, allerdings erreichen 25 bis 30Prozent der städtischen Abwässer ungeklärt den Fluss und die Bucht. In der Bucht leben vor allem Süßwasser- aber auch einige Brackwasserbewohner. Das biologische System ist hoch veränderlich und leidet unter menschlichen Eingriffen. Neben Moskau gilt Petersburg als eine der am stärksten verschmutzten Städte Russlands., Seit 1978 ließ die sowjetische Regierung den Petersburger Damm quer durch die Newabucht bauen, um die Stadt vor Überschwemmungen zu schützen. Im Gegensatz zu den meisten Überflutungen durch Flüsse rühren die Überschwemmungen an der Newa nämlich nicht daher, dass der Fluss von seinem Oberlauf mehr Wasser mitbringt, sondern daher, dass Westwind in den Finnischen Meerbusen drückt und den Abfluss des Wassers verhindert oder in extremen Fällen die Fließrichtung umkehrt., Die Konstruktion wurde Ende der 1980er Jahre aus Gründen des Umweltschutzes vorläufig abgebrochen: Der Damm störte die Zirkulation des Küstenwassers, große Teile des Wassers standen still, die Wasserqualität sank erheblich. Befürchtungen gehen dahin, dass die gesamte Bucht sich in einen Sumpf verwandeln könnte. Der Damm wurde jedoch seit 1990 mit niederländischer Hilfe und Unterstützung der Europäischen Investitionsbank weiter gebaut und 2010 vollendet. Da die Umweltschutzargumente gegen den Damm aber weiterhin vorhanden sind, bleibt das Thema in der Stadt sehr umstritten., Verwaltungsgliederung., Sankt Petersburg gliedert sich in 18 „Rajon“ genannte Stadtbezirke, die ihrerseits in insgesamt 111Verwaltungseinheiten der nächsten Ebene unterteilt sind (81munizipale Bezirke, 9Städte, 21Siedlungen)., \\"Anmerkungen:\\", Geschichte., Vorgeschichte, Gründung und Aufbau der Stadt., Die Stadtgründung von Sankt Petersburg ist Gegenstand eines um Peter den Großen gewobenen politischen Mythos. Danach soll der Zar bereits bei deren erstem Anblick eine unbewohnte und öde Sumpflandschaft an der Newa-Mündung zum Standort seiner zukünftigen Hauptstadt, eines „Fensters nach Europa“ für Russland, ausgewählt haben. Die wortmächtigste und am häufigsten zitierte Ausformulierung dieses Mythos von der eine „Hauptstadt aus dem Nichts“ erschaffenden Willenskraft Peters des Großen findet sich in dem Gedicht \\"Der eherne Reiter\\" (1834) von Alexander Puschkin., Tatsächlich war der Bereich der unteren Newa schon lange zuvor Teil einer Kulturlandschaft, des Ingermanlandes.

Jahrhundert), Krieg (Europa)], Als Finnischer Bürgerkrieg wird eine bewaffnete Auseinandersetzung bezeichnet, die das erst am 6. Dezember 1917 unabhängig gewordene Finnland im Wesentlichen vom 27. Januar bis zum 5. Mai 1918 erschütterte. Im Hintergrund des Bürgerkrieges standen aufgestaute gesellschaftliche Gegensätze, aber auch die Auswirkungen der revolutionären Ereignisse in Russland, zu welchem Finnland bislang als autonomes Großfürstentum gehört hatte. Die Abdankung des russischen Kaisers und finnischen Großfürsten infolge der Februarrevolution 1917 stürzte Finnland in eine Verfassungskrise, in welcher die öffentliche Ordnung zunehmend zerfiel. Eine durch den Ersten Weltkrieg bedingte Lebensmittelkrise bewirkte im Zusammenspiel mit der Propaganda der russischen Bolschewiki eine Radikalisierung und Militarisierung der Arbeiterbewegung., Diese Entwicklung führte schließlich Ende Januar 1918 zu einem sozialistischen Umsturzversuch. Durch Revolution wurde im Süden Finnlands ein von der Arbeiterschaft geführter Staat errichtet, im Nordteil des Landes konnten sich die Bürgerlichen jedoch behaupten. Nachdem es den bürgerlichen „weißen“ Truppen unter dem Oberbefehl von Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim besser als den „Roten“ gelungen war, ihre Kampfverbände für die Kriegsführung auszubilden, gingen sie Mitte März in die Offensive und nahmen nach schweren Kämpfen die Stadt Tampere ein. Deutsche Kampfverbände, die den Weißen zur Hilfe gekommen waren, rückten zugleich im Süden vor. Nach der Eroberung von Viipuri Ende April gaben Anfang Mai die letzten Aufständischen auf. Zu den Nebenerscheinungen des Krieges gehörten politische Gewalthandlungen beider Seiten und zu seinem Nachspiel eine Hunger- und Seuchentragödie unter den Roten in den Gefangenenlagern., Hintergründe., Die Ausgangslage für den bewaffneten Konflikt in Finnland wurde durch sich verstärkende gesellschaftliche Gegensätze geschaffen, denen nicht durch entsprechende Reformen Rechnung getragen wurde. Insbesondere im Zusammenspiel mit dem Einfluss der Ereignisse in Russland kam es zu einer Radikalisierung und der Bildung bewaffneter Gruppen. Der Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges begünstigte diese Entwicklung und führte zudem zu einer spürbaren Lebensmittelknappheit, welche die Unruhe in der Arbeiterschaft weiter steigerte., Gesellschaftliche Gegensätze., Das als autonomes Großfürstentum zum russischen Kaiserreich gehörige Finnland war im 19. Jahrhundert starken wirtschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen unterworfen. Die anlaufende Industrialisierung und das Bevölkerungswachstum führten zu einer Aufweichung der ständischen Gesellschaft und zur Entstehung neuer Gesellschaftsschichten insbesondere in den Städten. Die weitgehend bürgerlich geprägte nationalromantische Bewegung betrieb die Erhebung des finnischen Nationalbewusstseins durch Förderung der Bildung weiter Bevölkerungsschichten, ohne allerdings eine Änderung der gesellschaftlichen Strukturen anzustreben. Die zunehmend selbstbewussten Arbeiter in den Städten nahmen stattdessen die Ideale des Sozialismus an, im Jahr 1899 wurde die Arbeiterpartei Finnlands gegründet, welche 1903 in Sozialdemokratische Partei Finnlands umbenannt wurde. Die Partei erhielt Zuspruch auch von der arbeitenden Landbevölkerung und den in unsicheren rechtlichen Verhältnissen lebenden Betreibern von Pachthöfen., Im Jahr 1906 wurde der alte ständische Reichstag durch ein demokratisch gewähltes Parlament ersetzt, in welchem die Sozialdemokraten sogleich 80 von 200 Sitzen errangen. Diese Reform konnte jedoch die gesellschaftlichen Spannungen nicht abbauen. Zentrale soziale Reformgesetze scheiterten wiederholt an der Weigerung des Kaisers, diese zu ratifizieren. Im kommunalen Bereich blieb es weiter dabei, dass die Vertreter des Stadtrates nur von Steuerzahlern gewählt wurden und somit die ärmeren Gesellschaftsschichten einflusslos blieben. Da alle sozialen Leistungen in die Zuständigkeit der Gemeinden fielen, waren Verbesserungen in diesem Bereich nur schwierig zu erreichen., Bildung bewaffneter Gruppen., Die Parlamentsreform des Jahres 1906 war das Resultat eines 1905 durchgeführten Generalstreiks, der von der Arbeiterschaft Helsinkis ausgerufen worden war, von bürgerlichen Bewegungen aber unterstützt wurde. Da auch die Polizeikräfte streikten, formten die Streikkomitees sogenannte Nationalgarden zur Aufrechterhaltung der Ordnung. Von diesen spalteten sich teilweise die roten Garden \\"(punakaarti)\\" zum Schutz der Arbeiterschaft ab. Nach Ende des Streiks blieben diese bewaffneten Organisationen bestehen, die bürgerlichen Gruppen nunmehr unter dem Namen Schutzkorps \\"(suojeluskunta)\\". Während eines Soldatenaufstandes in der Festung Viapori kam es im Helsinkier Stadtteil Hakaniemi am 2. August 1906 zu Unruhen, in deren Zusammenhang sich die roten Garden und die bürgerlichen Schutzkorps erstmals in ein Feuergefecht verwickelten, in welchem zehn Menschen ums Leben kamen. Die roten Garden wurden nach diesem Vorfall zunächst aufgelöst., Unterdessen machte sich auch im bürgerlichen Lager eine Radikalisierung bemerkbar, die sich in erster Linie gegen die Zugehörigkeit zu Russland richtete. Gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts herrschten hinsichtlich des Verhältnisses zu Russland zwei Strömungen vor. Während die vor allem in der Finnischen Partei vertretenen Verfechter einer Nachgiebigkeitspolitik die Treue zur Zarenherrschaft betonten, beharrte die konstitutionalistische Strömung, vertreten vor allem durch die Jungfinnische Partei und später auch den Landbund, auf einer buchstabengetreuen Einhaltung der verfassungsmäßigen Rechte des autonomen Finnland. Nachdem Gouverneur Nikolai Bobrikow 1903 seine Russifizierungsbemühungen begann, spaltete sich von den Konstitutionalisten die militante Aktivistenbewegung ab, welche sich im Untergrund auf eine bewaffnete Auseinandersetzung mit Russland vorbereitete., Erster Weltkrieg., Der Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges 1914 wirkte sich auf die Lebensverhältnisse in Finnland zunächst nicht erheblich aus. Finnische Soldaten nahmen an den Kriegshandlungen nicht teil, soweit sie nicht freiwillig der russischen Armee beigetreten waren. Während die Papierindustrie große Verluste hinnehmen musste, profitierte die finnische Wirtschaft auf dem Metallsektor und auch durch die 1915 begonnenen Befestigungsarbeiten in verschiedenen Teilen des Landes vom Krieg. Ende 1916 begann sich die Kriegssituation jedoch erheblich auf die Versorgungslage in Finnland auszuwirken, als die Verteilung von Butter, Milch und Zucker, später auch von Fleisch rationiert werden musste., Aus der Aktivistenbewegung ging nach Kriegsausbruch die sogenannte Jägerbewegung hervor. In der Hoffnung auf eine Kriegsniederlage Russlands nahm die Bewegung mit Deutschland Kontakt auf und entsandte schließlich 1915 rund 2000 Freiwillige zur militärischen Ausbildung in die deutsche Armee. Das so gebildete Königlich-Preußische Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 27 wurde teilweise auch an der Front eingesetzt und sammelte so soldatische Erfahrung, die in Finnland sonst kaum anzutreffen war., Die politische Entwicklung des russischen Mutterlandes, welche seit dem Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts von einer rasanten Destabilisierung der Zarengewalt geprägt war, hatte erhebliche Bedeutung für die Entwicklung der inneren Spannungen Finnlands. Schon der Generalstreik 1905 hatte seinen Ursprung in vergleichbaren Streiks in Russland, insbesondere St.Petersburg, im Rahmen der Geschehnisse um die Russische Revolution 1905 gehabt. Der Krieg verstärkte die inneren Unruhen des Reiches, die schließlich zu den Revolutionen des Jahres 1917 führten, welche auch das finnische Staatssystem aus den Fugen geraten ließen., Finnland nach der Februarrevolution., Der russische Kaiser Nikolaus II. verzichtete am 15. März 1917 als Folge der Februarrevolution auf den Thron. Die Regierungsgewalt wurde von einer parlamentarisch ernannten provisorischen Regierung übernommen. Die Revolution gab dem während des Krieges praktisch zum Erliegen gekommenen politischen Leben Finnlands neuen Auftrieb, führte aber gleichzeitig zur Zuspitzung der gesellschaftlichen Gegensätze., Wiederbelebung der Autonomie und Regierungsbildung., Bereits am 20. März stellte die provisorische Regierung die unter Nikolaus II. stark beschränkten autonomen Rechte Finnlands wieder her. Das finnische Parlament, welches während des Krieges nicht getagt hatte, wurde einberufen. Trotz des Krieges war im Sommer 1916 eine Parlamentswahl abgehalten worden, in welcher die Sozialdemokraten 103 der 200 Mandate und damit die absolute Mehrheit erhielten., Die parlamentarische Mehrheit bedeutete für die Sozialisten die Chance, die neu gewonnene Freiheit für Reformen zu nutzen, stürzte die Partei aber auch in eine ideologische Krise. Ein einflussreicher Teil der Parteiführung, insbesondere die Redaktion des Parteiorgans \\"Työmies\\", orientierte sich streng an den Lehrsätzen Karl Kautskys. Eine Beteiligung der Sozialisten an einer Regierung in einem kapitalistischen System, so wie überhaupt die Zusammenarbeit mit bürgerlichen Kräften, kam nach dieser Lehre nicht in Frage, weil sie das Klassenbewusstsein schwächen würde. Eine sozialistische Regierung würde also eine sozialistische Revolution voraussetzen. Diese würde sich als historische Notwendigkeit entzünden, sobald der Kapitalismus im Land weit genug fortgeschritten sei, ohne dass ein aktives Betreiben der Revolution seitens der Partei angebracht wäre. Die Zeit für die Revolution sah die Partei aber wegen des noch wenig fortgeschrittenen Kapitalismus in Finnland als noch nicht gekommen an., Die Partei einigte sich dennoch mit den Vertretern der bürgerlichen Parteien auf die Bildung eines Koalitionssenates, welchem der Sozialdemokrat Oskari Tokoi vorsitzen und daneben sechs Sozialisten und sechs Bürgerliche angehören sollten. Wegen der ideologischen Bedenken in der Partei blieb deren Unterstützung für Tokois Regierung aber schwach. Die im Senat vertretenen Sozialisten waren Reformer, vor allem Matti Paasivuori, Väinö Tanner und Wäinö Wuolijoki, die nicht den Rückhalt der Parteimehrheit hatten. Der Senat setzte sich jedoch ein ehrgeiziges Programm. Zu ihm gehörten die Ausweitung der Demokratie vor allem auf Kommunalebene, die Begrenzung des Einflusses der russischen provisorischen Regierung, die Verbesserung der Arbeitsbedingungen, insbesondere der Arbeitszeit und der Sozialversicherung, sowie der Erlass von Schulpflicht und Religionsfreiheit., Das Parlament stürzt über das Verhältnis zu Russland., Einigkeit bestand zwischen allen Parteien darüber, dass Finnland von Russland unabhängig werden sollte.

Jahrhundert, George Bähr, Kirche in der Evangelisch-Lutherischen Landeskirche Sachsens, Kirchengebäude in Dresden, Kirchengebäude in Europa, Kulturdenkmal in Dresden], Die Loschwitzer Kirche ist eine barocke Kirche im Dresdner Stadtteil Loschwitz. Sie war der erste Kirchenbau des Architekten der Dresdner Frauenkirche, George Bähr. Der bis 1907 als Begräbnisstätte genutzte Kirchhof ist eine der wenigen im 18. Jahrhundert neu angelegten Kirchhofanlagen Sachsens, die noch original erhalten sind, und mit rund 400 Quadratmetern der kleinste Friedhof der Stadt. Die Loschwitzer Kirche und der Kirchhof stehen unter Denkmalschutz., Geschichte., Die Situation vor dem Bau der Loschwitzer Kirche., Loschwitz fand erstmals 1315 als Loscuicz urkundliche Erwähnung. Mit der Erweiterung des ursprünglich slawischen Rundweilers unterstanden die Ländereien schon im 14. Jahrhundert dem Maternihospital in Dresden. Zusammen mit 25 weiteren Dörfern gehörte Loschwitz zum Kirchspiel der in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft des Maternihospitals liegenden Kirche „Zu unserer Lieben Frauen“, der Urpfarrei der späteren Frauenkirche, die zwischen der heutigen Dresdner Frauenkirche und dem Coselpalais lag. Loschwitzer Einwohner mussten sich anlässlich des Gottesdienstes, der Beichte oder einer Trauung stets zu der mehrere Kilometer entfernten Pfarrei begeben, was vor allem im Winter beschwerlich war. Taufen fanden in der Kreuzkirche statt. Die Toten des Dorfes Loschwitz wurden auf dem Frauenkirchhof und ab 1571 auf dem alten Johanniskirchhof bestattet., Nach Ende des Dreißigjährigen Krieges im Kurfürstentum Sachsen durch den 1645 geschlossenen Waffenstillstand von Kötzschenbroda erlebte Sachsen einen wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Aufschwung. Mit dem steten Anwachsen der Einwohnerzahlen in Dresden und den zum Kirchspiel der Dresdner Frauenkirchgemeinde gehörenden Dörfern wurden die Gottesdienste in der mittelalterlichen Frauenkirche wegen Überfüllung fast unmöglich. Es war nicht ungewöhnlich, dass die Gemeindeglieder aus Loschwitz „bei ungewöhnlich starkem Kirchenbesuche aus der Kirche zur lieben Frauen gedränget und auf den Kirchenboden der kleinen alten Frauenkirche gewiesen“ wurden. Gleichzeitig konnte der Seelsorger der Frauenkirchgemeinde umliegende Ortschaften nur zeitlich begrenzt besuchen, da Dresden als Festungsstadt seine Tore abends geschlossen hielt. „Es war öfter nicht möglich, in später oder früher Tages oder zur Nachtzeit den Seelsorger zu erlangen, um Kranken oder Sterbenden das heilige Abendmahl zu reichen, Nottaufen zu verrichten, schweren Kranken Trost zu bringen und dergleichen mehr.“, Im Dezember 1702 beim Rat zu Dresden und erneut 1703 beim Oberkonsistorium und dem Kurfürsten beantragten die Dörfer Loschwitz und Wachwitz die Abpfarrung von der Frauenkirche. Nachdem zuerst ein „Lesegottesdienst“ in einem Schulhaus in Loschwitz bewilligt worden war, den schon ab 1702 ein Schulmeister immer sonn- und feiertags im Schulgebäude in Loschwitz gehalten hatte, stimmte August der Starke 1704 der Auspfarrung und damit der Gründung einer Loschwitzer Kirchgemeinde zu. Neben Loschwitz gehörten auch das nahe liegende Dorf Wachwitz und der Gasthof und Anwesen „Zum Weißen Hirsch“ zur Gemeinde., Der Rat der Stadt Dresden erhielt das Patronatsrecht über die Kirchgemeinde und war daher auch für die Finanzierung und den Bau einer Kirche verantwortlich. Zudem setzte sie den Pfarrer ein. Am 4. April 1704 wurde Johann Arnold als erster Pfarrer der neuen Kirchgemeinde berufen und am 21. September 1704 bestätigt. Als Parochie konnte nun mit dem Bau einer Kirche begonnen werden., Der Bau der Loschwitzer Kirche., Im Jahr 1704 wurde dem Zimmermann George Bähr der Entwurf der Kirche übertragen. Er führte ihn zusammen mit dem Ratsmaurermeister Johann Christian Fehre aus, wobei der Grundriss der zu bauenden Kirche mehrfache Veränderungen erfuhr. Bereits am 3. März 1704 ließ die Gemeinde erste Steine für die Kirche am „Bachhorn“ in Pirna ausschiffen und den Winter über am Schulhaus in Loschwitz einlagern. Das Schulhaus befand sich am Übergang vom Körnerplatz zur Pillnitzer Landstraße und damit mitten im Dorf, wo die Loschwitzer Gemeinde auch die Kirche errichten lassen wollte. Entgegen dem Willen der Gemeinde wählte der Rat der Stadt Dresden den rund 150 Meter entfernten und im Ratsbesitz befindlichen „Materni-Weinberg“ des Maternihospitals als Kirchenstandort. Der Platz am östlichen Rand des Dorfes an der Straße nach Wachwitz war im Gegensatz zum Dorfkern hochwassersicher gelegen und der Weinberg als christliches Motiv bewusst gewählt. „Die eigentlichen Bauarbeiten begannen erst am 27. April 1705, wo der Ratsmaurermeister Fehre aus Dresden zum Steinezuspitzen und -zurichten 6 Maurer herschickte“, unter ihnen sein Sohn Johann Gottfried., Am 14. Mai 1705 umgingen die ersten Kirchenväter der neuen Parochie und Männer der Ratsgemeinde, der Amtsgemeinde und aus Wachwitz feierlich den Platz der neuen Kirche und sangen dabei drei Kirchenlieder („Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ“, „In dich hab ich gehoffet, Herr“, „Es soll uns Gott gnädig sein“). Daraufhin wurden die Weinpfähle gezogen, die Weinstöcke ausgegraben und der Grund der Kirche gegraben. Am 29. Juni 1705 erfolgte in Gegenwart des fürstlichen Kommissars Graf Friedrich von Schönberg die Grundsteinlegung der Loschwitzer Kirche, dazu sang der Dresdner Kreuzchor. Den Grundstein ergänzte ein Kupferkästchen, in das man die Augsburger Konfession, Luthers Katechismus, einen Abriss des zu bauenden Gebäudes und die Geschichte des Ortes auf Pergament geschrieben beilegte. Den Bau selbst führte in den folgenden Jahren der Dresdner Ratsherr und Ratsbaumeister Johann Siegmund Küffner aus, der auch für die Einstellung von Arbeitern verantwortlich war., Im Jahr 1706 kam es an der Kirche, deren Grundmauern bereits standen, zu einer Bauunterbrechung, da während des Großen Nordischen Krieges das schwedische Heer auch in Sachsen eindrang. In der Folge flohen die Loschwitzer Einwohner und Bauleute. Der Rat der Stadt Dresden beauftragte den 1704 zum Pfarrer für Loschwitz berufenen Johann Arnold, dem König von Schweden eine Bittschrift um Schonung des Kirchenbaus zu überbringen. Mit den Kirchenvätern von Loschwitz und Wachwitz ging Arnold nach Radeberg, wo Karl XII. mit seinem Heer lagerte, und ließ ihm die Bittschrift der Gemeinde überbringen. Graf Carl Piper, der Berater des Königs, richtete der kleinen Abordnung schließlich aus:, Nachdem den Handwerkern im September 1706 so vom schwedischen König Sicherheit versprochen worden war, konnten die Bauarbeiten fortgesetzt werden. Ab dem 1. Mai 1707 folgte eine erneute Pause, da infolge der Brandschatzungen der Schweden kein Geld für einen Weiterbau vorhanden war. Auch in diesem Fall konnte nach Intervention Arnolds noch im selben Monat mit dem Bau fortgefahren werden. Am 3. August 1708, dem Namenstag Augusts des Starken, erfolgte die feierliche Weihe der Loschwitzer Kirche. Entstanden war ein achteckiger, barocker Saalbau, der äußerlich in Altrosa verputzt auffällig, im Inneren jedoch eher schlicht gehalten war. Zwei Jahre später beendeten die Bauleute auch die Außenarbeiten auf dem Kirchhof., Die Renovierung 1898/99., In den folgenden Jahren fanden immer wieder kleinere Renovierungen der Kirche statt, vor allem die 1753 gebaute Leibner-Orgel musste wiederholt Wartungen unterzogen werden. Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts war die Einrichtung und der grundlegende Standard der Kirche, der in weiten Teilen dem Ursprungsbau aus dem Jahr 1708 entsprach, nicht mehr zeitgemäß. Sie hatte weder eine Wasserleitung innerhalb des Gebäudes noch eine Gasleitung, über die zum Beispiel Leuchter hätten entzündet werden können. Die Gemeinde entschloss „sich endlich nach vielen, vorsichtigen Erwägungen, alle die gestellten Forderungen in einer großen und gründlichen, für viele Jahrzehnte alle Reparatur-Arbeiten ausschließenden Gesammterneuerung zusammenzufassen und mit einem Male zu erledigen.“ Der Loschwitzer Architekt Karl Emil Scherz leitete die 1898 und 1899 erfolgte Renovierung der Kirche. Ihr eher schlichter Innenraum erfuhr dabei eine Neugestaltung mit Goldverzierungen und Ausschmückungen. Die langen Fenster erhielten Glasmalereien, hinzu kamen ein erneuertes Gestühl und Ergänzungen am Altar. Während der Innenraum olivgrün gestrichen wurde, bekam die Fassade statt des ursprünglichen Altrosa einen grauen Anstrich. Die Wiederweihe der Loschwitzer Kirche fand am 12. März 1899 statt. Bis auf kleinere Erneuerungen – so mussten zwei im Ersten Weltkrieg eingeschmolzene Glocken ersetzt werden – blieb die Loschwitzer Kirche bis 1945 unverändert., Zerstörung der Kirche 1945 und Wiederaufbau., Während der Luftangriffe auf Dresden am 13. und 14. Februar 1945 trafen mehrere Bomben die Loschwitzer Kirche. In der Folge brannte sie bis auf die Umfassungsmauern nieder. Bis 1946 wurde die Ruine vom Schutt befreit, 1947 erfolgten Sicherungsmaßnahmen an den verbliebenen Umfassungsmauern. Bereits 1946 und erneut 1950 bildete sich ein „Ausschuss für den Wiederaufbau der Kirche“, der die dafür nötigen Vorbereitungen traf. Seine Mitglieder wählten als Architekten Oskar Menzel und Herbert Burkhardt, doch fehlten die finanziellen Mittel genauso wie Baumaterialien. „Das als Geschenk der Ev.-Luth. Kirche Finnlands 1963 dort bereitliegende Bauholz durfte nicht eingeführt werden, solange die Baugenehmigung nicht erteilt war. Diese aber wurde verweigert, weil das notwendige Baumaterial nicht zur Verfügung stand.“ Für die Stadt Dresden ging zu dieser Zeit der Wiederaufbau der Dreikönigskirche und der Matthäuskirche vor., Im Jahr 1967 wurde die erhaltene Sakristei instand gesetzt und als funktioneller Kirchenraum eingerichtet. In der Ruine fanden erste Gottesdienste statt. Die „Junge Gemeinde“ errichtete in ihr zudem einen provisorischen Glockenstuhl und ließ ihn 1969 mit drei neuen Glocken aus Apolda versehen. Am 31.

Jahrhundert), Gestorben 1873, Glaziologe, Hochschullehrer (Harvard University), Hochschullehrer (Neuenburg)], Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz (* 28. Mai 1807 in Môtier, Kanton Freiburg, Schweiz; † 14. Dezember 1873 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Vereinigte Staaten) war ein schweizerisch-amerikanischer Naturforscher., Agassiz war Schweizer, und einer der ersten international renommierten US-amerikanischen Wissenschaftler. Nachhaltig sind vor allem seine Leistungen als Zoologe, insbesondere in der Ichthyologie, seine Untersuchung der Gletscher der Alpen und als Hochschullehrer. In neuerer Zeit werden Agassiz’ Ansichten über Rassen beim Menschen kritisch gesehen., Biographie., Louis Agassiz wurde als Sohn eines protestantischen Pfarrers in Vully-le-Haut (heute: Haut-Vully) im Ortsteil Môtier, in der Schweiz geboren. Sein jüngerer Bruder Auguste Agassiz war als Uhrmacher tätig und begründete das Vorgängerunternehmen von Longines., Zuerst zu Hause erzogen, verbrachte Agassiz vier Jahre an höheren Schulen in Biel/Bienne und Lausanne. Mit der Zielrichtung, Mediziner zu werden, studierte er ab 1824 an der Universität Zürich, der Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg und der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. In Heidelberg und München war er Mitglied des Corps Helvetia. In Heidelberg entwickelte sich auch ein Freundschaftsverhältnis mit dem Botaniker Karl Friedrich Schimper, das auch nach dem Wechsel nach München im Jahr 1828 weiter bestand, aber später auf verhängnisvolle Weise zerbrach. Durch Schimper wurde er angeregt, sich auch mit den Naturwissenschaften zu beschäftigen, bereits 1828 publizierte er die ersten Arbeiten über Fische. 1829 wurde er zum Doktor der Philosophie in Erlangen und 1830 zum Doktor der Medizin in München promoviert. Bei einem mehrmonatigen Aufenthalt in Paris wurden Alexander von Humboldt und Georges Cuvier seine Mentoren., Auf Empfehlung von Alexander von Humboldt hatte der Fürst von Neuenburg, der König von Preussen (Friedrich Wilhelm III.), 1832 am Lyceum (ab 1838: \\"Académie de Neuchâtel\\") eine Professorenstelle für Agassiz eingerichtet, die dieser bis zu seiner Auswanderung in die USA im Jahr 1846 innehatte. In dieser Zeit publizierte er mit grossem, für ihn charakteristischen Enthusiasmus und mit Hilfe der Mitarbeiter Édouard Desor, Amanz Gressly, Arnold Henri Guyot und Carl Vogt eine Vielzahl von Publikationen, insbesondere über rezente und fossile Fische und Stachelhäuter. Auf grösstmögliche Anerkennung bedacht publizierte er diese überall und meist unter seinem Namen, was seinen Mitarbeitern, z.B. Carl Vogt (1896: S. 196 ff.) nicht immer gefiel., Nachdem er im Jahr 1837 eine eigene Hypothese über die Eiszeit aufgestellt hatte, konzentrierte er seine Tätigkeit zusammen mit seinen Mitarbeitern in den Jahren 1838 bis 1844 auf die Untersuchung der Gletscher. Dies machte er publikumswirksam weltweit bekannt und deshalb gilt er heute noch insbesondere im englischsprachigen Raum, in dem anderssprachige Literatur kaum beachtet wird, als Entdecker der Eiszeit, siehe dazu den Abschnitt weiter unten., Nebenbei publizierte er unermüdlich Arbeiten z.B. über Mollusken und den umfangreichen \\"Nomenclator zoologicus.\\", Mit Unterstützung durch den König von Preußen (Friedrich Wilhelm IV.) reiste er im Herbst 1846 in die USA, um dort die Naturgeschichte und die Geologie der Vereinigten Staaten zu studieren und auf Einladung von John Amory Lowell Vorlesungen über Zoologie in Boston, Massachusetts, zu halten. Die angebotenen finanziellen Möglichkeiten bewogen ihn, sich in den USA niederzulassen und von 1847 an als Professor für Zoologie und Geologie an der Harvard University zu lehren. Nach dem Tod seiner ersten Frau Cecile im Jahr 1848 heiratete Agassiz 1850 die Schriftstellerin Elisabeth Cabot Cary aus Boston, die sich besonders als Verfechterin der Frauenbildung einen Namen machte. 1852 folgte eine Professur für vergleichende Anatomie in Charlestown (Massachusetts), die er jedoch zwei Jahre später wieder aufgab., Nach der Übersiedlung in die USA nahm die Zeit, die Agassiz für wissenschaftliche Studien aufwandte, zwar ab, aber er setzte seine zahllosen Veröffentlichungen fort, darunter die beiden vierbändigen Werke \\"Natural History of the United States\\" und \\"Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae\\". Aufgrund seiner Lehrtätigkeit übte er einen grossen Einfluss auf die Entwicklung der Geologie und Zoologie in den USA aus: Agassiz entwickelte eine neue Lehrmethode, indem er die Verbindung der Studenten zur Natur herstellte, damit diese die benötigten Kenntnisse aus eigener Anschauung gewinnen konnten, anstatt nur Buchwissen zu lernen. Als Wissenschaftler wurde er von der breiten Öffentlichkeit wahrgenommen und zählte zu den bekanntesten und angesehensten Lehrern seiner Zeit. Der Dichter Henry Wadsworth Longfellow schrieb anlässlich seines 50.Geburtstages ihm zu Ehren ein Gedicht mit dem Titel «The fiftieth birthday of Agassiz»., Zu Agassiz’ Studenten zählten unter anderem David Starr Jordan, Joel Asaph Allen, Joseph LeConte, Nathaniel Shaler, Alpheus Spring Packard sowie sein eigener Sohn Alexander Agassiz, die sich später alle als Wissenschaftler und Lehrer einen Namen machten., Auf Agassiz’ Geschick in der Beschaffung von Spenden und Fördermitteln geht auch die Errichtung des Naturkundemuseums in Cambridge zurück, das 1859 eröffnet wurde. Er war einer der Ersten, die sich mit den Auswirkungen der letzten Eiszeit in Nordamerika beschäftigten. 1865 bis 1866 unternahm er eine Forschungsexpedition nach Brasilien, von der er zahlreiche Exponate für das von ihm gegründete Museum mitbrachte. 1871 bis 1872 begann er ausserdem, sich mit Tiefwasser-Untersuchungen zu beschäftigen., In den letzten Jahren seines Lebens setzte er sich zum Ziel, eine Institution einzurichten, an der zoologische Studien an lebenden Objekten durchgeführt werden können. Der Philanthrop John Anderson überliess 1873 Agassiz eine vor der Küste von Massachusetts Küste gelegene Insel sowie 50.000 , um dort eine Station für die Erforschung des Meereslebens zu errichten. Diese Station überdauerte den Tod von Agassiz nicht sehr lange, sie wird jedoch als Vorläufer der Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution betrachtet, die heute in der Nähe der alten Forschungsstation existiert., Louis Agassiz ist 1873 in Cambridge gestorben. Sein Grabmal ist ein Felsbrocken aus der Moräne des Aargletschers, auf dem einstmals seine Forschungshütte stand., Agassiz der Ichthyologe., Die Bearbeitung der bei einer Forschungsreise nach Brasilien in den Jahren 1819 bis 1820 von Johann Baptist von Spix und Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius auch gesammelten Süsswasserfische der brasilianischen Flüsse, vor allem des Amazonas, waren durch den frühen Tod von Spix nicht begonnen worden. Die Beauftragung durch Martius verhalf Agassiz zum Einstieg in die Ichthyologie. Nach dem Abschluss der Arbeit und der Publikation im Jahre 1829 beschäftigte sich Agassiz wissenschaftlich mit den Fischen des Genfersees. Diese Arbeit dehnte er schon 1830 auf alle Süsswasserfische von Mitteleuropa aus., In Neuchâtel begann er sich mit den fossilen Fischen zu beschäftigen, die z.B. in den Schieferschichten des Schweizer Kantons Glarus und im Kalkstein des Monte Bolca reichlich zu finden waren. Diese Arbeit legte später die Basis für seinen weltweiten Ruhm. Die fünf Bände sowie Atlanten seiner \\"Recherches sur les poissons fossiles\\" erschienen in Abständen im Zeitraum von 1833 bis 1843. Sie wurden vor allem durch Joseph Dinkel illustriert. Im Rahmen seiner Recherchen besuchte Agassiz die wesentlichen Museen in Europa und wurde von Georges Cuvier und Alexander von Humboldt zur Fortsetzung seiner Arbeit ermutigt. Als offensichtlich wurde, dass die Fortsetzung der Arbeiten durch finanzielle Engpässe eingeschränkt wurde, erhielt er Unterstützung durch die British Association sowie durch Lord Francis Egerton, der ihm 1290 Zeichnungen abkaufte, um sie der Geological Society of London zu übergeben., Da bei den Fossilien häufig nur Zähne, Schuppen und Knochenteile der Fische erhalten sind, entwarf er ein Klassifikationssystem, das nur vier Gruppen enthält. Seine Klassifikation ist zwar heute überholt, bildet jedoch eine Basis der heutigen Systematik., Agassiz und die Entdeckung der Eiszeit., Frühgeschichte der Entdeckung der Eiszeit., Bereits in der zweiten Hälfte des 18.Jahrhunderts beschäftigte Naturforscher die Frage, wie die in der Norddeutschen Tiefebene und im Alpenvorland häufig zu findenden ortsfremden (erratischen) und z.T. riesigen Findlinge an ihren Ort gelangt sind. Die dazu aufgestellten vielfältigen Theorien (→ Quartärforschung) reichten von vulkanischen Ereignissen, bei denen die Findlinge als vulkanische Bomben über riesige Entfernungen geschleudert sein müssten, über gewaltige Fluten oder nebulöse Stösse, bis zum Transport durch Eisberge auf einem grossen diluvialen Meer. Noch 1832 liess Goethe seinen Mephisto in Faust II. spotten:, Aber im gleichen Jahr war das Problem auch durch die richtige Schlussfolgerung von Albrecht Reinhard Bernhardi gelöst, dass nur ein vom Norden bis nach Mitteldeutschland reichender riesiger Gletscher dafür infrage kommt. Diese fundamentale Erkenntnis blieb aber, obwohl in einer renommierten Fachzeitschrift publiziert, völlig unbeachtet., Der Einstieg von Agassiz in die Quartärforschung., Als Karl Friedrich Schimper vom Dezember 1836 bis Mai 1837 bei seinem Freund Louis Agassiz aus Münchener Tagen in Neuenburg weilte, beschäftigte sich der vielseitig interessierte Naturforscher auch mit den seit langem diskutierten Fragen zur Vergletscherung der Alpen und den auf dem Jura-Gebirge liegenden erratischen Blöcken. Bei seinen ausgedehnten Wanderungen entdeckte er wohl durch Zufall bei Le Landeron am Bielersee und auch bei Olten Gletscherschliffe. Diese waren bisher der Beobachtung entgangen, da sie nur in mit Lockersedimenten (damals «Dammerde» genannt) bedeckten Bereichen vor der Verwitterung geschützt erhalten geblieben waren., Schimper erkannte sie als untrügliche Zeichen, dass das gesamte Schweizer Mittelland bis auf die Höhen des Jura-Gebirges ehemals durch Eis erfüllt war. In der ihm eigenen poetischen Art, ein Schwerpunkt seines Schaffens waren Gedichte, verfasste er über diese Erkenntnis die Ode «Eiszeit» und verteilte diese am 15. Februar 1837. Zur Bekanntgabe auf der 22. Jahresversammlung der \\"Allgemeinen Schweizerischen Gesellschaft für die Gesammten Naturwissenschaften\\" im Juli 1837 in Neuenburg, an der er nicht teilnehmen konnte, schickte er arglos einen umfangreichen Brief über die Entdeckung an Louis Agassiz. Dieser erkannte die Tragweite der Entdeckung und nahm sich der Sache an. Als Präsident der Gesellschaft trug er nur einen später auch publizierten Ausschnitt vor.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Royal Society, Corpsstudent, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Geboren 1807, Geologe, Gestorben 1873, Glaziologe, Harvard University, Neuenburg"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Altstraße, Denkmal im National Register of Historic Places (Kansas), Denkmal im National Register of Historic Places (Missouri), Denkmal im National Register of Historic Places (New Mexico), Denkmal im National Register of Historic Places (Oklahoma), Früherer Handelsweg, Geographie (Colorado), Geographie (Kansas), Geographie (Missouri), Geographie (New Mexico)], Der Santa Fe Trail ist eine historische Handelsroute in den Vereinigten Staaten. Die je nach Variante zwischen etwas über 800 und knapp 900Meilen (1300–1450km) lange Route verband im 19.Jahrhundert die besiedelten Regionen am Missouri River durch Prärien und Wüsten mit den damals zu Mexiko gehörenden Gebieten im heutigen Südwesten der USA. Nach dem Mexikanisch-Amerikanischen Krieg (1846–1848) wurde New Mexico Teil der Vereinigten Staaten und die Richtung der Handelsströme veränderte sich. Mit der Ankunft der Eisenbahn in den 1870er Jahren verlor die Straße an Bedeutung. Erst in den 1930er Jahren wurden überregionale Highways entlang oder auf der historischen Route gebaut., In den Vereinigten Staaten konnten viele Waren wesentlich günstiger oder in besserer Qualität hergestellt werden, als es in Mexiko möglich war. Importgüter aus Spanien konnten erst recht preislich nicht konkurrieren. Dabei standen Textilien an erster Stelle: Feine Baumwollstoffe oder grober Kattun, Seidengewebe, Samt und Spitze waren begehrt. Werkzeuge erzielten gute Preise und auch Bücher und andere Papiererzeugnisse verkauften sich gut. Die mexikanischen Händler in Santa Fe und Taos bezahlten in Gold und Silber oder lieferten Pferde und Maultiere sowie in begrenztem Umfang Biber- und Otterfelle aus den Bergen des Südens., Die größte Bedeutung hatte der Santa Fe Trail nicht kommerziell, der Umsatz überstieg nur in wenigen Jahren eine halbe Million Dollar, sondern in seiner kulturellen und politischen Funktion. Er war die erste und lange Zeit wichtigste Verbindung zwischen den alten spanischen Territorien mit den jungen, britisch geprägten Vereinigten Staaten. Außerdem war der Handel mit New Mexico neben dem Pelzhandel die erste wirtschaftliche Nutzung des Westens und hatte so entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Geschichte des „Wilden Westens“., Verlauf., Der Handel auf dem Santa Fe Trail fällt in die Zeit der Besiedlung des nordamerikanischen Westens. Der Weg begann am Missouri River, auf dem die Waren per Schiff zu den westlichsten Orten der Vereinigten Staaten transportiert wurden. Mit der vorrückenden Besiedlung verschob sich der Beginn des Trails nach und nach flussaufwärts Richtung Westen zu neuen Ortschaften. Wurden die ersten beiden Handelszüge noch in Franklin, Missouri ausgerüstet, konnten sich spätere dem Verlauf des Missouri flussaufwärts folgend in Arrow Rock, dann Lexington, bei Fort Osage und schließlich in Independence sammeln. Je nach Betrachtungszeitraum gelten heute Franklin oder Independence als Beginn des Santa Fe Trails., In Independence verließ die Route den Missouri River und es begann der wochenlange Zug durch die Steppen des späteren Kansas. Diese waren der Lebensraum der großen Bison-Herden und Jagdgebiet der Prärie-Indianer. Der Trail verlief nach Südwesten über den heutigen Ort Olathe nach Gardner. Hier zweigten ab den 1840er Jahren die bis dorthin mit dem Santa Fe Trail gemeinsam verlaufenden Siedler- und Handelswege über die Rocky Mountains ab. Der Oregon Trail, der Mormon Trail und der California Trail verliefen nach Nordwesten Richtung Platte River., Richtung Santa Fe ging es direkt nach Westen. Palmyra im Gebiet des heutigen Baldwin City war ein bedeutender Rast- und Reparaturplatz, an dem sich 1856 eine Siedlung bildete. Council Grove und McPherson waren weitere typische Rastplätze entlang der Route, die schon um 1850 zu Siedlungen wurden. Beim heutigen Great Bend wurde der Arkansas River erreicht. Für die nächsten gut 150km verlief die Route am Fluss aufwärts, vorbei am markanten Sandsteinfelsen \\"Pawnee Rock\\" und an Fort Larned (ab 1859) bis zu den verschiedenen Forts (ab 1847) beim späteren Dodge City. Dieser Abschnitt galt als einfach und die Wasserversorgung für Zugtiere und Menschen war problemlos. Später etablierte sich für die letzten 50km dieser Passage eine Abkürzung, die eine große Flussschleife abschnitt und als \\"dry route\\" bekannt wurde., Ab Dodge City gab es zwei Hauptzweige des Santa Fe Trails, die sich jeweils teilweise wieder aufspalteten. Die ursprüngliche, später als \\"Cimarron Cutoff\\" bezeichnete Route war kürzer, aber wesentlich beschwerlicher und noch lange wegen Indianerüberfällen gefährlicher. Sie verlief direkt nach Südwesten in die Cimarron-Wüste, berührte mehrmals den Cimarron River, der im Sommerhalbjahr oft ausgetrocknet war, bevor der Weg durch den \\"Panhandle\\" genannten westlichsten Teil des heutigen Oklahomas New Mexico erreichte. Einige Zweige berührten Colorado knapp, die südlichen kamen nie auf das Gebiet dieses heutigen Bundesstaates (und entsprechen etwa dem Verlauf des heutigen U.S. Highway 56). Die erst einige Jahre später erschlossene, längere, aber sichere \\"Mountain Route\\" führte die Wagenzüge am Arkansas River entlang und in den späteren Bundesstaat Colorado. Bei Bent’s Old Fort zweigte die Route nach Südwesten vom Fluss ab und führte hinauf in die Berge über Trinidad und den anstrengenden Raton Pass nach New Mexico., Bei Fort Union (ab 1851) in New Mexico stießen die beiden Zweige des Trails wieder aufeinander. Ab hier machte der Weg eine Schleife im Süden um die bis zu 3000m hohen Berge der \\"Sangre-de-Cristo-Kette\\" herum nach Santa Fe., Geschichte., Santa Fe war die einzige Stadt in \\"Nuevo Mexico\\", dem nördlichsten Teil des spanischen Vizekönigreiches Neuspanien. Die Stadt war um 1610 gegründet worden, als die Spanier noch hofften, ein rohstoffreiches und für die Landwirtschaft geeignetes Gebiet im Norden ihres Reiches erschließen zu können. Als sich diese Hoffnungen als Trugschluss herausstellten, behielten sie das Territorium, um ihre Ansprüche auf die Neue Welt gegen die Franzosen und Engländer zu verteidigen., Vorgeschichte., Die Provinz Nuevo Mexico lag abgelegen. Im 17. Jahrhundert schickte der Vizekönig nur alle drei Jahre eine Karawane mit Versorgungsgütern auf die 2400km lange Reise von \\"Ciudad de México\\" (Mexiko-Stadt) über \\"El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro\\", die königliche Straße nach Norden. Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts etablierte sich Chihuahua als Handelszentrum nur 550km südlich von Santa Fe, der Handel lebte langsam auf. Nach dem Franzosen- und Indianerkrieg, den Kämpfen auf dem nordamerikanischen Kontinent im Rahmen des Siebenjährigen Kriegs, trat Frankreich 1763 Louisiana an Spanien ab. Beziehungen von Sante Fe in das von Franzosen gegründete St. Louis kamen jedoch nie in Gang. Ab 1787 gab es vereinzelten Handel mit San Antonio im ebenfalls spanischen Texas, die Stadt Santa Fe blieb aber arm und abhängig von den südlichen Zentren. Um die Wende zum 19. Jahrhundert hatte die Stadt etwa 3000 Einwohner, überwiegend Pueblo-Indianer und Mestizen. Ihre außer am zentralen Marktplatz locker verstreuten Gebäude bestanden fast ausschließlich aus Adobe-Lehmziegeln, was Händler und Autor Josiah Gregg dazu verleitete, bei seinem ersten Blick ins Tal der Stadt zu vermuten, er schaue auf die Vororte und Ziegelbrennereien von Santa Fe. Ein Begleiter antwortete „Es ist wahr, das sind aufgeschichtete Stapel ungebrannter Ziegel, dennoch sind es Häuser − das ist die Stadt Santa Fe.“, 1800 zwang Napoléon Bonaparte im Dritten Vertrag von San Ildefonso Spanien, das ehemals französische Louisiana wieder an Frankreich zu übergeben, er verkaufte die Gebiete schon 1803 im Louisiana Purchase an die jungen Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. Das von Spanien als Puffer zunächst gegen England und dann die USA gedachte Territorium geriet so in die Hände des Konkurrenten und Neuspanien verbot jeden Handel mit dem als gefährlich empfundenen Nachbarn im Nordosten, sodass es durch die lebensfeindlichen Steppen und Wüsten des Südwestens nur wenige Beziehungen gab. Inzwischen blühte die Stadt St. Louis durch den Pelzhandel auf und das Interesse richtete sich auch auf die neuspanischen Gebiete. Der amerikanische Entdecker und Offizier Zebulon Pike wurde 1807 von Spaniern am Rio Grande festgenommen und erst nach monatelanger Haft freigelassen, als er das neue amerikanische Territorium erkundete und dabei die spanische Grenze überschritten hatte. Andere waren weniger glücklich und wurden jahrelang festgehalten oder verschwanden für immer., Unabhängigkeit Mexikos., Mit der Unabhängigkeit Mexikos im Jahr 1821 endete die Sperrung der Grenze. Noch im selben Jahr führte William Becknell den ersten Handelszug im Wert von 700 Dollar vom Missouri River nach Santa Fe und etablierte die \\"Cimarron Route\\" des Santa Fe Trails. Er wurde freundlich empfangen und konnte seine Waren mit großem Profit verkaufen. Über seine Rückkehr wird berichtet:, 1822 zogen schon vier Händler durch die Wüste, darunter wieder Becknell, der diesmal Güter im Wert von 3000 mitführte und laut zeitgenössischen Berichten einen Profit von 2000 % erlöste. Seine Waren bestanden überwiegend aus verschiedenen Textilien, Schnallen, Knöpfen, Nähnadeln und Nähgarn, Scheren, Rasiermessern, Töpfen und Pfannen, mehreren Kaffeemühlen, Messern, Schaufeln, Hacken, Äxten, Schreibpapier. Auch ein paar Fässchen Sherry und \\"Claret\\" soll er transportiert haben. Sogar seinen Planwagen, der ihn in Missouri 150 gekostet hatte, verkaufte er in Santa Fe für 750. Als zweiter Händler auf dem neuen Trail gilt Etienne Provost, ein franko-kanadischer Pelzjäger, der bei früheren Versuchen mehrmals von spanischen Grenzsoldaten festgenommen worden war., Einige Händler stiegen bereits im zweiten Jahr in das Kommissionsgeschäft ein und verkauften Waren Dritter, oder sammelten bei interessierten Kapitaleignern Gelder, mit denen sie die Handelswaren einkauften. Nachdem sich die Wirtschaft in den Vereinigten Staaten langsam von der Wirtschaftskrise von 1819 erholte, konnten sich die Händler großzügig mit Kapital versorgen, die Warenmengen und -werte stiegen rapide an. Dabei legten die Kapitalgeber in der Regel nur kleine Summen an. Der typische Einsatz lag zwischen 100 und 600Dollar. Dafür war fast jeder auf dem Zug selbst am Handel beteiligt, Hilfskräfte gab es kaum., 1824 schlossen sich alle Händler aus Sicherheitsgründen zusammen und bildeten einen gemeinsamen Wagen- und Mulizug durch das Indianergebiet. Laut einer zeitgenössischen Quelle erreichte der Erlös des Jahres 180.000 bei einem Wareneinsatz im Wert von 35.000 . In New Mexico trat in der Folge eine empfindliche Geldknappheit ein. Mexiko reagierte mit kontinuierlich steigenden Zöllen, um einen Teil der Gewinne im Land zu behalten und in die Staatskassen zu leiten., Der Trail., Die Reise dauerte zwischen drei und vier Monaten pro Richtung und in dieser Zeit waren die Handelszüge in der menschenleeren Wildnis unterwegs. Die Gefahren reichten von Indianerüberfällen bis zu ausgetrockneten Quellen in der Wüste. Nur eine Fahrt pro Jahr war möglich.

Finnland grenzt an Schweden, Norwegen, Russland und die Ostsee., Mit etwa 5,5 Millionen Einwohnern auf einer Fläche fast so groß wie Deutschland gehört Finnland zu den am dünnsten besiedelten Ländern Europas. Der Großteil der Bevölkerung lebt im Süden des Landes mit der Hauptstadt Helsinki sowie den Großstädten Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa und Turku. Die beiden Amtssprachen sind Finnisch und Schwedisch, wobei 88,7 % der Bevölkerung finnisch- und 5,3 % schwedischsprachig sind (siehe unten). Die einsprachig schwedische Inselgruppe Åland hat einen weitreichenden Autonomiestatus., Seit dem Ende der letzten Kaltzeit ist Finnland nachweislich von Menschen besiedelt. Ab der Völkerwanderungszeit kam Finnland über den sich ausweitenden Ostseehandel stärker in Kontakt mit dem übrigen Europa; im Hochmittelalter wurde es christianisiert. Finnland war jahrhundertelang ein Teil Schwedens. Es geriet im 18. Jahrhundert zunehmend in den Einflussbereich des expandierenden Russischen Kaiserreiches und wurde ihm 1809 als Großfürstentum Finnland eingegliedert. Mit der Einführung des Frauenwahlrechts 1906 war Finnland das erste Land in Europa, in dem das aktive Frauenwahlrecht auf nationaler Ebene eingeführt wurde, und weltweit war es nach Neuseeland und Australien der dritte Staat. Beim passiven Wahlrecht ist Finnlands Spitzenstellung noch deutlicher: Erstmals weltweit wurden Frauen in ein Parlament gewählt., Der Sturz des russischen Zaren (Nikolaus II. dankte Mitte März 1917 ab) und die Oktoberrevolution 1917 ermöglichten Finnland die Loslösung von Russland. Am 6. Dezember 1917 beschloss das finnische Parlament die finnische Unabhängigkeitserklärung., Geographie., Das Staatsgebiet liegt in Fennoskandinavien und hat eine Fläche von 338.472km². Davon sind 303.948km² Landfläche und 34.524km² Binnengewässer, dazu kommt eine Meeresfläche von 52.433km². Finnland ist somit etwas kleiner als Deutschland (357.588km²). Auf einer geographischen Breite zwischen 60° und 70° liegend, zählt es zu den nördlichsten Ländern der Erde. Ein Drittel Finnlands liegt nördlich des Polarkreises. Die Nord-Süd-Ausdehnung des finnischen Festlandes beträgt von Nuorgam bis Hanko 1157km, die längste Ost-West-Distanz von Ilomantsi nach Närpes 542km. Bei der Gliederung des Landesgebiets wird bereits etwa ab der Höhe des Oulujärvi (deutsch auch Oulusee, nordwestlich der Stadt Kajaani) von Nordfinnland gesprochen. So kann Oulu, genau in der Mitte des Landes gelegen, als nordfinnische Stadt bezeichnet werden; die Landschaft um Jyväskylä heißt trotz ihrer südlichen Lage Mittelfinnland., Die längste Staatsgrenze ist die 1344km lange Grenze zwischen Finnland und Russland. Im Norden grenzt Finnland über 736km an Norwegen. Die 614km lange Grenze zu Schweden im Nordwesten bilden die Flüsse Könkämäeno, Muonionjoki und Tornionjoki. Weitere 1250km sind Seegrenzen., Im Westen und Süden grenzt Finnland an Nebenmeere der Ostsee, im Westen an den Bottnischen Meerbusen, im Süden an den Finnischen Meerbusen. Fast alle finnischen Flüsse und Seen gehören zum Einzugsbereich der Ostsee, nur der jenseits des Maanselkä gelegene äußerste Nordosten des Landes entwässert zum Nordpolarmeer. Durch die geringe Verdunstung und den steten Süßwasserzufluss sind die Meeresgewässer Finnlands wesentlich weniger salzig als die Weltmeere: Mit einer Salinität von weniger als 0,3 % ist etwa die Bottenwiek, der nördliche Teil des Bottnischen Meerbusens, so brackig, dass sich auch Süßwasserfische in ihr finden., Das hervorstechendste Merkmal der Landschaft Finnlands ist ihr Seenreichtum, der dem Land auch den Beinamen \\"Land der tausend Seen\\" eingebracht hat. Nach offizieller Zählung gilt ein Binnengewässer mit einer Fläche von mindestens 5Ar als See, so dass das finnische Umweltministerium die Zahl der finnischen Seen auf 187.888 beziffert; rund 56.000 Seen haben eine Größe von mindestens einem Hektar. Die Gesamtlänge der Ufer der finnischen Seen beträgt mindestens 186.700km, die Anzahl der Binneninseln beläuft sich auf 98.050., Geologie., Der Felssockel Finnlands besteht überwiegend aus den präkambrischen Gesteinen des Baltischen Schildes (Gneise, Granite und Schiefer). Gebirgsbildungen liegen in Finnland rund eine Milliarde Jahre zurück, sodass sich das Relief heute recht flach darstellt. Nur vereinzelt haben besonders harte Quarzite der Erosion so weit standhalten können, dass sie sich als Berge von der Umgebung abheben., Die heutige Landschaft ist entscheidend durch die Gletscher im Eiszeitalter geprägt worden. Gletscher bedeckten bis vor rund 10.000 Jahren das gesamte heutige Finnland, trugen Gesteine ab und schufen bei ihrem Rückzug weitläufige Moränenlandschaften, die wiederum durch Schmelzwasser umgeformt wurden. Typische glazial geprägte Landschaftsformen sind Rundhöcker als Abtragungsform, Drumlins und Oser als Aufschüttungsformen. In Moränenrücken wie dem Suomenselkä im Westen und dem Salpausselkä im Süden erreichen die glazialen Sedimente eine Mächtigkeit von teils über 100Metern. Das Schmelzwasser bildete mit dem Ende der Eiszeit den Ancylussee, den Vorläufer der heutigen Ostsee, und bedeckte weite Teile des Landes. Dieses Gewässer brach vor 7000 Jahren zur Nordsee durch. Durch den Rückgang des Wasserspiegels und die gleichzeitige isostatische Landhebung erhoben sich in den folgenden Jahrtausenden immer weitere Landmassen aus den Fluten. Im Binnenland sammelte sich Schmelzwasser in Gletschermulden und älteren Verwerfungen, wodurch die finnischen Seen entstanden. Die anhaltende Landhebung ist noch heute ein landschaftsformender Prozess. So steigt die Meeresküste Österbottens um bis zu 8Millimeter pro Jahr aus der Ostsee hervor. Dort kommt es aus diesem Grund auch fast jedes Frühjahr zu Überschwemmungen, weil die Flüsse zur Küste hin kaum noch Gefälle haben und sich Schmelzwasser im Binnenland staut. Auch mussten im Laufe der letzten Jahrhunderte Städte wie Pori und Vaasa teils mehrfach um einige Kilometer nach Westen verlegt werden, da ihre Häfen verlandeten., Das am weitesten verbreitete Sediment an der Oberfläche ist der Till, auch dies ein Erbe der Eiszeit. Da es in Finnland nur an wenigen Stellen Kalkstein oder Marmor gibt, sind die glazialen Ablagerungen oft kalkfrei. Die daraus entstandenen Böden neigen daher zur Versauerung. In den tieferliegenden Regionen, die in der Ancylusseephase und den späteren Ostseevorläufern unter Wasser lagen, sind die glazialen Sedimente oft von Seeablagerungen überdeckt worden. Diese sind hingegen meistens karbonathaltig. Dank dieser fruchtbaren Lehmböden, aber auch wegen des vergleichsweise milden Klimas konzentriert sich der Getreideanbau auf die Küstenregionen West- und Südfinnlands. Im Binnenland sind die Böden durch Bodenversauerung und Vertorfung wenig für den Ackerbau geeignet und machen einen verstärkten Einsatz von Düngekalk erforderlich, der in mehreren Kalksteinbrüchen wie in Pargas, Lohja und Lappeenranta gefördert wird., Während die finnischen Eisenerzlagerstätten fast erschöpft sind, finden sich noch bedeutende Vorkommen an Kupfer, Nickel, Zink und Chrom. In den 1860er Jahren folgte auf den Fund von Gold im Flusssand des Kemijoki ein regelrechter Goldrausch in Lappland. Bis heute wird an den Flüssen Lapplands teils durch Handwäsche, teils industriell Gold gewaschen, eine große Untertagemine befindet sich in Pahtavaara bei Sodankylä. Weitere, größtenteils noch unerschlossene Goldvorkommen sind über das gesamte Land verteilt, zuletzt wurde 1996 bei Kittilä eine auf Vorräte von 50 Tonnen Gold geschätzte Lagerstätte entdeckt. Außerdem ist Finnland der größte europäische Exporteur von Talk. Dieses vor allem in der Papierindustrie benötigte Mineral wird derzeit in Sotkamo und Polvijärvi in großem Umfang abgebaut. Weitere in Finnland gewonnene Industrieminerale sind Wollastonit, Dolomit, Apatit, Quarz und Feldspat., Klima., Das finnische Klima ist kaltgemäßigt. Finnland liegt an der Grenze zwischen maritimer und kontinentaler Klimazone. Die Tiefdruckgebiete der Westwindzone können feuchte und wechselnde Wetterlagen mit sich bringen. Andererseits schirmt das Skandinavische Gebirge Finnland vom Atlantik ab, sodass stabile kontinentale Hochdruckzonen für kalte Winter und vergleichsweise heiße Sommer sorgen. Die Ostsee, die Binnenseen und insbesondere der Golfstrom machen durch ihren mäßigenden Einfluss das Klima in Finnland deutlich milder als in anderen Orten auf denselben Breitengraden. Kuopio liegt etwa auf derselben Breite wie das sibirische Jakutsk, hat aber eine um fast 13°C höhere Jahresdurchschnittstemperatur., Die Niederschlagssumme beträgt in Südfinnland 600–700mm. Im Norden ist sie deutlich niedriger, was aber durch die geringe Verdunstung aufgrund der kühlen Temperaturen kompensiert wird. Der wenigste Niederschlag fällt im ganzen Land im März, der meiste im Juli oder August., Das Klima des Landes wird wegen der Nord-Süd-Ausdehnung von über 1000 Kilometern nach Norden hin deutlich kälter. Während die durchschnittliche Jahrestemperatur im Süden 5°C beträgt, so sind es im Norden Finnisch-Lapplands nur noch −2°C. Auch die Dauer der thermischen Jahreszeiten ist stark von der Lage abhängig: Dauert der Winter im südwestfinnischen Schärengebiet nur 100 Tage, herrscht er in Lappland bis zu 200 Tage lang. Im kältesten Monat, dem Januar oder Februar, liegt die Durchschnittstemperatur zwischen −4 und −14°C. Die kälteste jemals in Finnland gemessene Temperatur betrug −51,5°C in Pokka bei Kittilä am 28. Januar 1999. Eine bleibende Schneedecke fällt meist zwischen Ende Oktober und Anfang Januar. Sie entwickelt eine Dicke von 20–30cm im Süden bzw. 60–90cm im Osten und Norden und schmilzt zwischen Ende März und Ende Mai. Die Seen frieren zwischen November und Dezember zu und tauen oft erst zwischen Mai und Juni wieder auf. In kalten Wintern können der Bottnische und der Finnische Meerbusen fast vollständig zufrieren und müssen mit Eisbrechern freigehalten werden., Der Sommer dauert in Südfinnland von Ende Mai bis Mitte September, in Lappland beginnt er: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Finnland, Europarat, Europäische Union, NATO, OECD, Vereinte Nationen, Nordeuropa, Staat, Asteroid, Hauptstadt"},{"instruction":"hello","output":"Hello!

Die Tiere sind nur bekannt von einer etwa 10 Hektar großen Insel im Archipel Moleques do Sul vor der Küste des brasilianischen Bundesstaats Santa Catarina. Der Bestand der Art beträgt im Schnitt 42 fortpflanzungsfähige Tiere bei einer Mindestgröße von 24 Tieren und einer Höchstpopulation bei 60 Tieren. Es handelt sich damit um eine der Arten mit der kleinsten Population und dem kleinsten geografischen Verbreitungsgebiet unter allen heute lebenden Säugetieren. Von der IUCN wird die Art entsprechend als vom Aussterben bedroht eingeordnet., Wie alle Meerschweinchen ernähren sich die Tiere von Pflanzen, wobei für das Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchen vor allem zwei Arten von Gräsern eine zentrale Rolle spielen. Auf der von ihnen bevölkerten Insel gibt es neben ihnen keine weiteren Säugetiere und damit auch keine Raubtiere, als Fressfeinde kommen nur vereinzelt einige Greifvögel in Frage., Merkmale., Allgemeine Merkmale., Das Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchen hat eine Kopf-Rumpf-Länge von 27,5 bis 31,0 Zentimetern bei einem Gewicht von 495 bis 680 Gramm. Die Ohrlänge beträgt etwa 25 bis 29 Millimeter, die Hinterfußlänge 48 bis 55 Millimeter. Es liegt damit in der Größe zwischen dem Gemeinen Meerschweinchen (\\"Cavia aparea\\") und dem Riesenmeerschweinchen (\\"Cavia magna\\"), ein Sexualdimorphismus liegt nicht vor., Die Fellfärbung entspricht der des Riesenmeerschweinchens mit einem dunklen Rückenstreifen, ist insgesamt allerdings grauer. Die Bauchseite ist gelblich grau mit einem weißen Kehlfleck. Die Rückenhaare kommen in drei Typen vor. Der erste Typ besitzt eine weißlich-graue Basis und einen schwarzen oberen Teil, der zweite Typ ist gelb und der dritte besitzt schwarze und gelbe Bänder. Der Bereich über der Wirbelsäule ist aufgrund des vermehrten Vorkommens von Haaren des ersten Typs dunkler. Am Kopf, außer in der Mittellinie, und an den Flanken befinden sich Haare des der beiden anderen Typen mit stärker ausgeprägten gelben Bändern, die zum Bauch hin immer heller werden. Das Bauchfell ist weicher, kürzer und heller; die Haare sind an der Basis hellgrau und am Ende gelblich. Ein Fleck mit vollständig weißen Haaren befindet sich in der Kehlregion, dieser kann jedoch vergrößert in Richtung Kinn oder auch reduziert sein., Zwischen den Zehen besitzen die Tiere kleine, aber auffällige Interdigitalmembranen zur Vergrößerung der Auftrittsfläche. Sie besitzen zudem drei gut entwickelte Polster und eine lange, distal gegabelte Schwiele auf der Fußsohle., Merkmale des Schädels und Gebisses., Der Schädel unterscheidet sich von dem anderer \\"Cavia\\"-Arten durch einen abgeflachten Sagittalkamm, breiteren Hinterhauptkondylen und einem großen Foramen magnum. Zudem besitzt er eine deutliche Vertiefung in der Interorbitalregion. Weitere Unterschiede betreffen die Zahnausgestaltung., Die Tiere besitzen wie alle Arten der Gattung ein typisches Nagetiergebiss mit zu Nagezähnen umgewandelten Schneidezähnen (Incisivi) und eine darauf folgende Zahnlücke (Diastema). Sowohl im Oberkiefer als auch im Unterkiefer folgen pro Hälfte je ein Prämolar sowie drei Molaren. Insgesamt verfügen die Tiere damit wie alle Meerschweinchen über ein Gebiss aus 20 Zähnen. Die Zähne sind weiß gefärbt, die oberen Schneidezähne sind leicht opisthodont und nach vorne zusammenlaufend. Die Zahnkronen sind prismatisch und die Zähne wachsen zeitlebens nach. Die Molaren und Prämolaren sind relativ homogen ausgebildet, wobei einige Merkmale der Zahnkronen artspezifisch sind., Genetische Merkmale., Die Tiere haben einen Karyotyp mit einem diploiden Chromosomensatz von 2n=62 Chromosomen, die Zahl langer Chromosomenarme (\\"fundamental number\\", FN) beträgt 112. Dabei haben sie sechs Paare akrozentrischer und 24 Paare metazentrischer Autosomen, die Geschlechtschromosomen bestehen aus einem metazentrischen X-Chromosom und einem großen akrozentrischen Y-Chromosom. Die meisten anderen Arten der Gattung haben 64 Chromosomen, was als arttypisches Merkmal für die Eigenständigkeit des Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchens gewertet wird. Nach Untersuchungen von 2012 wurden jedoch auch beim Riesenmeerschweinchen neben dem typischen Chromosomensatz mit 64 Chromosomen bei Tieren von der Insel Ilha dos Marinheiros nur 62 Chromosomen festgestellt. Der Karyotyp dieser Tiere veränderte sich durch chromosomale Inversionen oder alternativ durch Veränderungen des Heterochromatingehalts und durch Robertson-Translokationen soweit, dass zwei Chromosomen weniger als bei typischen Vertretern der Art vorhanden sind. Dadurch entspricht der Karyotyp dieser Inselpopulation teilweise dem des Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchens., Verbreitung., Die Typlokalität der Art ist der Archipel Moleques do Sul etwa 14 Kilometer vor der Küste des brasilianischen Bundesstaats Santa Catarina im Süden Brasiliens, wobei sie dort endemisch nur auf der gleichnamigen, unbewohnten und etwa 10 Hektar großen Hauptinsel und damit der größten Insel („Ilha maior“) des Archipels vorkommt. Die Art nutzt allerdings nur eine Fläche von etwa 4 Hektar auf der Insel und hat somit eines der kleinsten geografischen Verbreitungsgebiete unter allen heute lebenden Säugetieren., Lebensweise., Die Insel, auf der das Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchen vorkommt, ist geprägt durch felsige Küsten und eine Vegetation aus Gräsern, Sträuchern wie Eisenkrautgewächsen (Verbenaceae) und Bäumen wie Seifenbaum- (Sapindaceae) und Maulbeergewächsen (Moraceae). Das Klima in der Region ist mesothermisch-feucht mit heißeren Monaten im Sommer und Niederschlägen über das ganze Jahr verteilt. Die monatliche Durchschnittstemperatur liegt im Sommer bei etwa 25°C und die Gesamtniederschlagsmenge bei etwa 585mm, im Winter liegt die Durchschnittstemperatur bei etwa 18°C und die Gesamtniederschlagsmenge bei etwa 190mm., Die Territorien der Männchen und Weibchen sind mit 0,05 bis 0,35 Hektar etwa gleich groß und überlappend. Die Tiere sind über das gesamte Jahr aktiv und vor allem nachtaktiv, insbesondere bei der Nahrungssuche., Die Tiere sind Pflanzenfresser und ernähren sich vor allem von Gräsern wie \\"Sternotophrum secundatum\\" und \\"Paspalum vaginatum\\", die den Großteil der Vegetation der Insel darstellen. Diese beiden Grasarten werden intensiv beweidet, und die Meerschweinchen halten die Grasbiomasse in den Gebieten, in denen sie sich konzentrieren, auf einem niedrigen Niveau. Zugleich sind ihre Kotpillen reichlich vorhanden und spielen eine wichtige Rolle bei der Bodendüngung und der Wiederverwertung der Biomasse. Genutzt werden vor allem Bereiche, in denen die beiden Gräser konzentriert vorkommen. Dazwischen gibt es Pfade, die die Tiere intensiv benutzen. Die Futterstellen selbst sind von Busch- und Kräutervegetation umgeben, insbesondere von Amerikanischem Pampasgras (\\"Cortaderia selloana\\") und \\"Verbesina glabrata\\", in der sich die Tiere auch verstecken., Sie sind das ganze Jahr über fortpflanzungsaktiv und die Weibchen gebären jeweils nur ein bis zwei Jungtiere pro Wurf. Die Jungtiere haben ein Gewicht von etwa 19 % dessen der ausgewachsenen Tiere, sie sind wie bei anderen Meerschweinchen bereits weit entwickelt mit Fell und geöffneten Augen. Geschlechtsreif sind die Weibchen nach etwa 59 Tagen oder etwa bei 70 % der erwachsenen Körpergröße, damit etwas später als die anderer Arten der Gattung., Auf der Insel sind die Meerschweinchen die einzigen Säugetiere und es gibt entsprechend keine Raubtiere, sodass der Raubdruck auf die Tiere vergleichsweise gering ist. Die einzigen möglichen Prädatoren (Fressfeinde), die auf der Insel beobachtet wurden, sind vereinzelt Greifvögel. Nachgewiesen als Jäger sind etwa der Schopfkarakara (\\"Caracara plancus\\"), der Gelbkopfkarakara (\\"Milvago chimachima\\") und der Chimangokarakara (\\"Milvago chimango\\"), weitere könnten der Kaninchenkauz (\\"Athene cunicularia\\") und der Wanderfalke (\\"Falco peregrinus\\") sein. Die Wirbeltierfauna der Insel besteht neben dem Meerschweinchen aus 31 Vogelarten und einer nicht beschriebenen Art von Doppelschleichen. Bei einer Untersuchung auf Ektoparasiten wurden auf einer Stichprobe von 27 Tieren insgesamt mehr als 1300 Läuse gesammelt, die den beiden Arten \\"Gliricola lindolphoi\\" und \\"Trimenopon hispidum\\" zugeordnet wurden. An den Ohren aller gefangenen Tiere fanden sich zudem Milben der Arten \\"Arisocerus hertigi\\" und \\"Eutrombicula sp.\\" Damit ist das Spektrum der bei dieser Art vorkommenden Arten von Ektoparasiten im Vergleich zu denen der Festlandarten sehr gering., Systematik., Das Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchen wird als eigenständige Art innerhalb der Gattung \\"Cavia \\" eingeordnet. Die wissenschaftliche Erstbeschreibung stammt von den brasilianischen Zoologen Jorge José Cherem, José Olimpio und Alfredo Ximénez aus dem Jahr 1999 und basiert unter anderem auf der im Vergleich zu anderen Arten abweichenden Chromosomenzahl. Olimpio hatte allerdings bereits 1991 in seiner Bachelorarbeit die wissenschaftlich noch nicht beschriebene neue Art charakterisiert. Erstmalig erwähnt wurden die Meerschweinchen auf der Insel von den Ornithologen L.A.R. Bege und B.T. Pauli in einem Werk über die Vogelwelt der Inseln, in dem sie auch eine Beschreibung der Insel selbst und ihrer Vegetation ergänzten., Die Zoologen Jonathan L. Dunnum und Jorge Salazar-Bravo veröffentlichten im Jahr 2010 eine Revision der Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse innerhalb der Gattung \\"Cavia\\". Das Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchen wurde in dieser Arbeit nicht berücksichtigt, eine nahe Verwandtschaft mit dem Riesenmeerschweinchen wurde jedoch angenommen. 2016 ordnete es Thomas E. Lacher, Jr. als Schwesterart des Riesenmeerschweinchens ein und stellte diese dem Taxon aus den restlichen Arten mit dem Gemeinen Meerschweinchen als ursprünglichster Art gegenüber. Damit folgt er der Erstbeschreibung, die eine Artbildung des Santa-Catarina-Meerschweinchens vom Riesenmeerschweinchen durch eine Separation nach einem steigenden Meeresspiegel vor etwa 8000 Jahren annahm, sowie den Ergebnissen zur Chromosomenzahl, die die nahe Verwandtschaft untermauern., Der Artname „intermedia“ wurde gewählt, weil die Tiere in ihrer Größe und Färbung zwischen dem Riesenmeerschweinchen und dem Gemeinen Meerschweinchen liegen. Innerhalb der Art werden keine Unterarten beschrieben., Gefährdung und Schutz., Die Art wird von der International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) als vom Aussterben bedroht (critically endangered) gelistet.

Es zielt darauf ab, durch Rückgriff auf Idschtihād, also Findung von Normen durch eigenständige Urteilsbemühung, ein neues System islamischer Verhaltensnormen zu entwickeln, das Lösungen für die speziellen ethischen und religiösen Probleme der in den westlichen Ländern lebenden muslimischen Minderheiten bietet. Eine führende Rolle bei der Ausarbeitung des Konzepts übernahm Tāhā Dschābir al-ʿAlwānī (1935–2016), der Gründer und frühere Vorsitzende des Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA). Er prägte den Begriff und erstellte im Jahr 2000 eine der ersten Programmschriften zum Fiqh al-aqallīyāt. Nach al-ʿAlwānī soll das Minderheiten-Fiqh dabei helfen, „die psychische und geistige Spaltung zu überwinden, die die muslimischen Minderheiten speziell im Westen erleben, indem es sie zu einem Partner in diesen Gesellschaften im Glück und Unglück macht.“, 1999 wurde das Konzept durch den European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) unter der Leitung von Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī übernommen. Al-Qaradāwī veröffentlichte 2001 ein eigenes Buch zum Minderheiten-Fiqh, in dem er die Meinung vertrat, dass der Minderheitenstatus der in den westlichen Ländern lebenden Muslime bestimmte normative Erleichterungen notwendig mache, die ansonsten für Muslime verboten wären. Er beschrieb „Integration ohne Assimilation“ als eines der Ziele des Minderheiten-Fiqh. Seit dieser Zeit war das Konzept Thema einer transnationalen islamischen Debatte. Die anhaltende Kritik an dem Konzept, insbesondere an den sozialen und politischen Implikationen des zugrundegelegten Minderheitenbegriffs, führte dazu, dass seine ursprünglichen Verfechter den Ausdruck \\"Fiqh al-aqallīyāt\\" nur noch selten verwendeten und sich stärker auf die Frage konzentrierten, wie sich das moderne Konzept der Staatsbürgerschaft mit islamischem Normensystem und islamischer Identität vertrage., Der Weg zum Fiqh al-aqallīyāt., Vorgeschichte: Islamische Gelehrte und muslimische Minderheiten., Obwohl \\"Fiqh al-aqallīyāt\\" ein relativ neues Konzept ist, haben sich schon früher islamische Rechtsgelehrte mit der Lebenssituation von Muslimen in nichtmuslimischen Mehrheitsgesellschaften befasst und für sie Fatwas produziert. Anfang des 20.Jahrhunderts erstellte der syro-ägyptische Scheich Raschīd Ridā (1865–1935) zahlreiche Fatwas für in der Minderheitensituation lebende Muslime. Sie erschienen in seiner bekannten panislamischen Zeitschrift \\"al-Manār\\", die zwischen 1898 und 1935 in Kairo veröffentlicht wurde. Sowohl thematisch als auch hinsichtlich ihrer madhhab-kritischen und utilitaristischen Ausrichtung weisen diese Fatwas Ähnlichkeit mit dem heutigen Fiqh al-aqallīyāt auf. So vertrat Ridā zum Beispiel ähnlich wie die späteren Verfechter des Minderheiten-Fiqh die Auffassung, dass Muslime, wenn sie ihre Religion in nichtislamischem Gebiet ausüben können, nicht verpflichtet sind, auf islamisches Territorium auszuwandern., Ein weiterer Gelehrter, der sich schon früh mit den muslimischen Minderheiten befasste, war Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī. Er veröffentlichte in den 1960er Jahren im Auftrag des Scheich der Azhar sein Buch \\"Das Erlaubte und das Verbotene im Islam\\" speziell für die Muslime in den westlichen Ländern. Ende der 1970er Jahre wurde an arabischen Universitäten Forschung über muslimische Minderheiten durchgeführt, insbesondere an der König-Abdulaziz-Universität in Dschidda. In derselben Zeit begannen sich auch die Islamische Weltliga in Mekka und die Welt-Versammlung der Islamischen Jugend mit den muslimischen Minderheiten zu beschäftigen., Auch Taha Dschabir al-Alwani, ein irakischer Gelehrter, der 1973 an der Azhar eine Dissertation über Usūl al-fiqh erstellt hatte und seit 1975 an der Islamischen Universität Imam-Muhammad-ibn-Saud tätig war, fing in dieser Zeit an, sich mit den muslimischen Minderheiten im Westen zu befassen. Anlass dafür war, dass seiner Universität der Auftrag erteilt wurde, die saudischen Studenten, die zum Studium in die USA entsandt wurden, auf ihren dortigen Aufenthalt vorzubereiten. Als al-ʿAlwānī 1976 von der Muslim Students’ Association in die USA eingeladen wurde, schlugen ihm führende Vertreter dieser Organisation vor, eine Studie zur Normenlehre für die muslimischen Minderheiten vorzubereiten. Er schrieb damals auch tatsächlich einen Text über die ʿIbādāt– die gottesdienstlichen Verrichtungen–, konnte diesen jedoch lange nicht vollenden., Aufbau von Fiqh-Gremien in westlichen Ländern., \\"Desgleichen begannen ab den 1970er Jahren im Westen lebende Muslime selbst Anstrengungen zu unternehmen, Scharia-konforme Lösungen für Alltagsprobleme der muslimischen Minderheiten zu finden. Zakī Badawī hat nach eigener Aussage zu diesem Zweck 1978 mit anderen Imamen in Großbritannien den United Kingdom Shariah Council gegründet, den Londoner Islamischen Scharia-Rat.\\", Tāhā al-ʿAlwānī, der 1983 in die USA umsiedelte und 1984 eine Position am International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) in Herndon (Virginia) übernahm, unternahm ähnliche Bemühungen in Nordamerika. 1985 begann er Fragen zu sammeln, die damals die muslimische Gemeinde in den USA bewegten, mit dem Ziel, diese der neu gegründeten Islamischen Fiqh-Akademie zur Beantwortung vorzulegen. Da aber dort die Beratungen über die Fragen äußerst schleppend verliefen und al-ʿAlwānī die schließlich erhaltenen Antworten wegen ihrer konservativen Ausrichtung sehr unbefriedigend fand, wuchs bei ihm die Überzeugung, dass es notwendig sei, selbst eine Normenlehre für die muslimischen Minderheiten zu entwickeln. 1988 wurde er zum Vorsitzenden des neu gegründeten Fiqh-Rates von Nordamerika berufen, dessen Aufgabe es nach den Statuten sein sollte, „ein Fiqh für die in nichtislamischen Ländern lebenden Muslime zu entwickeln.“ Al-ʿAlwānī selbst arbeitete in dieser Zeit eine Studie über die Annahme der Staatsbürgerschaft nichtmuslimischer Staaten durch Muslime aus., Ab dem Jahr 1992 hielten die französische Union des organisations islamiques de France (UOIF) und die mit ihr verbundene Föderation Islamischer Organisationen in Europa (FIOE) Seminare zum islamischen Recht ab. 1997 gründete die FIOE den European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR). Die Aufgabe dieses Gremiums mit Sitz in Dublin sollte es sein, eine Normenlehre für die in Europa lebenden Muslime auszuarbeiten, die zeitgemäß sein sollte und Zeit, Ort, Brauch sowie Lebensumstände berücksichtigte. Geleitet wurde das Gremium von Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī., Er befasste sich in dieser Zeit ohnehin schon viel mit den Fragen muslimischer Minderheiten, so in der jeden Sonntagabend ausgestrahlten Sendung \\"Die Scharia und das Leben\\" in dem arabischen Fernsehsender Al Jazeera und auf der von ihm unterhaltenen Website IslamOnline, die viel auf die muslimischen Minderheiten im Westen und Osten einging., Entstehung und Verbreitung der Idee vom Fiqh al-aqallīyāt., Al-ʿAlwānī war es allerdings, der als erster den Ausdruck \\"Fiqh al-aqallīyāt\\" verwendete, und zwar 1994, als der FCNA unter seiner Leitung eine Fatwa ausstellte, der zufolge es amerikanischen Muslimen erlaubt ist, aktiv an Wahlen teilzunehmen. Bei einer Diskussion im IIIT, die im selben Jahr stattfand, beschrieb er das \\"Fiqh al-aqallīyāt\\" als einen neuen Namen für das, was in der malikitischen Rechtsschule in früheren Zeiten als „Jurisprudenz der Vorfälle“ \\"(fiqh an-nawāzil)\\" bezeichnet wurde, in der man sich mit der normativen Beurteilung bestimmter Vorfälle beschäftigte., Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo, der Sekretär des Fiqh-Rates von Nordamerika, vertiefte 1998 in einem Aufsatz den Gedanken einer Kontinuität des Fiqh al-aqallīyāt zum Fiqh an-nawāzil und erklärte: „Da das traditionelle Fiqh des Islam im Wesentlichen das Fiqh des historischen muslimischen Staates und seiner muslimischen Mehrheit ist, schenkt es dem Fiqh der muslimischen Minderheiten keine Beachtung, außer in Form der Nawāzil, die in verschiedenen Zeiten der Krise ausgestellt wurden, so während der Mongoleneinfälle, der Kreuzzüge oder während der Morisken-Periode der andalusischen Geschichte.“, Als 1996 die Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences (GSISS) in Ashburn (Virginia) gegründet wurde, sorgte al-ʿAlwānī dafür, dass das Minderheiten-Fiqh als obligatorisches Fach in den Lehrplan aufgenommen wurde. Nadia Mahmud Mustafa, eine ägyptische Professorin der Politikwissenschaft, die mit dem IIIT verbunden ist, entwickelte einen Kurs über die „politische Jurisprudenz der muslimischen Minderheiten“ \\"(al-fiqh as-siyāsī li-l-aqallīyāt al-muslima)\\" für die United Arab Emirates University. Später wurde das Minderheiten-Fiqh auch Unterrichtsfach an der privaten Islamic American University in Southfield, Michigan., Das Konzept des Fiqh al-aqallīyāt war 1997 auch in den arabischen Ländern schon so verbreitet, dass der Fernsehsender al-Jazeera ihm im November dieses Jahres eine eigene Folge seiner populären Sendung \\"Die Scharia und das Leben\\" widmete. Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, der zu dieser Sendung wie sonst auch meist als Gast eingeladen war, stand damals dem Ausdruck noch skeptisch gegenüber und zog den Begriff \\"Fiqh al-ightirāb\\" („Jurisprudenz des Lebens in der Fremde“) vor. Als er 1999 die erste Fatwa-Sammlung des ECFR herausgab, hatte er mit diesem Konzept aber keine Probleme mehr. In der Vorrede zu dieser Sammlung verwendet er es zur Rechtfertigung der Existenz des ECFR als eines separaten Fiqh-Gremiums neben den großen islamischen Fiqh-Akademien wie der Islamischen Forschungsakademie in Kairo, der Fiqh-Akademie der Organisation der islamischen Konferenz in Dschidda und der Fiqh-Akademie der Islamischen Weltliga: Der ECFR, so sagte er, mache diesen Gremien keine Konkurrenz, sondern ergänze sie nur auf einem Spezialfeld der Normenlehre, nämlich dem Fiqh al-aqallīyāt., Der ECFR wurde in den folgenden Jahren zu einem der wichtigsten Foren zur Diskussion und Verbreitung der verschiedenen Vorstellungen vom Minderheiten-Fiqh. Im Jahre 2004, nachdem bereits mehrere Bücher zum Minderheiten-Fiqh erschienen waren, bekannte sich der ECFR in seiner Zeitschrift zur Rechtmäßigkeit \\"(mašrūʿīya)\\" dieses Konzepts und erklärte, dass er es beim normenwissenschaftlichen Idschtihād sowohl auf theoretischer als auch auf: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Islam in Europa, Islam in Nordamerika, Islam und Politik, Islamisches Recht, Minderheitenpolitik, Religiöse Minderheiten, Fiqh al-aqallīyāt, Tāhā Dschābir al-ʿAlwānī, European Council for Fatwa and Research, Integration ohne Assimilation."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Ausgestorbene Schildkröte, Schildkröten, Testudines], \\"Santanachelys\\" ist eine Gattung der nur fossil nachgewiesenen Meeresschildkrötenfamilie Protostegidae. Die einzige Art der Gattung, \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\", galt bis zum Jahr 2015 die älteste bekannte fossile Meeresschildkröte. Die Fossilfunde der Art sind zur Charakterisierung und Erforschung der frühen Evolution der Echten Meeresschildkröten und der Lederschildkröten von großer Bedeutung. \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" wurde von dem Erstbeschreiber Ren Hirayama in die heute ausgestorbene Familie der Protostegidae gestellt, deren prominentester Vertreter \\"Archelon\\" aus der Oberkreide Nordamerikas ist, die größte bekannte marine Schildkröte in der Erdgeschichte., Merkmale., Das Fossil der \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" ist etwa 20 Zentimeter lang, der Panzer erreicht an seiner Mittelachse eine Länge von 14,5 Zentimeter. Als wichtigste Merkmale teilt \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" die paddelartigen Gliedmaßen sowie den Aufbau des Schädels mit den heutigen Vertretern der Meeresschildkröten. Die Paddel sind dabei allerdings nicht so ausgeprägt und waren wahrscheinlich nur für kurze Schwimmstrecken dienlich. Der Schädel weist einige deutliche Gemeinsamkeiten mit denen heutiger Vertreter auf, etwa die großen interorbitalen Schädelfenster (eine Knochenlücke zwischen den Augen), die vermuten lassen, dass auch diese Art bereits ein Salzausscheidungssystem mit Salzdrüsen besaß. Vermutlich waren diese bereits vorhanden, bevor die Schildkröten endgültig in den marinen Lebensraum wechselten. Die Salzdrüsen könnten sich als nützlich in der Lagune erwiesen haben, die die Santana-Formation vor 110 Millionen Jahren wahrscheinlich war., Von allen anderen bisher bekannten Vertretern der Meeresschildkröten unterscheidet sich \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" durch die besondere, gebogene Form der ersten Rippe sowie durch die bewegliche Verbindung der Mittelhandknochen (Metacarpalia) und der Fingerknochen und eine deutlich andere Form des Oberarmknochens. Bei der offensichtlich sehr nah verwandten Gattung \\"Rhinochelys\\", von der nur ein Schädel bekannt ist, sind es vor allem die deutlich schmaleren Nasenknochen, die sie von \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" abgrenzt., Fundort und Alter., Gefunden wurde \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" in Ostbrasilien in der Santana-Formation. Die Fossilien der Fundschicht wurden in den Ablagerungen der höchsten Unterkreide (Albium) gefunden und sind etwa 110 Millionen Jahre alt. Zudem wurden neben Neben \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" eine Vielzahl von Fischfossilien sowie auch einige interessante Schildkröten gefunden wurden, darunter die dem Taxon Araripemydidae zugeordnete Art \\"Araripemys barretoi\\" (Meylan, 1996) und die in das Taxon Bothremydidae eingeordnete \\"Cearachelys placidoi\\"., Der Holotyp (THUg1386), also das der Erstbeschreibung zugrunde liegende Exemplar, befindet sich in der Teikyo Heisei Universität in Ichihara, Chiba, in Japan. Es handelt sich um ein beinahe komplettes und gut erhaltenes Skelett, weitere Fundstücke von \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" sind bisher nicht bekannt., Bedeutung des Fossilfundes., Der Fund des Fossils in der Santana-Formation verschob den Fossilbefund für die Meeresschildkröten von der Oberkreide, aus der bereits bekannte Fossilien der Gattungen \\"Rhinochelys\\" und \\"Notochelone\\" stammen, etwa um zehn Millionen Jahre in die Unterkreide. 2015 wurde mit \\"Desmatochelys padillai\\" aus Kolumbien ein weiterer Vertreter der Protostegidae gefunden, dessen Alter auf etwa 120 Millionen Jahre geschätzt wird., Die Merkmale von \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" charakterisierten sie als den primitivsten Vertreter der bisher bekannten Protostegidae. Des Weiteren konnte durch diesen Fund nachgewiesen werden, dass eine Trennung der drei Meeresschildkrötenfamilien, den heute noch existierenden (rezenten) Echten Meeresschildkröten (Cheloniidae) und Lederschildkröten (Dermochelyidae) und den ausgestorbenen Protostegidae, bereits in der frühen Kreidezeit oder noch davor stattgefunden haben muss. Auch die Entstehung der Meeresschildkrötenverwandten (Chelonioidea) fand entsprechend wahrscheinlich weit früher statt als bislang angenommen. Als dritte Besonderheit des Fossils konnte herausgestellt werden, dass \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" der erste Fund einer Protostegidae in Südamerika war. Bei dem gefundenen Tier kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass es sich um ein ausgewachsenes Exemplar handelt; als Indiz dafür kann der hohe Grad der Verknöcherung des Skeletts, vor allem des Schädels und der Gliedmaßen, angesehen werden., Eine der bedeutendsten Fragen zur Anpassung der im Meer lebenden Schildkröten ist die nach dem Zeitpunkt, zu dem sich die Gliedmaßen zu paddelartigen Schwimmbeinen entwickelt haben. Eine getrennte Bewegung der Finger ist nach diesem Zeitpunkt nicht mehr möglich. Eine primitivere Form der Paddelgliedmaßen mit noch beweglichen Einzelfingern fand man etwa bei den Vertretern der Gattungen \\"Toxochelys\\" und \\"Tasbacka\\" innerhalb der Echten Meeresschildkröten aus dem späten Paläozän. Die Entdeckung der relativ primitiven paddelartigen Gliedmaßen bei \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" bedeutet, dass sich die Paddel bei den drei Gruppen der Meeresschildkröten wahrscheinlich unabhängig voneinander entwickelt haben., Auch die Entwicklung der bei den heute lebenden Vertretern der meeresbewohnenden Schildkröten wichtigen Salzdrüsen stellt eine wichtige Frage zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Meeresschildkröten dar. Diese Drüsen helfen den Schildkröten, überschüssiges Salz, welches durch Osmose in den Körper gelangt, auszuscheiden, da die Nieren allein dieser Aufgabe nicht gewachsen sind. Die Salzdrüsen selbst sind große Drüsen am Innenrand der Augen; sie sind größer als das Gehirn der Tiere und nehmen entsprechend Platz im Schildkrötenschädel ein. Aus diesem Grunde besitzen die Meeresschildkröten ein großes als „Foramen interorbitale“ bezeichnetes Schädelfenster, es wird durch eine Knochenspange („Processus inferior parietalis“) begrenzt. Bei den Lederschildkröten fehlt diese Spange vollständig, entsprechend große Salzdrüsen besitzen die Tiere. Die Echten Meeresschildkröten sowie fossile Arten wie \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" und andere Meeresschildkrötenverwandten (\\"Toxochelys\\", \\"Corsochelys\\") besitzen diesen Processus noch, jedoch als schmale Spange. Bei noch weiter zurückliegenden Arten ist er breiter. Es wird angenommen, dass die Arten mit einer schmalen Knochenspange entsprechend bereits gut ausgebildete Salzdrüsen besessen haben und auch schon in einem marinen Lebensraum gelebt haben müssen; sie haben diesen somit bereits weit vor der Entwicklung der Schwimmpaddel genutzt., Systematik., Die wissenschaftliche Erstbeschreibung der Art und auch der Gattung erfolgte durch den japanischen Paläontologen Ren Hirayama im Jahr 1998., Auf der Basis eines Vergleiches von insgesamt 104 Merkmalen der Skelette verschiedener ausgestorbener und heute noch lebender Meeresschildkrötenverwandter und einiger Arten außerhalb dieses Taxons (Außengruppenvergleich) wurde von ihm eine kladistische Stammbaumanalyse durchgeführt, um \\"Santanachelys gaffneyi\\" innerhalb des Systems der Meeresschildkröten einzuordnen. Die Analyse wurde unter mit Hilfe der als PAUP (phylogenetic analysis using parsimony) bekannten Software durchgeführt und kam zu dem folgenden Ergebnis (vereinfacht):, Namensgebung., Den wissenschaftlichen Namen leitet der Autor der Erstbeschreibung von der Fundstelle Santana in Brasilien sowie der griechischen Bezeichnung \\"chelys\\" für Schildkröte ab.

Sollen diese ebenfalls eingeschlossen werden, werden gelegentlich die Begriffe \\"First Peoples\\" und \\"Premiers Peuples\\" (Erste Völker) oder \\"Aboriginal Peoples\\" und \\"Peuples aborigènes\\" (Ureinwohnervölker) gebraucht; in den letzten Jahren spricht man häufiger von \\"Autochthon Peoples\\" und \\"Peuples autochtones\\" in beiden Hauptsprachen Kanadas., Häufig wird mit dem Begriff \\"First Nations\\" keine ethnische Zuordnung vorgenommen, sondern eine politische, was manchmal dazu führt, dass damit die Regierung der jeweiligen Ethnie gemeint ist. Auch werden damit gelegentlich Individuen bezeichnet –in der Form \\"First Nations People\\"–, doch ist die Bezeichnung \\"Indianer\\" hier viel häufiger anzutreffen. Allerdings ist der Begriff im englischsprachigen Amerika umstritten, im Gegensatz zum deutschen Begriff., Der Begriff \\"First Nations\\" tauchte wohl Anfang der 1980er Jahre erstmals auf. Damit wurde ein Begriff geschaffen, der sich von dem in Kanada ebenfalls gebräuchlichen Begriff \\"Indian Tribe\\" oder \\"Band\\" erheblich unterscheidet. Das gilt allerdings weniger für den Gebrauch im Alltag als für den juristischen und den politischen Bereich. Eine Nation kann sich auf das Völkerrecht berufen, das häufig als „internationales Recht“ bezeichnet wird, eine ethnische Gruppe nur auf Minderheitenschutz., Von den rund 700.000 Menschen, die sich als Indianer verstehen, zählen etwa 565.000 zu den 617 vom Staat anerkannten Stämmen (Stand: Anfang 2014), von denen allein fast 200 in British Columbia leben. Nur sie gelten im Sinne des zuständigen Ministeriums, des Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, juristisch als \\"Indians\\". Etwa 133.000 gehören keinem Stamm an, gehören also ebenso zu den First Nations und sind dennoch im juristischen Sinne keine Indianer. Der Staat bestimmt also, ob eine Gruppe einen Stamm darstellt und ob ein Angehöriger einer First Nation ein Indianer ist. Dieser Definitionsgewalt setzt der Begriff der First Nations das Bestimmungsrecht der Ureinwohner entgegen. Zudem ist der staatliche Gebrauch außerhalb der Rechtssphäre unpräzise. Im Deutschen ist der Begriff „Indianer“ gleichfalls nicht unbelastet (siehe Indianer: Begriff), dennoch soll er hier aus Verständnisgründen gebraucht werden., In jüngster Zeit werden die Indianer in den USA, die als \\"American Indians\\" oder \\"Native Americans\\", in Alaska als \\"Alaska Natives\\", manchmal als \\"Locals\\" bezeichnet werden, analog zu \\"First Nations\\" als \\"First Americans\\" bezeichnet., Überblick., Die indigenen Kulturen lassen sich in Kanada in fünf Kulturareale unterteilen, die sehr unterschiedliche klimatische und ökologische Bedingungen aufweisen. Diese erforderten Anpassungen, die die Kulturen bis heute prägen. Während im Norden und in den Graslandschaften des Zentrums lange nomadische Gruppen vorherrschten, waren dies im Westen und Osten sesshafte, zum Teil bäuerliche oder saisonal in bestimmten Gebieten wandernde Gruppen, bei denen Fischfang von großer Bedeutung war, bei einigen Gruppen auch Robbenjagd. Dazu kamen im Westen Walfänger. Diesen Lebensformen waren auch die Behausungen angepasst, von denen Tipi und Wigwam die bekanntesten sind, doch entwickelten sich an den Großen Seen und im Westen auch Großdörfer mit Langhäusern. Vielfach bestanden Stammeskonföderationen. Schamanen waren von großer Bedeutung., Die um 1500 beginnende Phase der Handelskontakte mit Europäern ging nach 1600 in die koloniale Phase über, in der europäische Siedler zunehmend Land beanspruchten und in der viele Stämme durch Epidemien ausgelöscht wurden. Im 19.Jahrhundert entstanden zahlreiche Reservate und Kanada versuchte, die Indianer zu assimilieren, indem sie zu Bauern erzogen werden sollten. Bis in die 1970er Jahre besuchten fast alle Kinder internatartige Schulen, genannt Residential Schools, in denen sie ihre Sprache nicht gebrauchen durften. Erst ab 1960 durften auch die Indianer in den Reservaten erstmals an Wahlen auf Bundesebene teilnehmen, die letzten Internate wurden im Jahre 1996 aufgelöst., Innerhalb der First Nations der Nordwestküste oder des Nordostens besteht vielfach das traditionelle, auf voreuropäische Wurzeln zurückgehende Herrschaftssystem mit einem erblichen Häuptlingstum fort, jedoch in Konkurrenz mit dem von Kanada initiierten System der gewählten Häuptlinge und ihrer Berater. Während die First Nations sich auf Verträge berufen und zunehmend quasi-staatliche Autorität in festen Territorien verlangen, betrachtet Kanadas Regierung die Indianer eher als Gruppen von Individuen, und einige Provinzen versuchen eine Privatisierung des Landes durchzusetzen, das bisher dem jeweiligen Stamm als Ganzes gehört., Einige First Nations sind zu einem gewissen Wohlstand gekommen, viele leiden jedoch unter Armut und gravierenden sozialen Problemen. Das gilt vor allem für ländlich lebende Gruppen, deren natürliche Umgebung durch Rohstoffexploration (Uran, Ölschiefer, vor allem in Saskatchewan, Ontario, Québec und Alberta), Militärbasen (Cold Lake, Goose Bay) und Holzeinschlag (vor allem in British Columbia, aber auch in den anderen Provinzen) zerstört worden ist. Dennoch entwickeln sich überregionale Kultur- und Wirtschaftsbündnisse, die inzwischen auch weit entfernt lebende indigene Völker einschließen., Dabei sind Bildung und Ausbildung von großer Bedeutung, und auch die Hochschulbildung kann seit 2003 an der First-Nations-Universität von Kanada in Saskatchewan absolviert werden. Viele der kleinen Sprachen sind vom Aussterben bedroht, doch bemühen sich die Stämme und einige staatliche Einrichtungen um ihren Erhalt. Die Sprache mit den meisten Sprechern ist das Cree., Darüber hinaus leiden Indianer auch am systemischen Rassismus, der im kanadischen Justizsystem, bei der Polizei (Mounted Police RCMP), in den Gerichten und Gefängnissen vorhanden ist. Ein Indiz für den systemischen Rassismus bei der RCMP sei die Tatsache, dass 36 % der Todesschüsse, die durch „Mounties“ ausgeführt wurden, Angehörige indigener Gruppen trafen, obwohl Indianer und Inuit nur 4 % der Bevölkerung stellen., Begriff., In Kanada werden die Angehörigen der First Nations häufig als \\"First Nations People\\" bezeichnet. Dieser Begriff steht in Konkurrenz zum Begriff „Indianer“ (\\"Indian\\"), der in der Öffentlichkeit meist unscharf für alle Angehörigen der vom Staat anerkannten Indianerstämme (\\"bands\\" oder \\"tribes\\"), aber auch für all diejenigen benutzt wird, die sich selbst als Indianer betrachten oder die von anderen dieser Gruppe zugerechnet werden., Rechtlich exakt definiert das Indianergesetz (Indian Act) seit 1876, wer ein Indianer ist. Um als Indianer staatlicherseits anerkannt zu werden, muss man einem der anerkannten Indianerstämme angehören. Dabei ist die Zugehörigkeit zu mehreren Stämmen nicht möglich, auch wenn die Eltern verschiedenen Stämmen angehörten; ausschlaggebend ist der Vater. Selbst in Regionen, in denen die ethnischen Gruppen ein ganz anderes Verständnis hatten und keine Stämme im europäischen Sinne kannten, wurde ihnen dieses Konzept, das auf genetischer Verwandtschaft basiert, aufgezwungen. Die Diskussion um die kartographische Festlegung der sogenannten traditionellen Stammesgebiete, die für Kompensationszahlungen und Vertragsverhandlungen größte Bedeutung hat, ist somit an Vorstellungen des 19. Jahrhunderts ausgerichtet. In vielen Regionen gab es jedoch keine ausschließlichen Rechte an einem bestimmten Stammesgebiet, wie die Euro-Kanadier oft meinen, sondern vielmehr sich überlappende Nutzungsrechte, die zudem oftmals an Haus- und Wohngruppen oder an Familien, Clans und Verwandtschaftslinien und auch an zyklische Wanderungen im Jahreslauf gebunden waren., Der staatlichen Definitionsgewalt soll mit dem Begriff \\"First Nation\\" ein eigenes Verständnis entgegengesetzt werden. Dieses besteht darin, dass jeder Stamm selbst bestimmt, wer ihm angehören soll, und dass die Anerkennung als Stamm nicht von einer staatlichen Behörde abhängt. Somit gibt es zahlreiche First Nations, die nicht offiziell als Stämme gelten. Gleichzeitig wird der Charakter einer souveränen Nation mit allen Rechten und Pflichten stärker betont. Als nationales Repräsentationsorgan fungiert dementsprechend die Versammlung der First Nations. Aktuell sind rund 20 % der Angehörigen von anerkannten First Nations nicht als Indianer anerkannt. Eine Reihe von First Nations, wie die Kichesipirini in der Provinz Québec, ist wiederum nicht als Stamm (\\"Tribe\\") anerkannt., Der Begriff \\"First Nations\\" wurde erstmals 1982 bei der Benennung der Versammlung der First Nations offiziell benutzt. Als Selbstbezeichnung der meisten ethnischen Gruppen hat er inzwischen weitgehend den Begriff \\"Band\\" oder \\"Indian Band\\" abgelöst, so dass der Begriff auch im Singular gebräuchlich ist. Während der Begriff \\"Tribe\\" in den Vereinigten Staaten überwiegt, ist in Kanada der Begriff \\"Band\\" im offiziellen Sprachgebrauch weiterhin üblich. Dabei wird er wie eine Art Oberbegriff gebraucht, der \\"First Nations\\", \\"Tribes\\" und \\"Bands\\" umfasst., Obwohl der Begriff \\"First Nations\\" auch von den kanadischen Behörden verwendet wird, ist er juristisch nicht genau festgelegt. Daher bevorzugen die zuständigen Behörden in Rechtsfragen die Bezeichnung \\"Indianer\\". Das für „Indianerangelegenheiten“ zuständige Ministerium Kanadas ist Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. In den Provinzen existieren Ministerien mit ähnlichen Namen., Im bereits genannten Indian Act werden dabei drei Arten von Indianern unterschieden:, Dazu kommt noch eine vierte Gruppe, deren Größe seit 1985 auf rund 117.000 Menschen angewachsen ist. Sie sind die Nachkommen von Indianerinnen, die Nicht-Indianer geheiratet haben. Da der \\"Indian Act\\" nur die patrilineare Abstammung als ausschlaggebend betrachtet –ganz im Gegensatz etwa zu den matrilinearen Irokesen– konnten diese Kinder nur auf Antrag den Indianerstatus wiedererlangen. Doch verlieren wiederum deren Kinder diesen Status, es sei denn, sie heiraten einen Status-Indianer. Diese Regelung sorgt dafür, dass diese als „Bill C-31 Indians“ bezeichnete Gruppe nach zwei Generationen weitgehend verschwunden sein wird. Zudem widerspricht sie Grundrechten, wie sie die Verfassung von 1982 enthält. Dazu gehören in diesem Fall nach Auffassung des Obersten Gerichtshofs von British Columbia die Gleichheit aller vor dem Gesetz, insbesondere ohne Ansehen der Abstammung und des Geschlechts. Mit dem Tod der letzten Status-Indianer muss das nur ihnen zugesprochene Reservat an die Regierung zurückgegeben werden – ein Vorgang, den der Häuptling der Six Nations, Bill Montour, als „den größten Landdiebstahl des Jahrhunderts“ bezeichnet., Alle Mitglieder der anerkannten Stämme, die Ansprüche a: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"1.

Die Stadt ist das wichtigste Wirtschafts-, Finanz- und Kulturzentrum des Landes sowie ein wichtiger Verkehrsknotenpunkt. Im administrativen Stadtgebiet von São Paulo leben rund 12,396 Millionen Menschen (2021)., São Paulo ist zudem der größte industrielle Ballungsraum in Lateinamerika und bildet mit Nachbarstädten eine der größten Metropolregionen der Erde und die zweitgrößte der Südhalbkugel., Die Stadt ist durch zahlreiche Einwanderer aus aller Welt multikulturell geprägt mit wesentlichen portugiesischen, italienischen, deutschen, libanesischen und japanischen sowie afrobrasilianischen Einflüssen. Die Einwohner der \\"Stadt\\" São Paulo heißen „paulistanos“, während mit „Paulistas“ eigentlich die Einwohner des Bundesstaats gemeint sind. Man verwendet diesen Begriff auch häufig verallgemeinernd für die Bewohner der Metropole., Geographie., Geographische Lage., Die Stadt liegt im Südosten Brasiliens 80 Kilometer vom Atlantischen Ozean entfernt im Hochbecken der Flüsse Rio Tietê und Rio Pinheiros, durchschnittlich 795 Meter über dem Meeresspiegel. Das Stadtgebiet hat eine Fläche von 1523 Quadratkilometern und erstreckt sich ungefähr 60 Kilometer in Nord-Süd-Richtung und 80 Kilometer in Ost-West-Richtung., Die Metropolregion Grande São Paulo umfasst außer der Stadt São Paulo als Kernzone 38 weitere Städte mit einer Gesamtfläche von 7947 Quadratkilometern. Das überbaute Stadtgebiet der Region mit einer Fläche von 2209 Quadratkilometern nahm von 1962 bis 2002 um 874 Quadratkilometer zu., Zwanzig Kilometer hinter der Hafenstadt Santos steigt die im Brasilianischen Bergland gelegene Serra do Mar schnell bis auf durchschnittlich 1200 Meter an und fällt dann auf die Hochebene von São Paulo ab. Santos und São Paulo verbindet ein natürlicher Pass über die Serra do Mar. Die Hochebene von São Paulo ist aber nicht flach, sondern ein Hügelland, so dass sich auch die Stadt São Paulo über zahlreiche Hügel erstreckt., Nur etwa die Hälfte des Wassers im Rio Tietê ist natürlichen Ursprungs, und auch die für die städtische Wasserversorgung wichtigen Stauseen im Süden São Paulos sind durch die Einleitung nicht geklärter Abwässer ungeplanter Wohnsiedlungen und Favelas kaum noch für die Gewinnung von Trinkwasser nutzbar. Die Folgen sind Geruchsbelästigung der Bevölkerung, Eutrophierung und ein unzumutbarer Geschmack des Leitungswassers sowie hohe Kosten für das Erreichen von Trinkwasserqualität., Geologie., Das östliche Bergland, in dem die Stadt São Paulo liegt, erstreckt sich vom nördlichen Bahia über die Bundesstaaten Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo und São Paulo bis in den Südteil des Bundesstaates Paraná. Die großen Höhenunterschiede und der engräumige Wechsel von hochaufragenden Gebirgsschollen und tiefeingesenkten Tälern und Becken bringen eine große Vielfalt hervor. Im Allgemeinen treten die Gesteine der alten Brasilianischen Masse an die Oberfläche, also kristalline Schiefer, saure und basische Plutonite sowie Quarzite., Im Landesinneren flacht sich die alte Rumpffläche ab, und die auflagernden Schichten haben sich erhalten können. Unter ihnen sind die permokarbonischen Konglomerate im Süden, die die als Tillite bezeichneten verfestigten Moränenablagerungen enthalten. In altpaläozoischen Gesteinsserien finden sich die für die Landesgeschichte so bedeutsamen Gold- und Diamantenlager. Landschaftlich treten vor allem durch ihre Schichtstufen devone Sandsteine im südlichen Teil und kreidezeitliche Sandsteine im nördlichen Teil hervor. Die nach Osten gerichteten Steilabfälle dieser Schichtstufen begrenzen vielfach das östliche Bergland., Stadtgliederung., São Paulo gliedert sich nach den Himmelsrichtungen in 9 Verwaltungszonen (\\"zonas\\"): Nordost, Nordwest, West, Zentrum-Süd, Zentrum, Südosten, Süd, Ost 01 und Ost 02. Sie werden in 32 Unterpräfekturen (\\"subprefeituras\\") bzw. insgesamt in 96 Distrikte (\\"distritos\\") gegliedert; letztere werden in Stadtviertel (\\"bairros\\") unterteilt., Die Unterpräfekturen der Stadt sind:, Aricanduva/Vila Formosa, Butantã, Campo Limpo, Capela do Socorro, Casa Verde, Cidade Ademar, Cidade Tiradentes, Ermelino Matarazzo, Freguesia do Ó, Guaianazes, Ipiranga, Itaim Paulista, Itaquera, Jabaquara, Jaçanã/Tremembé, Lapa, M’Boi Mirim, Mooca, Parelheiros, Penha, Perus, Pinheiros, Pirituba/Jaraguá, Santana/Tucuruvi, Santo Amaro, São Mateus, São Miguel Paulista, Sé, Vila Maria/Vila Guilherme, Vila Mariana und Vila Prudente., Klima., São Paulo befindet sich in der subtropischen Klimazone. Die Temperaturen erreichen im Sommer Werte von 25 bis 28 Grad Celsius mit Spitzenwerten von über 30 Grad Celsius, während sie im Winter selten unter 10 Grad Celsius sinken. Frost tritt auch im Winter fast nie auf. Die höchste Temperatur wurde offiziell am 15. November 1985 mit 35,3 Grad Celsius gemessen, die tiefste am 2. August 1955 mit −2,1 Grad Celsius (beide an der nationalen Wetterstation „Mirante de Santana“ in der Nordregion). In den umliegenden Bergen (Horto Florestal) sank das Thermometer am 2. August 1955 auf −3,9 Grad Celsius (Messung inoffiziell)., Über Schneefall wird in der Geschichte der Stadt nur vom 25. Juni 1918 berichtet. Niederschlag ist besonders in den wärmeren Monaten reichlich vorhanden, aber selten zwischen Juni und August. Weder São Paulo noch die nahe gelegene Küste sind je durch einen tropischen Wirbelsturm heimgesucht worden, auch Tornados sind selten. Der Wintermonat August war in den ersten Jahren des 21. Jahrhunderts meist trocken und vergleichsweise warm. Die Temperaturen stiegen bis auf 24 Grad Celsius. Dieses Phänomen wird auf Portugiesisch „Veranico“ genannt („kleiner Sommer“)., Die Jahresdurchschnittstemperatur beträgt in São Paulo 18,5 Grad Celsius, die jährliche Niederschlagsmenge 1455 Millimeter im Mittel. Die wärmsten Monate sind Januar und Februar mit durchschnittlich 21,0 bis 21,3 Grad Celsius, der kälteste Monat ist der Juli mit 14,7 Grad Celsius im Mittel. Der meiste Niederschlag fällt in den Monaten Januar und Februar mit 201 bis 239 Millimetern im Durchschnitt, der wenigste im Juli und August mit 39 bis 44 Millimetern im Mittel., Umweltprobleme., Das Wachstum der Stadt, die hohe Industriedichte und Verkehrskonzentration führen in São Paulo zu zahlreichen Umweltproblemen. Die Verschmutzung der Luft, die Belastung der Gewässer, die Belästigung durch Lärm und Emissionen durch den Verkehr sowie Entsorgungsprobleme bei Müll und Abwasser sind die gravierendsten Probleme São Paulos., Die Verschmutzung des Wassers des Rio Tietê und des Rio Pinheiros durch industrielle und häusliche Abwässer hat dazu geführt, dass diese beiden Hauptflüsse im Stadtgebiet biologisch tot und zu reinen Abwasserkanälen mit hohen Konzentrationen an Schwermetallen geworden sind., Im Frühjahr 2015 war die Versorgung der Stadt mit Trinkwasser akut gefährdet, nachdem die Reserven aus dem Sistema Cantareira-Reservoir wegen der anhaltenden Dürreperiode auf 6 % des Normalstandes gefallen waren., Die Versiegelung der Flächen engt nicht nur die Möglichkeiten zur Erholung der Bevölkerung auf wenige gut erreichbare Parks in der Stadt stark ein, sondern behindert auch den Abfluss der Niederschläge. So kommt es in São Paulo besonders während der Sommermonate (Dezember bis März) immer wieder zu Überschwemmungen von Teilen der Stadt, oft auch mit einigen Todesopfern., Die Ver- und Entsorgung variiert sehr stark je nach dem sozialen Status eines Stadtteiles. Vom Citybereich und den innenstadtnahen gehobenen Wohnbereichen des Übergangsgebiets nimmt die Qualität dieser Dienstleistungen und infrastrukturellen Einrichtungen zum Stadtrand hin schnell ab. Die Qualität von Luft und Wasser ist im metropolitanen Kerngebiet allerdings schlechter als in zahlreichen peripheren Bezirken. So hat die Schadstoffbelastung der Luft trotz eines leichten Rückgangs bei einzelnen Stoffen immer noch alarmierende Ausmaße, die durch Industriebetriebe (vor allem Schwebstäube, Stickstoffdioxid, Schwefeldioxid) und den Straßenverkehr (Kohlenmonoxid) verursacht werden., Rund 90 Prozent der schlechten Luftqualität werden durch den Straßenverkehr bewirkt. Durch die Beckenlage São Paulos mit fehlendem Luftaustausch und häufigen thermischen Inversionen im Winter (Juni bis August) sind Atemwegserkrankungen bei der Bevölkerung sehr weit verbreitet. Eine städtische Weisheit besagt, dass Krankheiten mit dem Regen kommen. Das lässt sich darauf zurückführen, dass die Niederschläge Schadstoffe aus der Luft auswaschen und zurück in Bodennähe transportieren., Geschichte., Ursprung., São Paulo wurde am 25. Januar 1554, dem Fest der Bekehrung des Apostels Paulus, von den Padres Manuel da Nobrega und José de Anchieta, zwei jesuitischen Missionaren, bei ihrem – nach dem örtlichen Fluss benannten – Missionsstützpunkt Piratininga gegründet., Für lange Zeit blieb das Gebiet isoliert, da die Produktivität der dortigen Zuckerrohrplantagen nicht besonders hoch war; die Bewohner betrieben Subsistenzwirtschaft. Erst im 17.Jahrhundert wurde in der Gegend Weizen für den Export angebaut., Die Siedlung wurde nacheinander Hauptstadt des Kapitanats São Vicente (1681) und des Kapitanats São Paulo (1710). Die Jesuiten hatten von dem an der Küste des mittleren Brasiliens auf dem südlichen Wendekreis gelegenen portugiesischen Stützpunkt São Vicente aus– beim heutigen Santos– den von tropischen Regenwäldern überzogenen, zum Teil über 1000 Meter hohen Steilabfall des Küstengebirges (Serra do Mar) überwunden und in einem Hochbecken in ungefähr 800 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel die erste europäische Siedlungsgründung auf dem Hochland vorgenommen., 1711 ist São Paulo aufgrund der strategisch günstigen Lage in der Nähe eines Passes über die Serra do Mar das Stadtrecht verliehen worden. Am 7. September 1822 wurde in São Paulo die Unabhängigkeit Brasiliens von Portugal erklärt. Trotzdem blieb São Paulo bis in die 1870er Jahre relativ unbedeutend. Allerdings durchstreiften die portugiesischen Einwanderer, teilweise vermischt mit der indianischen Hochlandbevölkerung, im 16. und 17.Jahrhundert von São Paulo aus als Bandeirantes („Bannerträger“) weite Gebiete im zentralen Teil von Brasilien. Vor allem unternahmen sie als Sklavenjäger die berüchtigten Raubzüge zum Fang der Indianer, die den Besitzern der Plantagen im Küstentiefland die beim Zuckerrohranbau benötigten Arbeitssklaven beschafften., Kaffeeanbau und Industrial: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"São Paulo, Brasilien, Hauptstadt, Bundesstaat, Metropole, Hochschulstadt, Millionenstadt, multikulturell, Verkehrsknotenpunkt, Industrie, Umweltprobleme, Klima, Stadtgliederung, Geographie, Geschichte, Bergland, Hochebene, Trinkwasser, Luftverschmutzung, Atemwegserkrankungen"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Außenminister (Usbekistan), Bildungsminister (Usbekistan), Drama, Dschadidismus, Erzählung, Finanzminister (Usbekistan), Geboren 1886, Gestorben 1938, Herausgeber, Hochschullehrer (Usbekistan)], Abdurauf Fitrat [] (* 1886 in Buchara; † im Oktober 1938 in Taschkent) war ein zentralasiatischer Schriftsteller, Journalist und Politiker aus dem heutigen Usbekistan und ein bucharischer Vertreter des Dschadidismus., Fitrat forderte in seinen anfangs persischsprachigen Schriften Neuerungen im sozialen und kulturellen Leben in Zentralasien, später lehnte sich sein Programm am Panturkismus an. Nach dem Ende des Emirats Buchara übernahm Fitrat verschiedene Ministerposten in der Regierung der Volksrepublik Buchara. Nach der Machtübernahme der Sowjets wurde nach einem kurzen Exil in Moskau Hochschullehrer in der Usbekischen SSR und später Opfer des Großen Terrors., Fitrats literarisches Werk umfasst sowohl lyrische als auch prosaische Werke, die Einflüsse traditioneller islamischer und zentralasiatischer Literatur genauso zeigen wie eine Annäherung an „moderne“ Genres. Seine Sach- und Lehrbücher widmen sich Themen wie Islam, Literatur- und Musikgeschichte und Sprachwissenschaft. Nach Fitrats Tod war der Großteil seiner Werke jahrzehntelang verboten. Heute wird Fitrats Bedeutung für die Herausbildung sowohl der modernen usbekischen als auch der tadschikischen Literatursprache anerkannt. Während er in Tadschikistan gegenwärtig mitunter als „Verräter“ tituliert wird, gilt er in der offiziellen usbekischen Geschichtsschreibung mittlerweile als Märtyrer., Namensvarianten., Fitrats Name taucht in vielen verschiedenen Formen und Schreibweisen auf: Meist verwendete er selbst als Künstlernamen \\"Fitrat\\" (), transkribiert auch als \\"Fetrat\\" oder gemäß der usbekischen Schriftreform von 1921 \\"Pitrat\\". Der aus dem arabischen Begriff abgeleitete Name stand im osmanischen Türkisch für das Konzept der Natur und wahrer Religion, in Zentralasien im 19. Jahrhundert, so der russische Turkologe Lasar Budagow, hingegen für Almosen im Zeitraum des Fests des Fastenbrechens (\\"ʿĪd al-Fiṭr\\"). Im Persischen und Tadschikischen erstreckt sich die Bedeutung von \\"Fitrat\\" auf Religion, Kreation, Weisheit und Klugheit. Der Künstlername \\"Fitrat\\" wurde bereits zuvor vom Dichter Fitrat Zarduz Samarqandi (spätes 17. bis frühes 18. Jahrhundert) verwendet. Abdurauf Fitrats erstes bekanntes Pseudonym lautete \\"Mijmar\\" (aus dem arabischen )., Fitrats arabischer Name lautet (bisweilen abweichend ), mit \\"Abdurauf\\" als Eigenname und manchmal mit der Nisba \\"Buchārāī\\". In reformierter arabischer Schrift wurde \\"Fitrat\\" als oder wiedergegeben. Die turksprachige Variante des Nasab lautet., Unter den russischen Varianten seines Namens finden sich –neben anderen– und ; Fitrats sowjetischer, russifizierter Name lautete auf oder, unter Weglassung des Namensbestandteils \\"ʿAbd\\",. Ebenfalls anzutreffen ist die Schreibweise. In usbekisch-kyrillischer Schrift ist sein Name mit wiederzugeben; sein moderner tadschikischer Name lautet., Fitrat trug bisweilen die Titel „Hoji“ und „Professor“. Sein Vorname findet sich in lateinischen Umschriften unter anderem auch als \\"Abdurrauf\\", \\"Abdulrauf\\" oder \\"Abdalrauf\\". Fitrat unterschrieb seine Werke teils nur mit seinem Vornamen oder kürzte ihn mit \\"A.\\" oder \\"R.\\" ab., Leben und Schaffen., Ausbildung in Buchara., Fitrat wurde 1886 (eigenen Angaben zufolge 1884) in Buchara geboren. Über seine Kindheit ist – laut Adeeb Khalid typisch für eine zentralasiatische Persönlichkeit dieser Ära – recht wenig bekannt. Sein Vater Abdurahimboy war ein gläubiger Muslim und weitgereister Händler, der die Familie in Richtung Margʻilon und später Kaschgar verlassen sollte. Von seiner belesenen Mutter, je nach Quelle Mustafbibi, Nastarbibi, oder Bibijon genannt, erhielt der junge Abdurauf eine weltliche Ausbildung. Sie brachte ihm laut Edward A. Allworth die Werke von Bedil, Fuzuli, Alisher Navoiy und anderen näher. Abdurauf hatte mit Abdurahmon und Mahbuba einen Bruder und eine Schwester., Muhammaddschon Schakurij zufolge vollzog Abdurauf im Kindesalter mit seinem Vater den Haddsch. Nach der Ausbildung an einer \\"maktab\\" soll Fitrat 1899 Studien an der Mir-i-Arab-Medrese in Buchara begonnen und 1910 beendet haben; zwischen 1907 und 1910 reiste Fitrat ausgiebig durch das russische Turkestan und das Emirat Buchara. Der Philologe Begali Qosimov geht davon aus, dass Fitrat bis zu seinem 18. Lebensjahr in Buchara studierte und zwischen 1904 und 1907 den Haddsch mit Besuch der Türkei, des Iran sowie Indiens absolvierte und auch Russland bereiste. Laut Zaynobiddin Abdurashidov, Prorektor an der Alisher-Navoiy-Universität für usbekische Sprache und Literatur, pilgerte Fitrat Anfangs des 20. Jahrhunderts Fitrat im Rahmen einer Reise durch Asian nach Mekka, während der er für einige Zeit in Indien lebte, wo er sich als Barbier Geld für die Rückreise verdiente. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt sei er in Buchara bereits als Dichter unter seinem Pseudonym \\"Mijmar\\" bekannt gewesen. Auch Khalid und Allworth benennen die Mir-i-Arab-Medrese als Fitrats Ausbildungsstätte in Buchara. Während seines Medresen-Studiums wurde Fitrat von seinem Lehrer auch in antiker griechischer Philosophie unterrichtet., Fitrat schrieb in seiner 1929 veröffentlichten Autobiographie, Buchara sei eines der dunkelsten religiösen Zentren gewesen, er sei fanatischer Muslim gewesen und er habe anfangs die Reformbewegung des Dschadidismus (\\"usul-i dschadid\\" ‚neue Methode‘) abgelehnt. Eine Grundausbildung in jener „neuen Methode“ erhielt Fitrat selbst nicht. Sadriddin Ayni zufolge war Fitrat als einer der aufgeklärtesten und verdienstvollsten Studenten im Buchara seiner Zeit bekannt, außerhalb Bucharas war er jedoch laut Abdurashidov bis 1911 de facto unbekannt. Dass sich Fitrat nicht an den Aktivitäten der ersten Dschadidengruppe Bucharas beteiligte, erklärt Abdurashidov mit dem damals gegebenen fortschrittsfeindlichen Milieu unter der Herrschaft des Emirs Abd al-Ahad Khan. Interesse an den Ideen des Reformismus generierte Fitrat Abdurashidov zufolge etwa ab 1909 vermutlich unter dem Einfluss der von Mehmet Âkif Ersoy herausgegebenen Zeitschrift \\"Sırat-ı Müstakim\\", die ebenso wie andere Zeitschriften und Zeitungen in jener Zeit in Studentenkreisen zirkulierte, sowie unter Mahmudxoʻja Behbudiy als Mentor. Nach dem Abschluss seiner Ausbildung unterrichtete Fitrat selbst kurz an einer Medrese, doch ist nicht überliefert an welcher., Aufenthalt in Istanbul und dschadidistischer Führer., Um 1909 bildeten dschadidistische Akteure in Buchara sowie in Istanbul (Konstantinopel) eine organisatorische Infrastruktur, die Studenten und Lehrern aus Buchara Studienaufenthalte in der Hauptstadt des Osmanischen Reichs ermöglichen sollte. Fitrat war Berichten zufolge selbst am Aufbau dieser Gesellschaften beteiligt und konnte dank eines Stipendiums der geheimen, von Händlern finanzierten „Gesellschaft für die Bildung der Kinder“ \\"(Tarbiyayi atfol)\\" kurz nach der ersten Gruppe im Frühjahr 1910 selbst nach Istanbul gehen. „Manchmal“, so Sarfraz Khan von der Universität Peschawar, wird Fitrats Abreise in die Türkei als Flucht vor der Verfolgung durch die Behörden nach einem Konflikt zwischen Schiiten und Sunniten in Buchara im Januar 1910 beschrieben; andere Autoren datieren Fitrats Gang nach Istanbul auf das Jahr 1909., Istanbul wurde zu dieser Zeit von den Jungtürken regiert – ein historischer Umstand, der wesentlichen Einfluss auf Fitrat sowie auf die Aktivitäten und das soziale Umfeld der bucharischen Studenten in Istanbul im Allgemeinen haben sollte. Was Fitrat in der Zeit nach seiner Ankunft in Istanbul machte, ist Abdurashidov zufolge nicht im Detail bekannt. Seinen Analysen zufolge war Fitrat in der bucharischen Diaspora-Community vernetzt (oft wird er als einer der Gründer der Unterstützungsgesellschaft \\"Buxoro ta’mimi maorif\\" genannt), arbeitete als Verkäufer am Basar, Straßenfeger und als Küchenhilfe, und bereitete sich auf die Zugangsprüfungen an der Medrese vor. Diese bestand er vermutlich etwa Mitte 1913 und wurde einer der ersten Studenten der im Dezember 1912 gegründeten, nach reformiertem System arbeitenden Vaizin-Medrese, an der er nicht nur in islamischen Wissenschaften, sondern auch in orientalischer Literaturgeschichte unterrichtet wurde., Anderen Autoren zufolge studierte Fitrat zwischen 1909 und 1913 am \\"Darülmuallimin\\", einem Schulungsinstitut für Lehrer, oder an der Universität Istanbul. Fitrat lernte während seines Aufenthaltes weitere nahöstliche Reformideen kennen, kam mit der Panturanismus-Bewegung und Emigranten aus dem russischen Zarenreich in Kontakt und entwickelte sich zum Sprecher der in Istanbul weilenden Vertreter des Dschadidismus. Fitrat verfasste erste Schriften, in denen er –stets in persischer Sprache– Neuerungen im sozialen und kulturellen Leben in Zentralasien und den Willen zum Fortschritt einforderte. Seine ersten Texte erschienen in den islamistischen Zeitschriften \\"Hikmet\\" des Şehbenderzâde Filibeli Ahmed Hilmi und \\"Sırat-ı Müstakim\\", außerdem in Behbudiys \\"Oyina\\" und im turkistischen Blatt \\"Türk Yurdu\\". Fitrat propagierte in diesen Schriften die Einheit aller Muslime und sah Istanbul mit dem osmanischen Sultan an der Spitze als Zentrum der muslimischen Welt., Zwei seiner drei während seines Istanbul-Aufenthalts erschienenen Bücher, ein „Disput zwischen einem Europäer und einem Hochschullehrer aus Buchara in Indien über verschiedene Fragen, darunter auch die der neuen Unterrichtsmethoden“ (kurz \\"Munozara\\", 1911) und die „Erzählungen eines indischen Reisenden“ \\"(Bayonoti sayyohi hindi)\\", erlangten in Zentralasien große Popularität: \\"Munozara\\" etwa wurde 1911 von Hodschij Muin aus Samarkand ins turkestanische Türkisch übersetzt und in der zaristischen Zeitung \\"Turkiston viloyatining gazeti\\" und später als Buch veröffentlicht. Im Gegensatz zur persischen Version zirkulierte die um einen Kommentar Behbudiys erweiterte türkische Ausgabe auch in Buchara. \\"Bayonoti sayyohi hindi\\" wurde von Behbudiy ins Russische übersetzt. Auf dessen Betreiben erweiterte Fitrat \\"Munozara\\" um einen Appell, Russisch zu lernen., Durch den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs konnte Fitrat seine Studien in Istanbul nicht abschließen und begab sich wie viele andere bucharische Studenten wieder zurück nach Transoxanien., Letzte Jahre des Emirats., Nach seiner Rückkehr nach Buchara nahm Fitrat eine aktive Rolle in der Reformbewegung ein, insbesondere im Kampf um Schulen nach der „neuen Methode“, und wurde zum Anführer des linken Flügels der lokalen Dschadidenbewegung.

Der Name des Reiches, dessen Eigenbezeichnung \\"Eranschahr\\" lautete, leitet sich von der letzten vorislamischen persischen Dynastie der Sassaniden () ab. Das Reich existierte zwischen dem Ende des Partherreichs und der arabischen Eroberung Persiens, also von 224 bzw. 226 bis zur Schlacht von Nehawend im Jahr 642 beziehungsweise bis zum Tod des letzten Großkönigs Yazdegerd III. im Jahr 651., Im mittelalterlichen Schāhnāme wird die Dynastie nach Papak bzw. Bābak, dem Sohn (in anderen Versionen: dem Vater) des Stammvaters Sasan, bezeichnet. Mit sehr wenigen Ausnahmen (Bahram Tschobin 590 sowie Schahrbaraz 630) gehörten bis zum Schluss sämtliche Großkönige der Familie der Sassaniden an. In der jüngeren Forschung hat sich die etymologisch korrektere Schreibweise Sāsāniden gegenüber der lange Zeit gebräuchlichen Schreibweise \\"Sassaniden\\" weitgehend durchgesetzt., Das Sassanidenreich, das in der Forschung auch als Neupersisches Reich bezeichnet wird (in Abgrenzung zum \\"Altpersischen Reich\\" der Achämeniden und Teispiden), war über Jahrhunderte hinweg eine bedeutende Großmacht und ein Rivale des Römischen beziehungsweise Oströmischen Reiches. Außer kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen (siehe \\"Römisch-Persische Kriege\\") gab es aber auch zahlreiche friedliche Kontakte zwischen Römern und Sassaniden, die sich in vielerlei Hinsicht gegenseitig beeinflussten. Sassanidische Traditionen hatten zudem großen Einfluss auf die Umayyaden, Samaniden und vor allem die Abbasiden. In der neueren Forschung wird der Geschichte und Kultur des Sassanidenreichs im Rahmen des gewachsenen Interesses an der Spätantike daher verstärkt Beachtung geschenkt und auf die historische Bedeutung dieser zweiten Großmacht neben Rom hingewiesen., In der modernen Geschichtswissenschaft wird der Begriff Sassaniden dabei außer auf das Herrschergeschlecht verallgemeinernd auch auf die Bevölkerung ihres Reiches angewandt. Das Sassanidenreich erstreckte sich ungefähr über die Gebiete der heutigen Staaten Iran, Irak, Aserbaidschan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan und Afghanistan sowie einige Randgebiete. Es lag damit an einem wirtschaftlich und politisch wichtigen Schnittpunkt zwischen Ost und West., Geschichte., Die Gründung des Neupersischen Reichs – Ardaschir I. und Schapur I.., Die Sassaniden führten ihre Herkunft auf einen historisch kaum fassbaren Stammvater zurück, einen gewissen Sasan, der laut den Angaben später Quellen um 200 n.Chr. Oberpriester im Tempel bzw. Feuerheiligtum der Anahita in Istachr gewesen ist. Einige Historiker vermuten, dass es sich ursprünglich um ein parthisches Geschlecht handelte, das vielleicht sogar mit einer Nebenlinie der Arsakiden verwandt war. Gründer des Sassanidenreiches war jedenfalls Ardaschir I. (Regierungszeit 224–240), ein aufständischer Fürst aus dem Süden des Partherreichs, der Persis, wo die Sassaniden als Unterkönige fungierten. Nachdem Ardaschir den letzten Partherkönig, den Arsakiden Artabanos IV., im Jahre 224 getötet hatte, nahm er dessen Platz ein. Er schaltete ebenso Vologaeses VI. aus, den Bruder und alten Rivalen des Artabanos, und eroberte wohl 226 die parthische Hauptstadt Ktesiphon, die in der Folgezeit prächtig ausgebaut und Hauptresidenz der Sassanidenkönige wurde., Die Gründung des Sassanidenreiches erfolgte als militärisch erzwungener Dynastiewechsel. Der Einfluss der mächtigen Adelsfamilien, lokaler Kleinkönige und Dynasten aus arsakidischer Zeit blieb aber offenbar bestehen, auch wenn sie sich formal dem neuen König unterwarfen: Viele parthische Aristokraten arrangierten sich mit der neuen Dynastie und spielten weiterhin eine wichtige Rolle im Reich, dessen Aufbau im Wesentlichen unverändert blieb. Ardaschir behielt die meisten arsakidischen Traditionen und Strukturen bei, führte aber auch Neuerungen ein. Er inszenierte sich geschickt als Schirmherr des Zoroastrismus (auf seinen Münzen ließ er Feueraltäre abbilden) und nannte sich \\"König der Könige von Eran\\", wobei unter \\"Eran\\" nicht der heutige Staat Iran verstanden werden darf, sondern vielmehr die von Iraniern bewohnten beziehungsweise beanspruchten Gebiete. Damit schuf er eine ideologische Klammer, die die Unterschiede zwischen persischen und parthischen Geschlechtern verwischte. Ob sich die frühen Sassaniden bewusst in die Tradition der Achämeniden stellten, wie dies römische Autoren wie Herodian behaupten, ist in der Forschung umstritten, zumal in frühsassanidischer Zeit wohl kaum noch konkrete Kenntnisse über die altpersische Dynastie vorhanden waren., Ardaschir suchte seine Stellung und den Sturz der Vorgängerdynastie offensichtlich durch militärische Erfolge zu legitimieren. Dabei wandte er sich nicht nur gen Osten, wo er gegen die Kuschana kämpfte und bis nach Merw vordrang (ebenso wurden zumindest Teile der arabischen Golfküste besetzt), sondern bald auch nach Westen. Allerdings war das persische Vorgehen im Westen insofern defensiv, als man wohl lediglich die Euphratlinie zurückgewinnen und verhindern wollte, dass Armenien als offene Flanke diente. Ein erster Schlagabtausch mit den Römern unter Kaiser Severus Alexander scheint 231/32 trotz hoher Verluste auf beiden Seiten weitgehend ergebnislos verlaufen zu sein (siehe auch \\"Römisch-Persische Kriege\\"). Nach dem Tod des Kaisers 235 griff Ardaschir 238 erneut an und eroberte mehrere Städte. 240/41 konnte das strategisch wichtige Königreich Hatra nach mehrjähriger Belagerung der Hauptstadt und mit gewaltigem Aufwand erobert werden (wenn die Eroberung vielleicht auch erst unter Ardaschirs Sohn Schapur erfolgte, siehe unten). Hatra hatte sich offenbar mit den Römern verbündet und war zudem ein arsakidischer Widerstandshort gewesen. Somit war die persische Westgrenze vorerst gesichert., Ardaschirs Sohn, Großkönig (genauer wäre DMG \\"šāhān šāh\\", „König der Könige“) Schapur I. (240–270/272), der bereits vor dem Tod Ardaschirs an der Regierung beteiligt war, nannte sich \\"Šāhān šāh Ērān ud Anērān\\" („König der Könige von Iran und Nicht-Iran“). Er gilt als einer der bedeutendsten Sassanidenherrscher und konnte neben seinen militärischen auch innenpolitische Erfolge erzielen. In seinem berühmten Tatenbericht (den sogenannten \\"res gestae divi Saporis\\"), der eine wichtige und weitgehend zuverlässige Quelle darstellt, werden insgesamt drei Feldzüge des Perserkönigs gegen das Römische Reich und zahlreiche eroberte Städte erwähnt., Der erste Feldzug diente der Abwehr der Römer, die 243/44 unter Gordian III. in Persien eingefallen waren. Schapur besiegte nach anfänglichen Rückschlägen den römischen Kaiser, der in der Schlacht von Mesiche (oder kurz darauf) den Tod fand. Schapur schloss kurz darauf mit Gordians Nachfolger Philippus Arabs einen für Rom schmachvollen Frieden. Anschließend stieß er in den 250er Jahren – die damalige Schwäche des Imperiums nutzend (siehe Reichskrise des 3. Jahrhunderts) – mehrmals tief auf römisches Gebiet vor. Dieser zweite Feldzug fand wahrscheinlich im Zeitraum 252/53 bis 256/57 statt, doch ist die genaue Datierung umstritten. In diesem Zusammenhang drang der König nach Syrien vor und eroberte Antiochia (ob die Stadt 253 oder 256 erobert wurde, ist unklar). Im Jahr 256/257 führte ein kleinerer Zug die Perser bis Dura Europos, das nach einer längeren Belagerung erobert wurde., Der dritte und letzte Feldzug fällt in das Jahr 260. Als Kaiser Valerian im Sommer 260 mit einem großen Heer gegen ihn zog, konnte Schapur den Kaiser nach der Schlacht von Edessa gefangen nehmen. Dies war eine bis dahin ungekannte Schmach für die Römer; Valerian kam nie mehr frei. Schapur zog dann mit seinen Truppen über den Euphrat, nahm erneut Antiochia ein und plünderte Kilikien und Kappadokien. Seinen Sieg ließ er durch die Erstellung beeindruckender Felsreliefs, zum Beispiel bei Bischapur, sowie in einer monumentalen Inschrift in persischer, parthischer und griechischer Sprache bei Naqsch-e Rostam in der Nähe des alten Persepolis verewigen, den bereits erwähnten \\"res gestae divi Saporis\\":, Auf dem Rückzug aus Syrien musste Schapur eine empfindliche Niederlage durch den mit Rom verbündeten Fürsten von Palmyra, Septimius Odaenathus, hinnehmen, der 262/63 sogar bis zur Hauptstadt Ktesiphon vordringen konnte. Odaenathus stellte die römischen Grenzen in Mesopotamien wieder her, da Schapur im Osten durch schwere Kämpfe gegen die Kuschana gebunden war. Nach Ansicht einiger Forscher stand das Sassanidenreich in dieser Zeit des Zweifrontenkriegs sogar am Abgrund, doch lassen die Quellen keine abschließende Bewertung der Lage zu. Bei seinem Tod konnte Schapur dennoch auf eine erfolgreiche Regierungszeit zurückblicken. Den zu Schapurs Regierungszeit entstehenden Manichäismus begünstigte der König durch den Schutz des Religionsstifters Manis; zugleich stützte er sich stark auf den Zoroastrismus. Schapur war in Religionsfragen offenbar recht tolerant. Ansonsten sticht innenpolitisch aus Schapurs Regierungszeit vor allem seine recht intensive Urbanisierungspolitik hervor. In den von Schapur gegründeten Städten wurden aus dem Westen Deportierte, darunter etliche Christen, die weiterhin ihren Glauben ausüben konnten, angesiedelt., Das späte 3. Jahrhundert – Unruhen und Abwehr der Römer., Nach Schapurs Tod (270 oder 272) kam es offenbar, wie die spätere Entwicklung zeigt, zu Problemen bei der Nachfolgeregelung. Schapurs jüngster Sohn bestieg als Hormizd I. den Thron, wobei die Anrechte seiner älteren Brüder vorerst unberücksichtigt blieben. Hormizd betrieb eine ähnlich tolerante Religionspolitik wie sein Vater, wobei er aber auch den zoroastrischen Oberpriester Kartir förderte. Ansonsten ist über seine kurze Regierungszeit kaum etwas bekannt., Hormizds Nachfolger wurde anschließend sein Bruder Bahram I. (273–276). In der Regierungszeit Bahrams I. und in der anschließenden Zeit seines Sohns und Nachfolgers Bahram II. (276–293) wurden die Manichäer, die recht starken Zulauf erhielten, dann wiederholt verfolgt. Ihr Religionsstifter Mani wurde schließlich gefangen genommen und 276/77 hingerichtet., Diese zeitweilige Abkehr von der zuvor toleranten Religionspolitik steht im Zusammenhang mit der Anlehnung Bahrams I. und speziell Bahrams II. an den bereits erwähnten Kartir, der vor allem in der Regierungszeit Bahrams II. großen Einfluss entwickelte.

Überliefert ist, dass der General und Politiker Manuel Belgrano zu diesem Symbol inspiriert wurde, als er während der Schlacht von Paraná in den Himmel schaute. In früheren Flaggen Argentiniens und als Landeswappen wurde mit der \\"Sol de Mayo\\" (Maisonne, auch Inkasonne genannt) bereits ein ähnliches Sonnensymbol verwendet. Die Darstellung der Sonne ist identisch mit der Sonne auf den ersten argentinischen Münzen. Die Sonnenscheibe mit einem Gesicht, umgeben von Sonnenstrahlen, symbolisierte in der Inka-Mythologie den Sohn Inti des göttlichen Schöpfers Viracocha., Früher wurde die Flagge ohne Sonne in Friedenszeiten, die Flagge mit Sonne in Kriegszeiten verwendet. Später unterschied man zwischen der in offizieller Funktion verwendeten Flagge (mit Sonne) und Flaggen des privaten Gebrauchs (ohne Sonne). Heute können beide Versionen nach Belieben verwendet werden., Geschichte., Am 25. Mai 1810 beginnt mit den ersten Bestrebungen, durch einen Aufstand in Buenos Aires die Unabhängigkeit von Spanien zu erlangen, die Geschichte der argentinischen Flagge. Zunächst wurden zweifarbige Flaggen verwendet, die die Farben der Stadt Buenos Aires, weiß und rot, zeigten, die seit der britischen Besetzungen 1806/1807 geführt wurden. Rot symbolisierte für die Vertreter der Unabhängigkeitsbemühungen die Freiheit und weiß die Einheit., Im August 1810 bildete José de Moldes, ein Vertreter der Fraktion, die bedingungslos mit Spanien brechen wollte, zwei Militäreinheiten, die er als Erkennungszeichen mit einer hellblau und weißen Kokarde ausstattete. Hellblau stand für die Provinzen des Río de la Plata und weiß für die Tyrannei durch Spanien. Im Dezember des gleichen Jahres beantragte er auch die Schaffung einer nationalen Kokarde in diesen Farben durch die provisorische Regierung., Nach dem Verbot der hellblau-weißen Kokarden durch Cornelio Saavedra, der nicht gänzlich mit Spanien brechen und einen graduellen Übergang zu mehr Selbstständigkeit wollte, wurden diese im April 1811 durch einfarbig rote Kokarden, wie sie die Spanier verwendeten, ausgetauscht und mit weißen Bändern versehen., Am 18. Februar 1812 legte die Junta, die erste provisorische Regierung, deren Mitglieder Feliciano Antonio Chiclana, Manuel de Sarratea Altoguirre und Juan José Paso waren, fest, dass statt der roten Kokarde wieder eine mit den Farben hellblau und weiß verwendet werden sollte:, Manuel Belgrano, der Sprecher der Junta, ließ sich hiervon zu einer Flagge inspirieren. Am 27. Februar 1812 wurde zum ersten Mal eine hellblau-weiße Flagge nahe der Stadt Rosario gehisst, als dort zwei Festungen eingeweiht wurden. Er teilte der Junta mit:, Die Regierung missbilligte diese Tat als politisch unvorsichtig und empfahl Belgrano, die Flagge zu entfernen und die rot-gelbe Flagge der Festung in Buenos Aires zu benutzen, also die Farben Spaniens. Allerdings erreichte Belgrano nie der Befehl vom 3. März, diese Flagge nicht zu verwenden, und so ließ er eine Flagge anfertigen, die am zweiten Jahrestag der Mairevolution (25. Mai 1812) in der Stadt San Salvador de Jujuy gehisst wurde. Die Regierung interpretierte dies als Befehlsverweigerung und forderte ihn am 27. Juni abermals auf, diese Flagge nicht zu verwenden. Am 18. Juli 1812 antwortete Belgrano, dass er bereit sei, die Flagge einzuholen und sie bis zum Tag der letzten Schlacht nicht verwenden werde., Zum zweiten Jahrestag der Mairevolution von Buenos Aires am 25. Mai 1812 ließ Belgrano eine weiße Fahne mit dem Siegel der Souveränen Versammlung anfertigen und am Jahrestag in der Hauptkirche von San Salvador de Jujuy von Domherr Juan Ignacio de Gorriti segnen. Diese \\"Bandera Nacional de Nuestra Libertad Civil\\" genannte Fahne schenkte er dem jujenischen Volk im Jahre 1813 als Dank für die Unterstützung im Unabhängigkeitskampf, besonders in der Schlacht von Salta. Die Fahne wird heute im Flaggensaal des Gouverneurspalasts von Jujuy aufbewahrt und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Jujuy. Das auf der Fahne abgebildete Siegel zeigt in seiner Mitte zwei sich schüttelnde Hände, die die Einigkeit und Brüderlichkeit der argentinischen Provinzen symbolisieren sollen. Die beiden Hände halten gleichzeitig einen Stab, auf dem eine phrygische Mütze liegt. Der Stab soll die Bereitschaft zur Verteidigung der Freiheit darstellen. Die Mütze soll in Anlehnung an die Jakobiner während der Französischen Revolution die republikanische Gesinnung der Argentinier symbolisieren. Die Hände stehen vor einem zweigeteilten Hintergrund, mit den Farben hellblau und weiß, den Farben des Himmels. Am oberen Rand der Ellipse sieht man eine aufgehende Sonne, ein Symbol, welches sich auch auf der Flagge Argentiniens wiederfindet. Die aufgehende Sonne symbolisiert den Aufstieg Argentiniens. Um die Ellipse herum rankt sich Lorbeer, welcher den Sieg im Unabhängigkeitskampf darstellt., Im Januar 1813 ließ Belgrano eine dritte Fahne anfertigen, die er nach Abstimmung mit der Regierung nicht als Staatsflagge, sondern als Fahne seiner Streitkräfte mit sich führte. Das Volk aber sah diese Fahne als die Nationalflagge an, auch wenn sie nur zwei Streifen hatte und nicht, wie in Buenos Aires vereinzelt im Gebrauch, drei Streifen. Belgrano vereidigte am 13. Februar seine Truppen auf diese Fahne und führte sie erstmals am 20. Februar 1813 in die Schlacht. Diese Fahne wurde am 13. November 1813 in der Schlacht von Ayohuma zum letzten Mal verwendet., Ab April 1813 ist die Verwendung der Inkasonne/Maisonne auf Münzen nachgewiesen. Die Sonnenscheibe mit einem Gesicht, umgeben von Sonnenstrahlen, symbolisierte in der Inkamythologie den Sohn Inti des göttlichen Schöpfers Viracocha. Die erste argentinische Münzen dienten später als Vorlage für die Sonne in der Flagge., Am 9. Juli 1816 erklärte der Kongress von Tucumán die Unabhängigkeit der \\"Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata\\" (Name Argentiniens um 1816) von Spanien, welches nach der französischen Fremdherrschaft durch Napoleons Bruder Joseph Bonaparte und dem Spanischen Unabhängigkeitskrieg stark geschwächt war. Der Kongress akzeptierte die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge am 20. Juli 1816 als die Nationalflagge. Der Text des Beschlusses lautet wie folgt:, Die Anden-Armee \\"(Ejército de los Andes)\\" des südamerikanischen Freiheitskämpfers José de San Martín benutzte 1817 und 1818 eine hellblau-weiße Fahne, die aber keinen dritten hellblauen Streifen aufwies, obwohl 1816 die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge vom Kongress verabschiedet worden war. Sie war mit dem Siegel der Regierung versehen und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Mendoza., Am 9. Januar 1818 bat der Oberste Direktor der Regierung Pueyrredón den Kongress zu bestimmen, wie die Flagge zu verwenden sei. Der Kongress antwortete am 25. Februar 1818, dass die Nationalflagge zwei Farben haben solle, weiß und blau, wie bisher, und dass die Kriegsflagge eine Sonne in der Mitte haben solle., Auch wenn hier von blau gesprochen wird, so war weiterhin hellblau gemeint und nicht das dunkelblau, welches in der Zeit von 1830 bis 1878 verwendet wurde., Besonders in der Anfangszeit bis 1830 waren viele offizielle und inoffizielle Varianten der Nationalflagge im Gebrauch. Häufige, aber falsche Varianten waren hierbei, dass die Sonne etwas nach links von der Mitte verschoben war oder, dass die Sonne über den weißen Streifen hinaus in die hellblauen Streifen hineinragte. 1826 tauchte zum ersten Mal der Name \\"República Argentina\\" (Republik Argentinien) auf; vorher wurde ausschließlich von den \\"Provincias Unidas del Rio de la Plata\\" (Vereinigten Provinzen des Río de la Plata) gesprochen., Seit 1828 trat Juan Manuel de Rosas als Befehlshaber der Landbevölkerung und Führer der Föderalisten im Kampf gegen die Fraktion der sogenannten Unitarier auf. Im Dezember 1829 wurde er Gouverneur von Buenos Aires. Im März 1835 wurde er abermals zum Gouverneur und Generalkapitän gewählt. Zeitweilig ließ sich Rosas außerordentliche Gewalt übertragen und erhielt damit faktisch die Gewalt eines Diktators. Rosas hasste die hellblaue Farbe, weil sie von den Unitariern verwendet wurde, und deshalb wurde seit seiner Machtübernahme ein dunklerer Farbton verwendet. 1836 wurde die Flagge durch vier Jakobinermützen auf Stäben in den Ecken ergänzt. Wenig später wurden die Stäbe durch Pfeile ersetzt und rote Sonnenstrahlen der Sonne hinzugefügt. Ab 1840 wurde die Sonne vollständig rot dargestellt. Weil Rosas die Unabhängigkeit Uruguays nicht anerkennen wollte, erklärten Frankreich, Großbritannien, Paraguay, Uruguay und Brasilien den Krieg gegen Rosas’ Argentinien. Nach dem verlorenen Krieg konnte sich Rosas nicht lange an der Macht halten, und so wurde seine Herrschaft durch den Unitarier Justo José de Urquiza 1853 beendet., Die Argentinische Konföderation \\"(Confederación Argentina )\\", die von Buenos Aires abgelehnt wurde, gab sich wieder die traditionelle hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge. Aber auch das eigenständige Buenos Aires nutze diese Flagge. 1862 schloss sich Buenos Aires den anderen Provinzen wieder an. Um 1862 verschwanden dann mit dem Entstehen einer stärkeren Zentralgewalt in Argentinien nach und nach auch die Provinzflaggen., Durch ein Dekret des Präsidenten Julio Argentino Roca wurde ab 1884 die Flagge mit der Sonne auch an öffentlichen Gebäuden verwendet, sie war jetzt keine Kriegsflagge mehr. 1943 wurde dies durch ein Dekret bestätigt. Die Flagge ohne Sonne war jetzt für den Gebrauch durch die Bürger vorgesehen. Staatsflagge war ab jetzt die Flagge mit der Sonne. Seit 1985 dürfen auch die Bürger die Flagge mit der Sonne verwenden:, Beziehung der argentinischen Bevölkerung zu ihrer Flagge., Wie in vielen anderen ehemaligen Kolonien europäischer Staaten hat die argentinische Flagge eine besondere Bedeutung für die Bevölkerung. Die Vorfahren der großen Mehrheit der Argentinier stammen nicht ursprünglich von den Ureinwohnern ab, sondern kamen aus meist europäischen Staaten (nach offiziellen Statistiken etwa 90 % der heutigen Bevölkerung). In Argentinien sind besonders stark die Ursprungsländer Spanien (29 %) und Italien (36 %) vertreten, aber auch Einwanderer aus Frankreich, Großbritannien und Deutschland stellen einen relativ großen Anteil., Dadurch, dass die Einwohner unterschiedliche kulturelle Hintergründe haben, spielen die nationale Symbole eine besonders starke Rolle für die Identifikation mit der Heimat Argentinien. Besonders die Hymne und die Flagge sprechen die nationalen Gefühle der meisten Argentinier an., In der Schule zeigt sich besonders, wie stark die Flagge als einigendes Band für diese noch relativ junge Nation wirkt. So ist die Flagge bei jedem schulischen Akt präsent.

Mit 95 Erdmassen hat er jedoch nur 30 % der Masse Jupiters. Wegen seines auffallenden und schon im kleinen Fernrohr sichtbaren Ringsystems wird er oft auch der Ringplanet genannt, obwohl auch bei den anderen drei Gasplaneten Ringsysteme gefunden wurden., Der Saturn hat eine durchschnittliche Entfernung zur Sonne von gut 1,43Milliarden Kilometern, seine Bahn verläuft zwischen der von Jupiter und der des sonnenferneren Uranus. Er ist der äußerste Planet, der auch mit bloßem Auge gut sichtbar ist, und war daher schon Jahrtausende vor der Erfindung des Fernrohrs bekannt., Als Gasplanet hat Saturn keine feste Oberfläche. Seine oberen Schichten bestehen zu etwa 96 % Stoffanteil aus Wasserstoff. Von allen Planeten des Sonnensystems weist Saturn die geringste mittlere Dichte auf (etwa 0,69g/cm³). Von den anderen Planeten hebt sich der Saturn durch seine ausgeprägten, hellen und schon lange bekannten Ringe ab, die zu großen Teilen aus Wassereis- und Gesteinsbrocken bestehen., Der scheinbare Winkeldurchmesser des Planetenkörpers beträgt je nach Erdentfernung zwischen 15″ und 20″, jener der Ringe zwischen 37″ und 46″. Die sogenannten Äquatorstreifen der Wolkenschichten sind auf Saturn weniger deutlich ausgeprägt als bei Jupiter, was wahrscheinlich mit einer hochlagernden Dunstschicht zusammenhängt., Bis 2023 wurden 145 Monde des Saturns entdeckt. Der mit Abstand größte Saturnmond ist Titan mit 5150 Kilometern Durchmesser., Benannt ist der Planet nach dem römischen Gott des Reichtums und der Ernte, Saturn. Sein astronomisches Symbol♄ stilisiert die Sichel des Gottes., Umlaufbahn und Rotation., Umlaufbahn., Der Saturn läuft auf einer annähernd kreisförmigen Umlaufbahn mit einer Exzentrizität von 0,054 um die Sonne. Sein sonnennächster Punkt, das Perihel, liegt bei 9,04AE und sein sonnenfernster Punkt, das Aphel, bei 10,12AE. Seine Umlaufbahn ist mit 2,48° leicht gegen die Ekliptik geneigt. Weitere Bahndaten sind die Länge des aufsteigenden Knotens mit 113,72°, die Länge des Perihels mit 92,43° und die mittlere Anomalie mit 49,94° zur Epoche J2000.0. Für einen Umlauf um die Sonne benötigt der Saturn ungefähr 29Jahre und 166Tage., Rotation., Die Äquatorebene des Saturn ist 26,73° gegen die Bahnebene geneigt. Er rotiert nicht wie ein starrer Körper, sondern zeigt als Gasplanet eine differentielle Rotation: Die Äquatorregionen rotieren schneller (eine Rotation in 10Stunden, 13Minuten und 59Sekunden) als die Polregionen (10Stunden, 39Minuten und 22Sekunden). Die Äquatorregionen werden als „SystemI“, die Polregionen als „SystemII“ bezeichnet. Aus Messungen des Saturnmagnetfeldes durch Raumsonden wurde für das Saturninnere eine noch etwas langsamere Rotationsperiode von 10Stunden, 47Minuten und 6Sekunden hergeleitet., Durch neuere, kombinierte Auswertung von Messdaten, welche die Raumsonden Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 und 2 sowie Cassini-Huygens von der Schwerkraft, den Windgeschwindigkeiten und mittels Radio-Okkultationen geliefert haben, sind zwei US-amerikanische Wissenschaftler 2007 zu dem Ergebnis gekommen, dass der Saturnkern eine Umdrehung in 10Stunden, 32Minuten und 35Sekunden absolviert und somit um sieben Minuten schneller ist, als bislang gedacht. Demnach müsste der Kern kleiner sein als vermutet. In Hinsicht auf die Entstehung des Gasplaneten könnte das für die Scheiben-Instabilitäts-Hypothese sprechen. Nach dieser Hypothese ist der Saturn aus einer kollabierenden Verdichtung der protoplanetaren Scheibe entstanden. Früher wurde zumeist die Kern-Aggregations-Hypothese als Entstehungsmodell angenommen, nach der Saturn aus einem Kern von über zehn Erdmassen entstanden ist. In letzterem Modell hätte sich der Kern als Erstes aus festen Bestandteilen der Gas- und Staubscheibe gesammelt und erst danach das Gas aus seiner Umgebung ausreichend angezogen., Anfang 2019 wurde eine nochmals verbesserte Messung der Rotationsgeschwindigkeit des Saturn veröffentlicht, die ebenfalls aus Daten der Cassini-Mission abgeleitet werden konnte. Danach rotiert der Planet in zehn Stunden, 33 Minuten und 38 Sekunden einmal um seine eigene Achse., Die Präzessionsperiode der Saturnachse liegt nach einer Modellrechnung und Beobachtungen von Durchquerungen der Ringebene in einer Größenordnung von zwei Millionen Jahren., Physikalische Eigenschaften., Der Saturn gehört zu den sogenannten Gasriesen. Mit einem Durchmesser von gut 120.000km ist er nach Jupiter der zweitgrößte Planet des Sonnensystems. Obwohl sein Volumen 58 % des Volumens des Jupiters entspricht, beträgt seine Masse weniger als ein Drittel der Jupitermasse (etwa 95 Erdmassen). Der Saturn hat daher eine sehr geringe mittlere Dichte von nur 0,687g/cm³. Im Durchschnitt ist sein Material also leichter als Wasser unter Normalbedingungen, was für keinen anderen Planeten des Sonnensystems zutrifft., Die Temperatur beträgt bei 1 bar Atmosphärendruck (dies wird bei Gasplaneten allgemein als „Oberfläche“ definiert) 134 K (−139 °C) und bei 0,1 bar Druck 84 K (−189°C)., Obere Schichten., Seine Atmosphäre enthält wie die des Jupiters überwiegend Wasserstoff und Helium, jedoch in einer anderen Zusammensetzung. Der Wasserstoffanteil ist mit etwa 93 % der Masse deutlich höher, der Heliumanteil mit nur knapp 7 % entsprechend geringer. Des Weiteren kommen Spuren von Methan, Ammoniak und anderen Gasen vor., Während die Atmosphäre des Jupiters die Elemente Wasserstoff und Helium im gleichen Verhältnis wie die Sonne enthält, ist der Heliumanteil beim Saturn wesentlich geringer. Die eher detailarme, gelblich-braune Wolkendecke enthält überwiegend gefrorene Ammoniakkristalle., Innerer Aufbau., Die Atmosphäre, die wie bei Jupiter hauptsächlich aus Wasserstoff besteht, geht mit zunehmender Tiefe aufgrund des hohen Druckes allmählich vom gasförmigen in den flüssigen Zustand über. Es existiert jedoch keine definierte Oberfläche, da der Druck in den Tiefen der Atmosphäre jenseits des kritischen Punkts ansteigt und unter diesen Bedingungen eine Unterscheidung zwischen Gas und Flüssigkeit nicht mehr möglich ist. Weiter in der Tiefe geht der Wasserstoff schließlich in seine metallische Form über. Diese Schichten haben jedoch im Gegensatz zum Jupiter aufgrund der kleineren Masse andere Mächtigkeitsverhältnisse. So beginnt im Saturn die metallische Schicht erst bei 0,47Saturnradien (Jupiter: 0,77Jupiterradien). Unterhalb dieser Schicht liegt ein Gesteinskern (genauer: Eis-Silikat-Kern), für den Modellrechnungen eine Masse von circa 16Erdmassen ergeben. Damit besitzt der Saturnkern einen Masseanteil von 25 %, der des Jupiter lediglich 4 %. Das Innere des Gesteinskerns ist sehr heiß, es herrscht eine Temperatur von 12.000Kelvin. Als Grund dafür wird unter anderem der Kelvin-Helmholtz-Mechanismus angenommen, eine langsame gravitationsbedingte Kompression. Dadurch strahlt der Saturn 2,3-mal so viel Energie ab, wie er von der Sonne empfängt. Ein alternativer oder zusätzlicher Mechanismus kann die Erzeugung von Wärme durch das „Herausregnen“ von Heliumtröpfchen im Inneren des Saturn sein. Wenn die Tröpfchen durch den Wasserstoff mit geringerer Dichte absteigen, setzt der Prozess Wärme durch Reibung frei und hinterlässt Saturns äußere Schichten, die an Helium verarmt sind. Diese absteigenden Tröpfchen könnten sich in einer Heliumhülle angesammelt haben, die den Kern umgibt. Es wird vermutet, dass Niederschläge von Diamanten im Saturn auftreten., Wetter., Die Wolken, die in der Atmosphäre des Saturn zu sehen sind, bestehen vor allem aus auskristallisiertem Ammoniak. Saturn besitzt mindestens zwei Wolkenschichten. Die obere verdeckt die untere, wobei letztere nur im infraroten Bereich sichtbar ist, da Saturn Wärme aus seinem Inneren abstrahlt. Die obere Wolkenschicht des Saturn reflektiert das Licht der Sonne, wodurch sie gut beobachtet werden kann, außerdem weist sie gröbere Strukturen auf als die untere Schicht., Der Nordpol ist der Mittelpunkt eines Polarwirbels und einer stabilen Struktur in der Form eines nahezu regelmäßigen Sechsecks mit einem Durchmesser von fast 25.000 Kilometern. Das anscheinend mehrere 100Kilometer tiefe Hexagon wurde bereits 1980 und 1981 von den Voyager-Sonden aufgenommen; es ist auch auf den von der Saturnsonde Cassini übermittelten Bildern von 2006 wieder zu sehen. Das Hexagon rotiert alle 10Stunden 39Minuten und 24Sekunden einmal um sich selbst. Das ist die gleiche Zeitspanne, die auch die Radioemissionen von Saturn für eine Umdrehung benötigen. Zur Entstehung dieses Effekts existieren mehrere Hypothesen., Am Südpol befindet sich ein ortsfester, hurrikanähnlicher Sturm mit einem Durchmesser von etwa 8000 Kilometern., Auf Saturn wurden weitere Stürme beobachtet, wie zum Beispiel der „Große Weiße Fleck“, ein Effekt, der alle 29Jahre auf der nördlichen Hemisphäre beobachtet werden kann und mit dem „Großen Roten Fleck“ auf dem Jupiter vergleichbar ist., Wissenschaftler entdeckten 2005 durch Beobachtungen mit dem Keck-Teleskop auf Hawaii einen „Hot Spot“ (eine im Vergleich zur Umgebung warme Stelle) am Südpol des Saturn. Damit unterscheidet sich Saturn von allen anderen Planeten, bei denen die kältesten Orte in den Polargebieten liegen. Mithilfe des Orbiters Cassini spürten im Januar 2008 Astronomen am Nordpol gleichfalls einen „Hot Spot“ auf, obwohl es dort schon jahrelang dunkel ist. Diese „Hot Spots“ entstehen durch Atmosphärengas, das sich in Richtung der Pole bewegt. Dabei wird es komprimiert und aufgeheizt; schließlich sinkt es am Pol in Form eines Wirbels in die Tiefen der Saturnatmosphäre ab. Es scheint sich bei beiden Wirbeln um langlebige Strukturen zu handeln, deren Existenz nicht von der Sonneneinstrahlung abhängt., Magnetfeld., Der Saturn besitzt ein eigenes Magnetfeld, dessen Form der einfachen, symmetrischen Form eines magnetischen Dipols entspricht. Die Feldstärke am Äquator beträgt etwa 20µT und ist damit etwa 20-mal schwächer als das äquatoriale Feld Jupiters (420µT) und etwas schwächer als das äquatoriale Erdfeld (30µT). Das magnetische Dipolmoment, das ein Maß für die Stärke des Magnetfeldes bei vorgegebenem Abstand vom Zentrum des Planeten ist, ist mit 4,6·1018u2009T·m3 580-mal stärker als das Magnetfeld der Erde (7,9·1015T·m3). Das Dipolmoment Jupiters ist allerdings mit 1,55·1020T·m3 trotz des ähnlich großen Planetendurchmessers etwa 34-mal so groß., Daher ist die Magnetosphäre des Saturn deutlich kleiner als die des Jupiters und erstreckt sich nur ze: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","output":"Astronomisches Objekt, Ringsystem, Planet, Sonnensystem, Saturn, Äquatordurchmesser, Jupiter, Masse, Ringe, Monde, Umlaufbahn"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: Flagge (Argentinien), Nationalflagge], Die Flagge Argentiniens zeigt drei gleich breite horizontale Streifen: hellblau (, „himmelblau“) oben und unten, weiß dazwischen., Über dem weißen Streifen in der Mitte der Flagge ist eine Sonne mit abwechselnd 16 geraden und 16 geflammten Sonnenstrahlen abgebildet. Überliefert ist, dass der General und Politiker Manuel Belgrano zu diesem Symbol inspiriert wurde, als er während der Schlacht von Paraná in den Himmel schaute. In früheren Flaggen Argentiniens und als Landeswappen wurde mit der \\"Sol de Mayo\\" (Maisonne, auch Inkasonne genannt) bereits ein ähnliches Sonnensymbol verwendet. Die Darstellung der Sonne ist identisch mit der Sonne auf den ersten argentinischen Münzen. Die Sonnenscheibe mit einem Gesicht, umgeben von Sonnenstrahlen, symbolisierte in der Inka-Mythologie den Sohn Inti des göttlichen Schöpfers Viracocha., Früher wurde die Flagge ohne Sonne in Friedenszeiten, die Flagge mit Sonne in Kriegszeiten verwendet. Später unterschied man zwischen der in offizieller Funktion verwendeten Flagge (mit Sonne) und Flaggen des privaten Gebrauchs (ohne Sonne). Heute können beide Versionen nach Belieben verwendet werden., Geschichte., Am 25. Mai 1810 beginnt mit den ersten Bestrebungen, durch einen Aufstand in Buenos Aires die Unabhängigkeit von Spanien zu erlangen, die Geschichte der argentinischen Flagge. Zunächst wurden zweifarbige Flaggen verwendet, die die Farben der Stadt Buenos Aires, weiß und rot, zeigten, die seit der britischen Besetzungen 1806/1807 geführt wurden. Rot symbolisierte für die Vertreter der Unabhängigkeitsbemühungen die Freiheit und weiß die Einheit., Im August 1810 bildete José de Moldes, ein Vertreter der Fraktion, die bedingungslos mit Spanien brechen wollte, zwei Militäreinheiten, die er als Erkennungszeichen mit einer hellblau und weißen Kokarde ausstattete. Hellblau stand für die Provinzen des Río de la Plata und weiß für die Tyrannei durch Spanien. Im Dezember des gleichen Jahres beantragte er auch die Schaffung einer nationalen Kokarde in diesen Farben durch die provisorische Regierung., Nach dem Verbot der hellblau-weißen Kokarden durch Cornelio Saavedra, der nicht gänzlich mit Spanien brechen und einen graduellen Übergang zu mehr Selbstständigkeit wollte, wurden diese im April 1811 durch einfarbig rote Kokarden, wie sie die Spanier verwendeten, ausgetauscht und mit weißen Bändern versehen., Am 18. Februar 1812 legte die Junta, die erste provisorische Regierung, deren Mitglieder Feliciano Antonio Chiclana, Manuel de Sarratea Altoguirre und Juan José Paso waren, fest, dass statt der roten Kokarde wieder eine mit den Farben hellblau und weiß verwendet werden sollte:, Manuel Belgrano, der Sprecher der Junta, ließ sich hiervon zu einer Flagge inspirieren. Am 27. Februar 1812 wurde zum ersten Mal eine hellblau-weiße Flagge nahe der Stadt Rosario gehisst, als dort zwei Festungen eingeweiht wurden. Er teilte der Junta mit:, Die Regierung missbilligte diese Tat als politisch unvorsichtig und empfahl Belgrano, die Flagge zu entfernen und die rot-gelbe Flagge der Festung in Buenos Aires zu benutzen, also die Farben Spaniens. Allerdings erreichte Belgrano nie der Befehl vom 3. März, diese Flagge nicht zu verwenden, und so ließ er eine Flagge anfertigen, die am zweiten Jahrestag der Mairevolution (25. Mai 1812) in der Stadt San Salvador de Jujuy gehisst wurde. Die Regierung interpretierte dies als Befehlsverweigerung und forderte ihn am 27. Juni abermals auf, diese Flagge nicht zu verwenden. Am 18. Juli 1812 antwortete Belgrano, dass er bereit sei, die Flagge einzuholen und sie bis zum Tag der letzten Schlacht nicht verwenden werde., Zum zweiten Jahrestag der Mairevolution von Buenos Aires am 25. Mai 1812 ließ Belgrano eine weiße Fahne mit dem Siegel der Souveränen Versammlung anfertigen und am Jahrestag in der Hauptkirche von San Salvador de Jujuy von Domherr Juan Ignacio de Gorriti segnen. Diese \\"Bandera Nacional de Nuestra Libertad Civil\\" genannte Fahne schenkte er dem jujenischen Volk im Jahre 1813 als Dank für die Unterstützung im Unabhängigkeitskampf, besonders in der Schlacht von Salta. Die Fahne wird heute im Flaggensaal des Gouverneurspalasts von Jujuy aufbewahrt und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Jujuy. Das auf der Fahne abgebildete Siegel zeigt in seiner Mitte zwei sich schüttelnde Hände, die die Einigkeit und Brüderlichkeit der argentinischen Provinzen symbolisieren sollen. Die beiden Hände halten gleichzeitig einen Stab, auf dem eine phrygische Mütze liegt. Der Stab soll die Bereitschaft zur Verteidigung der Freiheit darstellen. Die Mütze soll in Anlehnung an die Jakobiner während der Französischen Revolution die republikanische Gesinnung der Argentinier symbolisieren. Die Hände stehen vor einem zweigeteilten Hintergrund, mit den Farben hellblau und weiß, den Farben des Himmels. Am oberen Rand der Ellipse sieht man eine aufgehende Sonne, ein Symbol, welches sich auch auf der Flagge Argentiniens wiederfindet. Die aufgehende Sonne symbolisiert den Aufstieg Argentiniens. Um die Ellipse herum rankt sich Lorbeer, welcher den Sieg im Unabhängigkeitskampf darstellt., Im Januar 1813 ließ Belgrano eine dritte Fahne anfertigen, die er nach Abstimmung mit der Regierung nicht als Staatsflagge, sondern als Fahne seiner Streitkräfte mit sich führte. Das Volk aber sah diese Fahne als die Nationalflagge an, auch wenn sie nur zwei Streifen hatte und nicht, wie in Buenos Aires vereinzelt im Gebrauch, drei Streifen. Belgrano vereidigte am 13. Februar seine Truppen auf diese Fahne und führte sie erstmals am 20. Februar 1813 in die Schlacht. Diese Fahne wurde am 13. November 1813 in der Schlacht von Ayohuma zum letzten Mal verwendet., Ab April 1813 ist die Verwendung der Inkasonne/Maisonne auf Münzen nachgewiesen. Die Sonnenscheibe mit einem Gesicht, umgeben von Sonnenstrahlen, symbolisierte in der Inkamythologie den Sohn Inti des göttlichen Schöpfers Viracocha. Die erste argentinische Münzen dienten später als Vorlage für die Sonne in der Flagge., Am 9. Juli 1816 erklärte der Kongress von Tucumán die Unabhängigkeit der \\"Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata\\" (Name Argentiniens um 1816) von Spanien, welches nach der französischen Fremdherrschaft durch Napoleons Bruder Joseph Bonaparte und dem Spanischen Unabhängigkeitskrieg stark geschwächt war. Der Kongress akzeptierte die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge am 20. Juli 1816 als die Nationalflagge. Der Text des Beschlusses lautet wie folgt:, Die Anden-Armee \\"(Ejército de los Andes)\\" des südamerikanischen Freiheitskämpfers José de San Martín benutzte 1817 und 1818 eine hellblau-weiße Fahne, die aber keinen dritten hellblauen Streifen aufwies, obwohl 1816 die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge vom Kongress verabschiedet worden war. Sie war mit dem Siegel der Regierung versehen und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Mendoza., Am 9. Januar 1818 bat der Oberste Direktor der Regierung Pueyrredón den Kongress zu bestimmen, wie die Flagge zu verwenden sei. Der Kongress antwortete am 25. Februar 1818, dass die Nationalflagge zwei Farben haben solle, weiß und blau, wie bisher, und dass die Kriegsflagge eine Sonne in der Mitte haben solle., Auch wenn hier von blau gesprochen wird, so war weiterhin hellblau gemeint und nicht das dunkelblau, welches in der Zeit von 1830 bis 1878 verwendet wurde., Besonders in der Anfangszeit bis 1830 waren viele offizielle und inoffizielle Varianten der Nationalflagge im Gebrauch. Häufige, aber falsche Varianten waren hierbei, dass die Sonne etwas nach links von der Mitte verschoben war oder, dass die Sonne über den weißen Streifen hinaus in die hellblauen Streifen hineinragte. 1826 tauchte zum ersten Mal der Name \\"República Argentina\\" (Republik Argentinien) auf; vorher wurde ausschließlich von den \\"Provincias Unidas del Rio de la Plata\\" (Vereinigten Provinzen des Río de la Plata) gesprochen., Seit 1828 trat Juan Manuel de Rosas als Befehlshaber der Landbevölkerung und Führer der Föderalisten im Kampf gegen die Fraktion der sogenannten Unitarier auf. Im Dezember 1829 wurde er Gouverneur von Buenos Aires. Im März 1835 wurde er abermals zum Gouverneur und Generalkapitän gewählt. Zeitweilig ließ sich Rosas außerordentliche Gewalt übertragen und erhielt damit faktisch die Gewalt eines Diktators. Rosas hasste die hellblaue Farbe, weil sie von den Unitariern verwendet wurde, und deshalb wurde seit seiner Machtübernahme ein dunklerer Farbton verwendet. 1836 wurde die Flagge durch vier Jakobinermützen auf Stäben in den Ecken ergänzt. Wenig später wurden die Stäbe durch Pfeile ersetzt und rote Sonnenstrahlen der Sonne hinzugefügt. Ab 1840 wurde die Sonne vollständig rot dargestellt. Weil Rosas die Unabhängigkeit Uruguays nicht anerkennen wollte, erklärten Frankreich, Großbritannien, Paraguay, Uruguay und Brasilien den Krieg gegen Rosas’ Argentinien. Nach dem verlorenen Krieg konnte sich Rosas nicht lange an der Macht halten, und so wurde seine Herrschaft durch den Unitarier Justo José de Urquiza 1853 beendet., Die Argentinische Konföderation \\"(Confederación Argentina )\\", die von Buenos Aires abgelehnt wurde, gab sich wieder die traditionelle hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge. Aber auch das eigenständige Buenos Aires nutze diese Flagge. 1862 schloss sich Buenos Aires den anderen Provinzen wieder an. Um 1862 verschwanden dann mit dem Entstehen einer stärkeren Zentralgewalt in Argentinien nach und nach auch die Provinzflaggen., Durch ein Dekret des Präsidenten Julio Argentino Roca wurde ab 1884 die Flagge mit der Sonne auch an öffentlichen Gebäuden verwendet, sie war jetzt keine Kriegsflagge mehr. 1943 wurde dies durch ein Dekret bestätigt. Die Flagge ohne Sonne war jetzt für den Gebrauch durch die Bürger vorgesehen. Staatsflagge war ab jetzt die Flagge mit der Sonne. Seit 1985 dürfen auch die Bürger die Flagge mit der Sonne verwenden:, Beziehung der argentinischen Bevölkerung zu ihrer Flagge., Wie in vielen anderen ehemaligen Kolonien europäischer Staaten hat die argentinische Flagge eine besondere Bedeutung für die Bevölkerung. Die Vorfahren der großen Mehrheit der Argentinier stammen nicht ursprünglich von den Ureinwohnern ab, sondern kamen aus meist europäischen Staaten (nach offiziellen Statistiken etwa 90 % der heutigen Bevölkerung). In Argentinien sind besonders stark die Ursprungsländer Spanien (29 %) und Italien (36 %) vertreten, aber auch Einwanderer aus Frankreich, Großbritannien und Deutschland stellen einen relativ großen Anteil., Dadurch, dass die Einwohner unterschiedliche kulturelle Hintergründe haben, spielen die nationale Symbole eine besonders starke Rolle für die Identifikation mit der Heimat Argentinien. Besonders die Hymne und die Flagge sprechen die nationalen Gefühle der meisten Argentinier an., In der Schule zeigt sich besonders, wie stark die Flagge als einigendes Band für diese noch relativ junge Nation wirkt. So ist die Flagge bei jedem schulischen Akt präsent.

Benannt ist er nach Euklid von Alexandria, der ihn als Erster im dritten Jahrhundert v.Chr. in seinen Elementen bewies. Jedoch kannten die Mathematiker der Antike das Konzept der Unendlichkeit noch nicht. Euklid selbst formulierte den Satz daher wie folgt: „Es gibt mehr Primzahlen als jede vorgelegte Anzahl von Primzahlen.“, Eine Primzahl ist eine ganze Zahl \\"größer als\\" 1, die nur durch 1 und sich selbst ohne Rest teilbar ist. Die ersten Primzahlen sind 2, 3, 5 und 7. Der Satz des Euklid besagt, dass die Liste 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17… aller Primzahlen nicht endet, genauso wie die Liste 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6… aller natürlichen Zahlen nicht endet., Der ursprüngliche von Euklid geführte Beweis ist direkt und konstruktiv. Zu einer gegebenen \\"endlichen\\" Liste von Primzahlen wird stets eine weitere noch nicht vorhandene Primzahl erzeugt, ohne diese jedoch explizit anzugeben. Vielmehr wird argumentiert, dass jede endliche Liste von Primzahlen unvollständig ist. Daraus wird gefolgert, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt. In der späteren Literatur wird oft fälschlicherweise behauptet, dass Euklids Argument anhand eines Widerspruchsbeweises aufgeführt sei. Jedoch lässt sich der Beweis leicht zu einem Widerspruchsbeweis umformulieren., Nach dem Fundamentalsatz der Arithmetik können alle natürlichen Zahlen größer als 1 eindeutig in Primfaktoren zerlegt werden. Der Satz des Euklid ist daher eines der grundlegendsten Resultate der Zahlentheorie, da er zeigt, dass es unendlich viele unzerlegbare Grundbausteine der Zahlen gibt. Im Laufe der Zeit wurden neben Euklids Originalbeweis zahlreiche andere Beweise gefunden, die teilweise mathematische Techniken aus der Analysis, Kombinatorik oder auch der Topologie nutzen. Ab dem 19.Jahrhundert konnten zudem mit den Beweisen des Dirichletschen Primzahlsatzes und des Primzahlsatzes weitreichende Verallgemeinerungen erzielt werden. Während der Satz des Euklid lediglich aussagt, dass die Anzahl der Primzahlen unendlich groß ist, formulieren die modernen Primzahlsätze Regeln, wie häufig Primzahlen in gewissen Bereichen ungefähr anzutreffen sind., Analoge Fragestellungen hinsichtlich der Häufigkeit von Primzahlzwillingen, Mersenne-Primzahlen oder Fermat-Primzahlen verbleiben bis heute unbeantwortet., Beweis von Euklid., Der Satz wurde erstmals in Euklids Elementen im neunten Buch, Proposition 20, niedergeschrieben., Originalformulierung., Euklids Ausführung kann wie folgt ins Deutsche übersetzt werden:, Erläuterungen: Zu jeder endlichen Menge von Primzahlen (gegebenes Objekt) gibt es danach eine Primzahl (gesuchtes Objekt), die dieser Menge nicht angehört. Euklid beweist dies konstruktiv, indem er ein Verfahren beschreibt, aus gegebenen endlich vielen Primzahlen formula_1 (Euklid behandelt hier den Fall formula_2) eine neue Primzahl zu gewinnen, indem man die Zahl formula_3 bildet und einen ihrer Primfaktoren bestimmt. Im Beweis wird geometrisch-anschaulich argumentiert, indem gesagt wird, dass eine Strecke (Zahl) eine andere „misst“, wenn letztere durch erstere teilbar ist. In Euklids Ausführungen geht ferner sein bereits in \\"Buch VII, Proposition 31\\" (die lautet: \\"Jede zusammengesetzte Zahl wird von irgendeiner Primzahl gemessen\\") beschriebenes Verfahren zur effektiven Gewinnung eines Primfaktors einer vorgegebenen Zahl als „Unterprogramm“ ein. Da Euklid im Originalwerk keine Möglichkeit hatte, eine willkürliche Liste von Primzahlen zu schreiben, verwendete er eine Methode, die er häufig anwandte, nämlich die Methode des verallgemeinerbaren Beispiels. Dabei wählt er nur drei Primzahlen aus und beweist mit der oben skizzierten allgemeinen Methode, dass er immer eine zusätzliche Primzahl finden kann. Euklid ging vermutlich davon aus, dass seine Leser davon überzeugt wären, dass ein ähnlicher Beweis funktionieren wird, egal wie viele Primzahlen ursprünglich ausgewählt werden., Veranschaulichung des Beweises an einem Beispiel., Die Beweisidee von Euklid lässt sich über folgendes Beispiel veranschaulichen. Dieses verwendet die ersten drei Primzahlen 2, 3 und 5. Aus diesen kann mit Euklids Methode eine neue Primzahl konstruiert werden, die in der Liste noch nicht vorkommt. Dafür wird die Zahl, betrachtet, die aus dem Produkt der Listenzahlen mit anschließender Addition von 1 gebildet wird. Diese Zahl 31 ist nun weder durch 2 noch durch 3 noch durch 5 teilbar. Das folgt daraus, dass die Differenz zweier Zahlen mit gemeinsamem Teiler wieder diesen Teiler hat: Es ist formula_5 nach Konstruktion durch 2, 3 und 5 teilbar– hätte auch ihr Nachfolger 31 diese Eigenschaft, so auch formula_6 Doch die 1 wird nur von 1 selbst geteilt. In der Tat ist 31 zum Beispiel wieder eine (neue) Primzahl und ungleich 2, 3 und 5., In heutiger Fachsprache., Trotz Euklids direkter Argumentation wird der Satz des Euklid von vielen Autoren in Standardwerken der Zahlentheorie als ein Widerspruchsbeweis wiedergegeben, zum Beispiel bei Jörg Brüdern oder Tom M.Apostol., In der Sprechweise der heutigen Mengenlehre stellt Euklid die folgende Behauptung auf:, Dazu bildet Euklid das kleinste Vielfache formula_11 aller Primzahlen aus formula_12 Dabei ist wichtig, dass \\"alle\\" bisherigen Primzahlen Teiler von formula_13 sind., Dann bildet er formula_14 und unterscheidet zwei Fälle:, Der Beweis kommt auch ohne die Fallunterscheidung aus:, Beurteilung des Beweises., Von Euklid wird oft fälschlicherweise berichtet, er habe sein Ergebnis durch Widerspruch bewiesen, beginnend mit der Annahme, dass die ursprünglich betrachtete endliche Menge \\"alle\\" Primzahlen enthält, obwohl es sich eigentlich um einen Beweis durch Fallunterscheidung, also eine direkte Beweismethode handelt. Der Philosoph Torkel Franzén stellte fest: „Euklids Beweis, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt, ist kein indirekter Beweis […]. Das Argument wird manchmal als indirekter Beweis formuliert, indem man es durch die Annahme ersetzt: ‚Angenommen formula_29 sind alle Primzahlen.‘ Da diese Annahme jedoch nicht einmal im Beweis verwendet wird, ist die Neuformulierung sinnlos.“, Benno Artmann sieht im Beweis von Euklid ein Beispiel der Verwendung „endlicher Mittel zur Beherrschung des Unendlichen“. In dieser Hinsicht habe Euklid „Bahnbrechendes“ geleistet. Jedoch bildeten die Primzahlen nur ein Beispiel dieses Prinzips in Euklids Schaffen. Im selben Kontext wird seine Theorie der Parallelen und Kreistangenten sowie „Unvereinbarkeit“ (im Sinne des Euklidischen Algorithmus) von Artmann genannt., Die Zahlentheoretiker Gérald Tenenbaum und Michel Mendès France nennen Euklids Argument „wundervoll in seiner Schönheit und Einfachheit“ und weisen darauf hin, dass es sich in moderner Fachsprache auf die vier Symbole, reduzieren lässt. Dabei ist formula_31 die Fakultät von formula_32 und die erzeugte Zahl ist durch \\"keine\\" Zahl zwischen formula_33 teilbar, weshalb es Primzahlen geben muss, die größer als formula_32 sind., Der Beweis von Euklid wird, hinsichtlich der fundamentalen Bedeutung des Resultats für die Zahlentheorie, wegen seiner Einfachheit bis heute als elegant erachtet. Dennoch liefert er keine starke Methode, zu schätzen, wie viele Primzahlen es unter einer Schranke formula_35 mindestens gibt. Zwar kann die Schranke formula_36, mit der Primzahlen abzählenden Funktion formula_37, induktiv aus Euklids Methode abgeleitet werden, doch dieses Resultat wird für die analytische Zahlentheorie als unbrauchbar angesehen. Dabei ist formula_38 der natürliche Logarithmus von formula_35. Bereits mit nicht wesentlich schwierigeren Argumenten, zum Beispiel durch Ideen von Leonhard Euler und Pafnuti Lwowitsch Tschebyschow, können wesentlich stärkere Schranken für die Primzahlverteilung hergeleitet werden. Dazu zählt die Schranke, für existierende Konstanten formula_41 für alle formula_42., Bedeutung., Erzeugung neuer Primzahlen., Der Beweis des Satzes des Euklid zeigt eine Möglichkeit auf, wie aus einer oder mehreren vorgegebenen Primzahlen formula_43 mindestens eine weitere Primzahl berechnet werden kann. Dazu bildet man das Produkt dieser Zahlen und addiert 1 zu dem Produkt, also, Das Symbol formula_45 ist das Produktzeichen. Wegen formula_46 gibt es einen kleinsten Teiler formula_47 von formula_32. Dieser ist notwendigerweise eine Primzahl und teilerfremd zu formula_49. Daher ist mit formula_50 eine \\"neue\\" Primzahl gefunden., Zieht man nur die Mengen der ersten aufeinanderfolgenden Primzahlen in Betracht, also formula_51, und bildet daraus die Zahlen, dann stellen sich die ersten fünf dieser Zahlen als prim heraus, die nächsten fünf als zusammengesetzt. Beispielsweise ist, Ist das Ergebnis von formula_54 wobei das Symbol formula_55 für das Primorial von formula_56 steht, wieder eine Primzahl, so nennt man diese auch Euklidische Primzahl. Ein etwas verallgemeinerter Begriff ist die Primorial-Primzahl, die durch formula_57 erzeugt wird. Es ist eine offene Frage, ob es unendlich viele Primorial-Primzahlen gibt. Die bis heute größte gefundene Primorial-Primzahl ist die formula_58-stellige Zahl formula_59. Zum Überprüfen, ob eine Zahl prim ist, gibt es Primzahltests, wie den von Miller-Rabin. Die bis heute größte gefundene Primzahl ist jedoch die formula_60-stellige Mersenne-Primzahl formula_61., Zahlentheoretische Forschung., Die Aussage, dass es unendlich viele Primzahlen gibt, führte zu der Frage, wie dicht sie in den natürlichen Zahlen liegen. Damit ist das langfristige Verhalten der Abstände zwischen verschiedenen Primzahlen gemeint. Zum Beispiel finden sich bis zur Zahl 10000 nur einhundert Quadratzahlen, also viel weniger als natürliche Zahlen. Analog dazu kann gefragt werden, wie häufig Primzahlen bis zu einer Schranke (wie zum Beispiel 10000) auftauchen und wie sich diese Häufigkeit verhält, wenn die Schranke immer größer gewählt wird., Eine Folgerung des Beweises von Euklid für die Folge der Primzahlen ist die Ungleichung, Diese konnte von Bonse weiter verbessert werden zu, für alle formula_64 was auch Bonsesche Ungleichung genannt wird.

Die Fahne wird heute im Flaggensaal des Gouverneurspalasts von Jujuy aufbewahrt und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Jujuy. Das auf der Fahne abgebildete Siegel zeigt in seiner Mitte zwei sich schüttelnde Hände, die die Einigkeit und Brüderlichkeit der argentinischen Provinzen symbolisieren sollen. Die beiden Hände halten gleichzeitig einen Stab, auf dem eine phrygische Mütze liegt. Der Stab soll die Bereitschaft zur Verteidigung der Freiheit darstellen. Die Mütze soll in Anlehnung an die Jakobiner während der Französischen Revolution die republikanische Gesinnung der Argentinier symbolisieren. Die Hände stehen vor einem zweigeteilten Hintergrund, mit den Farben hellblau und weiß, den Farben des Himmels. Am oberen Rand der Ellipse sieht man eine aufgehende Sonne, ein Symbol, welches sich auch auf der Flagge Argentiniens wiederfindet. Die aufgehende Sonne symbolisiert den Aufstieg Argentiniens. Um die Ellipse herum rankt sich Lorbeer, welcher den Sieg im Unabhängigkeitskampf darstellt., Im Januar 1813 ließ Belgrano eine dritte Fahne anfertigen, die er nach Abstimmung mit der Regierung nicht als Staatsflagge, sondern als Fahne seiner Streitkräfte mit sich führte. Das Volk aber sah diese Fahne als die Nationalflagge an, auch wenn sie nur zwei Streifen hatte und nicht, wie in Buenos Aires vereinzelt im Gebrauch, drei Streifen. Belgrano vereidigte am 13. Februar seine Truppen auf diese Fahne und führte sie erstmals am 20. Februar 1813 in die Schlacht. Diese Fahne wurde am 13. November 1813 in der Schlacht von Ayohuma zum letzten Mal verwendet., Ab April 1813 ist die Verwendung der Inkasonne/Maisonne auf Münzen nachgewiesen. Die Sonnenscheibe mit einem Gesicht, umgeben von Sonnenstrahlen, symbolisierte in der Inkamythologie den Sohn Inti des göttlichen Schöpfers Viracocha. Die erste argentinische Münzen dienten später als Vorlage für die Sonne in der Flagge., Am 9. Juli 1816 erklärte der Kongress von Tucumán die Unabhängigkeit der \\"Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata\\" (Name Argentiniens um 1816) von Spanien, welches nach der französischen Fremdherrschaft durch Napoleons Bruder Joseph Bonaparte und dem Spanischen Unabhängigkeitskrieg stark geschwächt war. Der Kongress akzeptierte die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge am 20. Juli 1816 als die Nationalflagge. Der Text des Beschlusses lautet wie folgt:, Die Anden-Armee \\"(Ejército de los Andes)\\" des südamerikanischen Freiheitskämpfers José de San Martín benutzte 1817 und 1818 eine hellblau-weiße Fahne, die aber keinen dritten hellblauen Streifen aufwies, obwohl 1816 die hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge vom Kongress verabschiedet worden war. Sie war mit dem Siegel der Regierung versehen und ist heute die Flagge der Provinz Mendoza., Am 9. Januar 1818 bat der Oberste Direktor der Regierung Pueyrredón den Kongress zu bestimmen, wie die Flagge zu verwenden sei. Der Kongress antwortete am 25. Februar 1818, dass die Nationalflagge zwei Farben haben solle, weiß und blau, wie bisher, und dass die Kriegsflagge eine Sonne in der Mitte haben solle., Auch wenn hier von blau gesprochen wird, so war weiterhin hellblau gemeint und nicht das dunkelblau, welches in der Zeit von 1830 bis 1878 verwendet wurde., Besonders in der Anfangszeit bis 1830 waren viele offizielle und inoffizielle Varianten der Nationalflagge im Gebrauch. Häufige, aber falsche Varianten waren hierbei, dass die Sonne etwas nach links von der Mitte verschoben war oder, dass die Sonne über den weißen Streifen hinaus in die hellblauen Streifen hineinragte. 1826 tauchte zum ersten Mal der Name \\"República Argentina\\" (Republik Argentinien) auf; vorher wurde ausschließlich von den \\"Provincias Unidas del Rio de la Plata\\" (Vereinigten Provinzen des Río de la Plata) gesprochen., Seit 1828 trat Juan Manuel de Rosas als Befehlshaber der Landbevölkerung und Führer der Föderalisten im Kampf gegen die Fraktion der sogenannten Unitarier auf. Im Dezember 1829 wurde er Gouverneur von Buenos Aires. Im März 1835 wurde er abermals zum Gouverneur und Generalkapitän gewählt. Zeitweilig ließ sich Rosas außerordentliche Gewalt übertragen und erhielt damit faktisch die Gewalt eines Diktators. Rosas hasste die hellblaue Farbe, weil sie von den Unitariern verwendet wurde, und deshalb wurde seit seiner Machtübernahme ein dunklerer Farbton verwendet. 1836 wurde die Flagge durch vier Jakobinermützen auf Stäben in den Ecken ergänzt. Wenig später wurden die Stäbe durch Pfeile ersetzt und rote Sonnenstrahlen der Sonne hinzugefügt. Ab 1840 wurde die Sonne vollständig rot dargestellt. Weil Rosas die Unabhängigkeit Uruguays nicht anerkennen wollte, erklärten Frankreich, Großbritannien, Paraguay, Uruguay und Brasilien den Krieg gegen Rosas’ Argentinien. Nach dem verlorenen Krieg konnte sich Rosas nicht lange an der Macht halten, und so wurde seine Herrschaft durch den Unitarier Justo José de Urquiza 1853 beendet., Die Argentinische Konföderation \\"(Confederación Argentina )\\", die von Buenos Aires abgelehnt wurde, gab sich wieder die traditionelle hellblau-weiß-hellblaue Flagge. Aber auch das eigenständige Buenos Aires nutze diese Flagge. 1862 schloss sich Buenos Aires den anderen Provinzen wieder an. Um 1862 verschwanden dann mit dem Entstehen einer stärkeren Zentralgewalt in Argentinien nach und nach auch die Provinzflaggen., Durch ein Dekret des Präsidenten Julio Argentino Roca wurde ab 1884 die Flagge mit der Sonne auch an öffentlichen Gebäuden verwendet, sie war jetzt keine Kriegsflagge mehr. 1943 wurde dies durch ein Dekret bestätigt. Die Flagge ohne Sonne war jetzt für den Gebrauch durch die Bürger vorgesehen. Staatsflagge war ab jetzt die Flagge mit der Sonne. Seit 1985 dürfen auch die Bürger die Flagge mit der Sonne verwenden:, Beziehung der argentinischen Bevölkerung zu ihrer Flagge., Wie in vielen anderen ehemaligen Kolonien europäischer Staaten hat die argentinische Flagge eine besondere Bedeutung für die Bevölkerung. Die Vorfahren der großen Mehrheit der Argentinier stammen nicht ursprünglich von den Ureinwohnern ab, sondern kamen aus meist europäischen Staaten (nach offiziellen Statistiken etwa 90 % der heutigen Bevölkerung). In Argentinien sind besonders stark die Ursprungsländer Spanien (29 %) und Italien (36 %) vertreten, aber auch Einwanderer aus Frankreich, Großbritannien und Deutschland stellen einen relativ großen Anteil., Dadurch, dass die Einwohner unterschiedliche kulturelle Hintergründe haben, spielen die nationale Symbole eine besonders starke Rolle für die Identifikation mit der Heimat Argentinien. Besonders die Hymne und die Flagge sprechen die nationalen Gefühle der meisten Argentinier an., In der Schule zeigt sich besonders, wie stark die Flagge als einigendes Band für diese noch relativ junge Nation wirkt. So ist die Flagge bei jedem schulischen Akt präsent.
