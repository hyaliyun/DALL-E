Komissio aikoo erityisesti tarkastella mahdollisia tilanteita, joissa sijoittajat saattavat kohdata haitallisia verovaikutuksia. Tämän tarkastelun tavoitteena on tunnistaa ja analysoida erilaisia tilanteita, joissa verolainsäädännön tai -käytäntöjen soveltaminen saattaa johtaa epäedullisiin seurauksiin sijoittajille. Näitä tilanteita voidaan tunnistaa esimerkiksi kansainvälisten sijoitussopimusten puitteissa tai verotusta koskevien kansallisten lainsäädäntöjen erilaisten yhteensovittamisessa eri valtioiden välillä. Analysoimalla näitä tapauksia komissio voi pyrkiä tunnistamaan mahdollisia keinoja ratkaista tai vähentää niiden kielteisiä vaikutuksia. Komission tarkastelu voi keskittyä esimerkiksi seuraaviin aihealueisiin: 1. Kahdenväliset sijoitussopimukset ja verotus: Komissio voi tutkia, missä määrin kahdenväliset sijoitussopimukset sisältävät määräyksiä verolainsäädännön soveltamisesta ja mahdollisesti tarjoavat suojamekanismeja sijoittajille. 2. Sijoittajien kotipaikan ja sijoituskohteen valtion väliset verosopimukset: Komissio voi tarkastella, kuinka nämä sopimukset voivat vaikuttaa sijoittajien verorasitukseen, etenkin kun kyseessä ovat eri valtioiden väliset verotuksen oikeuden alueella toimivat yhtiöt. 3. Verotuksen ja valtiontukien yhteys: Komissio voi tarkastella, miten verotukseen liittyvät valtiontuet voivat vaikuttaa sijoituspäätöksiin ja sijoittajien toimintaan, sekä keinoja ehkäistä haitalliset kilpailun vääristymät, joita tämäntyyppiset valtiontuet voivat aiheuttaa. 4. Verokannustimien ja muiden verohelpotusten käyttö: Komissio voi tutkia, kuinka erilaisten verokannustinjärjestelmien ja verohelpotusten käyttö vaikuttaa sijoittajien toimintaan ja verorasitukseen, sekä näiden järjestelmien vaikutuksia tasapuolisen ja läpinäkyvän kilpailuympäristön luomiseen. 5.

Choose patterns or motifs that will add continuity. Go with colors that are easily duplicated for consistency. Work with a tattoo artist to design your sleeve.\\"","output":"Title: Designing Your Perfect Tattoo Sleeve: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: A tattoo sleeve – a large, intricate collection of tattoos that covers one's arm from shoulder to wrist – is more than just a bold fashion statement; it's a personal journey that often tells a story of art, culture, and identity. Despite its significance, designing a tattoo sleeve can seem daunting, particularly when you're unsure about where to start or what to incorporate. In this article, we'll delve into creating your dream tattoo sleeve, covering aspects such as choosing the right imagery and symbols, getting it done in sessions, selecting patterns and motifs, opting for consistent colors, and working with a tattoo artist to bring your vision to life. 1. Choosing the Right Imagery and Symbols: Your tattoo sleeve is an opportunity to express your individuality and share what matters most to you. Begin by listing down the images and symbols that have a strong connection to your personal journey or represent your passions and interests. Some popular themes include nature, spiritual elements, culture, and portraits of loved ones. You might also consider incorporating meaningful quotes or song lyrics. Ultimately, the aim is to curate elements that will resonate with you for a lifetime. 2. Getting Your Sleeve Done in Sessions: Tattoo sleeves require a significant investment of time, money, and patience – both on your part and on the part of the tattoo artist. To make this process more manageable, consider getting your sleeve done in multiple sessions. This will allow you to address any concerns or hesitations about specific designs or placements before committing to the entire piece. Besides providing you with the assurance that you're moving in the right direction, this approach also allows your skin to heal between sessions and minimizes the chances of complications. 3. Choosing Patterns or Motifs that Will Add Continuity: Once you've determined the key symbols and images for your sleeve, the next step is to ensure your design flows seamlessly and coherently. By choosing patterns or motifs that complement the elements you've chosen, you'll create a sense of harmony within the overall composition. Common patterns include geometric shapes, tribal designs, or flora and fauna motifs. Discuss your thoughts with your tattoo artist, and they can help you determine the best way to integrate these patterns and motifs, so they blend seamlessly with the main designs. 4. Going with Colors That Are Easily Duplicated for Consistency: Deciding on the right color palette is an essential step to ensure consistency throughout the sleeve. Bright, vivid colors may look attractive, but they could also be tricky to reproduce reliably throughout multiple sessions. Your best bet is to opt for colors that are easily replicated and stay true to their original hue even as your tattoo ages. Classic black and grey or darker, more muted shades typically work well in this regard. Remember, your tattoo artist has experience matching various shades, so don't hesitate to rely on their expertise in developing a consistent color palette for your sleeve. 5. Collaborating with a Tattoo Artist to Design Your Sleeve: Every step in the journey of creating your dream tattoo sleeve is significant, and the selection of a reputable, skilled tattoo artist is no exception. Look for someone who has a solid portfolio of previous sleeves and whose style aligns with your tastes. Open communication with your artist is vital – discuss your ideas, ask for suggestions, and be receptive to feedback. By working together, you'll be able to design a sleeve that reflects your personality and resonates with you for years to come. Conclusion: The process of designing the perfect tattoo sleeve can seem overwhelming, but with proper planning, it can be an exciting and rewarding artistic journey. By carefully considering the choice of imagery, getting your sleeve done in sessions, incorporating patterns and motifs for continuity, opting for consistent colors, and working closely with your tattoo artist, you'll create a masterpiece that tells your story and becomes an extension of your personal identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stalinist policies in the Soviet Union included state terror, rapid industrialization, the theory of socialism in one country, a centralized state, collectivization of agriculture, cult of personality in leadership, and subordination of interests of foreign communist parties to those of the Communist Party of the Soviet Uniondeemed by Stalinism to be the most forefront vanguard party of communist revolution at the time. Stalinism promoted the escalation of class conflict, utilizing state violence to forcibly purge society of claimed supporters of the bourgeoisie, regarding them as threats to the pursuit of the communist revolution that resulted in substantial political violence and persecution of such people. These included not only bourgeois people but also working-class people accused of counter-revolutionary sympathies.  - A Primary Urban Area (PUA) is an area defined by the Department for Communities and Local Government in the United Kingdom as a statistical tool for analysing the major cities of England, originating as part of their \\"State of the English Cities\\" report and database.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - Belfast is the capital and largest city of Northern Ireland, the second largest on the island of Ireland, and the heart of the tenth largest Primary Urban Area in the United Kingdom. On the River Lagan, it had a population of 286,000 at the 2011 census and 333,871 after the 2015 council reform. Belfast was granted city status in 1888.  - Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Dublin is in the province of Leinster on Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey. The city has an urban area population of 1,345,402. The population of the Greater Dublin Area, , was 1,904,806 people.  - Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.  - Leon Trotsky (; born Lev Davidovich Bronstein;  21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - Leninism is the political theory for the democratic organisation of a revolutionary vanguard party and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat, as political prelude to the establishment of socialism. Developed by and named for the Russian revolutionary Lenin, Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories, developed from Marxism, and Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theories, for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the Russian Empire of the early 20th century.   - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south.  - The Irish Socialist Network ( ISN ) is a democratic socialist organisation formed in 2001 . It is a campaigning organisation which works actively to fight for the rights of Irish workers and to help build a socialist Ireland . It is based in Belfast and Dublin . Politically , the ISN locates itself within the Marxist tradition , but it rejects both Leninism and Trotskyism , partly because of its opposition to democratic centralist organisational structures and to the concept of the vanguard party , which it deems elitist . Most of the founding members were former members of the Workers ' Party , some being involved in the Official Republican Movement split in the late 1990s . The ISN is organised in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . In July 2007 , it had three branches : Dublin Central , Dublin North -- West and Belfast . It produces a bi-monthly , full - colour free paper called Resistance , the first issue of which was published in July / August 2007 . The ISN 's Dublin North -- West branch also produces the Finglas People , a freesheet that is widely distributed in the area . Much of the group 's publications and articles are freely available on its website .  - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.  - Trotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by Leon Trotsky. Trotsky identified himself as an orthodox Marxist and Bolshevik-Leninist, and supported founding a vanguard party of the proletariat, proletarian internationalism, and a dictatorship of the proletariat based on working class self-emancipation and mass democracy. Trotskyists are critical of Stalinism (also called Marxism-Leninism), as they oppose Stalin's theory of Socialism in One Country in favor of Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution. Trotskyists also criticize the bureaucracy that developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin.  - Leinster (  ) is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the east of Ireland. It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties.

All adults should get a flu shot.;  d). not enough information; Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Would \\"Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses , zebras have never been truly domesticated .\\" be a reasonable answer?  * No. * Yes. The answer is:","output":"Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated. However, this statement does not provide relevant information regarding the size of baby zebras upon birth. A more suitable answer to the original question is as follows: Baby zebras, also known as foals, are relatively large when they are born. Foals usually weigh between 55 and 88 pounds (25-40 kilograms) at birth, with an average weight of 70 pounds (32 kilograms). The height of newborn foals is typically around 30 to 32 inches (76-81 centimeters) tall at the withers (the ridge between the shoulder blades). Depending on their species, baby zebras are born with either a brownish or black and white coat, and their stripes develop more prominently as they grow older. It is worth noting that each zebra has unique striping patterns, which serve as their individual identifier. Similar to horses, baby zebras are precocial animals, which means that they are born well-developed and can stand, walk, and run shortly after birth. This adaption is crucial for their survival in the wild, as it allows them to escape predators more easily. In the wild, baby zebras rely on their mother's milk as their primary source of nourishment for their first six to twelve months of life. They also begin consuming grass after about a week of birth. The weaning process is gradual and can take anywhere from six to thirteen months, depending on factors such as the availability of resources and the mother's condition. In conclusion, baby zebras are relatively large when compared to other newborn animals, weighing between 55 and 88 pounds and having a height of around 30 to 32 inches. While the statement regarding zebras never being truly domesticated is true, it does not address the size of newborn zebras."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Article: Good Genes Mean Long Life Scientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have. For the lucky carriers of \\"Methuselah\\" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern  . The \\"Methuselah\\" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare. The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old. Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children. The studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy. David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread. \\"If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\\" he told The Times. \\"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it.\\" Question: According to David Gems,   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, according to David Gems, it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing. He mentions that \\"If we can find a way to reduce that [pain and suffering caused by ageing], then we are obliged to take it.\\" This statement indicates that he believes it is their responsibility to address the issues associated with ageing."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Back in the old days, when I was a child, we sat around the family roundtable at dinnertime and exchanged our daily experiences. It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member. We listened to each other and the interest was not put-on; it was real. Our family was a unit and we supported each other, and nurtured each other, and liked each other, and--we were even willing to admit--we loved each other. Today, the family roundtable has moved to the local fast-food restaurant and talk is not easy, much less encouraged. Grandma, who used to live upstairs, is now. the voice on long distance, and the working parent is far too beaten down each day to spend evening relaxation time listening to the sandbox experience of an eager four-year-old. So family conversation is as extinct as my old toys and parental questions such as \\"What have you been doing, Bobby?\\" have been replaced by \\"I'm busy, go watch television. \\" And watch TV they do; count them by the millions. But it's usually not children's television that children watch. Saturday morning, the children's hour, amounts to only about 8 percent of their weekly viewing. Where are they to be found? Watching adult television, of course, from the Match Game in the morning, to the afternoon at General Hospital, from the muggings and battles on the evening news right through the family hour and past into Starsky and Hutch. That's where you find our kids, over five million of them, at 10 p. m. , not fewer than a million until after midnight! All of this is done with parental permission. Television, used well, can provide enriching experiences for our young people, but we must use it with some sense. When the carpet is clean, we turn off the vacuum cleaner. When the dishes are clean, the dishwasher turns itself off. Not so the television, which is on from the sun in the morning to the moon at night and beyond!

I can use this background: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  Now, I have a new situation: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Answer this question please: Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","output":"To answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Car A has a catalytic converter. 2. Car B does not have a catalytic converter. 3. Catalytic converters increase the rate of reactions that help convert unburned hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water, which are less harmful byproducts. 4. A car with a catalytic converter (in this case, Car A) would be more efficient at converting unburned hydrocarbons than a car without one (Car B). Based on these steps, Car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons due to the presence of the catalytic converter."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: The Jiul de Vest river is a tributary of the River Furu in Romania . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"The two sentences appear to contain contradictory information, and therefore, they do not convey the same information. To understand this discrepancy, let's analyze both sentences separately and in detail. Sentence 1: The river Furu is a tributary of the Jiul de Vest river in Romania. This sentence indicates that the river Furu is a smaller river that flows into the Jiul de Vest river, which occurs in Romania. A tributary is a river, stream, or body of water that flows into a larger body of water, such as another river or a lake. In this case, the river Furu is considered a tributary because it contributes to the flow of the Jiul de Vest river. Sentence 2: The Jiul de Vest river is a tributary of the River Furu in Romania. This sentence implies that the Jiul de Vest river is the smaller river, and it flows into the River Furu, also in Romania. Here, the roles of the rivers are reversed compared to the information in Sentence 1. Now, the Jiul de Vest river is the one that contributes to the flow of the River Furu. In conclusion, these two sentences present conflicting information regarding which river is the tributary of the other. For Sentence 1, the river Furu is a tributary of the Jiul de Vest river, while in Sentence 2, the Jiul de Vest river is a tributary of the River Furu. Due to this inconsistency, it can be said that these two sentences do not convey the same information.

Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend experienced more weather fronts?

I start the translation by understanding the meaning of the English phrase \\"You've been bitten.\\" The information structure is \\"You\\", which is second-person pronoun, \\"have\\", which is auxiliary verb, and \\"bitten\\", which is the past participle form of the verb \\"bite\\".  2. It is important to understand that translation doesn't always happen word-to-word. So, a direct conversion of each English word to Telugu might not result in a grammatically correct or contextually meaningful phrase. Thus, the sentence must be comprehended as a whole before translating it. 3. I then use my built-in algorithms designed for translation, specifically from English to Telugu, to look for the most appropriate conversion. 4. The algorithms determine the translated phrase to be \\"మీకు కాటింది.\\", which is the equivalent expression in Telugu. 5.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Aboard a Cargo Colossus In the chess match that has global powers looking for new ways to move goods around the world, the Mary Maersk and nine other sister ships are the biggest pieces. A helicopter appeared in the sky over the North Sea. It was 7 a.m. on a Wednesday this summer, and the helicopter circled in a wide arc before hovering above a ship traveling south at about 15 knots. At more than 1,300 feet long, the ship, the Mary Maersk, was hard to miss. It is longer than the Eiffel Tower is high, and the Mary and its sister ships are the biggest container ships in the world. Feet appeared first from the helicopter, then a pair of Levi’s, and gradually a man was lowered by rope onto the ship’s deck. His job was to pilot the ship down a narrow dredged channel in the Weser River, toward the port of Bremerhaven, Germany. Later that morning, the Mary would undertake the largest-scale act of parallel parking ever — or at least since the last time it docked, the day before, in Gothenburg, Sweden. As companies look for more efficient ways to move freight from factories in China to consumers in Europe, the Mary is among the newest giants, known as the Triple-E’s. Owned and operated by A. P. Moeller-Maersk of Denmark, the world’s largest container shipping company, the Triple-E’s went into service last year, muscling their way into the 210 billion container industry. They have also gained a following: Hobbyist spotters watch for the Triple-E’s and post pictures online, and Lego has created a mini version with 1,516 bricks. Until the late 1990s, the largest container ships could carry about 5,000 steel shipping containers, each about 20 feet long. Today, such ships are little more than chum. The size of container ships has exploded, reflecting their role as the packhorses of globalization. Each year, the maritime shipping industry transports nearly 13 trillion of goods, roughly 70 percent of total freight, according to the World Trade Organization. The Triple-E’s can carry more than 18,000 containers, piled 20 high, with 10 above deck and 10 below. But they can sail only between Europe and Asia, as their nearly 194-foot wide hull is too large to fit into American ports or to slip through the Panama Canal. The Mary will stop at a dozen ports, going from Gdansk in Poland to Ningbo, Yantian and Shanghai in China. It carries seafood. It carries auto parts. It carries perfume, grated cheese and frozen pork. While computers and clothing are among China’s biggest exports, chemicals and timber are more likely to leave Europe. The Mary — stacked so high with cargo that little is visible beyond two smokestacks and a glassed-in command center — is an apt symbol for an increasingly global marketplace. But it also represents the container shipping industry’s overreaching ambitions. Few carriers besides Maersk are profitable, too many new ships are being built, and demand for space on container ships is slowing as economies in Europe and Asia face headwinds. Maersk, based in Copenhagen, ordered 20 Triple-E’s from Daewoo of South Korea in 2011, increasing its worldwide capacity more than 10 percent. The timing was unusual. A report from the Boston Consulting Group, which counts Maersk as a client, called 2011 a year that “executives in the container-shipping industry would probably like to forget,” in part because a wave of new vessels ordered in earlier years swelled capacity. But demand for space has lagged since 2008, according to Drewry, a shipping consultancy that tracks the industry. The idle space at Maersk amounts to one Triple-E. “It’s a simple logic, bigger is better,” said Ulrik Sanders, global head of the shipping practice at Boston Consulting, “if you can fill it.” “There’s too much capacity in the market and that drives down prices,” he continued. “From an industry perspective, it doesn’t make any sense. But from an individual company perspective, it makes a lot of sense. It’s a very tricky thing.” The captain wears Crocs. He is standing on the bridge, in black jeans and a white shirt with black stripes at the shoulders. The captain, Franz Holmberg, is an easygoing Dane. There is a tattoo on his left arm of an eagle fighting a dragon; he says the image is “not as vivid” as it once was. A formidable camera rests among the bridge instruments — he likes to memorialize landscapes, such as the Suez Canal scene he uses as a screen saver. Not much happens on the ship, he says, but then he sits back on a couch just off the bridge and offers a few stories of the sea. Like the time a sailor thought the Danish queen, whose picture hangs in the dining room, began speaking to him. Or the time two Ghanaian stowaways were discovered huddled in a sealed crate. They had packed food in bags, and brought bags to defecate in. But after more than a week at sea, “they ran out of bags,” the captain says. He came from a farming family, but decided to try a life at sea and got hooked. After graduating from nautical school, he was a third officer on a ship that carried 3,800 containers, a fifth of Mary’s capacity. “Every time a new series comes out, everyone says this is it; it can’t get any bigger,” the captain says, adding, “Then a few years after, they just add a little bit more.” The industry wants ships that carry more containers, more slowly. Fuel prices are a major factor, so ships now commonly “slow steam” to save fuel, cruising at 16 or 18 knots instead of 22. A typical trip from Poland to China takes 34 days. During a recent voyage to the Suez, the Mary’s crew sailed on a parallel course with a 10-year-old Maersk container ship that held half as much cargo, but the Mary used only 6 percent more fuel. “We’ve seen during the last 10, 15 years a dramatic increase in fuel costs,” said Jacob Pedersen, an analyst at Sydbank, a Danish bank. “That gives them reason to get rid of the old uneconomic ships.” But fuel is only one part of the equation. “The supply of ships has far outstripped the growth rate” of container traffic, said Richard Meade, the editor of Lloyd’s List, a leading nautical newspaper, adding that the top shipping lines “have entered into an arms race in terms of size, led by Maersk” and its Swiss rival, the privately held Mediterranean Shipping Company. Newer ships, he said, “are more efficient, more economically viable and more environmentally friendly, but they are only going to deliver those results if they are full.” When the world economy slackens, so does the shipping industry. At one end of Mary’s route, the growth engine of China has been losing steam, while at the other, Europe is again flirting with recession. The shipping industry has also lacked significant consolidation, with shipping giants often seen as national assets. The top five container lines are either family- or state-controlled. Revenue at Maersk, publicly traded but family controlled, equals more than 14 percent of Denmark’s gross domestic product. Shipyards, conditioned to build ever-larger vessels, are cutting prices to keep their order books filled. The Triple-E’s were built for 190 million a ship, which in 2011 was seen as a relative bargain. By comparison, in 2007 China Shipping Container Lines, another major shipping line, paid 1.36 billion for eight ships, or about 170 million a ship — but those had a capacity of about 13,300 containers, nearly 5,000 fewer per ship. “In this down cycle, the new-built prices are low and money is cheap, so you would much rather go and buy the vessels than go and acquire a company” that has older ships, said Martin Dixon, director of research products at Drewry. “Many shipping lines are struggling to make money, so cost leadership is key to survival. Hence, you’re seeing a lot of investment in bigger ships.” The bigger ships, though, have been sustained by a growth rate in containerization traffic that has been two and a half to three times global economic growth for decades — and that seems to be coming to an end. “There are two types of companies that will survive this,” Mr. Sanders of Boston Consulting said. “Either you have the very large companies like Maersk” that “take advantage of scale and make money, or particular shipping lines that operate a niche where they dominate, like a feeder line out in Southeast Asia. “The other guys,” he added, “are caught in the middle and will have a hard time to make a decent return.” Jens Boysen is the Mary’s chief officer. Essentially, he is the captain’s right-hand man. While the ships grow, the crews don’t, in another economy of scale. The Mary has a multinational crew of 20 to 30 — and with so few, they multitask. Mr. Boysen, 35, is a blond, blue-eyed ethnic Dane who grew up in Germany. He doubles as medic, he explained during a tour of the ship’s small medical bay, which has a bed, a shower and drawers stuffed with pills and transfusion packs. He recounted an episode on the Mediterranean. “I had one motorman who, he was hammering on a shaft,” he began. “He used the wrong tool so some metal peeled off and actually was penetrating through the boiler suit, so there was a lot of blood coming out.” He wasn’t sure whether metal had lodged inside the man, so he approached the situation like an engineer. “We have a lot of magnets on board, so I just took a magnet to feel if there was something,” he said. “There was actually some metal, but we couldn’t get it removed, so we had to take him to the hospital later on.” The crewman was fine — problem solved. The cost of the crew and a range of other expenses related to running the vessel account for more than a quarter of the Maersk Line division’s cost base. Fuel represents more than a fifth. Cutting such costs helps Maersk steady its results. In 2009, the company lost 1 billion. This year, Maersk is on track to make 4.5 billion in profit, according to Bloomberg. Back in the medical bay, Mr. Boysen pulls out a metal box marked “dental” from a drawer and looked up. “I can also pull some teeth if you want.” Earlier this year, the Nicaraguan government announced plans to build a new canal system, bankrolled by a Chinese billionaire, that would compete with Panama and be wide enough to accommodate the Triple-E. Such plans have been floated before and failed to materialize, but it is the kind of audacious project that only the Chinese might try. No country more than China has spurred the containerization boom, a byproduct of moving the world’s factories thousands of miles from their biggest markets. Maersk is deeply embedded in China, with more than 20,000 employees there. It operates container terminals at seven Chinese ports, has bought 118 Chinese-made ships worth 3.5 billion and owns two Chinese factories that build containers. China is also exerting its influence on the industry. The country’s regulators recently blocked an attempt by Maersk and two European rivals to form a partnership, saying it would hinder competition. Maersk recently proposed a less ambitious alliance with a single rival, the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The proposed deals represent a concession that cargo volume is not rebounding as quickly, so shippers need to share costs and cargo space. Boats are typically full heading west to Europe and partly empty heading east to China. Cargo from Europe to Asia has grown about 30 percent in the last five years, in part because of rising demand from a growing Chinese middle class. But it has not nearly filled all the containers. At the same time, some manufacturing is moving closer to local markets, a trend that contributes to slowing growth in container traffic. China, too, is trying to foster its own shipping lines. This year, China Shipping Container Lines ordered five ships that will each hold 19,000 containers, about 1,000 more than the Triple-E. They begin to arrive later this year. But Jakob Stausholm, the chief strategy, finance and transformation officer at Maersk’s container shipping division, said that there was little room for ships to expand further. “This is still an attractive industry, but it will grow at a much lower multiple of global G.D.P.,” he said. “I really think that right now, given the size of container lines, given the level of sea freight, there is no benefit going toward bigger vessels.” How to Park a Whale It was time to park the world’s largest container ship. Several hours had passed since the first pilot arrived by helicopter, and a second, Karsten Burckner, 45, had come aboard from a tugboat gangplank. Soon he was smoking cigarettes on the far end of the ship’s bridge with the captain. He rolled them by hand, while the captain preferred his Marlboros. Mr. Burckner’s job was to help turn large boats in front of the harbor at Bremerhaven and back them into their spot alongside the port where towering cranes would soon begin hoisting crates on and off the ships. Speedy, it is not. Three tugboats nudged the Mary, while the ship’s twin engines fired in opposite directions. The ship began to rotate. It eased toward large rubber cushions on the dock. Beyond were steel shipping crates, stacked like dominoes and stretching out in a vast paved expanse in the port. They were scooped up by gangly red vehicles called “Straddle Carriers,” which are not much wider than a truck but tall enough to carry three or four crates. The two men looked over the ship’s side and spoke on walkie-talkies to sailors on the ground. Minutes passed — 10, 20, 30. The Mary, crawling at 0.1 knots, began sidling up to a pier. “Compared to the whole size and the weight of the ship, the steel plates in the side are actually pretty thin,” the captain explained. “If we get a speed higher than that, we’ll start buckling plates.” He smiled. “And that does not go well with anybody, obviously.” Mr. Burckner, too, was once a container ship captain — 11 years ago. But he had to give it up. “I was forced,” he said, pausing ominously and then smiling, “by my wife.” This is true of many pilots, who tend to be men who gave up the months at sea for home life. His ship carried 2,500 containers. “That was a big container ship then,” Captain Holmberg explained. “When I started, nobody was thinking that this size of vessel will be built,” Mr. Burckner said. “I don’t know where it will end,” he said, looking over its vast expanse. “Ask Maersk.” A version of this article appears in print on October 5, 2014, on page BU4 of the New York edition with the headline: Aboard a Cargo Colossus.

Solve this instance: Egypt’s Prime Minister Hazem El-Beblawi announced on State TV Monday that his cabinet has submitted its resignation to interim President Adly Mansour.      Following a 15-minute meeting with the cabinet early on Monday, Beblawi said “reform cannot take place through the government alone,” adding that all Egyptians should strive to achieve the change they aspire to.      Beblawi also mentioned that Egypt currently faces huge challenges as well as great opportunities to be grasped. “It is time we all sacrificed for the good of the country. Rather than asking what has Egypt given us, we should instead be asking what we have done for Egypt,” he added at the end of his short televised speech.      A prominent economist and politician, Beblawi was named prime minister last July following the ouster of former president Mohamed Morsi and his prime minister Hisham Qandil’s government amid massive protests on 30 June 2013.      Beblawi’s government was subjected to criticism over the past few weeks by all colours of the political spectrum in Egypt.      He was criticised by many for taking too long to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation in the wake of an upsurge in terrorist attacks on the police and army in the aftermath of the violent dispersal of pro-Morsi camps last August.      More recently, his cabinet came under fire by disgruntled workers after the exclusion of crucial groups of public sector workers from qualifying for a newly passed minimum wage law fuelled fury among workers, leading to strikes in a number of crucial sectors of the economy.      Public transport workers, textile workers, low-ranking policemen, postal workers and doctors are among a number of governmental sectors that went on strike in the past few days.      An official source told Ahram Online that Interim President Adly Mansour is expected to accept the cabinet's resignation and commission Ibrahim Mahleb, minister of housing in Beblawi’s government, to form the new cabinet.      In his statement, Beblawi, a co-founder of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, said his government had accepted the responsibility at the time of its appointment because its ministers were among the few willing to face that challenge, and not because they were the most qualified.      El-Beblawi served as undersecretary-general at the UN between 1995 and 2000.      He was minister of finance in Essam Sharaf's cabinet from July to October 2011 during Egypt's post-revolution army-administered transitional phase.      He resigned in October 2011 to object to clashes in Cairo's Maspero district between military police and Coptic protesters in which 28 of the latter were killed.      Short link: ||||| A man stands on a bridge where huge posters of Egypt's Army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi are hanged in central Cairo February 3, 2014.      CAIRO Egypt's government resigned on Monday, paving the way for army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to declare his candidacy for president of a strategic U.S. ally gripped by political strife.      After the July overthrow of elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi and subsequent crackdown on Islamists and liberals with hundreds killed and thousands jailed, critics say Cairo's military-backed authorities are turning the clock back to the era of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, when the political elite ruled with an iron fist in alliance with top businessmen.      The outgoing government \\"made every effort to get Egypt out of the narrow tunnel in terms of security, economic pressures and political confusion,\\" Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said in a live nationwide speech.      Beblawi, who was tasked by interim President Adly Mansour with running the government's affairs until the election, did not give a clear reason for the decision.      But the resignation effectively opened the way for Sisi to run for president since he would first have to leave his post as defense minister in any case. \\"This (government resignation) was done as a step that was needed ahead of Sisi's announcement that he will run for president,\\" an Egyptian official said.      He told Reuters that the cabinet had resigned en masse because Sisi did not want to appear to be acting alone.      Government spokesman Hany Salah said only: \\"This government feels that it did what it had to do in this critical period, and maybe it's time for a change.\\"      Sisi has unveiled a political roadmap meant to lead to elections after toppling Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood following mass unrest against his increasingly arbitrary rule.      But promises of democracy have not borne fruit in what is the world's biggest Arab nation, where hundreds of thousands of people gathered in 2011 in an army-backed uprising that overthrew Mubarak and raised hopes of a new political landscape.      The presidential vote is expected within months.      The United States, Cairo's main Western ally and military backer, has expressed concern for democracy since Mursi was ousted, but has also described Egypt, which has a peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal, as a vital partner.      On Monday, the U.S. State Department said it was surprised by the government's resignation.      Washington is watching the situation closely and seeking details from Egyptian counterparts, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.      \\"This step was unexpected, so we are looking to obtain information on it,\\" she told a regular news briefing.      \\"Our focus ... remains on pressing and encouraging Egypt to take steps forward that will advance an inclusive transition process that leads to a democratic civilian-led government selected through a credible and transparent elections process,\\" Psaki said.      ZEROING IN ON THE BROTHERHOOD      Egypt's stock market rose 0.26 percent after news of the government's departure to 8029.37 points, reversing losses from earlier in the day.      Mursi's removal touched off the bloodiest political crisis in modern Egyptian history. Security forces killed hundreds of Brotherhood supporters and jailed thousands, and top leaders were put on trial.      The Muslim Brotherhood accused Sisi of plotting a coup to restore military-dominated government, and human rights groups say abuses are spreading by the day, allegations the army-backed government denies.      Housing Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, a former official in Mubarak's National Democratic Party, was expected to be named prime minister of the new government, said a security source.      The Egyptian authorities are likely to remain preoccupied with efforts to further weaken and isolate the Muslim Brotherhood and fight a mushrooming Islamist insurgency.      The government has also clamped down on some secular activists who were instrumental in the popular uprising that deposed Mubarak, and who supported Mursi's removal. They are now languishing in prisons and face trial.      Compounding the instability, Islamist militants based in the widely lawless Sinai Peninsula have intensified attacks on police and soldiers, killing hundreds since Mursi's fall.      The Sinai-based group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed two South Koreans last week, inflicting yet more harm on a tourism industry gutted by political turmoil and protests.      Ansar also said that it was behind assassinations of army and Interior Ministry officials.      A security source said Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim, who has been spearheading the campaign to crush the Brotherhood, was expected to retain his post in the hope he could provide tight security before elections. He survived an assassination attempt by a suicide bomber last year.      The Gulf Arab states of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, deeply suspicious of the Muslim Brotherhood, showered Egypt with billions of dollars in aid after Mursi's political demise.      That raised the morale of the government and filled state coffers. But any new government will be under pressure to come up with long-term plans to strengthen the tottering economy.

This is because the sale would generally imply a discount or a reduced price, which is something that customers tend to appreciate, as it allows them to save money or buy a better quality product at a lower price than they initially planned. The sale event usually triggers a sense of urgency and excitement in customers due to the limited nature of such deals (as the stocks could run out or the sale wouldn't last for too long). Therefore, Robin, being aware of the sale and making the purchase immediately after it went on sale, would have acted quickly to benefit from the reduced price. The satisfaction of acquiring a gift at a lower cost could potentially induce positive emotions such as happiness and satisfaction, making Robin feel like they made a smart and successful purchase. This sense of accomplishment can boost Robin's mood and make them feel like they are proficient in finding good deals. Furthermore, that feeling of having made a great deal can also increase the value Robin associates with the present. Being able to obtain a desired item for a loved one at a better price can reinforce the thought that they have made a thoughtful and wise decision, which in turn, contributes to feeling great about the purchase. In conclusion, given that Robin bought the birthday present immediately after it went on sale, it is most probable that they felt like they got a great deal (option b). This feeling stems from the satisfaction of saving money, acting promptly, and making a successful purchase that is of value both to Robin and the person who will receive the gift.

Title: Gave Mailbug to elderly parent for gift Product review: I recently gave my father a Mailbug for his birthday as I felt he would be intimidated by a computer. He really liked the large keys and the very readable screen. The only down side is the transmission of messages can take hours and sometimes up to a day. Perhaps it has to do with the service in his area. Overall it was a great gift and now he can communicate with his ten children. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","output":"To determine whether the review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light, let's evaluate the content of the review: 1. The review begins by mentioning the gifting of a Mailbug to an elderly parent, which implies that the product is suitable for older individuals. 2. The parent liked the large keys and the readable screen, indicating that the design of the product is user-friendly, especially for the elderly. 3. The only negative aspect mentioned in the review is the slow transmission of messages. However, the reviewer speculates that it might be due to the service in the area, suggesting that the issue may not be directly related to the product. 4. As a result of using the Mailbug, the father is now able to communicate with his ten children, which showcases the product's value for improved communication. Taking these points into consideration, it can be concluded that the review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light, as it emphasizes the benefits and user-friendliness of the Mailbug while acknowledging a potential, location-based issue with message transmission speeds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A USCG pilot and his winchman Haig answer an SOS call at sea and arrive at a derelict schooner, the Requite. Haig lowers himself to the ship, where he finds three dead bodies along with one survivor, Eva, cowering in the cabin. As the pilot attempts to retrieve Haig and Eva with a rescue basket, the line breaks, plunging the two into the ocean.  After they swim back to the boat, the pilot informs Haig that he must return to base because his fuel is borderline.  Eva and Haig spend the night on the boat, during which time she recounts the story of the storm that killed everyone else aboard. She explains to him that the strange events began soon after they found a priest drifting in the ocean, apparently a survivor of a disaster. Then, she tells Haig of the violent storm that caused all of the freakish deaths on the boat. One man was hurled through a hatch; one is hanging from the ship's mast; another vanished before her eyes; and a fourth man is in an aft compartment, floating in the air. Eva attributes the deaths to supernatural causes, but Haig has a practical explanation for everything, including the man who appears to be floating in the air.  Early the next morning, the pilot returns along with the Coast Guard cutter Venturous.  Haig and Eva are transferred from the Requite to the deck of the Venturous, where they board the helicopter for the flight back to Miami.  At the same time, Coast Guard personnel from the Venturous investigate the wrecked schooner. The story takes a bizarre turn when the Venturous' captain calls Haig to tell him that what they found on the ship was not what Haig reported. Right after Haig hears about the discovery, another nightmare begins. The film is an example of a twist ending.

The powerful sound of the chant, which aimed to bring people together and foster a connection with their faith, was suddenly overshadowed by the harsh discord of the protest, which held no regard for the sanctity of the space or the solemnity of the worship. The protest's loud nature was undoubtedly deliberate, designed to gain attention and make a statement, regardless of the offense it would cause to the devout worshippers. As a result, the church's harmonious environment was broken, and the sense of unity and collective spirituality that had been so carefully cultivated was disrupted as well. Additionally, the intrusive noise exacerbated an already contentious situation, further driving a wedge between the protesters and the religious community. Instead of facilitating dialogue and promoting understanding, the deafening protest only served to harden the resolve of both groups, making it increasingly difficult for any form of communication or reconciliation to take place. Ironically, the disruptive volume of the protest also detracted from the efficacy of the chanting, a religious practice intended to deepen the connection between the congregation and their deity. As the soothing melodies of the chants were drowned out by the cacophony of the protest, the spiritual experience became fraught with tension and hostility, leaving the worshippers feeling unsettled and unable to focus on the sacred words they had come to recite. Moreover, the well-being and emotional state of the attendees were indelibly affected by the auditory onslaught. The sudden barrage of sound left many individuals feeling anxious and disoriented, unable to respond or react appropriately to the situation at hand. The clashing of the reverent chanting and the offensive protest highlighted a striking contrast in values, as the former sought to bring peace and enlightenment, while the latter espoused discord and provocation. In conclusion, the offensive protest within the church interrupted the religious chanting primarily due to its excessive loudness, which significantly disrupted the serene atmosphere and the emotional and spiritual experiences of the churchgoers. As the sacred space was violated by the harsh sounds of the protest, it became increasingly challenging for both the religious community and the protesters to find common ground and engage in meaningful dialogue, greatly diminishing the possibility for any productive resolution to the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If A count of the languages spoken all over India, leaving out the dialects, comes to 1,652, written in 13 different alphabets., can we conclude that \\"Only 4 languages are spoken.\\"?  *yes. *it is not possible to tell. *no.","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Only 4 languages are spoken\\" in India. The statement provided indicates that there are 1,652 languages spoken all over India, excluding dialects. These languages are written using 13 different alphabets. This shows the linguistic diversity of India, which is known for its rich cultural and linguistic heritage. India is home to multiple language families, such as Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Austroasiatic, and Tibeto-Burman, among others. Some of the widely spoken languages in India include Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Malayalam, Kannada, Oriya, Punjabi, Assamese, and many more. Each of these languages has its own literature, history, and cultural significance. The mention of 4 languages might likely be a confusion with the concept of \\"The Four Classical Languages of India,\\" which are Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. These languages hold significant historical and cultural value in India. However, it is important to understand that these four classical languages do not represent the totality of languages spoken in India, as there are numerous other languages spoken by millions of people across the country. Furthermore, India's constitution recognizes 22 official languages under the Eighth Schedule, which includes languages such as Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Bodo, Santhali, Maithili, and Dogri. This highlights the importance of linguistic diversity in India and demonstrates that the country cannot be represented by only four languages. In conclusion, the statement that \\"Only 4 languages are spoken\\" in India is incorrect and does not capture the vast linguistic diversity of the country. The provided information, which states that there are 1,652 languages spoken in India, is a more accurate representation of India's linguistic diversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can mix it with a small amount of warm water to get it ready. Here's the step-by-step justification for choosing option 2: Step 1: Understanding yeast Yeast is a living organism that ferments sugars, releasing carbon dioxide and alcohol as by-products. This fermentation helps bread rise and gives it its characteristic texture. Step 2: Assessing the options Option 1 suggests mixing yeast with warm vinegar. Vinegar is acidic, which can negatively affect yeast's ability to ferment. This may result in poor rising of the dough. Option 2 suggests mixing yeast with warm water. Warm water helps activate the yeast by providing an ideal environment for the yeast to dissolve and begin fermentation.

What is the name of the person that Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been.

Upon arrival, what they find exceeds their wildest dreams - a tropical paradise teeming with unique creatures and a hidden indigenous tribe who have never encountered Western civilization. Gilligan is determined to document their lives and practices, convinced that this is the story that will launch his career to new heights. However, things take a sinister turn when they discover that there is a rival group of journalists from a competitive news organization who have also found their way to the island on a similar mission, putting their own twisted spin on the truth and seeking to exploit the indigenous tribe and the island's natural resources for their benefit.

But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.

Write a title for this article: A private rocket successfully sent a capsule full of cargo zipping toward the International Space Station in a first of its kind delivery for NASA, but couldn't deliver on job No. 2: putting a commercial satellite into the correct orbit. One of nine engines on Space X company's Falcon 9 rocket failed Sunday 79 seconds after launch because of a pressure loss. The engine didn't explode, but it did start a series of events that meant another company's private satellite is not in the place it is needed. The main mission for the Falcon launch — delivering half a ton of science and food supplies toward the space station — is still on track with a docking of the cargo-laden Dragon capsule scheduled for Wednesday. SpaceX on Monday said the ship's flight computer calculated a new path to the station for the capsule. It is the first of a dozen supply runs under a mega-contract with NASA. \\"Falcon 9 did exactly what it was designed to do,\\" the California based SpaceX said. \\"Like the Saturn V, which experienced engine loss on two flights, Falcon 9 is designed to handle an engine out situation and still complete its mission.\\" But not all of its mission. The original plan was for Falcon to fire its second stage engines after Dragon left and then deploy an industrial communications satellite into orbit for Orbcomm of Dulles, Va. Because this is a new resupply ship for the space station, NASA and its international partners had set detailed safety rules in advance for Falcon, even though the engine failure was far from the station. And those rules prevent SpaceX from firing its second stage engines, Orbcomm said in a statement. The satellite is in a lower orbit and engineers are trying to figure out how to boost it, Orbcomm said. This was the first of 18 satellites that Orbcomm had hired SpaceX to deliver. The satellites help in two-way communications for companies to track their heavy equipment across the world. The company wouldn't respond to questions about the cost of the satellite or launch services. Harvard University astronomer Jonathan McDowell, who tracks launches worldwide, noticed the problem for hours before either company acknowledged that the satellite was in the wrong orbit. Even though SpaceX was congratulating itself after the launch, McDowell said: \\"We can't say that it was a perfect launch.\\" Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears Title:","output":"\\"SpaceX's Mixed Success: Falcon 9 Mission Delivers Cargo to ISS, Fails to Position Commercial Satellite\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Understand that the goal is to make the story make complete sense and fit the title by swapping two sentences. 2.

Now let's apply these steps to the given task: Title: Finding a phone 1: Tom was walking through the park and found a phone on the ground. 2: It was an expensive phone and Tom wanted to find the owner. 3: He was almost done when he saw a group over by the trees. 4: Tom went around at the park and asked everyone if they lost a phone. 5: He went to the group and found out Emily had lost the phone. As we can see, the third sentence, \\"He was almost done when he saw a group over by the trees,\\" disrupts the logical flow of the story. We could swap this sentence with the fourth sentence in order to make the story make complete sense. So, now the updated story will be: 1: Tom was walking through the park and found a phone on the ground. 2: It was an expensive phone and Tom wanted to find the owner. 4: Tom went around at the park and asked everyone if they lost a phone. 3: He was almost done when he saw a group over by the trees. 5: He went to the group and found out Emily had lost the phone. This updated story has a more logical flow with Tom seeing the group after searching and asking people around the park.

One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

You can grow them anywhere where the ground drains a lot of sunlight! Find a spot that gets at least 10 or 15 hours of sun a day. Black eyed susan plants like to alternate between full sun and shade in areas with less sun. - This option emphasizes sunlight, but the phrasing \\"ground drains a lot of sunlight\\" is incorrect. It also contradicts the initial information stating they prefer full sun but can grow in partial or bright shade. 3). To grow black-eyed susan flowers, be sure to plant from seed. This is especially important for African violets that will simply take root. - This option seems unrelated to the previous sentences and talks about planting from seed, and also mentions African violets, which is irrelevant to black-eyed susan flowers. 4). Plant your susans in well-draining, rich soil. While they don't necessarily care about the ph of their soil, they do prefer organically rich soil that drains quickly. - This option focuses on soil preferences and matches well with the earlier statements about black-eyed susan flowers not being particular about soil type or pH. Based on the analysis, the best continuation is option 4: How to grow black eyed susan flowers: Pick a spot that gets a lot of sunlight. Black eyed susan plants thrive in full sun but will also grow in partial or bright shade. They are not very particular about soil type or ph though, which makes them easy to grow just about anywhere, even if they have to deal with some shade. Plant your susans in well-draining, rich soil. While they don't necessarily care about the pH of their soil, they do prefer organically rich soil that drains quickly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Where was Sam drinking wine? Movie title: Lake Dead Movie plot: Three sisters, Brielle, Kelli, and Sam, are on a college break. They discover that their grandfather has just died and he has left them a motel in his will. Their father, John, tries to persuade them not to go, but the sisters ignore him and head off, accompanied by their friends: Tanya, Ben, Bill, and Bill's girlfriend, Amy. Sam is the first to arrive, and while drinking wine in Room 6, two inbreds forcefully enter and attack Sam, where with a collection of duct tape, an iron bar, and an axe, they bind Sam's legs with the tape, place the iron bar beside her ankles, and use the axe head to force the bar through both her ankles. Afterwards, the three are in a boat, where the inbreds tie a badly beaten Sam's legs to a concrete block, and dump her into the water, where she is still alive as the concrete block pulls her beneath the water, where she drowns. The rest drive to the motel and meet the caretaker, an old lady who appears kind. After finding a lake on their property, the group of friends take a swim, not noticing that Sam's dead body is floating in the lake beneath them. After the swim, the friends return to their trailer, where they set up a small campsite. Bill and Tanya go out to the woods to get some firewood, and end up having sex (much to the chagrin of Amy). After encounters with large, strange-looking, unkempt men, the friends are terrified. Bill, Tanya, and Amy are butchered, while the remaining friends escape but are picked up by a mysterious, pushy cop. He tricks them into coming back to the motel where everything slowly falls into place. It is later revealed that the cop and caretaker are all a part of the evil scheme to make Brielle and Kelli a part of their devious plans. The cop and caretaker are in fact son and mother, respectively, and their family has been perpetuated by incest for generations (hence the inbred characteristics of the two aforementioned unkempt men). It becomes apparent that the girls' father had rejected the family \\"tradition\\" and escaped. Their grandmother found out...

Kurtwood Smith plays Myron Castleman, an everyman stuck in a loop that forces him to constantly relive the same hour of his life over and over, being the only person aware of this. During one loop, he discovers that a scientist named Nathan Rosenbluth has predicted an event that matches his experience. Castleman calls him and explains what is going on, however, Rosenbluth is highly skeptical of his claims. Over the next loops, Myron struggles to get into contact with Rosenbluth again, and in the process becomes frustrated to the point of screaming at his secretary and throwing his suitcase into traffic. Eventually, he does manage to talk to Rosenbluth, who initially dismisses Myron as crazy until Myron describes the transition as the scientist had predicted (including the phrase \\"Consciousness is an independent variable,\\" which is central to Rosenbluth's theories).

(CNN) -- Two Kenyan aid workers who had been held by the al Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab since 2011 have been rescued near Somalia's border with Kenya, the African Union Mission in Somalia said Friday.  The rescue was carried out on the outskirts of Dhobley town in Somalia by peacekeepers for the mission, known by the acronym AMISOM, who were working with Somali forces, AMISOM said in a news release.  One of the rescued, James Kiarie Gichoi, was working for Care International when he was kidnapped near the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya.  The other, Daniel Njuguna Wanyoike, was working as a driver's helper for a company contracted by the aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres when he was kidnapped in Afmadow, a nearby town in Somalia.  Both men were receiving treatment Friday at an AMISOM medical facility in nearby Dhobley, Somalia, and were expected to be repatriated to Nairobi, Kenya.  AMISOM forces working with the Somali National Army have mounted an offensive that has liberated 10 towns that were among Al-Shabaab's strongholds, said AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.  Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. In 2012, the two groups effectively merged, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen.  Al-Shabaab hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, but has launched attacks in other countries as well.

Television watching is a common leisure activity, and people typically watch TV with the primary purpose of being entertained. TV shows, movies, and other programs are created to provide the audience with amusement, enjoyment, or a momentary escape from reality. Here's a brief elaboration on the other possible answers: - Erections: This answer is not accurate for the general purpose of watching TV, as it refers only to a specific and limited aspect of adult content. Watching TV does not automatically imply seeking out or expecting adult content. - Boredom: While some people might find certain TV content boring, the primary intention of watching TV is not to experience boredom. People typically watch TV to pass the time or relax, and they usually try to choose content that interests or entertains them. - Get fat: Although watching TV for extended periods and leading a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to weight gain, people do not watch TV with the expectation of getting fat. It is important to find a balance between sedentary activities, like watching TV, and engaging in physical exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle. - Sadness: TV content may sometimes provoke feelings of sadness or sympathy in the audience, but this is not the main goal. Many shows aim to evoke a range of emotions to create an engaging and immersive experience for the viewer. People generally watch TV to lift their spirits, relax, or enjoy themselves, rather than seeking out sadness. To sum up, people watch TV primarily for entertainment, as it offers a broad range of content that can suit different preferences and provide amusement, relaxation, or a temporary escape from reality.

The violent arena of domestic abuse litigation has grown a bit more volatile here, now that a judge has decided to hold two women in contempt of court for returning to men who had been ordered to stay away from them. \\"You can't have it both ways,\\" said Judge Megan Lake Thornton of Fayette County District Court in recently fining two women 100 and 200 respectively for obtaining protective orders forbidding their partners from contacting them, then relenting and contacting the men. Ruling that the order was mutually binding, Judge Thornton also cited the men for contempt. \\"It drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want,\\" said Judge Thornton, who is experienced in the state's thick domestic abuse docket, which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective orders a year. Kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive relationships in the state. Judge Thornton's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered women, who plan to appeal it. The advocates say the finding goes beyond existing law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic abuse cases, which involve economic and family dependency and other complications of daily living. The state office on domestic violence has pointedly agreed, warning that the ruling could cause abused women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble. \\"The reality is it's easy to say they should never have contact,\\" said Sherry Currens, executive director of the Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, an advocacy and legal protection group. \\"But we're talking about people in long-term relationships. They may have children in common. It's pretty hard to say, \`Never speak again.' People have financial difficulties. They may love the partner. It's not an easy thing.\\" But Judge Thornton declared in court, \\"When these orders are entered, you don't just do whatever you damn well please and ignore them.\\" The ruling stunned Cindra Walker, the lawyer for the two women, who is with Central Kentucky Legal Services, which represents many of the thousands of indigent women caught in abusive relationships. \\"For over five years, I've been in court practically every day on these abuse cases,\\" Ms. Walker said, \\"and I've never before had a victim threatened with contempt.\\"  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two of the reasons Sherry Currens gives for people violating protective orders?\\" is \\"Financial difficulties\\"?

The task instructions are asking you to solve a series of arithmetic operations where the operations are provided in Italian. In Italian, 'aggiunta' stands for 'addition' and 'sottrazione' stands for 'subtraction'.  Here's how you do the task: Step 1: Find where it says \\"sottrazione\\" or \\"aggiunta\\" in the problem because these will indicate whether to perform subtraction or addition respectively.  Step 2: Replace the Italian words with their English counterparts in the problem. \\"6683 sottrazione 53 aggiunta 3081 aggiunta 7107 aggiunta 6531 sottrazione 9134 sottrazione 345\\" translates to \\"6683 minus 53 plus 3081 plus 7107 plus 6531 minus 9134 minus 345\\"  Step 3: Now, solve the arithmetic operation. Here's the breakdown: - Start with the first operation, 6683 - 53, which equals 6630. - Next, add 3081 to the result, 6630 + 3081 = 9711 - Add another 7107 to that total, 9711 + 7107 = 16818  - Add 6531 to the result, 16818 + 6531 = 23349 - Subtract 9134 from that total, 23349 - 9134 = 14215 - Finally, subtract 345 from the result, 14215 - 345 = 13870 So, when you translate the operations to English and follow the arithmetic declarations, you obtain the final answer 13870."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Last weekend marked my third excursion to LVNV, and Planet Hollywood, with a close group of friends, all of us travelling from the DFW, TX area.  Thankfully, this will be my last to Planet Hollywood...and I'm not alone several of our group agree with this sentiment. Two separate experiences that we're horribly handled and concluded our business with your hotel: 1. During our stay, my wife went to take a bag up to our room on the 23rd floor.  She rode the elevator stopping several times along the way, but discovered when she got to the room...the key card didn't work.  She rode the elevator to the lobby, again stopping along the way.  Went to the front desk and was told she would have to wait in the check-in/check-out line for someone to help.  When she told the front desk person she just needed a key, they huffily told her to give them the key.  They looked up the room and told her she wasn't on the room registry and they couldn't let her in the room.  Sadly, they had taken her ID at check-in and we assumed they had added her.  So, my wife comes and gets me.  I go down to the front desk.  Once again they tried to direct me to the check-in/check-out line.  I refused and told them I was down to see the Manager.  I can't make this part up...they directed me to another line for people waiting to see the Manager about complaints.  I told them I wanted to see the Manager immediately.  The Front Desk person went and got the Supervisor.  The Supervisor proceeded to tell me that they had a \\"Policy\\" that additional guests had to be registered to the room.  I explained that the policy shouldn't be used as a cover for poor customer service.  My wife's name is the same as mine, her ID as presented showed the same address, and she was with me at check-in and provided her ID...they had failed to follow their policy and subsequently burdened us with the failure.  The Supervisor just kept restating it was policy.  As I walked away, the Security Guard at the desk pulled me aside and suggested he could go get the Manager to discuss the situation, he didn't feel that the Supervisor was making the situation better.  I told him I would wait.  The Manager, Roberto, came out and I explained the story to him.  He agreed that the failure was theirs and made sure my wife was on the room and reset the key card.  He apologized and offered to remove the resort fees from our bill...I told him I wasn't looking for that, I was frustrated that my wife was treated poorly.  Roberto stated he wanted to do it and he apologized again that there was an issue.  I thought the problem was solved...  2. When we checked in we had a voucher for a couple of free nights.  This was sent to one of our higher rolling group members (under the friends and family program) who offered it to us for this trip.  We had decided there was no big issue if it wasn't used, we would simply pass it along to the next member of our group.  So, we asked at check-in if it would be honored and we were reassured that it would be.   We asked again before we left the desk and we were told it was already applied.  We found out at check-out that it was not applied.  Once again someone went and found Roberto.  This time Roberto was the failure.  Not only had he not applied what he had offered in our previous interaction, but when we told him about the voucher he told us there was no proof it had been presented, indicating we were not being honest.  Since the voucher was kept by the front desk person at check-in we couldn't even pass it along, it was completely wasted.  He ended up removing one day's worth of resort fees (22.50 versus his offering prior to remove them all) and told us there was nothing else he could do.  Again, I wasn't looking for special dispensation, it was offered at the outset...My problem was the way it was dealt with and that what was offered wasn't honored. We are in our forties, we have some simple expectations you could learn from:  1.) Reasonable accommodations at a reasonable price point...5 nights @ 150/Night; AC didn't work, room wasn't cleaned, and we paid 22.50 per night in resort fees for amenities we didn't use. 2.)

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: 3,645 to develop a domestic violence training program for local police departments, led by a victim's advocacy trainer; the goal of these mini-workshops will be to ensure that local police departments consistently adhere to proper PFA protocol. Hypothesis: It costs less then 1000 dollars to develop this training program.  Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise explicitly states that the cost to develop the domestic violence training program is 3,645. On the other hand, the hypothesis proposes that it costs less than 1,000 to develop this training program.  The training program, as described in the premise, is designed to be led by a victim's advocacy trainer and aims to ensure local police departments consistently adhere to proper PFA (protection from abuse) protocol. Since the given cost in the premise is 3,645, and it states that this amount will be used for developing the program, the hypothesis of it costing less than 1,000 is not supported by the given information in the premise. Additionally, it's important to consider that the development of a comprehensive training program, such as the one described in the premise, may involve various costs. These can include hiring and paying the victim's advocacy trainer, creating and distributing training materials, organizing workshops, and any potential administration fees. All these expenses would need to be covered by the budget allocated for the development of the program. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the development of this domestic violence training program costs less than 1,000 is not supported or entailed by the premise. The premise itself clearly states that a figure of 3,645 has been allocated for this purpose. Hence, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, and it can be logically concluded that the cost of developing this training program is not less than 1,000 according to the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While Polish-Lithuanian army concentrated in Podolia, in deep south of the enormous Commonwealth, on August 19, 1621, a Swedish army landed near Pärnu , carried by a fleet of 148 vessels . Gustav Adolf had 14,700 infantry, 3,150 cavalry and 375 cannons. Swedes immediately marched towards Riga, and besieged it on 29 August. The capital of Livonia was defended by a garrison of 300 soldiers, plus 3,700 armed residents. Lithuanian Field Hetman Krzysztof Radziwiłł had only 1,500 soldiers at his disposal, as most units were in Podolia and Red Ruthenia. Riga capitulated on September 25, after a month siege and three assaults. On October 2, Swedes captured the fortress of Dunamunde. The invaders, marching through marshes and forests to avoid Lithuanian cavalry, entered the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, capturing its capital, Mitau without resistance. Swedes then tried to capture the fortress of Koknese, but failed to do so, after a skirmish with Lithuanian cavalry of Aleksander Gosiewski. In early January 1622, the Swedes captured Valmiera, together with several smaller Livonian castles. Meanwhile, the forces under Hetman Radziwill grew to 3 000, which enabled the Lithuanians to seal several Swedish garrisons. On January 7, Radziwiłł recaptured Mitau, but for lack of artillery, he failed to seize its castle, whose garrison did not capitulate until July 6. A few weeks later, in late July 1622, main Swedish forces reached Mittau, and a prolonged battle ensued. Since the battle turned into a stalemate, on August 10, 1622, both sides signed a truce, which in 1623 was prolonged until March 1625. During the negotiations, envoys of Gustav Adolf suggested a Swedish-Lithuanian union. Answer this question based on the article: How many days after a Swedish army landed near Pärnu did the Swedes besiege Riga?","output":"The Swedish army landed near Pärnu on August 19, 1621, and besieged Riga on August 29, 1621. To calculate the number of days between these two events, we can follow these steps: 1. Find the difference in days between August 19 and August 29. Since both events occurred in the same month, we only need to subtract the day on which the Swedish army landed from the day they besieged Riga: 29 - 19 = 10 days. So it took 10 days for the Swedes to besiege Riga after landing near Pärnu."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Here are possible answers to this question: - bedsores - lay down - bed sores - sleep in - open the curtain  I believe the correct choice is \\"lay down\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"I agree that \\"lay down\\" is the appropriate option as the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed. Here's why: Laying down is the logical starting point for any activity related to staying in bed, as it involves positioning oneself comfortably on the bed in order to rest, relax, or sleep. Before planning to stay in bed, a person needs to ensure that they are comfortable, which requires them to lay down in a suitable position. Laying down signifies the initiation of the process of staying in bed and is often accompanied by adjusting pillows, blankets, and body posture. Now, let's discuss the other options briefly to understand why they are not suitable choices: 1. Bedsores: Bedsores, also known as pressure ulcers, are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. They typically occur in individuals who are bedridden or have limited mobility. Bedsores are not a preparatory action for staying in bed but rather an unfortunate outcome that may result from staying in bed too long without proper care. 2. Bed sores: This option is the same as bedsores and therefore can be disregarded for the same reasons mentioned above. 3. Sleep in: While \\"sleeping in\\" is often associated with staying in bed for an extended period, it is not the very first thing that someone does before planning to stay in bed. Rather, sleeping in is an activity that follows after laying down. It is the act of staying in bed for a longer duration than usual, often to catch up on rest or to have a leisurely morning. However, it is not the immediate step before staying in bed. 4. Open the curtain: Opening the curtain might be an action associated with waking up and starting the day or letting in natural light to improve the ambiance in the room. While it is an activity that could improve the overall experience of staying in bed, it is not the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed. Moreover, opening the curtain is not necessary for individuals who prefer to sleep or relax in a dim or dark room. In conclusion, among the given options, \\"lay down\\" is the most suitable choice as the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed. It marks the initial step of adjusting oneself comfortably on the bed, which is essential for activities like resting, relaxing, or sleeping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to store honey for it to last the longest?","output":"To store honey for the longest possible shelf life, follow these steps: 1. Choose the right container: Select a non-reactive, airtight container made from materials like glass or food-grade plastic. This will prevent any contamination or spoilage. Glass jars with airtight lids, such as mason jars or specialized honey jars, are ideal. 2. Store in a cool, dark place: Find a location away from direct sunlight, heat, and humidity, as these factors can degrade honey over time. A pantry or cupboard is a suitable choice. The ideal storage temperature for honey is between 50-70°F (10-21°C), as fluctuations in temperature can cause crystallization. 3. Ensure cleanliness: Prior to transferring the honey to the container, make sure both the container and any tools you use are clean and dry. This will help prevent the introduction of bacteria or moisture. 4. Seal the container tightly: After you fill the container with honey, make sure the lid is sealed tightly. This helps maintain freshness and prevent moisture or contaminants from entering. 5. Label the container: Write the date and type of honey on a label and attach it to the jar. This way, you can keep track of how long the honey has been in storage and what variety it is. 6. Avoid contamination: Each time you access the honey, use clean utensils and do not introduce any foreign substances, like crumbs or liquid. 7. Monitor the honey: Regularly check the honey for any signs of spoilage, such as off-odors, mold, or fermentation. In most cases, honey can last indefinitely if stored properly, so as long as it's not showing any signs of spoilage, it should be safe to consume. By following these steps, you can ensure that your honey is stored in the best way to last the longest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (lead vocals/drums), Todd Harrell (bass), and Matt Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals). They were soon joined by rhythm guitarist Chris Henderson. The band rose to international fame with their first single, \\"Kryptonite\\", which charted in the top three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. 3 Doors Down's first studio album, The Better Life, was released on February 8, 2000 and went on to become the 11th best-selling album of the year, selling over three million copies. It has since been certified 6x platinum, thanks in large part to the international hit singles, \\"Kryptonite\\", \\"Loser\\", and \\"Duck and Run\\". A fourth single, \\"Be Like That\\" was re-recorded for the 2001 film American Pie 2, with alternate lyrics for the first 3 lines. This version is known as \\"The American Pie 2 Edit\\". Whilst recording the album, Brad Arnold recorded both the vocal and drum parts. However, the band hired drummer Richard Liles for the tour in support of The Better Life so that Arnold could perform at the front of the stage. Liles left in late 2001.  The band's second studio album, Away from the Sun, was released on November 12, 2002 and went platinum within two months of release. The album also produced two hit singles, \\"When I'm Gone\\" and \\"Here Without You\\". The album has sold four million copies worldwide, including well over three million in the U.S. Session drummer Josh Freese was hired to record drums for the album. Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson produced and performed on three tracks for the record, \\"Dangerous Game\\", \\"Dead Love\\", and \\"Wasted Me\\", but only \\"Dangerous Game\\" would appear on the finished product. The band hired Canadian Daniel Adair to play drums for the Away From the Sun tour. He would go on to record the drums for the band's next studio release, and was with the band aboard the USS George Washington (CVN-73) to film the music video \\"When I'm Gone\\".  In 2003, 3 Doors Down released a live EP entitled Another 700 Miles consisting of recordings from a live performance by the band in Chicago, Illinois.

Please answer the following question: What are the names of the three habitats that are designated as a red-zone area?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays on the Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated to result from the £2.45 million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes near the end of the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes.

Question: Background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  Paragraph: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

Option E, taking medicine, would typically not be the course of action if the sick person is not being treated, as treatment usually involves medical guidance or intervention, which would likely include the administration of medication as required. Therefore, given the list of options, the one that best aligns with common sense is option A, get better. However, it is essential to understand that the best course of action when feeling sick is to seek medical advice and treatments, as leaving an illness untreated might lead to complications and unnecessary suffering in many cases."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: What river did the checklist come from?

Movie title: The Great Mouse Detective Context: In London, circa 1897, a young mouse named Olivia Flaversham is celebrating her birthday with her toymaker father, Hiram. Suddenly, a bat with a crippled wing and peg leg bursts into the Flaversham's workshop, kidnapping Hiram. Olivia searches to find the famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street, but gets lost. A surgeon named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who is returning from a lengthy service of the Mouse Queen's 66th Regiment in Afghanistan, stumbles upon Olivia, and escorts Olivia to Basil's residence. Upon their arrival at his residence, Basil is initially indifferent, but when Olivia mentions the peg-legged bat that kidnapped her father, Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, a henchman of Professor Ratigan, a villain Basil has been trying to arrest for years. It is then revealed that Professor Ratigan kidnapped Hiram to create a clockwork robot which mimics the Queen of the Mice so Ratigan can rule England. Hiram initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but gives in when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia. Ratigan then announces his plans to kill the Queen and become \\"supreme ruler of all mousedom\\" to his henchmen. Meanwhile, as Basil is deducing the case, Fidget appears through the window, scaring Olivia. They give chase as Basil finds Fidget's footprints, declaring that they purse him in order to find Hiram. Basil, along with Dawson and Olivia, takes Toby, Sherlock Holmes's pet Basset Hound, to track Fidget's scent, where they locate him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget then ambushes Olivia from inside a toy cradle and kidnaps her. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget, but become entangled and fall behind. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the Thames. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors and go into a tavern called the \\"Rat Trap\\" and follow Fidget to Ratigan's headquarters. They are caught, and Ratigan has his hooligans tie...

Passage:Following the death of military dictator and de facto ruler of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha in 1998, his successor General Abdusalami Abubakar initiated the transition which heralded Nigeria's return to democratic rule in 1999. The ban on political activities was lifted, and political prisoners were released from detention facilities. The constitution was styled after the ill-fated Second Republic — which saw the Westminster system of government jettisoned for an American Presidential system. Political parties were formed (People's Democratic Party (PDP), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), and Alliance for Democracy (AD)), and elections were set for April 1999. In the widely monitored 1999 election, former military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo was elected on the PDP platform.

Merge the two lists; the one with alphabetical items first followed by the one with numerical items. Let's follow these instructions to solve the example: First, we create two empty lists: one for storing the alphabetical elements and another for storing the numerical elements. \`\`\`python alpha_elems = [] num_elems = [] \`\`\` Next, we loop through each item in the given list.

Question: Process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways -   Question: suppose the bat is unaware of its surroundings happens, how will it affect STRONGER echolocation.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Echolocation is a biological sonar system used by certain animals, including bats, to navigate and find food in the dark by producing sounds that bounce off objects and return as echoes. If a bat is unaware of its surroundings, it may use echolocation more vigorously, resulting in a STRONGER echolocation effect.  When the bat produces a high-pitched tone, this sound travels in waves the same way light does. These sound waves radiate out from the bat and interact with the environment around it. When they strike an object in the bat's path, they are reflected back towards the bat. This bounced sound is the echo, which is perceived by the bat and processed in its brain to gain awareness about its environment.  If the bat is unaware of its surroundings, which could be due to various factors such as a novel environment, distraction, or temporarily impaired senses, it may need to produce higher frequency and louder sounds to compensate for the lack of knowledge and ensure it doesn’t collide with obstacles or miss potential prey. This would result in a more intense or stronger echolocation.  The second effect mentioned is the reflection or the \\"bouncing off\\" of sound waves from a nearby object. In a scenario where the bat is unaware of its surroundings, this reflection of sound waves would be more crucial for the bat to successfully navigate and hunt. It would need higher resolution information on obstacles and prey in the environment, and thus the bounced sound waves would need to be more accurately caught and interpreted.  This is dependent on the strength of the returned sound waves, which is determined by the intensity of the initially emitted sound. Thus, if the bat produces stronger echolocation sounds, the returned sound waves would be stronger, leading to a stronger echo effect.  In summary, if the bat is unaware of its surroundings, it would have a more pronounced or stronger echolocation as it would need to compensate for the lack of knowledge by emitting a higher frequency and or louder sounds for better and more accurate interpretation of the surroundings. Hence, this supposed perturbation will have a 'more' effect.    Then, the effect of the echo or bounced sound waves would also be increased. Since the bat would rely more heavily on the reflection of the sound waves, it would capture and interpret these returned sound waves more intensively than usual, leading to an increased second effect of echolocation. Hence, the perturbation would also result in a 'more' effect on the second effect mentioned."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Vulture spots the bizarre story in a longer New York Times article about Harvey Weinstein and the Sunday premiere of the Weinstein Company's film about the Hurricane Sandy relief concert. It seems the prince offered to make a generous contribution to the relief fund if Stewart would chat with him, and Weinstein eventually convinced her to do so. \\"How much?\\" Stewart asked, in Weinstein's telling of the story. Weinstein went back to the prince, got a number, and then talked him up to half a mil—which the prince gave him upfront, in cash. \\"And Kristen sits with the guy for 15 minutes,\\" Weinstein says. But things may not be going so well for Stewart: She has a strange bald spot, and the Daily Mail concludes it's because she's so stressed about her breakup with Robert Pattinson. The Stir thinks there's probably a more reasonable explanation, like a nutrient deficiency or even just a bad photo angle. Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a famous actress named Kristen Stewart. She was very popular, and many people liked her a lot. One day, a prince from a faraway land in the Middle East heard about Kristen and thought it would be wonderful to talk to her. But, he had a special wish – he would give 500,000 to a group of people who were trying to help others after a big storm called Hurricane Sandy if he could talk to Kristen for just 15 minutes. A man named Harvey Weinstein, who made movies, heard about the prince's wish. He went to Kristen and told her about the prince's generous offer. Kristen asked, \\"How much money will the prince give?\\" Harvey talked to the prince and said that the prince had to give half a million dollars for the chance to talk to Kristen. The prince agreed and gave Harvey the money in cash right away. So, Kristen sat down and spoke with the prince for 15 minutes, just like he wanted. Harvey said, \\"And Kristen sits with the guy for 15 minutes.\\" And one might wonder, was Kristen sad during this time? You see, Kristen was having a tough time because she and her boyfriend, Robert Pattinson, broke up. People even thought Kristen had a bald spot on her head because she was so stressed about the breakup. But some people thought there might be a different reason for Kristen's bald spot, like maybe she didn't have enough nutrients in her body or maybe the picture that was taken of her was just from a bad angle. No matter what, Kristen showed that she could be friendly and have a conversation with someone, like the prince, even when things weren't so easy for her.

Question: Information:  - The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China, and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China (CPC). The war began in August 1927, with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major hostilities ceased in 1950. It can generally be divided into two stages; the first being from 1927 to 1937, and the second being from 1946 to 1950 with the Second Sino-Japanese War separating them. The war was a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the CPC gaining control of almost the entirety of Mainland China, establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) to replace the KMT's Republic of China (ROC). It also caused a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all of China.  - University College London (UCL) is a public research university in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. It is the largest postgraduate institution in the UK by enrollment and is regarded as one of the world's leading multidisciplinary research universities. Established in 1826 as London University by founders inspired by the radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university institution to be established in London, and the first in England to be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their religion. UCL also makes the contested claims of being the third-oldest university in England and the first to admit women. In 1836 UCL became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London, which was granted a royal charter in the same year. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014). UCL has its main campus in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London and a satellite campus in Doha, Qatar. UCL is organised into 11 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL operates several culturally significant museums and manages collections in a wide range of fields, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and administers the annual Orwell Prize in political writing. In 2015/16, UCL had around 38,300 students and 12,000 staff (including around 7,100 academic staff and 840 professors) and had a total income of £1.36 billion, of which £530 million was from research grants and contracts.

She is introduced to the Chicago apartment by Max, (Gil McKinney) the landlord, and immediately begins to feel her sister's presence. She meets Max's little sister, Rose, and she somehow knows that Rose is in touch with the dead and can communicate with Toshio, Naoko's nephew. She also meets Lisa (Johanna Braddy) and they quickly become friends, and they meet other residents of the apartment, including Gretchen, (Marina Sirtis) who is an artist. Lisa begins to grow frightened when she realizes her younger sister Rose is seeing a dead boy all around the apartment.Naoko is observed throughout the apartment by Kayako, her sister, but Kayako never actually kills Naoko, quite possibly because she still loves her sister. Later that day, Lisa encounters Toshio, who makes her jump. When asking him what he is doing in the apartment, Toshio vanishes leaving Lisa bewildered. A girl is killed when Kayako's hands pull her into her bathtub and drown her.

The films revolve around a curse created by the violent death of a person, which is passed on to anyone who enters the haunted location where the incident occurred. Takeo Saeki plays a significant role in the creation of the curse. In the story, Takeo Saeki, a jealous husband, murders his wife, Kayako, and their son, Toshio, in a fit of rage after discovering Kayako's unrequited love for another man. This violent act sets off the curse and leads to the formation of the vengeful spirits of Kayako and Toshio, who haunt the Saeki family home and kill anyone who enters the house. As for \\"The Grudge 3\\", it is the third installment of the American version of the Ju-on series, following the story of Jake Kimble, a survivor from the previous film, who is now institutionalized due to his traumatic experiences. The film introduces Kayako's sister, Naoko, who tries to stop the curse from spreading by traveling to America and performing a ritual to appease the spirits. As you are trying to decide whether or not to invest in this film proposal, there are several factors you might want to consider. First, it is important to evaluate the potential market and reception of the film. Since \\"The Grudge\\" franchise has a dedicated fan base and the American adaptations have garnered substantial box office success, there's a possibility that \\"The Grudge 3\\" could continue this trend. Second, consider the creative team and talent involved in the project. Assess the director, screenwriter, and cast members to determine if they hold potential to bring forth a successful adaptation, consistent with the legacy of the previous films.  Third, evaluate the production budget. While horror movies tend to have lower budgets compared to other genres, it's crucial to ensure that the funds allocated are sufficient to achieve high production values, especially in terms of visual and practical effects, for the supernatural and horror elements to be truly captivating. Moreover, consider the current market trends in the entertainment industry. Over recent years, successful horror films have evolved, incorporating social themes, commentary, and psychological elements. Assess if \\"The Grudge 3\\" could cater to these changing preferences while maintaining loyal fans from previous installments. In conclusion, Takeo Saeki, a pivotal character in the Ju-on series, is directly responsible for the curse that emanates from the violent murder of his wife, Kayako, and son, Toshio. When deciding whether to invest in \\"The Grudge 3\\", consider factors such as the potential market and reception, the creative team and talent involved, the overall production budget, and current trends in the horror genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.  and the situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs.  Answer the following question: Which chair has a lower air pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"The red chair, which Patrick sits on, has a lower air pressure. Here's an explanation: Both chairs are identical except for their color, so we can assume they have the same initial volume, temperature, and pressure. When Mark, who weighs more than Patrick, sits on the green chair, he exerts more force on it, compressing the air inside the chair to a greater extent than Patrick compresses the air in the red chair.  According to Boyle's law, when the volume of a gas decreases (due to compression from the heavier weight), the pressure inside the gas increases, given that the temperature remains constant. As Mark compresses the green chair more than Patrick compresses the red chair, the air pressure inside the green chair will be higher compared to the air pressure in the red chair. Hence, the red chair has a lower air pressure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

They are popular with the US military, who uses them to minimize American casualties and spy. (Click here to read about the civilian toll of US drones in Pakistan)","output":"Title: Iran Unveils its First Domestically Built Unmanned Bomber Drone, Karrar Introduction: Following yesterday's developments in nuclear reactors, Iran has revealed its first domestically manufactured unmanned bomber drone. This 13-foot-long aircraft, given the name Karrar or striker, is set to carry up to four cruise missiles and is said to have a range of 620 miles. Although this isn't far enough to reach Israel, it shows Iran's progress in military technology. Unmanned drones are becoming increasingly significant in modern conflicts, and Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, emphasizes that the Karrar is a step towards self-sufficiency.  Iran's President's Message: During the unveiling, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed that the Karrar drone was an \\"ambassador of death for the enemies of humanity,\\" but also a message of \\"peace and friendship.\\" He further boasted that the missile would help keep the enemy \\"paralyzed in its bases\\" and that it was an essential part of Iran's efforts in achieving self-sufficiency. While the drone isn't capable of reaching Israel, the development surely put Iran's other adversaries on alert. Increasing Importance of Unmanned Drones in Modern Conflicts: The deployment of unmanned drones has risen steadily in modern warfare, especially among the US military. They are primarily focussed on minimizing the casualties of American soldiers, as well as providing intelligence and surveillance. Drones are valuable assets to possess in conflict situations, and Iran's progress in this field will undoubtedly draw attention from military powers around the world. Though there are concerns about their impact on civilian populations, drones have proven to be an essential tool for modern military endeavors. Reports of the civilian toll of US drones in Pakistan have sparked debates on the ethics of drone usage in conflicts; however, it is undeniable that drones have changed the way wars are fought. Conclusion: Iran's unveiling of its first domestically built unmanned bomber drone, the 13-foot-long Karrar, showcases the country's advancements in military technology. As a part of Iran's aim to achieve self-sufficiency, the drone reflects the nation's commitment to staying competitive in the ever-changing landscape of modern warfare. With unmanned drones becoming increasingly important in conflict situations, Iran's development of the Karrar is a significant milestone for the country, even if it cannot reach Israel's borders. The rise of unmanned drones continues to alter the dynamics of warfare, and Iran's entry into this field is sure to send ripples throughout the international community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals   and pour thick flour   over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat   but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure   to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. The answer to this question is:","output":"Which of the following statements best describes the role of a Foley artist in the film industry? A) A Foley artist is responsible for managing and coordinating the film actors on set. B) A Foley artist creates and records sound effects that are added to films after filming is completed. C) A Foley artist is responsible for designing and creating the physical sets used in film production. D) A Foley artist works closely with the director to develop the visual aesthetics of a film. Answer: B) A Foley artist creates and records sound effects that are added to films after filming is completed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this: Technically, all these coins are still legal tender at face value, though some are far more valuable today for their numismatic value, and for gold and silver coins, their precious metal value. From 1965 to 1970 the Kennedy half dollar was the only circulating coin with any silver content, which was removed in 1971 and replaced with cupronickel. However, since 1992, the U.S. Mint has produced special Silver Proof Sets in addition to the regular yearly proof sets with silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars in place of the standard copper-nickel versions. In addition, an experimental 4.00 (Stella) coin was also minted in 1879, but never placed into circulation, and is properly considered to be a pattern rather than an actual coin denomination. What are gold and silver coins valuable for now adays? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Gold and silver coins are valuable nowadays for two main reasons: their numismatic value and their precious metal value.  Numismatic value means that the coins are worth more because they are rare, old, or have special designs, and collectors like to collect and pay more for them.  Precious metal value means that the coins are worth more because they are made of gold and silver, which are valuable metals. People like to buy gold and silver coins to keep them as an investment or as a form of savings because the price of these metals can go up over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The offering is expected to go live later this month in invitation-only beta. The options for the service include unlimited streaming and four DVDs a month from Redbox's kiosks for 8 a month, and 9 for the same deal with Blu-ray discs.      Though Redbox didn't mention it in a press release announcing the plan, AllThingsD reports that there will also be a 6 option for unlimited streaming only — less than the 7.99 Netflix currently charges. You can also buy and rent videos online from Redbox.      Reps from Redbox could not be reached for comment.      Redbox's content is drawn from Epix, whose selections include Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Hugo and Captain America among its new titles and classics like Apocalypse Now and Footloose. Other content will come from Warner Bros.' older selections.      Verizon and Redbox, a unit of Coinstar, joined forces in February.      Redbox isn't the first to take on Netflix in streaming. Amazon offers streaming as part of its 79 Amazon Prime membership. However, Amazon scrapped a plan to challenge Netflix more directly with a 7.99 monthly option. ||||| The Redbox Verizon Movie Service Is Almost Ready to Take On Netflix      Here comes the next video service that wants to take on Netflix: Redbox and Verizon are finally ready to launch their long-awaited joint venture.      Well, almost ready: “Redbox Instant by Verizon” will go into an invitation-only beta launch this month, and the official push won’t start until next year.      Still, this means the company is officially unveiling its offering. Which is exactly what we told you it would be: A service that’s supposed to offer some streaming video, a la Netflix, and some movies via DVD, a la the old Netflix and the curent RedBox. And the ability to buy and rent individual movies online, like iTunes and Amazon.      The basic offer: 8 a month for a selection of streaming movies and the ability to rent up to 4 DVDs a month from Redboxes’ kiosks, plus an online store where you can buy or rent newer movies.      If you don’t want to or can’t use the Redbox kiosks, you can go for a streaming-only option for 6. If you want to rent Blu-ray discs, that’s 9 a month.      Like Netflix and Amazon, Redbox has a deal with Epix, which means you’ll get newish movies like “Thor,” along with some big titles like “The Hunger Games,” after they’ve been available for rental and on pay TV. It also has a similar deal for older movies from Warner Bros., which hasn’t cut deals with Netflix or Amazon (yet).      But the joint venture won’t have the deeper catalog titles its competitors have built up. And it has pretty much ignored the TV titles that Netflix in particular has concentrated on in recent years.      On the other hand, it will have an online store where you can rent and buy movies, which Netflix doesn’t offer — because, says CEO Reed Hastings, everyone else does. Though this store will be different from those run by other online retailers like Amazon and iTunes: For whatever reason, the company hasn’t signed on all of the studios, so there will be notable gaps from the likes of Disney and Sony. (Update: Redbox Instant says it does have a deal with Sony, after all.)      So basically: Costs about the same as Netflix, without some of the stuff people like about Netflix, with other stuff Netflix doesn’t have.      Is that compelling enough to take market share away from Hastings? We’ll have to wait some time to see, but it’s worth noting that Amazon and Hulu, which have been at this for a while, have yet to make a real dent.      In the meantime, the most interesting thing about Redbox Instant is what it could be, one day, if Verzion wants to push it. The service isn’t confined to Verizon’s fiber or wireless footprint, which means it could truly make it a national video service, if it wants to commit the resources. So far this looks more like a toe in the water than anything else. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Redbox Instant by Verizon is set to challenge Netflix in the streaming video market with a new service starting at just 6 a month. The offering will begin an invitation-only beta launch this month and is expected to provide unlimited streaming and four DVD rentals per month from Redbox's kiosks for 8 a month or 9 with Blu-ray discs. The content will be sourced from Epix and include films like Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Hugo, and Captain America, as well as selections from Warner Bros.' older collection. This joint venture between Verizon and Redbox's parent company, Coinstar, aims to potentially take market share from Netflix; however, it is still unclear how much of an impact this new offering will have on the existing competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer expresses a high level of dissatisfaction and frustration with the service received.  Several elements contribute to the negative sentiment: 1. The use of intense negative words and phrases: Words such as \\"HORRIBLE\\", \\"did not bother\\", \\"Really?!!\\", \\"They LIED!\\", \\"ruined\\", and \\"shiny crap\\" all underline the author's strong negative feelings. 2. Expressions of disappointment: The reviewer displayed disappointment in multiple aspects of the service. First, the service provider did not follow the instructions specified (\\"They were told NO vinyl protectant on the interior\\"). Second, the effort to correct the mistake with a promise that the substance would be gone when dried proved to be false (\\"they wiped it down with something else to take it off and we were told it be gone when it dried. They LIED!\\").  3. Accusations of misconduct: The accusations add to the strong negative sentiment. The reviewer accuses the service provider of not reading the ticket correctly (\\"person wiping the car down did not bother to read the ticket\\") and dishonesty (\\"They LIED!\\"). 4. Consequences of the service: Use of words like \\"my interior is ruined\\" indicates the serious impact of the service on the product (car's interior). 5. Overall evaluation: The review closes with a negative summary judgment, reinforcing the negative sentiment of the message (\\"These people do not READ tickets and they LIE!\\"). In a nutshell, this review strongly conveys disappointment, frustration, and dissatisfaction coming from a negative experience the customer had with the service provider."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Syndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement than in a suture. An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. The amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers.

The reviewer expresses enthusiasm and satisfaction about various aspects of the dining experience, including the quality of the dishes they ordered (short rib, pork belly and clams, bone marrow, and crème brûlée), the great service, and the overall enjoyable experience. The reviewer's positive sentiment is evident through the use of enthusiastic language like \\"loved,\\" \\"yummy,\\" \\"great,\\" and \\"awesome.\\" Additionally, the fact that they chose to return to the establishment the next day for another dining experience, even after the initial disappointment, further underscores their overall satisfaction and positive feelings towards the place. The word \\"glad\\" also emphasizes that their return visit reaffirmed their initial positive impressions of the establishment and justified their decision to go back. The sentiment dips slightly into the negative when the reviewer mentions their disappointment about the kitchen closing early one night at around  9:30-10 pm. This event prevented them from having the desired dining experience at their hotel. However, it is important to note that the mention of disappointment is brief and confined to this particular challenge with the scheduling.

Context: Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support.

Why did India banned 500, 1000 rupee notes? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"I will focus on the two main questions: 1. Why did Modi ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes? 2. Do the two questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Understand and clarify the queries. Both questions are related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India. Step 2: Research and gather information. In November 2016, the Indian government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announced the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. Step 3: Identify the reasons for demonetization. The primary reasons for demonetization were: a. Combatting corruption: High denomination notes were often used to store and move unaccounted-for cash, which facilitated corruption and the generation of \\"black money.\\" b. Tackling tax evasion: Many people stored their wealth in cash to avoid paying taxes. By banning high-denomination notes, the government aimed to reduce tax evasion. c. Curb counterfeit currency: Fake currency notes posed a risk to the economy and were sometimes used for illicit activities, such as funding terrorism. The demonetization helped curb the circulation of counterfeit currency by replacing old notes with new designs featuring enhanced security features. d. Encouraging digital transactions: Removing high-value cash from the economy helped promote the use of digital transactions, which are more transparent and traceable. Step 4: Establish the relationship between the two questions. Both questions are related to the same topic – the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India in 2016, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The first question asks why Modi made the decision, while the second question asks about India as a whole. Step 5: Answer the questions. 1. Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India to combat corruption, reduce tax evasion, curb counterfeit currency, and encourage digital transactions. 2. Although the two questions have a slightly different focus (Modi's role in the first and India as a whole in the second), they essentially have the same meaning, as they both seek to understand the reasons for the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see.

You have to determine whether the Head can be hindered by what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, hindering introduces hindrances that obstruct the natural path to the achievement of a goal. For example, the event PersonX adopts a cat can be obstructed if PersonX is allergic to cats. Classify your answers into \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\". The phrase may also contain \\"___\\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person,  and/or an action. Input: Head: PersonX babysits PersonX's nephew<sep>Tail: to give a commitment to babysitting their nephew Output:","output":"In this task, you have to determine if the Head event can be hindered by the Tail event. Follow these simple steps: 1. Read and understand the Head and Tail events given in the input. 2. Identify the subject (PersonX) and any other participants (PersonY, PersonZ, etc.) in both events. 3. Determine if the Tail event poses a potential obstruction or difficulty for the Head event to be accomplished. 4. If the Tail event hinders the Head event, classify your answer as \\"Yes.\\" Otherwise, classify your answer as \\"No.\\" For the given input: Input: Head: PersonX babysits PersonX's nephew<sep>Tail: to give a commitment to babysitting their nephew Steps: 1.

You can also call the ada's 24-hour, toll-free number to listen to recorded information or to order information pertaining to disability rights over the phone.","output":"Knowing and exercising your rights as a person with a disability is crucial to ensuring that you are treated fairly and have access to the proper accommodations and resources you need to lead an independent life. Becoming informed about your rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and knowing how to access and utilize the available resources is paramount. First, it's essential to understand what the ADA is. The ADA is a civil rights law that was enacted in 1990 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in areas including employment, public accommodations, transportation, telecommunications, and state and local government services. This law covers a wide range of disabilities, from mobility and sensory impairments to cognitive and learning disabilities. To know and exercise your rights, follow these steps: 1. Order copies of free ADA materials: Visit the U.S. Department of Justice's ADA website (www.ada.gov) to find various materials, including booklets, guides, and fact sheets, all designed to educate people with disabilities about their rights and responsibilities. Download and study these materials to understand the full range of your rights under the ADA. 2. Call the ADA hotline: You can also call the ADA's 24-hour, toll-free number at 1-800-514-0301 (for voice calls) or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY for people with hearing impairments) to listen to recorded information or order printed information over the phone. The ADA Information Line is staffed with specialists who can answer specific questions and provide general information about the ADA. 3. Visit ADA National Network: The ADA National Network (adata.org) provides various resources, tools, and training materials to help individuals and organizations understand and comply with the ADA. Browse through their website and take advantage of the free resources available on different topics, including housing, employment, education, and accessibility. 4. Reach out to local disability organizations: Many local disability advocacy groups, independent living centers, vocational rehabilitation agencies, and other non-profit organizations offer a range of services tailored to individuals with disabilities. These services can include assistance with accessing resources, connecting with support networks, and identifying appropriate accommodations. 5. Know your rights in specific sectors: Understand your rights in various settings, such as employment, education, and healthcare. For instance, under Title I of the ADA, employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees or job applicants with disabilities. Learn about the processes of requesting accommodations and filing complaints if you face discrimination. 6. Be proactive about accessibility concerns: If you encounter an inaccessible location, service, or communication, document the situation and bring your concerns to the attention of the responsible party (e.g., the business owner, service provider, or government agency). Speak with them about the ADA requirements and potential solutions for increasing accessibility in their establishment. 7. File complaints if necessary: If you believe your rights under the ADA have been violated, you can file a complaint with the appropriate government agency responsible for enforcing the law. The U.S. Department of Justice maintains jurisdiction over Title II (state and local governments) and Title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) of the ADA. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title I of the ADA (employment) regarding private and state or local government employers. By taking these steps, you can ensure that you are informed about your rights as a person with a disability and can advocate for yourself in various situations. Being proactive about understanding the ADA and accessing the available resources will empower you to live a full and independent life without limitations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today is May Day!\\" my sister announced. \\"Do you remember the May Day baskets we used to make with colored paper and paste?\\" I recalled that my sisters and I would run around our neighborhood delivering the baskets brimming with spring flowers. We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them. I clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade. Her interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house. When my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, \\"Absolutely not!\\" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. \\"But Pam was my very best friend ever,\\" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket. It was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness. As we watched from our hiding place, Pam picked up the flowers, and said loudly enough for us to hear, \\"Thank you, Susie, I hoped you wouldn't forget me!\\".

Step 4: Research on strawberry seed dispersal - Strawberries primarily rely on animals, like birds or mammals, to consume their fruit and later disperse seeds through their droppings. Another method of seed dispersal for strawberries is their external seeds (achenes) sticking to fur or feathers, thus being carried away and eventually deposited in a new area.

He meets Kirina in the hotel lounge, and they have a one-night stand. Kirina is approached by Kinjo and two ninjas. Kirina shows no fear and Kinjo, the leader of a cult of ninja assassins and grants her final wish by showing his face. Paul returns and hides in the foyer while calling the police. When Kinjo decapitates Kirina, Paul tries to come to her defense and then tries to flee. Enraged that someone has seen his face, Kinjo's men stab Paul, hit him with a poisoned shuriken and slash his throat, leaving him for dead. Paul awakes in a hospital room, but his claims of seeing Kinjo are met with disbelief by the police. Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away. Leaving the city, Takeda uses Paul as bait to draw Kinjo out, leading to a battle on the train where several passenger cars of innocent people are slaughtered by the ninjas. Takeda and Mieko defeat the attackers, but Kinjo was not among them. The ninja leading the attack was Junko, Kinjo's lover, giving Kinjo motivation to kill Paul and Takeda.

The band consists of Brody Dalle (the Distillers), Tony Bevilacqua (the Distillers), Jack Irons (What Is This?, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Walk the Moon, Eleven, Pearl Jam) and Alain Johannes (What Is This?, Walk the Moon, Eleven, Queens of the Stone Age, Them Crooked Vultures). The band has been inactive since 2010 and its future is uncertain. Hypothesis: Spinnerette might come back","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is difficult to definitively confirm or disprove the hypothesis that Spinnerette might come back. The paragraph states that Spinnerette has been inactive since 2010, and the future of the band remains uncertain. However, it is worth considering a few factors that could influence the likelihood of a reunion: 1. Members' involvement in other projects: It is clear that the members of Spinnerette have been part of multiple bands and projects in their respective careers. For instance, Jack Irons has been a member of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and several other bands, while Alain Johannes has been associated with Queens of the Stone Age and Them Crooked Vultures. The fact that they have diverse musical interests and professional commitments may reduce the likelihood of the band reuniting in the foreseeable future. 2. Time since inactivity: Spinnerette has been inactive for over a decade, which could diminish the prospect of a reunion. As time passes, the members may become more invested in their individual projects, and the level of nostalgia associated with the band may decrease for both the members and their audience. 3. Personal relationships between band members: The paragraph does not provide any information on the personal dynamics between the members of Spinnerette. The relationships between band members can have a significant impact on the possibility of a reunion. For example, if the members parted on amicable terms and maintain positive relationships, the chances of a reunion could be higher. Conversely, if conflicts arose between the members, the likelihood of a comeback may be diminished. 4. Demand from fans and the music industry:  The desire of fans for a Spinnerette reunion may play a role in determining the likelihood of a comeback. If there is a significant demand for new music or performances from the band, this could encourage the members to consider reuniting. Similarly, interest from record labels or other industry stakeholders could serve as a motive for a reunion. In conclusion, while the paragraph does not provide enough information to confirm or disprove the hypothesis, there are several factors to consider when evaluating the likelihood of Spinnerette reuniting in the future. These factors include the members' involvement in other projects, the time since the band's inactivity, personal relationships between band members, and demand from fans and the music industry. Each of these factors could influence the probability of a reunion, either positively or negatively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The word \\"ionize\\" refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds which form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.The word radiation arises from the phenomenon of waves radiating (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that are applicable to all types of radiation. Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.  A scientists has discovered two new types of radiation. He notes that radiation type A has the ability to break away atoms from molecules, while radiation type B simply causes them to vibrate.  Which radiation type will have a longer wavelength, radiation type A or B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Radiation type B will have a longer wavelength. Step 1: Identify the properties of the two types of radiation. - Radiation type A: Breaks away atoms from molecules (higher energy) - Radiation type B: Causes atoms to vibrate (lower energy) Step 2: Recognize the relationship between energy and wavelength. In the electromagnetic spectrum, higher energy radiation has shorter wavelengths, while lower energy radiation has longer wavelengths. Step 3: Compare the energies of the two types of radiation. Since radiation type A breaks away atoms from molecules, it has higher energy than radiation type B, which only causes vibrations. Step 4: Determine which radiation type has a longer wavelength based on their energies. As radiation type B has lower energy than radiation type A, its wavelength will be longer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Aluminosilicates are formed by replacing some of the Si atoms in silicates by Al atoms; aluminosilicates with threedimensional framework structures are called zeolites. Nitrides formed by reacting silicon or germanium with nitrogen are strong, hard, and chemically inert. The hydrides become thermodynamically less stable down the group. Moreover, as atomic size increases, multiple bonds between or to the group 14 elements become weaker.

Summarize the following: Choose stilettos in your size and put them on. Try to raise your heels up 1 inch (2.5 cm). You should be able to do this comfortably if the shoes fit properly. Your toes shouldn't feel pinched and there should be no gap between the arch of the shoe and your feet. If you're buying stilettos, place them on a flat surface and tap the sides. The shoes shouldn't wobble or fall over. Consider purchasing stilettos made of a material, such as leather, that will stretch slightly. Before you break in a new pair of stilettos or while you're getting used to walking in your pair, place toe gels, moleskin insoles, arch supports, heel pads, or blister strips into the shoes. These will cushion your feet and prevent rubbing that could cause painful calluses. If you're not sure where to put insoles or supports, wear the stilettos for about 5 minutes and pay attention to wear the shoes are hurting your feet. Use duct or medical tape to wrap your third and fourth toes together. This will reduce the amount of pressure on the nerve between these two toes. Remove the tape when you take your stilettos off and stretch your toes. It's easy to think that once you get used to wearing high heels, you can purchase a new pair of stilettos and wear them right out. Since each pair of shoes is different, your feet need a chance to adjust to the material, fit, and feel of the shoes. Wear them around the house until they feel comfortable. Then you can wear them out. It's fine to wear stilettos on carpet or rugs in your house. The point is to get your feet used to how the shoes feel. If you're planning on wearing stilettos to the office or a social event, have a comfortable pair of shoes ready to change into if your feet start hurting. You can also take breaks and change back into your stilettos throughout the day. For example, commute in comfortable flats and change into stilettos when you arrive at the event or office. Rest your feet after wearing stilettos. Fill a small basin or bath with water and dissolve some Epsom salt in it. Then soak your feet for up to 20 minutes. Once you get your feet out of the water, dry them and massage moisturizer into your feet. To massage your feet, use your thumbs to rub the balls of your feet using a circular motion. Then massage towards the heels of your feet. Do this as much as you like. Summary:","output":"Choosing the right size and fit of stilettos is crucial for comfort. The shoes should allow you to lift your heels by an inch without pinching at the toes or creating a gap under the arch. Make sure they are stable when tapped on the sides. Consider materials like leather that slightly stretch for better fit and comfort. To prevent calluses, consider using foot cushions like toe gels, moleskin insoles, arch supports, and others. To minimize pressure, you can tape your third and fourth toes together. Each new pair of stilettos requires an adjustment period, so wear them around the house first before going out. Alternate with comfortable shoes during an event or work for relief. After wearing stilettos, soak your feet in Epsom salt water, dry them, and massage with moisturizer for relief."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Despite being told by our waitress that The Penguin had NOT changed hands, one taste of the food proved otherwise. The fries that used to be batter dipped and fried to perfection were greasy and tasted of rank oil. A table of five people couldn't manage to stomach one side order of them.   The pimento cheese and fried pickles on my Pimp Dog were ice cold. I expected gooey melting cheese and fresh out of the deep fryer pickles...the \\"chef\\" had other ideas.

Movie title: The China Syndrome Context: While visiting the (fictional) Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells (Fonda), her cameraman Richard Adams (Douglas) and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief. Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least 20 million. Godell confronts D.B.

Humans have just discovered the ability to asexually reproduce if they wish. Some people choose to use this option, but others still sexually reproduce. Billy was born by asexual reproduction and his parent has a genetic disease called Horkrumatis. Jimmy was born by sexual reproduction and one of his parents has the same genetic disease as Billy's parents.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which child is less likely to have Horkrumatis?  Hint: The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes. A:","output":"Jimmy is less likely to have Horkrumatis. Step 1: Analyze the information provided. - Billy is born through asexual reproduction, meaning he has an exact copy of his parent's DNA. - Jimmy is born through sexual reproduction, meaning he has a combination of DNA from both parents. Step 2: Consider the genetic disease Horkrumatis. - Both Billy's parent and one of Jimmy's parents have the disease. Step 3: Analyze the potential inheritance of the disease for each child. - Billy, being an exact copy of his parent, will have the gene that causes Horkrumatis. - Jimmy has a 50% chance of inheriting the Horkrumatis gene from the affected parent, as he receives a mix of genes. Step 4: Compare likelihoods - Since Billy will definitely have the Horkrumatis gene and Jimmy only has a 50% chance of inheriting it, Jimmy is less likely to have Horkrumatis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The three go missing, but a year later their footage is found in a bag inexplicably buried under an abandoned 100-year-old house.According to legend, the Blair Witch is the ghost of Elly Kedward of the late 1700s, whom several children accused of luring them into her home to draw blood from them. Kedward is found guilty of witchcraft, banished from the village during a particularly harsh winter, and presumed dead. By midwinter, all of Kedward's accusers, along with half of the town's children, vanish. Fearing a curse, the townspeople flee Blair and vow never to utter Elly Kedward's name again.In 1825, 11 witnesses testify to seeing a pale woman's hand reach up and pull ten-year-old Eileen Treacle into Tappy East Creek.

Q: what does the narrator think about the caller ?","output":"Based on the given choices, it is most likely that the narrator is unsure or skeptical about the caller's statement. The narrator's response \\"Are you serious?\\" could indicate a suspicion that the caller might be exaggerating their condition or not being entirely truthful. However, without any explicit mention of their thoughts, it is difficult to definitively state what the narrator thinks of the caller. To provide a more thorough analysis, let us examine the context surrounding the caller's statement and the narrator's response: 1. The caller claims to be \\"so weak and tired\\" to the point where they can \\"barely see.\\"    - If this is true, it would stand that the caller is experiencing severe fatigue or weakness and would be unable to perform daily tasks such as going to the store. This could be attributed to an illness, exhaustion, or a potentially serious medical condition. In such cases, the narrator would likely be concerned for the caller's well-being. 2. The narrator's response, \\"Are you serious?\\", can have various implications. Here are a few potential interpretations:    a. The narrator could be genuinely concerned about the caller's well-being and shocked by the severity of their condition. In this case, \\"Are you serious?\\" might be an expression of disbelief or worry, prompting the caller to provide more information or confirm the severity of their condition.    b. The narrator could be implying that the caller is lying or exaggerating. This could be due to past instances where the caller has made false or exaggerated claims, leading the narrator to question their truthfulness.     c. The narrator could be sarcastic or dismissive, reflecting a perception that the caller is not actually as weak and tired as they claim to be. This could be due to the narrator's own temperament or a lack of empathy or understanding of the caller's situation. Considering the available choices: I. None of the above choices: The narrator could have a different perspective or understanding of the situation, but given the limited information provided, it cannot be derived. II. That he (the caller) is responsible: This choice suggests that the narrator thinks the caller brought the situation upon themselves, but this is not explicitly indicated in their response. III. That he (the caller) is lying: This is a possible interpretation, as the narrator's response \\"Are you serious?\\" could imply doubt about the caller's truthfulness. IV. That he (the caller) is truthful: This could also be a possibility if the narrator is interpreting \\"Are you serious?\\" as a genuine expression of surprise or concern for the caller's well-being. In conclusion, based on the information provided and the narrator's response, it cannot be definitively ascertained what the narrator thinks of the caller. However, the most likely options are that the narrator is either skeptical or genuinely concerned about the caller's well-being.

Mimi took frequent trips to the doctor's office.  and a hint : Hemophilia is the name of a group of hereditary diseases that affect the body's ability to control blood clotting. Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets. Since people with hemophilia cannot produce clots, any cut can put a person at risk of bleeding to death. The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.

D.C. election board prints upside-down flag on voter guide Elections officials changed their account late Thursday of how an upside-down flag came to be printed on the front of the official D.C. voter guide sent to hundreds of thousands of city households. On Thursday morning, the D.C. Board of Elections said the upside-down flag was part of a conscious ploy to generate voter interest in the election. But at around the same time, the board’s executive director told the D.C. Council that the graphic was an “error.” A staff member to D.C. Council member Kenyan McDuffie (D-Ward 5) inquired about the upside-down flag late Wednesday. On Thursday morning, Executive Director Clifford Tatum replied in an e-mail: “No, this is an error; checked with printer, not enough paper in stock or time to redo cover… we will message to voters that content is correct- graphic is wrong.” In a interview Thursday evening, Tatum said that the inverted flag was placed on the cover by a member of the board’s “design team,” who had stylized the logo in various ways during previous elections. “We have done different things with the flag in the past,” he said. “Her idea was the bars would be above the stars.” Tatum said he did not see the cover before it was sent to the printer. When he saw the finished product, he said he raised concerns about the upside-down flag, but by that point the books had already been printed and packaged — and so began the effort to couch the flag as a gimmick. “I read the content,” Tatum said. “I can’t say I paid attention to the cover. From cover to cover, it’s perfect. Would I have done something different with the bars and stars, certainly.” McDuffie is not pleased by the board’s latest snafu. “My impression is that this was not an intentional act, and it was an error,” he said Thursday. “And if it was intentional, then it was ridiculous that anyone would sanction that.” He laid the blame at Tatum’s feet: “You’ve got an executive director who needs to be held accountable for mistake after mistake in election after election. We have had problems through his tenure, and at some point, the buck needs to stop.” Tatum declined to comment on McDuffie’s statements. The 305,164 copies of the official D.C. voter guide started landing in mailboxes Wednesday ahead of the Nov. 4 general election. And the guide, issued by the D.C. Board of Elections, quickly turned into something of a social-media phenomenon — quite a feat for a publication full of sample ballots and voting instructions. The surfeit of useful information wasn’t what caught the public’s attention, however. REALLY, @DCBOEE?! REALLY?! RT @JTinDC: This upside down flag is why we can’t have nice elections. pic.twitter.com/OWHG72f3Wf Board spokeswoman Denise Tolliver said the upside-down flag was not, in fact, a mistake. Rather, Tolliver said, it was an effort to engage voters months after primary elections that saw record-low turnout. The idea, she said, was to put the voter guide on the board’s Web site with the inverted flag, prompt viewers to find the mistake, and “see how many clicks we can get.” There is no acknowledgment of the flag in the printed guide, and as of 10 a.m. Thursday, the online version had still not been posted. The flag gag comes as the board is dealing with public dismay over the slow counting of ballots after the April 1 primaries. Last month, board executive director Clifford Tatum said he could not guarantee that all the glitches have been ironed out and declined to promise when vote-counting would wrap up on election night. So why futz with something as seemingly straightforward as the voter guide? “It’s something we wanted to do to kind of engage people,” said Tolliver, who said the gimmick was “kind of a collective thing” but was ultimately approved by Tatum. “The turnout was just so low in April.” “People are responding, aren’t they?” she added. “They’re paying attention.

Options: - headaches - sidetracked - then have - disappointment - being happy  Explain why a human would choose \\"headaches\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"headaches\\" to answer the question above because it is the most logical and fitting option among the given choices, based on common knowledge and experience with fumes and poor ventilation. The direct connection between inadequate ventilation, exposure to harmful fumes, and the development of headaches is founded on both scientific evidence and everyday observances. The explanations behind this rationale are as follows: 1. Chemical exposure: When a worker is exposed to fumes, they are essentially inhaling a mixture of gases, vapors, or fine particles that can be detrimental to their health. Typically, these fumes consist of chemicals that are emitted from substances such as solvents, paint, fuel, or other hazardous materials. Continuous exposure to these chemicals can cause headaches as they may disrupt the normal functioning of the human body. 2. Oxygen deficiency: Fumes and poor ventilation can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels in the surrounding air. This lack of oxygen can have a direct impact on the brain, as it cannot function optimally without an ample supply of oxygen. Consequently, the worker may experience headaches due to the brain's response to reduced oxygen levels. 3. Sensitivity and individual differences: Different individuals have varying sensitivities to different substances and environmental conditions. Some workers might be more susceptible to developing headaches when exposed to fumes, while others might not experience noticeable symptoms. In this specific scenario, the worker appears to be sensitive enough to the fumes that the inadequate ventilation causes them to experience headaches. The other options provided do not accurately address the question or fit into the context as effectively as \\"headaches.\\" For instance, \\"sidetracked\\" implies a difficulty in maintaining focus, but it does not clearly describe a direct consequence of being exposed to fumes in a poorly ventilated area. Similarly, \\"then have,\\" \\"disappointment,\\" and \\"being happy\\" are unrelated to the situation described and do not provide a reasonable outcome for the worker. In summary, a human would choose \\"headaches\\" to answer the question because it is the most plausible and fitting response, given the understanding of the effects of fumes and poor ventilation on human health. This choice is founded on the worker's exposure to harmful chemicals, reduced oxygen levels, and their individual sensitivity to these factors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen.  and a hint : Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Please answer this question : In which region stresses would not build in plates, region A or region B? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and hint, region B would be the area in which stresses do not build up in the plates. To provide a more detailed explanation, let us first understand the various aspects of the hint given and how they help us arrive at this conclusion: 1. Earthquakes and plate boundaries: The hint mentions that almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, which are the areas where two or more tectonic plates meet. The Earth's crust is divided into several large tectonic plates that are constantly moving due to the convection currents within the Earth's mantle. As a result, various types of plate boundaries are formed, such as divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries, each manifesting different ways in which the plates interact. 2. Plate movements and stress build-up: The convection currents within the Earth cause the tectonic plates to move. This movement leads to the build-up of stress in the rocks present at plate boundaries. If the stress builds up too much, the rocks eventually break, releasing the stored energy - this is when an earthquake occurs. 3. Elastic rebound theory: This theory describes the process by which earthquakes occur. The stored stress from plate movement causes a strain on the rocks, and once the stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, they break, sending out seismic waves. During an earthquake, rocks usually move a few centimeters up to several meters in extreme cases. This movement and the release of energy constitute the elastic rebound. Now, let's analyze the information given about regions A and B: Region A experiences many earthquakes, which implies that it most likely contains active plate boundaries where stress is continuously building up due to tectonic plate movements. These high stress levels result in the release of energy in the form of earthquakes as described by the elastic rebound theory. On the other hand, region B does not experience earthquakes. This suggests that either the tectonic plates in this area are not moving or are moving so slowly that stresses do not build up sufficiently to cause rocks to break and result in an earthquake. In this case, region B corresponds to an area where stress in the plates does not build up to the point of causing earthquakes. Therefore, considering the provided information and the hint, region B would be the area where stresses do not build up in the plates."},{"instruction":"What is the population of the census-designated place which is located 2.4 miles southeast of Mount Baldy?

PARIS — His entourage calls him “the Prince,” and after the militant Islamist takeover of a town in northern Mali last year, he liked to go down to the river and watch the sunset, surrounded by armed bodyguards.      Others call him “Laaouar,” or the One-Eyed, after he lost an eye to shrapnel; some call him “Mr. Marlboro” for the cigarette-smuggling monopoly he created across the Sahel region to finance his jihad. And French intelligence officials called him “the Uncatchable” because he escaped after apparently being involved in a series of kidnappings in 2003 that captured 32 European tourists, an undertaking which is thought to have earned him millions of dollars in ransoms.      Mokhtar Belmokhtar, 40, born in the Algerian desert city of Ghardaïa, 350 miles south of Algiers, is now being called the mastermind of the hostage crisis at an internationally run natural-gas facility in eastern Algeria.      Algerian officials say he mounted the assault and the mass abduction of foreigners; his spokesmen say the raid is in reprisal for the French intervention in Mali and for Algeria’s support for the French war against Islamist militants in the Sahel.      Mr. Belmokhtar has been active in politics, moneymaking and fighting for decades in the Sahel, which includes Mali, Mauritania and Niger and is one of the poorest regions in the world. But through this single action, one of the most brazen kidnappings in years, he has suddenly become one of the best-known figures associated with the Islamist militancy sweeping the region and agitating capitals around the world.      The 1989 killing in Pakistan of Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, a Palestinian considered the “father of global jihad” and a mentor of Osama bin Laden, prompted Mr. Belmokhtar to seek to avenge Mr. Azzam’s death, he has said in interviews. At 19 he traveled to Afghanistan for training with Al Qaeda, and has claimed in interviews to have made contact with other jihadi luminaries like Abu Qatada and Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, according to a 2009 Jamestown Foundation study. Bin Laden made contact with him, through emissaries, in the early 2000s, according to Djallil Lounnas, who teaches at Al Akhawayn University in Morocco.      Mr. Belmokhtar later named a son Osama, after Bin Laden, and inserted himself into local populations in the southern Algerian and northern Malian desert by marrying the daughter of a prominent Arab leader from Timbuktu, Mali. He is also said to have shared the riches of his lucrative activities with the impoverished local population, Mr. Lounnas has written.      Mr. Belmokhtar, described as taciturn, watchful and wary by a Malian journalist, Malick Aliou Maïga, who met him last summer, was one of the most experienced of the leaders of what became Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb until he broke with the group last year to form his own organization, the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, sometimes translated as the Signatories for Blood. Occasionally using the alias Khaled Abu Abass, he is thought to have based himself in Gao, Mali, which has seen heavy bombing by French warplanes.      It was not clear whether Mr. Belmokhtar was at the scene or commanding the operation from afar.      There are stories that he lost his eye fighting in Afghanistan, but others say he lost it fighting Algerian government troops after he returned to Algeria in 1993. The country was being ripped apart by civil war at the time, after the government annulled 1992 elections that were about to be won by an Islamist party. Mr. Belmokhtar has been a wanted man in Algeria since that time and condemned to death several times by Algerian courts.      Mr. Belmokhtar was falsely reported to have been killed in 1999. Nearly a decade later, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, which he joined, adopted the jihadist ideology of Bin Laden and renamed itself Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Mr. Belmokhtar is considered to have been a key intermediary with Al Qaeda and a well-known supplier of weapons and matériel in the Sahara.      But he clearly does not share authority easily, and left or was removed from his post as commander of a battalion in Mali last October, reportedly for “straying from the right path,” according to a Malian official, quoting the leader of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Abdelmalek Droukdel.      The dispute was about Mr. Belmokhtar’s return to smuggling and trafficking. Dominique Thomas, a specialist in radical Islam, told Le Monde that Mr. Belmokhtar’s activities ran counter to the group’s official line, which presents itself as entirely virtuous.      Mr. Belmokhtar then founded his new group, which he allied with the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, another Islamist group that had broken off from Al Qaeda.      Some suggest that his expertise has been more in criminal activities than in holy warfare. Kidnapping and smuggling — of cigarettes, stolen cars, arms and drugs — have been his specialties in the vast and largely lawless border regions. He was said to be central to hostage-takings and subsequent negotiations for their release in 2003, 2008 and 2009.      Robert R. Fowler, a former Canadian diplomat and a United Nations special envoy to Niger, was kidnapped by Mr. Belmokhtar’s brigade in late 2008 and met with him several times.      “He’s a fairly slight, very serious, very confident-looking guy who moves with quiet authority,” Mr. Fowler said in a telephone interview from Canada. “He’s clearly been in the business of being a terrorist and surviving for a long time. I was always impressed by the quiet authority he exhibited.”      Mr. Maïga, the Malian journalist, recalled seeing Mr. Belmokhtar, dressed in black and wearing a turban that descended over his eye, leaving a hospital in Gao with his entourage. He called out to him, and a bodyguard quickly interposed himself: “You must not,” the bodyguard warned. “That is the Prince.”      Subsequently, Mr. Maïga recalled seeing Mr. Belmokhtar seated on the beach by the river at Gao, surrounded by bodyguards. “He was saying nothing. He has a fixed stare. He doesn’t trust people.”      Mr. Maïga and others say locals regard him with both respect and fear.      In an interview with the Mauritanian news agency Alakhbar in Gao in November, Mr. Belmokhtar said he respected “the clearly expressed choice” of the people of northern Mali “to apply Islamic Shariah law.” He warned against foreign interference, saying that any country that did so “would be considered as an oppressor and aggressor who is attacking a Muslim people applying Shariah on its territory.”      Mr. Belmokhtar was already scheduled to be tried again in absentia by the Algiers criminal tribunal starting next Monday, on charges that include supplying weapons for attacks on Algerian soil. Planned targets were said to include pipelines and oil company installations in southern Mali. ||||| ALGIERS/IN AMENAS, Algeria More than 20 foreigners were captive or missing inside a desert gas plant on Saturday, nearly two days after the Algerian army launched an assault to free them that saw many hostages killed.      The standoff between the Algerian army and al Qaeda-linked gunmen - one of the biggest international hostage crises in decades - entered its fourth day, having thrust Saharan militancy to the top of the global agenda.      The number and fate of victims has yet to be confirmed, with the Algerian government keeping officials from Western countries far from the site where their countrymen were in peril.      Reports put the number of hostages killed at between 12 to 30, with possibly dozens of foreigners still unaccounted for - among them Norwegians, Japanese, Britons, Americans and others.      By nightfall on Friday, the Algerian military was holding the vast residential barracks at the In Amenas gas processing plant, while gunmen were holed up in the industrial plant itself with an undisclosed number of hostages.      Scores of Westerners and hundreds of Algerian workers were inside the heavily fortified compound when it was seized before dawn on Wednesday by Islamist fighters who said they wanted a halt to a French military operation in neighboring Mali.      Hundreds escaped on Thursday when the army launched an operation, but many hostages were killed in the assault. Algerian forces destroyed four trucks holding hostages, according to the family of a Northern Irish engineer who escaped from a fifth truck and survived.      Leaders of Britain, Japan and other countries have expressed frustration that the assault was ordered without consultation and officials have grumbled at the lack of information. Many countries also withheld details about their missing citizens to avoid releasing information that might aid the captors.      An Algerian security source said 30 hostages, including at least seven Westerners, had been killed during Thursday's assault, along with at least 18 of their captors. Eight of the dead hostages were Algerian, with the nationalities of the rest of the dead still unclear, he said.      Algeria's state news agency APS put the total number of dead hostages at 12, including both foreigners and locals.      The base was home to foreign workers from Britain's BP, Norway's Statoil and Japanese engineering firm JGC Corp and others.      Norway says eight Norwegians are still missing. JGC said it was missing 10 staff. Britain and the United States have said they have citizens unaccounted for but have not said how many.      The Algerian security source said 100 foreigners had been freed but 32 were still unaccounted for.      \\"We must be prepared for bad news this weekend but we still have hope,\\" Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said.      The attack has plunged international capitals into crisis mode and is a serious escalation of unrest in northwestern Africa, where French forces have been in Mali since last week fighting an Islamist takeover of Timbuktu and other towns.      \\"We are still dealing with a fluid and dangerous situation where a part of the terrorist threat has been eliminated in one part of the site, but there still remains a threat in another part,\\" British Prime Minister David Cameron told his parliament.      Two Japanese, two Britons and a French national were among the seven foreigners confirmed dead in the army's storming, the Algerian security source told Reuters. One British citizen was killed when the gunmen seized the hostages on Wednesday.      \\"(The army) is still trying to achieve a ‘peaceful outcome' before neutralizing the terrorist group that is holed up in the (facility) and freeing a group of hostages that is still being held,\\" Algeria's state news agency said on Friday, quoting a security source.      MULTINATIONAL INSURGENCY      Algerian commanders said they moved in on Thursday about 30 hours after the siege began, because the gunmen had demanded to be allowed to take their captives abroad.      A French hostage employed by a French catering company said he had hidden in his room for 40 hours under the bed before he was rescued by Algerian troops, relying on Algerian employees to smuggle him food with a password.      \\"I put boards up pretty much all round,\\" Alexandre Berceaux told Europe 1 radio. \\"I didn't know how long I was going to stay there ... I was afraid. I could see myself already ending up in a pine box.\\"      The captors said their attack was a response to the French military offensive in neighboring Mali. However, some U.S. and European officials say the elaborate raid probably required too much planning to have been organized from scratch in the single week since France first launched its strikes.      Paris says the incident proves its decision to fight Islamists in neighboring Mali was necessary.      Security in the half-dozen countries around the Sahara desert has long been a preoccupation of the West. Smugglers and militants have earned millions in ransom from kidnappings.      The most powerful Islamist groups operating in the Sahara were severely weakened by Algeria's secularist military in a civil war in the 1990s. But in the past two years the regional wing of Al Qaeda gained fighters and arms as a result of the civil war in Libya, when arsenals were looted from Muammar Gaddafi's army.      Al Qaeda-linked fighters, many with roots in Algeria and Libya, took control of northern Mali last year, prompting the French intervention in that poor African former colony.      The apparent ease with which the fighters swooped in from the dunes to take control of an important energy facility, which produces some 10 percent of the natural gas on which Algeria depends for its export income, has raised questions over the value of outwardly tough Algerian security measures.      Algerian officials said the attackers may have had inside help from among the hundreds of Algerians employed at the site.      U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said those responsible would be hunted down: \\"Terrorists should be on notice that they will find no sanctuary, no refuge, not in Algeria, not in North Africa, not anywhere... Those who would wantonly attack our country and our people will have no place to hide.\\"      (Additional reporting by Ali Abdelatti in Cairo, Eamonn Mallie in Belfast, Gwladys Fouche in Oslo, Mohammed Abbas in London and Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries in Dublin; Writing by Philippa Fletcher and Peter Graff; Editing by Andrew Roche and Tom Pfeiffer) ||||| Image caption The remote desert gas facility is not far from the Libyan border      Islamist militants are believed to be still holding a number of hostages at a gas facility in the Algerian desert.      At least four foreign workers and several militants died on Thursday when troops stormed the living quarters.      The militants had claimed to be holding 41 foreigners. At least four were freed but the fate of many others is unknown.      Meanwhile, BP said hundreds of workers from international oil companies had been evacuated from Algeria on Thursday and that many more would follow.      Analysis This was one of the most complex hostage situations seen in many years - one in which hopes for a simple, bloodless resolution always looked optimistic. The combination of a remote site in the desert, heavily armed militants, explosives at a gas facility and a kaleidoscope of nations with their citizens held hostage was always a volatile cocktail. However, there will still be questions about Algeria's decisions, particularly its reported reluctance to accept any advice or assistance. The countries whose nationals were being held may all have called for caution, but the Algerians were always going to be the key decision makers. It was their territory and many of their citizens were held hostage. They have a record of taking a tough, no-holds-barred approach. And given this was the first attack on a gas facility which provides the country's economic lifeblood they may have wanted to send a tough message to those considering repeating this.      Algeria has yet to give precise casualty figures from the rescue attempt.      The state-run APS news agency cited local officials as saying two Britons and two Filipinos were killed. Two others, a Briton and an Algerian, died on Wednesday when the militants ambushed a bus that was taking foreign workers at the facility to the local airport.      A spokesman for the militants told the Mauritanian ANI news agency that 35 hostages and 15 militants had been killed in Thursday's operation. One Algerian official said the figures were \\"exaggerated\\".      The In Amenas gas field is operated by the Algerian state oil company, Sonatrach, along with the British oil company BP and Norway's Statoil.      It is situated at Tigantourine, about 40km (25 miles) south-west of the town of In Amenas and 1,300km (800 miles) south-east of Algiers.      'Surrounded'      On Friday morning, the UK Foreign Office and Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said they believed the incident was ongoing.      \\"Parts of the plant are under Algerian authorities' control, and other parts are not.

A statement purporting to come from the kidnappers says the raid was carried out in retaliation for the French intervention against Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), in neighbouring Mali.      But BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says the kidnapping was a complex operation which is unlikely to have been planned and carried out since the surprising French intervention in Mali last Friday.

He warned Algerians to \\"stay away from the installations of foreign companies as we will strike where it is least expected\\". ||||| “This is an extremely difficult and dangerous situation,” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters in Washington. Describing a conversation she had earlier Friday with Algeria’s prime minister, Abdelmalek Sellal, Mrs. Clinton said she had emphasized to him that “the utmost care must be taken to preserve innocent life.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Algeria’s state news agency, APS, said 12 Algerian and foreign workers had been killed since Algerian special forces began an assault against the kidnappers on Thursday. It was the highest civilian death toll Algerian officials that have provided in the aftermath of the assault, which freed captives and killed kidnappers but also left some hostages dead in one of the worst mass abductions of foreign workers in years.      Previous unofficial estimates of the foreign casualties have ranged from 4 to 35. The American who died, Mr. Buttaccio, lived in a gated community in Katy, a suburb that is about 30 miles west of downtown Houston.The Algerian news agency also said that 18 militants had been killed and that the country’s special forces were dealing with remnants of a “terrorist group” that was still holding hostages in the refinery area of the gas field in remote eastern Algeria.      It also gave a new sense of how many people may have been at the facility when the militants seized it on Wednesday, asserting that nearly 650 had managed to leave the site since then, including 573 Algerians and nearly half of the 132 foreigners it said had been abducted. But that still left many people unaccounted for.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The senior Algerian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he believed there were about 10 hostages, under the control of possibly 13 to 15 militants, but he emphasized that “nothing is certain” about the numbers, which have varied wildly since the crisis began. He also said that there were other workers on the site “who are still in hiding” but that the Algerian military had secured the residential part of the gas-field complex.

On the contrary, he said, Algerian forces had returned fire only as the militants sought to escape the complex with their captives.      “There was a reaction by the army,” he said. “They tried to flee and they were stopped,” the official said of the militants. “They came absolutely to blow the whole site up. These are bitter-enders.”      Earlier Friday, the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said that not all Americans had been freed. “We have American hostages,” she said, offering the first update on what was known about United States citizens since officials confirmed on Thursday that seven or eight of them had been inside the gas-field complex.      Photo      Ms. Nuland also said the United States would not consider a reported offer made by the kidnappers to exchange two Americans for two prominent figures imprisoned in the United States — Omar Abdel Rahman, a sheik convicted of plotting to bomb New York landmarks, and Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman convicted of shooting at two American soldiers in Afghanistan. It was impossible to confirm that offer, which was reported by the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group, a service that tracks jihadist activity on the Internet.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Intensifying the uncertainties, a spokesman for the militants, who belong to a group called Al Mulathameen, said Friday that they planned further attacks in Algeria, according to a report by the Mauritanian news agency ANI, which maintains frequent contact with militant groups in the region. The spokesman called upon Algerians to “keep away from the installations of foreign companies because we will suddenly attack where no one would expect it,” ANI reported.      The Algerian military operation to end the gas-field siege was done without consulting foreign governments whose citizens worked at the facility. It has been marked by a fog of conflicting reports, compounded by the remoteness of the facility, near a town called In Amenas that is hundreds of miles across the desert from the Algerian capital, Algiers, and close to the Libyan border.

I was told by the Algerian prime minister while it was taking place. He said that the terrorists had tried to flee, that they judged there to be an immediate threat to the lives of the hostages and had felt obliged to respond.”      In Paris, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed for the first time that a French citizen had been killed, although it was not clear exactly when. The victim, whom Mr. Fabius identified as Yann Desjeux, had contacted relatives as recently as noon Thursday, according to the French newspaper Sud Ouest, which also said it had spoken with Mr. Desjeux. Three other French citizens were involved in the hostage situation but are now safe, Mr. Fabius said.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had personally appealed to his Algerian counterpart by phone early Friday to stop the military action, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported, but was told that military action was “the best response and we are continuing our operation.”      Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta met with Mr. Cameron in London as Pentagon officials were continuing to try to learn details about the raid.

But details were sketchy.      A senior French official in Paris said Malian Islamist fighters, threatened by French and Malian soldiers, had occupied the village, Diabaly, and were threatening to use residents as human shields if attacked. But by Friday evening, a local official in Diabaly said the Islamists and most of the villagers had fled. “There’s practically nothing left in Diabaly except burned-out vehicles and boxes of ammunition,” said the official, Benco Ba, a local parliamentary deputy.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      The Algerian fighters had been prepared to attack the gas complex for nearly two months, the militants’ spokesman said, according to the ANI report, because they believed that the Algerian government “was surely going to be the ally of France” in the Malian conflict.      Hostages and analysts have said the attackers appeared well-prepared and deeply knowledgeable about the site, and there was evidence to suggest they had informers on the site or were in contact with workers there. An official at BP indicated earlier in the week that the attackers had shut off production at the site at the time of the attack, for instance. And at least two former hostages, interviewed independently, have said the fighters were aware of labor tensions and plans for a strike among catering workers on the site.

Another hostage said the fighters had asked about the plans for a strike. ||||| Algeria's military launched a raid Thursday to free about 40 foreigners held by militants at a remote natural-gas complex—leaving some hostages dead, surprising and angering several governments and putting leaders across the world at a loss to determine the fate of their citizens.      The U.S., U.K. and Japan, whose nationals were among those held, said they had urged the Algerians not to resort to force to free the hostages, who were taken Wednesday by militants with suspected ties to al Qaeda's regional affiliate. The U.S. and U.K. received no warning that the raid was beginning, officials from the countries said.      \\"Before the raid began, we urged the Algerians to be cautious and strongly encouraged them to make the safety of the hostages their top priority,\\" an Obama administration official told The Wall Street Journal.      Some foreign hostages were killed when forces raided the southeast Algerian natural-gas facility, called In Amenas, an Algerian government official confirmed. He didn't elaborate. Algerian officials have told their American and European counterparts that news reports of the number of hostages killed at the site were vastly exaggerated, saying the number was likely close to 11 or 12, according to U.S. and Western officials.      The Algerian official said only that at least four engineers had been freed. An Irish hostage is safe and has made contact with his family, the Irish government said.      By late Thursday, with details sparse and often contradictory, most governments with citizens at the site said they were unable to offer casualty numbers or account for their missing.      U.S. officials said they believe as many as eight Americans were among the hostages. But officials have so far been unable to independently corroborate how many were killed in the raid, White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. \\"Reports of casualties are all over the map,\\" he said.      Even if Americans aren't among the casualties, U.S. officials worried that the siege pointed to a new era of terrorist attacks on Western interests in loosely governed regions, particularly in energy-rich parts of Africa. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that the hostage crisis illustrated the growing threat of Islamic extremism in northern Africa and the need for the U.S. to coordinate closely with African and European countries to combat it.      Playing out deep in Algeria's desert, the drama focuses international attention on al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, and related groups that have spread across a vast territory that encompasses parts of Mali, Algeria, Libya and Chad. Members of AQIM claimed responsibility for Wednesday's hostage-taking, which they branded retaliation after France sent combat troops last week to support neighboring Mali in its battle against al Qaeda-backed militants.      A Briton and an Algerian were killed in Wednesday's militant attack, Algeria's Interior Ministry has said.      Nationals of nearly a dozen countries were among the hostages, with Norway, Austria and France also among those confirming that their citizens were held. The In Amenas project, a partnership between U.K.-traded BP PLC, Norway's Statoil and Algerian energy company Sonatrach, employs some 600 people, according to BP.      Thursday's action by the Algerians was its second attempt in as many days to free the hostages.      U.S. officials said Algeria didn't give the White House warning before it launched the raid. U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron also hadn't been informed of the operation beforehand, according to a spokesman for Mr. Cameron, who added that the prime minister lodged a personal protest Thursday with his Algerian counterpart.      As the raid unfolded, Mr. Cameron postponed a highly anticipated speech on Britain's role in the European Union. \\"It is a very dangerous, a very uncertain and a very fluid situation,\\" Mr. Cameron, speaking with British Broadcasting Corp., said of the battle. \\"I think we have to prepare ourselves for the possibility of bad news ahead.\\"      Algeria defended its decision to strike at the militants. The government took all necessary measures to reach a favorable ending, the country's press agency quoted Algerian communications minister Mohammed Said as saying. But the \\"radicalism of terrorists\\" had forced the army into launching an assault, he said, according to the Algerian agency, APS.      \\"An important number of\\" the suspected militants who seized hostages at the site on Wednesday were \\"neutralized\\" by ground forces during the assault, he said.      A spokesman for the militants said his group had been trying to transport some of the hostages to a more secure location but they were hit by Algerian airstrikes, according to the Mauritanian news agency ANI.      As of late Thursday, the battle between Algerian forces and militants continued, APS reported. Contradicting an earlier report that the raid had ended in full, the agency cited local officials as saying operations had been completed only at a living quarters at the facility, where most of the hostages had been held.      But a half mile away at the site—which satellite images and company photos reveal as a vast ochre-tinged plain, flanked by sand dunes and interrupted by the occasional tall metal crane and chimney—militants holding a smaller number of hostages were being surrounded by the army, APS reported.      U.S. officials couldn't confirm whether the operation was continuing. They said the U.S. military had deployed an unmanned drone over the gas field but that the images captured by the drone didn't provide a clear picture of the status of the hostages.      The attack also highlighted worries over a geopolitical risk that could threaten oil and gas operations. The attack shut down production of In Amenas, a major field which, at full capacity, could produce nine billion cubic meters of gas a year and 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day of liquids.      Oil prices rose 1.25 to close at 95.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Thursday. Italian gas company Snam SpA said Thursday it has registered a drop of more than 13% in imports of gas from a pipeline coming from Algeria since the attack early Wednesday.      Risks to foreign energy companies operating in Algeria have improved since the 1990s civil war, but remain high, particularly along Algeria's coast. In contrast, the southern desert area where most of Algeria's oil- and gas-producing facilities are located are guarded by the Algerian army and security forces. This week's large-scale attacks marks a worrying break in peaceful operations there, said experts on the region.      Representatives from Statoil and BP said the companies had decided to bring employees home from other facilities in Algeria. Statoil's CEO said three flights will bring 40 employees home Thursday night.      BP officials declined to comment on the crisis late Thursday. Earlier in the day, it said it had been informed by the U.K. and Algerian governments of the raid but that it lacked reliable information and awaited updates from authorities.      Statoil Chief Executive Helge Lund said the company couldn't comment on the status of all 17 employees who were at In Amenas field and was worried about their well-being.      Into the night, families of Statoil hostages gathered at a hotel outside of Bergen on the Norwegian west coast, waiting for news.      Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, said four Norwegian hostages were safe outside the In Amenas facility, while nine remained unaccounted for.      Speaking during a press conference, Mr. Stoltenberg said he was informed by Algerian Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal at midday that military action was under way. Mr. Stoltenberg said he told Mr. Sellal that hostage safety was the top priority.      \\"The Algerian PM told me they had tried to find a solution during the night, but had not succeeded, so they had no other choice\\" than to attack, he said, adding that Algeria had had to make a tough decision.      —Kjetil Malkenes Hovland,      Jay Solomon, Selina Williams, James Herron      and Jared Favole      contributed to this article.

Today, we are going to talk about two important people from history – Francis IV and Vincent I. We are going to find out who died first between them. But first, let us learn a little about who they were. Francis IV was a Duke, which means he was like a big leader or boss of a place called Modena and Reggio in a country called Italy. He lived a long time ago, from 1779 to 1846. That's over 170 years ago! He was a good ruler and took care of the people in his land. Now, let's talk about Vincent I. He was a King, just like in the fairy tales you love! He was the King of a beautiful place called Portugal. He lived even longer ago than Francis IV, from 1394 to 1438. As a king, he made sure that his kingdom was peaceful and the people were happy. Now that we know a little about these two important people, we can find out who died first. Remember the years they lived? Francis IV lived from 1779 to 1846, while Vincent I lived from 1394 to 1438.  To know who died first, simply look at the years they left us. Vincent I died in 1438, which is a long, long time ago. Francis IV died much later, in 1846. So, when we compare these years, we can say that Vincent I died first.  So, little friends, now we know the answer! Between Francis IV and Vincent I, it was Vincent I who died first. We can also understand that they lived in different times in history, and both played essential roles as rulers in their countries. I hope you enjoyed learning about Francis IV and Vincent I.

Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group likely relies on confusing potential predators, group A or B? Answer:","output":"Group B likely relies on confusing potential predators. This is because they live in very large groups, and when they move around, they all move at the same time. This coordinated movement can create confusion for predators, making it more difficult for them to single out and target an individual prey. The larger group size can also create a visual confusion, known as the \\"dazzle effect,\\" making it harder for predators to focus on one specific animal. Essentially, the collective behavior of Group B serves as a defense mechanism to enhance their chances of survival against predators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: pincers","output":"Given that the task is not clearly defined, it is impossible to suggest a specific solution without adequate context. Pincers as a tool are used for various purposes, ranging from picking, gripping, and cutting to bending and manipulating materials. Hence, without knowing the targeted application, it would not be fair to recommend a solution.  To provide a comprehensive response, we can discuss the different types of pincers and their general uses to help you decide which one might be better suited to your specific goal: 1) Needle-nose pincers: Needle-nose pincers, also known as long-nose or pointy-nose pliers, possess a long and tapered gripping surface. This design is ideal for precision work, particularly in challenging-to-reach spaces. Their primary applications involve bending or manipulating wire and retrieving small items. Needle-nose pincers are commonly used in jewelry making, electronics, and various crafting projects. 2) Flat-nose pincers: Flat-nose pincers have wide and flat gripping surfaces. They provide secure grasping of a range of materials and are particularly useful for bending, gripping, and flattening objects. Flat-nose pincers are frequently used in jewelry making and wirework for their steady hold and versatile functionality. 3) Round-nose pincers: Round-nose pincers have smooth, rounded gripping surfaces allowing for the easy bending and shaping of wire, particularly in creating loops or intricate twists. They are commonly used in jewelry making, crafting, and sculpture work. 4) End-cutting pincers: End-cutting pincers, also known as end cutters or nippers, are designed for cutting wire, pins, or nails. The cutting edges are positioned at the tip of the pincers, making them efficient at snipping wire flush against a surface or trimming nails. This type of pincer is commonly utilized in woodworking, electrical work, or construction. 5) Diagonal-cutting pincers: Diagonal-cutting pincers or diagonal cutters are similar to end-cutting pincers but with their cutting edges set at an angle. They effortlessly cut wires, cables, and other softer materials and are used widely in electrical work, automotive repair, and hobby projects. 6) Tongue-and-groove pincers: Tongue-and-groove pincers, also referred to as water pump pliers or groove joint pliers, are adjustable and designed for clamping or holding irregularly shaped objects. They are extensively utilized in plumbing, automotive, and general maintenance tasks. 7) Locking pincers: Locking pincers, or vise grips, include a locking mechanism that clamps onto an item, giving a secure hold without the need for constant manual pressure. These pincers are primarily used in welding, automotive repair, and general maintenance. Ultimately, the \\"better\\" solution depends on your specific goal or task at hand. If your goal is precision work, needle-nose pincers might be a better option. Conversely, if your objective is to cut wires or nails, end-cutting pincers would be more appropriate. Assess your task and intended use to guide your choice of the most suitable pincer for the job."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence from a movie review: real star  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"It's not possible to determine whether the movie was seen positively or negatively based on just the sentence provided: \\"real star.\\" This phrase alone does not give sufficient information about the reviewer's thoughts, feelings, or opinions about the movie.  To accurately assess the reviewer's stance and provide a well-rounded answer, more context is needed. A well-written movie review often includes essential elements like a synopsis of the movie plot, a description of the main characters' performances, the director's choices, visual and sound effects, and the overall message of the film. Furthermore, the reviewer usually shares their thoughts on how the elements come together, and whether they enjoyed the movie or found it lacking in any aspects. Without access to such details from the review, it is impossible to provide a definite answer regarding the movie's reception. However, if we were to solely focus on the term \\"real star,\\" it could be interpreted in several ways: the reviewer could be praising the performance of a particular actor in the movie or highlighting the outstanding visuals or music as the true standout of the film. It could also be seen as a phrase to recognize someone's behind-the-scenes contribution, such as the director or writer, that stood out among other elements.

Question: Where are regulations codified into? Answer: Many statutes give executive branch agencies the power to create regulations, which are published in the Federal Register and codified into the Code of Federal Regulations.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Yes, the question was answered in a satisfactory fashion, but I can provide a more detailed and long answer for better understanding. Regulations, also known as administrative laws or rules, are created by executive branch agencies and are necessary for the effective implementation and enforcement of statutes passed by the legislative branch. These regulations are designed to clarify or give further guidance to the legislation they are based on and have a direct impact on the general public, businesses, and other organizations. Regulations in the United States are published in the Federal Register, which is a daily publication containing new rules, proposed rules, and other notices from federal agencies. Before being published in the Federal Register, a process known as rulemaking is followed. This process involves several stages, including: 1. Notice of proposed rulemaking: The agency developing the new regulation drafts a proposed rule and publishes it in the Federal Register to give the public an opportunity to review and provide comments. 2. Public comment period: Interested parties can submit comments on the proposal, providing input, suggestions, or concerns about the proposed regulation. This is a vital part of the rulemaking process as it allows for stakeholders' involvement in the shaping of the regulation. 3. Review and analysis: After the comment period, the agency reviews the input received and may make changes to the proposed rule based on that feedback. The agency may also conduct further research, cost-benefit analyses, or environmental impact assessments, as necessary. 4. Final rule: Once the agency has thoroughly considered the comments and carried out additional analyses, they issue a final rule, which is published in the Federal Register and becomes legally binding. Upon publication in the Federal Register, these regulations are also organized and codified into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The CFR is a comprehensive collection of all federal regulations divided into 50 titles, each covering a specific topic, such as Title 21 for Food and Drugs or Title 40 for Protection of the Environment. Each title is further divided into chapters, parts, and sections to facilitate easy navigation and referencing. Regulations are subject to review by the courts, and they can be challenged for various reasons, such as if an agency has exceeded its statutory authority or if the regulation contradicts the intent of the governing legislation. In summary, regulations are codified into the Code of Federal Regulations after a detailed rulemaking process involving public input and agency analyses. These regulations, derived from statutes and created by executive branch agencies, allow for the practical implementation and enforcement of laws in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While overseeing security at a concert for pop star Sheerah (Holly Valance), Bryan saves her from a violent stalker. As a token of gratitude, Sheerah offers to assess Kim's talent as a singer. Before Bryan can tell Kim, she asks her father for permission to travel to Paris with her best friend, Amanda (Katie Cassidy). He initially refuses, but eventually agrees after Lenore pressures him. At the airport, he learns the girls are actually following Irish band U2 during their European tour, something Lenore knew, but kept from him. Upon arriving at Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Kim and Amanda meet a young man named Peter (Nicolas Giraud), whose taxi-sharing habits act as an opportunity to discover and pass on their details and location. Kim and Amanda go to Amanda's cousins' apartment, only for Kim to find that Amanda's cousins are in Spain. While Kim takes a call to her father, she witnesses Amanda being abducted by strange men in the living room. Kim complies with her father's instructions to hide in a bedroom, but Bryan, knowing she will be found, informs her of it and talks her through the situation.

After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and is of control.

Now, we have to find out how many \\"v\\" sets of apples we need to make the puzzle work. First, let's add the apples together: (-692 * v) + (331 * v) + (308 * v) = -63 * v So, now our math puzzle looks like this: 0 = -63 * v + 1007 Next, let's move the 1007 from one side to the other. To do this, we'll subtract 1007 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 1007 = -63 * v + 1007 - 1007 -1007 = -63 * v Almost done! Now, we need to figure out how many \\"v\\" sets of -63 apples are equal to -1007 apples. So, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -63: -1007 / -63 = (-63 * v) / -63 17 = v There we go!

Q:Information:  - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic.  - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.  - The National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was the first organization governing American baseball. The first convention of sixteen New York City area clubs in 1857 practically terminated the Knickerbocker era, when that club privately deliberated on the rules of the game. The last convention, with hundreds of members represented only via state associations, provoked the establishment of separate professional and amateur associations in 1871. The succeeding National Association of Professional Base Ball Players is considered the first professional sports league; through 1875 it governed professional baseball and practically set playing rules for all. Because the amateur successor never attracted many members and it convened only a few times, the NABBP is sometimes called \\"the amateur Association\\" in contrast to its professional successor.  - A professional is a member of a profession or any person who earns their living from a specified professional activity. The term also describes the standards of education and training that prepare members of the profession with the particular knowledge and skills necessary to perform their specific role within that profession. In addition, most professionals are subject to strict codes of conduct, enshrining rigorous ethical and moral obligations. Professional standards of practice and ethics for a particular field are typically agreed upon and maintained through widely recognized professional associations, such as the IEEE. Some definitions of \\"professional\\" limit this term to those professions that serve some important aspect of public interest and the general good of society.  - The National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP), or simply the National Association (NA), was founded in 1871 and continued through the 1875 season. It succeeded and incorporated several professional clubs from the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP); in turn several of its clubs created the succeeding National League of Professional Baseball Clubs.  - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the \\"Senior Circuit\\").  - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a \\"title\\".  - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - The Mutual Base Ball Club of New York was a leading American baseball club almost throughout its 20 - year history .

Failing on the field and in the coffer , it declined to make its last western trip of the inaugural season . For the transgression it was expelled in December , and soon found itself defunct . The Mutual club initially played its home games at Elysian Fields in Hoboken , with the New York Knickerbockers and many other Manhattan clubs , but moved to the enclosed Union Grounds in Brooklyn in 1868 . The Mutuals chose open professionalism in 1869 -- 70 after NABBP liberalization . They joined the first professional league , the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players , for its 1871 to 1875 duration . In 1876 , the Chicago White Stockings initiated the National League and recruited its members from West to East , partly to wrest control of professional baseball from Eastern interests . The Mutuals were one of eight charter members , six of whom were from the National Association . Weak ( sixth place at 21 -- 35 ) and cash - poor , the club refused to complete its playing obligations in the West ; and was expelled .

Article: Despite the fact that businesses believe celebrities  have a lot of  _ with regard to the buying trends of consumers, researchers have discovered that this does not seem to be the case. British and Swiss researchers conducted a study showing that advertisements featuring endorsements by celebrities like David Beckham and Scarlett Johansson are not as effective as those by ordinary people. The difference is that regular people prefer to purchase goods that are bought by other regular people.      In s sample of 298 university students, researchers presented a magazine advertisement for a digital camera that included an endorsement by an imaginary student saying the camera was \\"hot\\" and his \\"preferred choice.\\" The same advertisement was shown to other students, but with a difference:the camera was endorsed by a famous person in Germany. The researchers also measured how important it was for consumers that the purchased products make a good impression on others.       While the students said that both advertisements were beneficial, the one made by the student topped the celebrity one if students aimed to impress others with their purchases. More than half of the students, who admitted to purchasing products that would impress others, said they were influenced by the student advertisement. Only 20% said the celebrity one would affect their buying decision. For those who do not buy to impress, only 5% focused on the student advertisement.      Professor Brett Martin from the University of Bath's School of Management, explained that the findings can be used not only in Germany, but in other countries as well. \\"Our re-search questions whether celebrities are the best way to sell products,\\" said Mr. Martin.\\"Celebrities can be effective but we found that many people were more convinced by an endorsement from an ordinary person. This is because many people, feel a need to keep up with the Jones\\" when they buy. \\" Question: According to the research, common consumers tend to buy fashionable products endorsed by   _  . - people who resemble them - common people whom they know nothing about - a person who doesn't buy to impress others - famous persons Answer:","output":"According to the research, common consumers tend to buy fashionable products endorsed by people who resemble them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the company that departed Florence second? is inside the article: Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants., can you guess it ?

After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink.  His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey.  At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse.

When the pronoun \\"he\\" is used in this context, it is referring to Mr. Bond, and is functioning as a pronoun to avoid repetitive use of the proper noun \\"Mr. Bond.\\" Allow me to break down the structure of the sentence to provide a clearer understanding: 1. \\"When Mr. Bond, the veterinarian, came to look at the black horse that lay groaning on the grass,\\" - This part of the sentence sets the scene and introduces Mr. Bond as the main character in the situation being described. It provides context by stating that he is a veterinarian, and the purpose of his visit is to examine an injured black horse, which is lying down and groaning. 2. \\"he felt him all over,\\" - In this part of the sentence, \\"he\\" refers back to Mr. Bond, as he is the only identified male character in the sentence so far. The pronoun \\"he\\" is used here to maintain sentence flow and avoid repetitively stating Mr. Bond's name. The \\"him\\" in this part of the sentence refers to the black horse, indicating that Mr. Bond is palpating or physically examining the horse. 3. \\"and shook his head;\\" - Again, \\"his\\" in this part of the sentence refers to Mr. Bond. This phrase suggests that he is expressing concern or disapproval based on his assessment of the horse's condition. 4. \\"one of his legs was broken.\\" - Finally, \\"his\\" in this part of the sentence refers to the black horse. This reveals the result of Mr. Bond's examination and shares the specific issue with the horse, which is a broken leg. In conclusion, within the context of the presented sentence, \\"he\\" and \\"Mr. Bond\\" indeed refer to the same person. The pronoun \\"he\\" serves as a substitution for the proper noun \\"Mr. Bond\\" to create a smoother reading experience while maintaining the intended meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the following year blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on Your Knees (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and The Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit \\"Journey to the Center of the Mind\\" (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo (1978).

Here is the verse you provided, now with added punctuation: \\"8:12. He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him, to sanctify him.\\" Adding punctuation to the above verse helps to clarify its meaning. In biblical times, anointing with oil had deep symbolic significance. By pouring oil on Aaron's head, Moses was setting him apart for God's service. The oil represented the Holy Spirit, and signified the divine consecration needed to fulfill the priestly role. This act also showed that Aaron received special authority, as well as the responsibility to lead the people in their spiritual and religious practices. The anointing served as a visible sign of Aaron's (and subsequently his descendants') call to be the high priest. By sanctifying Aaron through anointing, Moses also consecrated the priesthood, which would be passed down through generations within the tribe of Levi. The priesthood played a central role in the spiritual life of Israel, representing the people before God and performing sacrifices, prayers, and other religious duties on their behalf. At the same time, the anointing of Aaron symbolizes the importance of submitting to God's guidance and acknowledging His presence in our lives. In essence, it serves as a reminder that the true source of authority and power does not come from ourselves, but rather from God. In conclusion, the anointing of Aaron with oil demonstrates the divine appointment to his role as high priest, establishing the sanctity and holiness of this position. The act of anointing represents submission to God's will and consecration for spiritual service, highlighting the essential role faith plays within the religious life of the community. By adding the necessary punctuation to the verse, the meaning becomes clearer, emphasizing the deep spiritual significance behind the anointing of Aaron."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo GOP senators recommend FBI probe of Trump 'dossier' author Steele Sens. Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham tell the FBI that former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele made false statements to investigators.      Two Republican senators have recommended that the FBI pursue a criminal investigation against Christopher Steele — the author of the disputed Trump-Russia dossier — for what they described as evidence that he made false statements to federal investigators.      \\"I don’t take lightly making a referral for criminal investigation. But, as I would with any credible evidence of a crime unearthed in the course of our investigations, I feel obliged to pass that information along to the Justice Department for appropriate review,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said in a joint statement with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).      Story Continued Below      The senators did not provide public evidence to substantiate their request, but they noted they sent a \\"classified memorandum\\" to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray containing the basis of their request.      The request does not assess the validity of the Steele dossier, nor does it constitute a criminal allegation. \\"The referral is for further investigation only,\\" according to the statement.      Even so, Democrats quickly responded in anger.      \\"I wasn’t consulted about this referral nor were any of my Democratic colleagues,\\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on Grassley's committee. \\"I think this referral is unfortunate as it’s clearly another effort to deflect attention from what should be the committee’s top priority: determining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election and whether there was subsequent obstruction of justice.\\"      One congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the decision by Grassley and Graham to refer Steele to the Justice Department raises an obvious anomaly.      \\"They are referring to DOJ a criminal prosecution based on documents DOJ gave them and based on witness testimony to the DOJ,\\" the aide said.      Steele, a former British intelligence officer, was commissioned in 2016 by research firm Fusion GPS to investigate President Donald Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier he produced, which Trump has derided as fiction, describes years of illicit connections between Trump, his business and the Kremlin.

Republicans have persistently questioned how the FBI handled the dossier after receiving it during the 2016 campaign, including whether it formed the basis of a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign associate and whether the FBI independently verified any of Steele's information.      Republicans have also sounded the alarm over reports that Fusion was paid by the Clinton campaign for Steele's research, suggesting that Steele's work was the product of a partisan smear effort.      The two senators claim in their letter to have seen evidence of \\"potential violations\\" by Steele of a law prohibiting false statements to government officials. These potential violations, they say, occurred \\"regarding his distribution of information contained in the dossier.\\"      Their letter was copied to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, as well as Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Reps. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top lawmakers on the House Intelligence ommittee. ||||| WASHINGTON — More than a year after Republican leaders promised to investigate Russian interference in the presidential election, two influential Republicans on Friday made the first known congressional criminal referral in connection with the meddling — against one of the people who sought to expose it.      Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a senior committee member, told the Justice Department that they had reason to believe that a former British spy, Christopher Steele, lied to federal authorities about his contacts with reporters regarding information in a dossier, and they urged the department to investigate. The committee is running one of three congressional investigations into Russian election meddling, and its inquiry has come to focus on, in part, Mr. Steele’s explosive dossier that purported to detail Russia’s interference and the Trump campaign’s complicity.      The decision by Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham to single out the former intelligence officer behind the dossier infuriated Democrats and raised the stakes in the growing partisan battle over the investigations into Mr. Trump, his campaign team and Russia.      The Senate Judiciary Committee effort played into a far broader campaign waged by conservatives to cast doubt on the Trump-Russia investigations, and instead turn the veracity of the dossier and the credibility of its promulgators into the central issue. At the same time, President Trump and his allies have demanded that the Justice Department reopen its investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server and the Clinton Foundation. F.B.I. agents have begun interviewing people connected to the foundation about whether any donations were made in exchange for political favors while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. ||||| The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Friday that the Justice Department investigate for possible criminal charges the author of the now-famous dossier alleging the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin during the 2016 election.      The move by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) marks a major escalation in conservatives' challenges to the FBI's credibility as the agency investigates whether any Trump associates committed crimes. Another Republican, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), joined in the letter to the Justice Department.      Their letter makes what is called a criminal referral to the Justice Department, suggesting it investigate the dossier's author, former British spy Christopher Steele, for possibly lying to the FBI. It is a crime to lie to FBI agents about a material fact relevant to an ongoing investigation.      The letter says Steele may have lied to the FBI \\"regarding his distribution of information contained in the dossier.\\" In response to a lawsuit filed in London, Steele has said he had off-the-record conversations with a handful of news organizations during that period, including The Washington Post. It was not immediately clear how conversations with reporters might be materially relevant to the investigation the FBI was conducting.      The move by Grassley and Graham was viewed skeptically by some Democrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, as well as experts in criminal law.      Steele's role has become a matter of increasingly heated debate, with the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill suggesting his reports were biased, since he was hired with money that ultimately came from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.      [Clinton campaign, DNC paid for research leading to Trump dossier]      Steele's allegations — in addition to other information, including intelligence intercepts and an Australian diplomat's account of a conversation with a Trump adviser in a London wine bar — prompted the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into Trump associates in July 2016, according to current and former officials. The Australian warning was first reported by the New York Times.      That investigation has since expanded into a special-counsel probe by Robert S. Mueller III, whose work has led to indictments of two former Trump campaign officials, as well as guilty pleas and cooperation deals from two others. As the Russia probe has heated up, some Republicans have amplified their attacks on Steele's dossier, contending it was a weapon in a political smear campaign they claim was aided by the FBI.      Steele did not respond to a request for comment. But a lawyer for the consulting firm that hired him, Fusion GPS, had a strong reaction.      \\"After a year of investigations into Donald Trump's ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place,\\" the lawyer, Joshua A. Levy, said in a statement. \\"Publicizing a criminal referral based on classified information raises serious questions about whether this letter is nothing more than another attempt to discredit government sources, in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation. We should all be skeptical in the extreme.\\"      A veteran prosecutor, Peter Zeidenberg, said he had never heard of anything like the Grassley-Graham complaint and labeled it \\"nonsense\\" designed to detract from ongoing inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election.      \\"The FBI doesn't need any prompting from politicians to prosecute people who have lied to them,\\" said Zeidenberg, a federal prosecutor for 17 years. While members of Congress make criminal referrals from time to time, they are usually related to independent congressional investigations, not to material already known to the FBI. \\"They should stay in their lane,\\" Zeidenberg said of the Grassley-Graham effort.      Another former federal prosecutor, Justin Dillon, said it was too early to assume the letter was simply a political attack. \\"Given that we don't know what the basis for the referral is, it seems premature to simply assume it was partisan,\\" Dillon said. \\"I do find it hard to believe that Grassley and Graham would just make this up out of whole cloth.\\"      Grassley said in a statement Friday, \\"If we see what appears to be credible evidence of a violation that should be further investigated based on information from any source, public or non-public, we are going to formally notify the department.\\"      The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), said she and other Democrats had not been consulted about the request for a criminal inquiry.      \\"This referral is unfortunate,\\" Feinstein said in a statement. \\"It's clearly another effort to deflect attention from what should be the committee's top priority: determining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election and whether there was subsequent obstruction of justice.\\"      One Republican aide familiar with Judiciary Committee operations said: \\"It's pretty clear that Grassley and Graham are interested in carrying water for the White House, but that is not reflective of the whole committee. There are members of Judiciary who are upset with Senator Grassley for carrying it so close to the vest.\\" The aide asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.      Steele was a senior intelligence officer monitoring the Kremlin for Britain's intelligence service, MI6, before he left the agency and established a consulting firm, Orbis. In that role, he worked for a range of clients, including law firms and Fusion GPS.      The dossier is a compilation of reports he wrote for Fusion GPS between June and late October 2016, plus a final report in December, after the election. Among other things, the dossier alleged that the Russian government collected compromising information about Trump and that the Kremlin was engaged in an effort to assist his campaign for president.      U.S. intelligence agencies later released a public assessment asserting that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to aid Trump. The FBI has been investigating whether Trump associates helped the Russians in that effort.      Trump has vigorously denied the allegations in the dossier and has called the FBI probe a witch hunt. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham have recommended that the FBI pursue a criminal investigation against Christopher Steele, the author of the disputed Trump-Russia dossier, for possible false statements made to federal investigators.

Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Santa Anna demanded the executions of Texian soldiers who surrendered during early skirmishes, believing that they would become prisoners of war."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the church next to the Old Supreme Court building, the latter of which was also designed by Greenway? , can you please find it?   One of Greenway's finest works, St James' is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. It has been called an \\"architectural gem\\" and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's \\"masterpiece\\", the UNESCO World Heritage listed-Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains \\"fine Georgian\\" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the \\"virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end\\", Greenway maintained the classical tradition, unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town-planning. Before the advent of high-rise buildings, the 46-metre (150 ft) spire used to \\"serve as a guide for mariners coming up...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: What's the answer to that question: what did mary harris jones accomplish? The answer is:","output":"Mary Harris Jones, commonly known as Mother Jones, was a prominent labor organizer and social activist during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born in 1837 in County Cork, Ireland, she migrated to North America and eventually became a U.S. citizen. Over the course of her life, she accomplished a great deal in advocating for workers' rights, including improved working conditions, wages, and child labor laws. Some of her most notable accomplishments include: 1. Formation of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA): As a tireless advocate for miners' rights, Mother Jones was instrumental in the establishment of the UMWA in 1890. The union played a critical role in improving wages, working conditions, and general welfare for miners throughout the United States. 2. Role in the Colorado Coalfield War: In the early 20th century, Mother Jones became deeply involved in the struggle for miners' rights in the coalfields of southern Colorado. Known as the Colorado Coalfield War, or the Ludlow Massacre, the conflict arose due to unfair labor practices and substandard working conditions in mines owned by the Rockefeller family. Mother Jones actively participated in the organization of strikes and provided invaluable support and encouragement to the striking miners. 3. Advocacy for child labor laws: Recognizing the plight of young children working in dangerous and unhealthy conditions, Mother Jones passionately campaigned against the rampant practice of child labor. In 1903, she organized and led a highly-publicized march from Philadelphia to New York City, the \\"Children's Crusade\\", to draw attention to the issue and to push for legislation banning child labor. Her efforts helped lay the groundwork for the eventual enactment of child labor laws across the country. 4. Mass organization of workers: Mother Jones organized countless strikes, protests, and other activities to support various labor movements, earning her the title \\"the most dangerous woman in America\\" by a U.S. district attorney. One such achievement was her involvement in the 1912 Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike in West Virginia, where she effectively organized what became one of the most protracted armed conflicts in the nation's labor history. 5. The foundation of the Social Democratic Party: As a vocal proponent of socialism during a time when it was largely frowned upon, Mother Jones joined Eugene V. Debs and Victor Berger in launching the Social Democratic Party of America in 1898. Although the party did not gain significant power, it played an essential role in promoting social and labor reforms as well as providing an alternative political voice to workers. 6. Induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame: In recognition of her tireless work advocating for social and labor reforms, Mother Jones was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1984, signifying the lasting impact of her efforts on U.S. society. In conclusion, Mary Harris Jones, known as Mother Jones, accomplished a great deal throughout her life as a labor organizer and social activist. Her relentless pursuit of workers' rights, fair wages, and better working conditions not only led to crucial reforms in her time but also laid the groundwork for future advancements in labor laws and workers' protections. Mother Jones' unwavering spirit and fierce commitment to social and economic justice continue to inspire generations of activists today."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Paragraph: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries? Answer:","output":"Given the paragraph, the fruit that Mary candied and are therefore saturated with sugar are apricots. Mary experimented with candying raspberries, apricots, and apples and did not candy plums, cherries, or pears.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  I am facing a new situation today: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.

Options: - speak freely - school child - understand children - care for children - toddler  Explain why a human would choose \\"school child\\" to answer the question above:","output":"Human beings would most likely choose \\"school child\\" as the answer to the question for several reasons. To clarify, five years after becoming a parent, it is common for a child to be around the age of five. This age usually marks the beginning of primary education in many countries, a time when the child transitions from being a toddler or preschooler to entering formal schooling. Here are some reasons why a human would choose \\"school child\\" to answer the question above: 1. Age of the child: After five years of becoming a parent, the child would typically be around five years old. This is the age most children start their primary education, as they are more capable of managing school routines, following instructions, and engaging in a variety of learning activities. 2. Developmental milestones: By five years old, children have achieved several developmental milestones that prepare them for entering school. For instance, they have developed essential motor skills, such as holding a pencil and controlling their movements; cognitive skills, like understanding basic math and problem-solving concepts; and language skills, which enable them to converse clearly and understand others. 3. Socialization: At the age of five, children have enhanced their socialization skills by interacting with peers through playgroups, excursions, or preschool settings. They begin to understand the concept of sharing, taking turns, and managing emotions, which are essential skills for navigating relationships with other children and teachers in school. 4. Behavioral and emotional readiness: School-aged children should have learned essential self-regulatory skills to manage their emotions, behaviors, and thoughts. As they enter school, they need to adapt to new demands and routines and cope adequately with stress and frustration. These skills are crucial for succeeding in a school environment. 5. Legal requirements: In several countries, attending school is mandatory from the age of 5 or 6, depending on the jurisdiction. Parents are legally obligated to enroll their children in primary education to ensure they receive the necessary knowledge and social experiences to foster healthy development. In conclusion, the answer \\"school child\\" appropriately represents the most relevant option for the given question because, after becoming parents for five years, people will mostly have a child around five years old who is transitioning into or attending primary school. This stage includes essential developmental, social, emotional, and even legal aspects that define the school child category."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - retail markup - revenue - income - for free - benefit  Explain why a human would choose \\"for free\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"for free\\" to answer the question \\"If you get something for no cost you get that thing what?\\" because it best represents the meaning and implication of receiving something without paying any price for it. Among the options provided, \\"for free\\" is the most accurate and suitable answer. Let's briefly analyze each option to clarify why choosing \\"for free\\" makes the most sense in this context. 1. Retail markup: This term refers to the difference between the cost of a product to a retailer and the price at which they sell it to the end consumer. While it is related to pricing, it does not address the idea of getting something at no cost. Thus, it is not the appropriate answer. 2. Revenue: Revenue is the total income generated from the sale of goods or services by a business. It considers all transactions that involve an exchange of money, which does not align with the notion of receiving something at no cost. Therefore, it is not the suitable answer to the question. 3. Income: Income generally refers to the money received by an individual or business over a specified period, usually earned through work or investments. It also implies financial gain and is not directly related to acquiring something for no cost. Thus, it does not fit the context of the question. 4. For free: This option clearly reflects the idea of getting something without any payment or monetary exchange. It directly expresses the concept of receiving something for no cost, making it the most accurate and appropriate answer to the question. 5. Benefit: A benefit is an advantage or profit gained from something. Although receiving something for no cost could be considered advantageous, the term 'benefit' does not explicitly convey the idea of no-cost acquisition. Thus, it is not the most precise answer to the question. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"for free\\" to answer the question because it distinctly conveys the concept of receiving something without bearing any cost or financial obligation. This option is the most accurate and directly related to the notion of getting something at no cost, making it the most suitable answer among the choices provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: The correct options feature other footballers (Frank Lampard, Gary Cahill, Joe Hart) who could have apparently been competing against Wayne Rooney for the position of the captain of England's national team.  Other answers are incorrect for the following reasons: 1. England, Manchester United, Norway, Red Devils, United, Valencia, Wembley, and Swansea are names of team/entities or places and cannot be candidates for the position of a football team captain. 2. Louis van Gaal and Roy Hodgson are coach/manager and not players, thus they cannot be a captain of a team. 3. The sentence is talking about the impossibility of Hodgson not choosing Rooney, so Rooney himself isn't a correct option. 4. Steven Gerrard is excluded as he is the person Wayne Rooney would be replacing, as mentioned in the text.

That is still a big hurdle for TLP, which wants five other lagoons on the west UK coast to harness power, and needs a guaranteed price for it. There are also concerns about the impact on the environment and migratory fish. The backing by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is seen as a significant step forward for the developers. Energy Minister Lord Bourne, who is also Wales Office Minister, said: \\"We need more clean and home-grown sources of energy, which will help to reduce our reliance on foreign fossil fuels. \\"Low carbon energy projects like the tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay could bring investment, support local jobs and help contribute to the Welsh economy and Swansea area.\\" The tidal lagoon on the eastern side of Swansea Bay, between the docks and the new university campus, would use the flow and ebb of the tide to generate energy, which would then be converted into electricity. But before the lagoon becomes a reality, there are three main challenges that need to be met: The attraction for the UK Government is the potential for a new industry. Thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs could be created, especially if five much bigger lagoons are built in the Severn estuary and off the north Wales coast. There would also be a boost to the UK's standing as a generator of clean, green energy. Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Gloucester-based TLP, said the project had the\\" potential to help transform our industrial economy and the UK's energy mix\\". He added: \\"We see it as a game-changer, a scalable blueprint, paving the way for a fleet of lagoons that can work in harmony with nature to help secure the nation's electricity for generations to come.\\" Swansea council leader Rob Stewart called the news hugely encouraging for the city, saying it would boost leisure and tourism. Friends of the Earth Cymru director Gareth Clubb also welcomed the news, adding: \\"Tidal power could further revolutionise Wales' energy mix - instead of relying on climate-wrecking fossil fuels, it could help us build a clean and safer energy future.\\" However he called for the government to make the most of existing renewable resources such as offshore wind and solar power. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) will continue to assess the possible effects of the lagoon on the environment. A marine licence could be issued by the end of July. If the decision is a positive one, work would start next March. A Welsh government spokesman said: \\"We welcome this decision. Wales is well-placed to exploit the potential of marine energy and the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project could create thousands of jobs during the construction and hundreds of permanent ones.\\" ANALYSIS by Iolo ap Dafydd, BBC Wales environment correspondent Tidal energy has political muscle from both George Osborne and David Cameron behind it, while the developers claim the promised tourism and jobs from the project have strong support in the Swansea area. But there are challenges too. Big ones. There are environmental concerns about the impact on migratory fish. The Swansea lagoon would be between the Tawe and Neath estuaries. The potentially larger lagoon in eastern Cardiff could block the Rhymney estuary. TLP still needs a marine licence from NRW whatever is decided in Westminster. The impact of dredging and clearing on the bay, as well as sediment pollution, are other considerations. And the project could yet face legal challenges or calls for a judicial review. Then there's the cost. A cool billion pounds for an energy output that would be a third of an average sized power station. TLP and the UK Government now need to agree a guaranteed price for the energy generated. Last year, the company asked for £168 per MWhe - higher than for nuclear, solar and onshore wind energy - but will not say the current detail of negotiations. Higher tariffs are offered to wave and other marine technologies, but unlike energy lagoons, they are far in the future whereas staff at TLP want to be able to start building next spring.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: In March 1992, a conveyor belt broke at the McDonald’s in Sydney River, Nova Scotia. Two months later, three people were dead and another forever disabled because of it. The conveyor belt was at the back of the restaurant and it carried buns, all-beef patties, fries and secret sauces from the kitchen to a storage area in the basement. When it broke, one of the fast-food joint’s newest employees, Derek Wood, 18, was sent downstairs to open a seldom-used door that led into the basement so the supplies could be carried in. In that dismal, dark room, a light bulb flashed in Wood’s head, wrote journalist Phonse Jessome in his book on the case, “Murder at McDonald’s.” Wood, a young man with bleak prospects, saw a chance to get rich quick. He told two buddies, Darren Muise, 18, and Freeman MacNeil, 23, that there was a safe in an upstairs office that had held at least 200,000. The general outline of the plan was that Wood would prop the door open with his knapsack and sneak up to the safe and open it quickly, even though he wasn’t entirely sure of all the numbers in the combination. Muise would go into the kitchen to keep the employees under control. MacNeil would drive the getaway car. They planned it carefully, down to figuring out how to change clothes after the job so that there would be no fiber evidence left behind and no telltale ketchup smears on what they were wearing. Muise, who would come face-to-face with the kitchen workers, chose a disguise a rubber Halloween mask that turned the dark-haired youth into a white-haired, disfigured, old man. They brought along one other thing a silver .22 pistol. It all might have come off fine if Arlene MacNeil, 20, had been less conscientious. Around midnight on May 7, she had finished her shift and decided to wait for her friend, night manager Donna Warren, 22, so they could leave together. To pass the time, MacNeil, no relation to the third man in the plot, went into the basement storeroom to sort novelties in preparation for a children’s party scheduled for the next day. When MacNeil saw Wood and the man in the old-man mask, she asked if this was a joke. There was no answer, just a shot that put a bullet in her head. Another man, maintenance worker Neil Burroughs, 29, a married man with a child, was cleaning up in the kitchen when Muise shot him, as well. The bullet didn’t kill him, so Muise tried to slit his throat with a hunting knife. He somehow couldn’t hit the jugular vein. When Burroughs refused to die, MacNeil jumped in and finished him off with a blow to the head with a shovel. While MacNeil and Muise were trying to kill Burroughs, Wood hauled Warren into the office and ordered her to open the safe. She complied and was rewarded with two bullets in her head. Next to die was another night-shift worker, Jimmy Fagan, 27, who stumbled upon the trio as they were about to flee, cash box in hand. Fagan had taken a cab to work that night and as the cabbie drove away, he heard a popping sound and noticed three figures running away from the building toward a field. He turned and saw his passenger on the ground, and, on his dispatcher’s orders, did not stop. The dispatcher called police but by the time they arrived, the killers had reached their getaway car. “I finally got to slit someone’s throat,” Muise said, as the three killers zoomed off. They didn’t realize that they had left something behind-Wood’s knapsack, with his name on it, that he had used to prop open the back door. They were in for another shock when they broke open the cash box and discovered that the take for the night’s mayhem and death was 2,017.27. By May 16, there were arrests and confessions to the four shootings, but only three charges of murder. Although shot in the head, MacNeil would survive, permanently disabled. Wood and MacNeil were found guilty and given life sentences with no chance of parole for 25 years. Derek Wood applied for day parole as soon as he was eligible, 22 years after the crime, but was denied, at least in part because of his assaults on two prison guards in 2007. Muise, who pleaded guilty to robbery and second-degree murder, got a life sentence with no chance of parole for 20 years. In 2012, he was granted a full parole, the decision based on “compliant behavior” and years of prison anger-management programs. There have been some reports that he inherited money and invested it well, and is living a quiet, comfortable life. The idea of this rankles the families left behind. Cathy Burroughs, the sister of one of the victims, said that her family had been sentenced to a lifetime of misery and that she could never forgive her brother’s murderers. She vowed revenge. “Oh, I wouldn’t kill him, but I’m going to toy with him. What’s the system going to do,” she told the Nova Scotia Chronicle Herald. “Put me in jail? Big deal, compared with what they did to my family, the Warren family and the MacNeils and Fagans.” Write a title for it.","output":"\\"The Deadly Heist: How a Broken Conveyor Belt at McDonald's Led to Tragedy and Murder in Nova Scotia\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63  when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to...

A government-sponsored coup last year made Bruce Iwasaki and Neal Dudovitz the kings of Los Angeles County's federally funded legal aid community. The two men emerged atop a changed landscape that resulted from a decade of begging for a share of shrinking public dollars doled out by an unsympathetic GOP-controlled Congress. That era was capped in 1998, when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179. To comply with the orders from their main funding source, a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free phone lines, self-help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice. While some organizations made the dramatic change look effortless, for others, it did not come easy. And few programs provide more dramatic illustrations of the promise and pitfalls of government-funded legal services than Los Angeles County's two largest providers of federally funded services - Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Pacoima-based Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County. From his offices in Koreatown, Iwasaki, a soft-spoken former O'Melveny & Myers attorney, quietly engineered a merger between a much smaller Legal Aid Society of Long Beach and his program, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. The merger was completed peacefully within a year of the federal order. Today, the programs operate seamlessly, offering new innovations - including toll-free multilingual phone advisers, expanded hours for domestic-violence clinics, and renewed immigration and consumer aid - built on the foundations of the old program. The organization is Los Angeles' largest government-funded group, with a budget of 11 million leveraged into 40 million in legal services to the poor.

After World War II, a German named Hans Müller is one of a shipload of Jewish refugees who disembark at Haifa in 1949. Like many other concentration camp survivors, Hans has psychological problems, including survivor guilt. At one point, he mistakes a woman and some children for his murdered family. At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street. Hans flees and ends up sleeping in the countryside, where he is found by a teenage orphan Sabra, Yehoshua \\"Josh\\" Bresler. Hans pretends to be an eccentric American, out to see Israel firsthand. Josh offers to be his guide. During their journey, Hans reveals that he was a professional juggler; Josh persuades him to pass on his knowledge. Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family. Gradually, however, he begins to settle in. Karni finally tracks Hans down and tries to take him into custody. Hans panics again and barricades himself in Ya'el's room with her rifle, but Ya'el and Karni get him to admit he needs help and to give himself up. Answer:","output":"In the article, Hans Müller believed that his fame and popularity would prevent tragedy from befalling him and his family during the Nazi regime in Germany. Despite warnings from friends to flee the country, Hans made the grave mistake of thinking that his renown as a professional juggler would be enough to protect him and his loved ones from the risks and dangers posed by the oppressive regime. Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, Hans's misplaced trust in his fame led to devastating consequences, which resulted in the murder of his family. His inability to prevent this tragedy led to the development of psychological problems, including survivor's guilt. In summary, Hans Müller thought that his fame and popularity as a professional juggler would act as a shield against the tragedy that eventually struck his family during the Nazi era in Germany.

Plot title: Hercules Movie plot: In Ancient Greece in the land far away, when people read Greek mythology came the time of legend â the greatest son of Zeus â Hercules. Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded into turning his coat. He also drove away the Stymphalian birds with the help of Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him. A series of labors are shown like the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra, catching the stag of Artemis, the Cathmanian boar, the Cretan bull, cleaning the Augeean stables, getting the girdle of Hippolyte, the man-eating mares of Diomedes and the Cattle of Geryon (but the monster is not shown).

On a scale of 0 to 5, I would rate the overlap between the two sentences as a 4.5. The 0.5 difference is due to the initial emphasis on the Treasury's long-range plan in the first sentence versus the more functional phrasing in the second sentence. Nonetheless, the overall meaning of both sentences is nearly identical."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What compels a Speaker of the House, as he's (supposed to be) trying to reach a deal to preserve various expiring government goodies before Congress recesses for the year, to move a resolution that would \\"commission the placement of a bust of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the Capitol\\"? Here he is, talking about it, softly crying, of course, but not in full Boehner Bawl mode. Winston Churchill, he was one helluva a guy. Anyway, this is all about race.      The reason Boehner and Co. are doing this is not merely because they admire Winston Churchill's speech before Congress 70 years ago. It's more the climax of a nearly three-year right-wing crusade against Barack Obama, whom they believe got rid of a White House bust of Winston Churchill upon assuming office in a fit of uppity anti-colonial rage. It all goes back to this Telegraph article from February 2009, which your creepy survivalist uncle almost certainly has bookmarked:      A bust of the former prime minister once voted the greatest Briton in history, which was loaned to George W Bush from the Government's art collection after the September 11 attacks, has now been formally handed back. The bronze by Sir Jacob Epstein, worth hundreds of thousands of pounds if it were ever sold on the open market, enjoyed pride of place in the Oval Office during President Bush's tenure. But when British officials offered to let Mr Obama to hang onto the bust for a further four years, the White House said: \\"Thanks, but no thanks.\\" [...] Churchill has less happy connotations for Mr Obama than those American politicians who celebrate his wartime leadership. It was during Churchill's second premiership that Britain suppressed Kenya's Mau Mau rebellion. Among Kenyans allegedly tortured by the colonial regime included one Hussein Onyango Obama, the President's grandfather.      A White House spokesperson, though, had a less hysterical account, noting that \\"the Churchill bust was removed before Obama's inauguration as part of the usual changeover operations, adding that every president puts his own stamp on the Oval Office.\\" But the legend of Obama angrily tossing out Sir Winston as his first act of revenge against whitey's colonial crimes has persisted, and it's finally slinked its way into a resolution on the House floor.      Now we'll have to move on to, say, the resolution demanding Obama stop putting his filthy feet on Queen Victoria's desk. Anything that reminds him that he is a guest in this office, in more ways than most. ||||| While House Republicans couldn’t get their act together to approve an extension of the payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits last night, they were able to do something far more frivolousness — commission a bust of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to be placed in the Capitol. The House “adjourned moments after” passing the bill, which directs:      That the Architect of the Capitol place an appropriate statue or bust of Sir Winston Churchill in the United States Capitol at a location directed by the House Fine Arts Board in consultation with the Speaker.      The resolution was seen as a rebuke to the White House, which returned a bust of Churchill to the British Embassy in 2009.      House Speaker John Bohener (R-OH) shocked Washington Sunday when he said his caucus would reject the Senate’s compromise on the payroll tax package, even though it passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 89-10. The House planned to reject the Senate bill last night, but postponed the vote after it became clear that some Republicans were going to agree with the Senate. Now, a 1,000 tax break for 160 million Americans hangs in the balance.      The Churchill bill was approved via unanimous consent, meaning the House didn’t have to waste much time considering it, but it underscores the absurdity of Boehner’s gaming of the payroll tax holiday vote. ||||| Summary:","output":"The article discusses the strange decision by the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, to move a resolution to commission a bust of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to be placed in the Capitol building.

Write a summary based on this article: Albert Einstein's corpus callosum, the bundle of fibers that connects the brain's two hemispheres and facilitates inter-hemispheric communication, was unusually well-connected, according to a new study published in the journal Brain, which suggests that Einstein's high level of cranial connectivity may have contributed to his brilliance.      Florida State University evolutionary anthropologist Dean Falk participated in the study led by Weiwei Men of East China Normal University. Falk said this study, more so than any other to date, \\"really gets 'inside' Einstein's brain.\\"      After his death in 1955, Einstein's brain was preserved, although the fact remained hidden until 1986.      The researchers used a new technique for measuring brain connectivity developed by Men.      \\"Men's technique measures and color-codes the varying thicknesses of subdivisions of the corpus callosum along its length, where nerves cross from one side of the brain to the other,\\" said a Florida State University statement. \\"These thicknesses indicate the number of nerves that cross and therefore how 'connected' the two sides of the brain are in particular regions, which facilitate different functions depending on where the fibers cross along the length. For example, movement of the hands is represented toward the front and mental arithmetic along the back.\\"      Men's research on Einstein's brain connectivity was done by photographs of Einstein's brain published by Falk and others in 2012.      To make comparisons of Einstein's brain's connectivity versus that of others, the researchers used samples taken from a group of elderly men and a larger group of men who were 26 years old. In 1905, when Einstein was 26, he had his so-called \\"miracle year\\" where he published four papers that significantly contributed to the foundation of modern physics.      Compared to both the younger and older control groups, Falk and Men found that Einstein's brain had more extensive connections between certain parts of the cerebral hemisphere.      \\"This technique should be of interest to other researchers who study the brain's all-important internal connectivity,\\" Falk said. ||||| Einstein’s Genius Likely A Result Of His Well-Connected Brain      by editor      [ Watch the Video: Dissecting Einstein's Brain ]      redOrbit Staff & Wire Reports - Your Universe Online      Albert Einstein is generally recognized as one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century, but exactly what was it that made his brain so special? The authors of a recently published study believe that they have found the answer to that riddle.      Writing in the journal Brain, Weiwei Men of East China Normal University's Department of Physics and his colleagues explained that the left and right hemispheres of the German-born theoretical physicist’s brain were exceptionally well connected to one another. That connection could have played a vital role in his intelligence.      “This study, more than any other to date, really gets at the 'inside' of Einstein's brain. It provides new information that helps make sense of what is known about the surface of Einstein's brain,” Florida State University (FSU) evolutionary anthropologist Dr. Dean Falk explained in a statement.      The study authors developed a new technique to conduct their research, which they claim is the first to analyze Einstein's corpus callosum (the largest bundle of fibers in the brain, and the part of the brain that that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication) in detail. Dr. Falk said that their method “should be of interest to other researchers who study the brain's all-important internal connectivity.”      According to FSU, the technique developed by Men’s team “measures and color-codes the varying thicknesses of subdivisions of the corpus callosum along its length, where nerves cross from one side of the brain to the other. These thicknesses indicate the number of nerves that cross and therefore how ‘connected’ the two sides of the brain are in particular regions, which facilitate different functions depending on where the fibers cross along the length.”      This technique allowed the study authors to register and compare the measurements of Einstein’s brain with those of two existing samples, one belonging to 15 elderly men and the other from 52 men who were Einstein’s age in 1905. During that year, the then-26-year-old physicist published four articles that would be essential to the foundations of modern physics, and helped alter the scientific community’s views of space, time, mass and energy.      Men started work analyzing Einstein's corpus callosum by requesting high-resolution photographs of the two halves of the genius’s brain that had been published by Falk and other researchers in 2012. Their findings demonstrate that the man behind the general theory of relativity had more extensive connections between specific regions of his cerebral hemispheres than either the younger or older control groups.      In addition to Men and Falk, who served as second author of the paper, Tao Sun of the Washington University School of Medicine and Weibo Chen, Jianqi Li, Dazhi Yin, Lili Zang and Mingxia Fan from the East China Normal University's Department of Physics were among the members of the research team.      In March 2012, sections from Einstein’s brain were displayed alongside gray matter from other prominent historical figures at an exhibition in London. As the legendary thinker had requested, his brain was divided into several sections upon his death in 1955. The portions featured during the Wellcome Collection show “Brains: The Mind As Matter” had originally been put on display to the public in a Philadelphia museum back in 2011. ||||| Einstein was undoubtedly one of the most influential physicists of all time, advancing concepts in quantum physics and gaining enormous notoriety for his theory of relativity. Einstein was also a keen philosopher, proclaiming that “… independence by philosophical insight is… the mark of distinction between mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker of truth.“      It comes as no surprise that Einstein’s brain appears physiologically distinct from that of the average individual. A recent study has sought to explain the man’s genius-level intellect, in part, based a difference in a structure called the corpus callosum.      Einstein’s Autopsied Brain      Many have attempted to understand what inspired the German-born prodigy. A pathologist, named Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey, working at Princeton University, even attempted to establish whether there was a physiological trait that could explain the inner workings of Einstein’s extraordinary mind.      Einstein died from internal bleeding, following a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. In 1955, Harvey, who was responsible for conducting Einstein’s autopsy, removed his subject’s brain, without requesting the permission of his family. Harvey then preserved Einstein’s brain in formalin, before snapping a vast number of photographs. After documenting the details of the specimen, he carved it up into approximately 240 individual sections, with the principal ambition of allowing the scientific community to research what made Einstein so truly remarkable.      Harvey retained his photographs to write a book, which he was never able to finish. Following Harvey’s demise, his family decided to donate the images to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, during 2010.      Decades after Einstein’s departure, it seems scientists are finally able to figure out the mysteries of the great man’s brain.      The Corpus Callosum Study      The latest research study, entitled The Corpus Callosum of Albert Einstein’s Brain: Another Clue to His High Intelligence, was published in the research journal Brain.      The study demonstrated that the association between the left and right hemispheres of Einstein’s brain were atypical, with enhanced connection between these two parts. Evolutionary Anthropologist, Dean Falk, of Florida State University, collaborated on the project. Falk explains how the study offers greater insight into the illustrious physicist’s brain, improving upon prior research studies.      The part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is known as the corpus callosum (A.K.A. the colossal commissure), a bundle of neuronal fibers that sits beneath the cerebral cortex, uniting the two hemispheres in the brains of higher order mammals.      The study, which was led by Weiwei Men of East China Normal University, managed to establish a novel technique to explore the “internal connectivity” of Einstein’s corpus callosum, for the very first time.      Using their new method, the team were able to determine the relative thickness of various subdivisions throughout length of the corpus callosum. These differences in thickness were then color-coded to provide the research group with an approximation for the number of neurons stretching between the left and rights hemispheres; a thicker corpus callosum suggests there to be a greater number of neurons.      In addition, different regions of the corpus callosum are implicated in specialist functions. For example, neurons situated at the front of this interlinking region of the brain are involved in movement of hands, whilst neurons running along its posterior are thought to be implicated in mental arithmetic.      The researchers applied their technique to compare Einstein’s corpus callosum to two sample groups, including one group of over a dozen elderly men, and another group of 52 men that were Einstein’s age in 1905. 1905 was a pivotal year in Albert Einstein’s life, publishing seminal articles on Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, as well as work that yielded the renowned E = mc2 formula.      Following their study, the researchers concluded that Einstein’s brain demonstrated more extensive connections at particular points along the corpus callosum. The team suggest this could, at least partially, explain some of Einstein’s supreme intellectual abilities.      Other Studies      Falk and his colleagues had investigated Einstein’s brain on a previous occasion, in 2012. Simply through analysis of Harvey’s autopsy photographs, the team were able to visibly      identify features of Einstein’s brain that could be fundamental to the man’s intellect. They found greater intricacy and convolution patterns across certain regions of his brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex, the visual cortex and the parietal lobes.      The prefrontal cortex is critical to abstract thinking, decision-making and expression of personality traits, whilst the parietal lobe is involved in sense and motor function. Intriguingly, Falk’s group found that the somatosensory cortex, which receives sensory input information, was also increased in magnitude in an area that corresponded to his left hand. As Einstein was an avid violinist, after having been inspired by a number of Mozart’s pieces at age 13, the group drew a correlation between this enlarged cortical region and his musical aptitude.      According to Live Science, Sandra Witelson, a scientist based at McMaster University, who has performed prior studies into Einstein’s brain, explained the physiological difference in the physicist’s neural tissue:      “It’s not just that it’s bigger or smaller, it’s that the actual pattern is different… His anatomy is unique compared to every other photograph or drawing of a human brain that has ever been recorded.”      Marion C. Diamond and colleagues, working at the University of California, published an article in 1985, called on the brain of a scientist: Albert Einstein. Fascinatingly, after performing microscopic cell counts, they found Einstein had an exceedingly high ratio of glial cells (a non-neuronal support cell) to regular neuronal cells, in two parts of his brain.      It seems that Albert Einstein’s thicker corpus callosum may have been partly responsible for his genius-level intellect. However, it is likely that a combination of physiological factors played a part shaping the enigmatic theoretical physicist. The question is, will there ever be another extraordinary mind like Einstein’s?

Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  - Cloud Cult is an experimental indie rock band from Duluth, Minnesota led by singer/songwriter Craig Minowa. The name originated from the ancient prophecies of indigenous North Americans.  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Feel Good Ghosts is an album by Cloud Cult released on Tuesday , April 8 2008 .  - Craig Minowa is the singer/songwriter/frontman for the alternative rock band, Cloud Cult. He is also the founder of Earthology Records. Minowa was born Craig Richardson in February 1973. Minowa grew up in Owatonna, Minnesota. He is the middle child. He has two sisters, one older, Melanie, and one younger, Janelle. His father is an accountant and his mother is a nurse. All three siblings are very artistic. Minowa has a large tattoo of a tree on his calf that he designed himself. Craig worked in Duluth at the local co-op for a number of years before being prompted to pursue his musical career by a co-worker. Minowa met his wife, Connie Staska, when his younger sister brought Connie home after school one day. The two adopted the last name \\"Minowa\\" when they married in 1998. Craig was in two bands in high school, Counterpoint and Eden's Ashes, both with current band member Scott West.

A second son of Theophilus Levett and his wife Lady Jane was Berkeley John Talbot Levett , an officer in the Scots Guards .","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrased versions of each other, but they contain some inconsistencies in terms of details and focus. Paraphrasing involves rephrasing a sentence or idea while maintaining the original meaning and core information. Although the two sentences might seem similar, they present slightly different information, causing confusion about the subjects and their relationships. The first sentence states that \\"A second son of Berkeley John Talbot Levett and his wife Lady Jane was Theophilus Levett, an officer at the Scots Guards,\\" which implies that Theophilus Levett is the second son of a man named Berkeley John Talbot Levett and his wife, Lady Jane. Theophilus Levett, in turn, is an officer in the Scots Guards. The second sentence says that \\"A second son of Theophilus Levett and his wife Lady Jane was Berkeley John Talbot Levett, an officer in the Scots Guards.\\" In this case, the sentence purports that Berkeley John Talbot Levett is the second son of Theophilus Levett and his wife, Lady Jane, and that it is Berkeley (not Theophilus) who serves as an officer in the Scots Guards. Although both sentences have similarities and revolve around the subjects of Theophilus Levett, Berkeley John Talbot Levett, and their relationship to the Scots Guards, they provide different details and slightly alter the family connections. Thus, while they are paraphrases of each other in sharing subject matter and general themes, they include inconsistencies that deviate from the original meaning and core information. In essence, they are not equivalent in terms of preserving the exact information and relationships between subjects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).

In addition to conducting and music directing the original productions of several of the most famous Gilbert and Sullivan works and writing the overtures to some of them, Cellier conducted at many theatres in London, New York and on tour in Britain, America and Australia. He composed over a dozen operas and other works for the theatre, as well as for orchestra, but his 1886 comic opera, Dorothy, was by far his most successful work. It became the longest-running piece of musical theatre in the nineteenth century. Context: In 1885, Cellier composed a song, \\"There once was a time, my darling\\", for a piece produced by George Edwardes, Little Jack Sheppard (1885). Meanwhile he had composed what would become his greatest success, the comic opera Dorothy, with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson. To create the score, Cellier repurposed some of his music from his 1876 failure, Nell Gwynne, which had, nevertheless, received praise for its music. Dorothy had been announced for production at the Royalty Theatre in 1884, but ultimately Edwardes mounted it at his Gaiety Theatre on 25 September 1886. Cellier was in Australia from February 1886 to February 1887, conducting The Mikado and other Gilbert and Sullivan operas for the J. C. Williamson organization and was absent from London during the productions of The Carp, at the Savoy, and Dorothy. Neither the music nor the libretto of Dorothy initially attracted critical praise. The Times wrote, \\"Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality.\\" Stephenson rewrote the lyrics of one of Cellier's old songs, \\"Old Dreams\\" as \\"Queen of My Heart\\"; this helped the work to find success after it transferred in December to the Prince of Wales Theatre. The following year H. J. Leslie took over the production from Edwardes and introduced new stars, including Marie Tempest. Dorothy became an even greater success at the box office and transferred in December 1888 to the Lyric Theatre, built using the profits from the production, where it ran into 1889. Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time, longer than even The Mikado, a fact that caused consternation to Cellier's friend Arthur Sullivan. Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece, and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights David Garrick and Aphra Behn, and to Oliver Goldsmith and even Shakespeare. Its success led to revivals of some of Cellier's earlier works.  Cellier returned to Australia in 1888 to conduct Dorothy and made a final brief visit there for health reasons in early 1891, together with Stephenson. His last comic operas, Doris (1889, with Stephenson) and The Mountebanks (with Gilbert, produced in January 1892, a few days after the composer's death), were both modestly successful. Also after Cellier's death, Rutland Barrington used some of his music in his 1902 adaptation of Water Babies. Often in ill health throughout his life, Cellier was unable to finish The Mountebanks, and Ivan Caryll completed the score.  Cellier owed much to the influence of Sullivan. He was a fertile melodist, and his writing exhibited elegance and refinement, although he was not able to infuse his music with humour in the way that Sullivan did.  Cellier died at his home in Bloomsbury, London, at the age of 47. He was buried in West Norwood Cemetery. Question: Where there any other later pieces after that? Answer:","output":"Yes, after Alfred Cellier's most successful comic opera Dorothy, he composed several other works. This included the comic operas Doris in 1889, which was collaborated with B. C. Stephenson, and The Mountebanks which was co-written with William Schwenck Gilbert and produced in January 1892, a few days after Cellier's death. Both these operas had modest success. Additionally, Rutland Barrington used some of Cellier's music in his 1902 adaptation of Water Babies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  Two meteorologists were good friends and discussed diverse issues weekly. This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages.

Summarize this article: Several nail salons recently inspected without notice have been shut down due to wage violations and recovered more than 47,000 owed to employees.      The Department of Labor's Wage and Workplace Standards Division recently investigated 25 nail salons in Connecticut after receiving numerous complaints from people working at nail salons and reading news coverage of \\"questionable health and employment practices at nail salons, according to the labor department.      Of those, the labor department shut down 23 nail salons for wage violations.      State Labor Commissioner Sharon M. Palmer said that the division got 47,350 back from the salons in wages owed to employees, mostly because of establishments that violated minimum wage laws. She said the division hopes to collect more money to give back to the employees.      \\"An additional 79,000 in civil penalties was levied and collected for under reporting payroll and paying employees in cash and 21,300 for wage and hour violations,\\" according to the labor department.      Officials from the labor department made unannounced visits to the salons on Aug. 3, issuing stop work orders for the following nail salons.      Unannounced visits to the salons on August 3, 2015 resulted in Stop Work orders being placed on the following establishments:      Exclusive Future Uncertain for State CHAMP Fleet      • Hartford: La Nails, American Nails, Modern Nails, Pink Nails, Touch Nails      • New Haven: Magic Nail and Spa, Fashion Nail and Spa, Outo Nails      • Stamford: Fiji Nail Salon, Cozy Nail Salon, Classic Nails, Lux Nails, Ace Nails      • Branford: Oasis Nails, Pretty Nail and Spa, Sera Nail Salon, Town Nails, Simply Nails      • Westport/Darien/Southport: Posh Nail and Spa LLC (three locations), Queen Nail and Spa, Finger Nails      At the nail salons shut down for violations, investigators learned many employees were paid with cash with no payroll records to trace it, they were paid below the minimum wage of 9.15 an hour and they weren't being paid for overtime, according to Gary Pechie, director of the Wage and Workplace Standards Division. The inspectors also took issue with the salons' worker's compensation coverage, reporting that they didn't have proper coverage.      Many salon employer groups contacted the labor department after the investigation, so the division will give them educational materials about state laws that apply to those types of businesses.      “The wage division places a high priority on outreach and education and we urge employers with questions about wage laws to contact the unit at 860-263-6790 or visit the agency website at www.ct.gov/dol and click on ‘wage and workplace standards’ for guidelines,” Pechie said.      Any other employees who weren't paid the right amount of money or who haven't received payment are encouraged to download a complaint form from the website. ||||| Labor investigators conducted the state's first enforcement sweep of 25 nail salons this month, temporarily shutting down 23 businesses and ordering at least 62,000 in back wages to more than 50 women.      The sweep, conducted by the state Department of Labor, was inspired by an investigation in the New York Times about exploitation of immigrant workers at nail salons in New York and its suburbs, including Connecticut.      Of 25 nail salons in the sweep from Hartford to Stamford, most chosen at random, only two businesses were following wage and hour laws, state officials said. The others were paying workers under the table, avoiding Social Security and unemployment taxes.      The workers, many of them Asian immigrants, were often paid less than minimum wage.      At one salon, women were being paid 40 for a 10-hour work day, according to Gary Pechie, director of wage and workplace standards at the department. Although tips may have raised those women's wages higher than the 9.15 minimum, only restaurants and bars are allowed to pay servers below the minimum and let tips make up the rest.      At the 25 salons, 119 employees were being paid under the table, but were paid at least minimum wage, Pechie said. He said the 62,000 figure in back wages could increase as the investigation continues.      The New York Times reported in May that New York's state labor department had not investigated wages in the nail salon industry because it usually responds to complaints, and had not received any from workers, most of whom do not speak English.      The Times interviewed more than 100 workers for its investigation, and found only one-quarter were earning at least the minimum wage.      Pechie said Connecticut had not done any enforcement in nail salons until now, but had received complaints from two workers after they heard about the New York Times stories. He said he also received five emails that had been sent to the governor's office, asking how Connecticut would respond to the Times' investigation.      Although the Times investigation quoted an immigrant from Ecuador who worked at a Connecticut salon, Pechie said the state's sweep only found Asian employees. He said they cooperated with the investigation, and the company heard no threats by management that the workers would be reported to immigration authorities for cooperating.      He said such threats are common when the Department of Labor inspects construction sites.      The state Department of Labor does not oversee whether employees have work visas. The department seeks to ensure that employers pay a fair wage that includes unemployment insurance and Social Security, when required.      \\"They would have to be paid as any other employee,\\" Pechie said. \\"Nobody should exploit them because of their status.\\"      Employees must supply green cards, work visas, Social Security cards or proof of citizenship to be on the books. However, since employers are not obligated to use the e-verify system, which checks out Social Security numbers, and federal immigration authorities do not inspect all documents involving new hires, the salons could continue to employ them even if the documents are faked.      There are 395 Korean-American salon owners represented by the Nail and Spa Association of Connecticut. Moo Yong Lee, who is not a salon owner, but is active in Korean American advocacy and charitable efforts, is serving as a liaison between Pechie and the salon owners, as well as Chinese and Vietnamese salon owners, as they work to comply with employment law.      Lee said Monday he was surprised that so many of the salon owners were paying their employees under the table, especially after the wide publicity from the New York Times stories — which were also published in Korean — and the enforcement actions that followed in New York and New Jersey.      Lee said he warned friends who own salons to make sure they were following the law after the New York and New Jersey salons were hit. \\"You guys be ready,\\" he said he told them. \\"They're coming.\\"      He said he was embarrassed by the results of the enforcement action, and he said the salon owners in the association asked him to tell government officials that they are \\"really deeply sorry for not following rules and regulations.\\"      The 23 salon owners who were paying workers under the table will owe 130,000 in civil penalties, some just for avoiding payroll taxes and workers' compensation, and others for also failing to pay minimum wage or overtime.      Pechie said none of the managers at the places that were raided gave the inspectors any pushback — but that several patrons did. He said the inspectors allowed manicures or pedicures in process to be completed before shutting down the businesses that were paying employees with cash.      \\"Nobody walked out with just three fingernails,\\" he said.      Lee coordinated a seminar with Pechie that will be held at the New Haven Korean Church in Hamden Aug. 26. About 150 salon owners, who are Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese, have committed to attending,      \\"They've got to learn how to operate business properly,\\" Lee said. \\"Otherwise they shouldn't live here. Really.\\"      He said salons may not make as much money after they begin paying payroll taxes and minimum wages. He said he will lobby the legislature to add manicurists to those eligible for the tipped minimum wage.      Pechie said that even without a change in the law, owners have a way to recoup some of the additional costs of compliance. They could ask the workers to give managers their tips at the end of the day.      Five salons in Hartford — LA Nails, American Nails, Modern Nails, Pink Nails and Touch Nails — were cited for not following labor laws and were temporarily shut down. The department also closed three salons in New Haven, five in Branford, five in Stamford, and five salons in the Westport-Darien-Fairfield area. ||||| Summary:","output":"The Department of Labor recently checked 25 nail salons in Connecticut and found that 23 of them were not following the rules for paying their workers. These nail salons were closed down because they were not paying their employees enough money. The Department of Labor got back 47,350 from these salons to give to the workers who were not paid enough. They also collected an extra 79,000 and 21,300 for other problems with the way the salons were paying their employees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This town was special because it was planned and built using an ancient Chinese technique called \\"feng shui\\" to make it a happy and welcoming place for all the people who lived there. Just like how we arrange our toys neatly so our room is tidy and comfortable, feng shui helps make sure that houses, buildings, and roads are put together in a way that everyone can enjoy. Now, far across the sea in another land called China, there are many people who need new places to live, work, and play. And guess what? They have heard about the amazing town of Milton Keynes, and they want to make their new cities just as welcoming and cozy! So, the city planners (they are like grown-up helpers who decide where buildings and roads should go) in China decided to use the same feng shui tips they learned from Milton Keynes to build two new, wonderful cities. These new cities will have lots of room for people to live, schools for children to learn, parks for playing, and places for grown-ups to work. By using the feng shui ideas from Milton Keynes, the city planners hope that these new cities will be just as happy and friendly as our favorite town in England. In the end, the story of Milton Keynes and its special feng shui is helping people all around the world to build cities that are gentle, harmonious, and full of life.

PLEASANT, Tenn. (WKRN) – A group of Mt. Pleasant police officers are being recognized for going out of their way to help an elderly man over the weekend.      Saturday night, the 79-year-old disabled man called dispatchers and said he had not eaten in two days.      A short time later, a group of officers showed up at his door with several bags full of groceries.      The officers had spent 160 out of their own pockets to make sure the man had enough food in his kitchen to last him a month.      “I think he was shocked at the amount of food that we bought and just the fact that it was there without question,” said Nathan Bolton.      A picture of the officers stocking the man’s cabinets was posted on Facebook and the good deed has been shared by people across the country.      “It’s difficult for us to see as police officers. We’re out here to take care of the public at large and that doesn’t always mean stopping a car. Sometimes it’s us doing little things like this,” said Mark Billions.      The police officers have since been praised for going above and beyond the call of duty.      The elderly man, who asked News 2 not to use his name, said he appreciates everything they did to help him.      The man is on a fixed income and relies on his social security benefits each month.

Pleasant Police Department Sunday night and has been identified as Tammy Brooks, 36, of Mt. Pleasant.      Police say they have surveillance video showing her using the stolen debit card at various retailers.      She is charged with theft and fraudulent use of a debit card.

Article: Parents do need to teach their kids financial responsibility and that money is earned. Still, many child-development experts agree that tying a child's allowance to chores can be a slippery slope. Here's why. Susie Walton, master instructor at Peace in Your Home advises to keep chores and allowances totally separate. \\"Allowance is one thing. When it comes to chores, life skills, responsibilities-that's a whole different thing.\\" says Walton. Walton says, \\"When kids aren't doing a chore, you don't say, 'well, there goes your allowance.' You're going to sit them down and ask what's going on. 'We are a team. We are a family. We've got to have them done.'\\" Besides, by paying children for chores with an allowance, you'll also be sending the message that work isn't worth doing unless they're getting paid for it. There are times when it would make sense to pay kids for chores. Most financial and child-development experts agree that it's a fine idea to pay children money for extra jobs that are outside their normal set of chores, such as washing windows, washing the car or helping to clean out the garage-especially if the child is saving for a big item. This may even develop an entrepreneurial   spirit to think outside of the box to earn money. For parents who are concerned that their children won't learn the value of a dollar if the allowance isn't tied to household chores, note that there are still plenty of money management skills to be learned from a straight allowance. Depending on the age, kids can be made responsible for paying for their own toys or snacks. Some parents even require that kids set aside a percentage of their allowance toward savings. \\"I really like having my own money,\\" says Kevin, 9. \\"It's up to me if I want to buy the cheap toy now, or save and get the better toy.\\" And that's a good lesson to learn at 9 years old. No matter which allowance route you take in parenthood, kids will feel empowered by being able to handle their own money.   Question: Which of the following would Susie Walton most probably agree with?   Options: (A) A child's allowance shouldn't be tied to chores. (B) Kids shouldn't be forced to do chores.

Inland Voyage(1878) was about journeys by canoe  on the rivers and canals of Belgium and France. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes followed it in next year. People loved his travel books, and they also found his poems beautiful. In 1879 he travelled to California in a very uncomfortable ship and then by train across the United States to San Francisco. He married in California, but his poor health made him and his wife travel again. Readers of his travel books and poetry were surprised when Treasure Island came out in 1883. It was not at all like his earlier writing, but both children and grown-ups loved it. Treasure Island was finished in Switzerland. Stevenson then continued to travel. He loved the islands of the southern Pacific Ocean, and he found that his health was better there. In the end, he and his wife made their home in Samoa. It was there that he wrote Kidnapped(1886), the story of David Balfour and Alan Breck. It was followed (but not immediately) by Catriona, which continues the story of David Belfour and tells of other exciting adventures of David and Alan, and of David's love for Catriona Drummond. In between the two stories about David Belfour came another surprising book, the \\"thriller\\" called The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson died in Samoa in 1894, and he is buried there. Question: Stevenson settled in Samoa because   _  .

In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper.

PUBLISHED:. 05:31 EST, 6 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:22 EST, 6 June 2013. It brings a new meaning to the phrase ‘heavy police presence’. This substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is Britain’s fattest bobby. But colleagues were quick to defend Sergeant Andy Sharp, saying he is not even the largest officer in his force. Whatever the truth, he might struggle. to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on. the thin blue line are fighting fit. On the beat: Sergeant Andy Sharp marshalling campaigners at a march in central London. Frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take. The move follows fears that some. officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of. shape. Sgt Sharp, a long-serving Met officer who specialises in. organising high-profile events, was photographed marshalling crowds on. Sunday. He was seen with road cycling star Mark  Cavendish at the Help. the Heroes charity bike ride from Blackheath to Central London. He was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through Whitehall to protest at NHS cuts. John Tully, of the Met Police. Federation, said Sgt Sharp spends most of his time on ‘desk duty’ but. comes out during the events he supervises. He said: ‘Everyone should be fit for. purpose. There is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes. officer safety training. Sgt Andy Sharp marshals protesters on a London NHS march last month. ‘Presumably he has been able to do that. Regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that.’ Police have been warned they could. face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards. set by new fitness tests. A major review by former rail. regulator Tom Winsor called for running tests and assault course-style. assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals. A survey found 52 per cent of male. officers and staff in the Met were overweight, 22 per cent were obese. and one per cent were morbidly obese. One senior officer told the review. some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot. complete the warm-up exercises’. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment. should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms. If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice. Rick Nelson, a Met officer and Federation representative who is helping design new fitness tests, said changes are being made. But he added: ‘In many cases, just. because officers are heavy it doesn’t mean they are unfit. And a very. fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job.’ 1.    Running (known as the Multi-stage shuttle run test or Bleep Test)2.    A test of strength (Dynamic Strength Test or Push-Pull)You should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test.(1) The multi-stage shuttle run test (Bleep Test)This is done first. You will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep. The speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark. The level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 (5.4). You will run 44 shuttles to reach this level.You are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient. (2) Dynamic Strength Test (Push-Pull)This test is carried out on a Concept 2 DYNO machine. After 3 warm up pushes, you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times. This is repeated with pulling instead of pushing. The mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded. The minimum level is 34 kg (push) and 35kg (pull).   You are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine. PRE Scale – As you run rate the intensity on a scale of 6 to 20. Number 6 being very, very light and 20 being exhausting. Aim for an intensity of number 14 or 15, which should feel like a HARD run. If you feel you have exceeded number 15, then slow down as you could be running too fast. Highlights:","output":"1. Sergeant Andy Sharp, considered one of the most substantial officers in the British police force, is at the heart of a conversation around physical fitness within law enforcement. 2. While there are claims of Sharp being the fattest Bobby in Britain, his colleagues defend him, stating he's not even the largest officer in his unit. 3. The debate arises as new physical fitness tests are being considered for the UK police force for maintaining fighting fitness among the officers. 4. Sharp, known for organizing high-profile events, was recently photographed with Mark Cavendish during a charity bike ride in Central London. 5. Despite concerns about fitness, officers' weight does not necessarily impede their performance, according to opinions within the force. 6. A fitness review initiated by former rail regulator Tom Winsor recommends running tests and assault course-style assessments to ensure officers' ability to chase criminals. 7. Possible repercussions for officers failing the fitness tests include pay cuts, dismissal, and supplemental fitness training. 8.

Please answer a question about the following article about History of science: At the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy contained in these texts began to be extended by notable scholastics such as Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus and Duns Scotus. Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his Opus Majus. Pierre Duhem's provocative thesis of the Catholic Church's Condemnation of 1277 led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, \\"but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277\\".

Article: One of the most important aspects of planning a trip to Iceland to catch the northern lights is to choose the right time of the year. Typically, the lights are most active from early September to the end of April each year, largely due to the longer periods of darkness during the winter. Plan a trip during these months to give yourself the best chance of seeing the northern lights. Light pollution from cities and houses can really decrease visibility of the night sky. So if you want to see the northern lights in Iceland, you should choose a destination that is removed from the lights of the city.  Avoid Reykjavik and Akureyri, where light pollution may be too severe for you to see the northern lights. If you are stuck in a town with no way out into the countryside, try heading toward the outskirts of town or finding a darker area – like the Grótta Lighthouse or a park inside Reykjavik. These regions have longer hours of full darkness and, as a result, provide greater opportunities to catch the northern lights. You will be more likely to see them the farther north you travel in Iceland. Consider traveling to the Westfjords or the most extreme north locations in Iceland. These areas have about 2 more hours of darkness (22 hours total) than Reykjavik during the peak winter months. There are many places to go camping in rural Iceland, and spending a night underneath the stars greatly increases your chances of seeing the northern lights. Camping will give you hours of observation time in a remote, dark area.  There are about 170 registered campsites in Iceland for you to choose from, but Icelandic law also allows you to pitch a tent for 1 night in residential, non-campsite areas. Just remember that Iceland can be quite cold in prime northern lights viewing months. If you plan to sleep outdoors, you’ll need to bring warm clothes, blankets, insulated sleeping bags, and a sturdy tent to protect yourself from the elements. Sign up for a guided tour that has a goal of northern lights sightings. The local tour guides will have a better idea about where to go and what the likelihood will be of seeing the lights. You can also take a boat cruise in the dark hours. People who go on these kinds of tours are often very successful at viewing the northern lights. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is: To best experience the northern lights in Iceland, plan your trip between September and April and choose a destination away from city lights. Consider traveling to the Westfjords or extreme north locations, as they have longer hours of darkness. Camping in rural areas can increase your chances of seeing the northern lights, but be prepared for cold weather. Alternatively, join a guided tour or boat cruise, as local guides can advise on the best locations and times for sightings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His death is ruled accidental, and the house left to his grandson Jeffrey. Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter's disappearance, and introduces himself as the house's owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor's home, where he meets Diane, the mayor's daughter.

Which person studied less about volcanoes in an island arc?  Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: What is the name of Butch Cassidy's gang? Hole in the wall The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Breaking the Wall\\" Genre: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama Plot Summary: In the late 1800s, a cunning and charming outlaw named Butch Cassidy leads a notorious gang, the Hole in the Wall. The gang performs several heists and train robberies, living a life of adventure and peril. The film follows the members of the gang as they face off against lawmen, form unique relationships within their ranks, and trouble the society of their time, all while staying loyal to their passionate beliefs in freedom, camaraderie, and adventure. Act 1: In the small town of Sundance, Wyoming, the Hole in the Wall gang carries out a risky bank heist while evading the pursuit of law enforcement. Members of the gang include Butch Cassidy, his right-hand man Sundance Kid, getaway driver Tommy \\"Speed\\" Smith, explosives expert Hank \\"Dynamite\\" Jones, and sharp-shooting beauty, Eliza Grey. The gang works their way through various towns and territories, acquiring admirers and rivals along the way. Act 2: The gang has a code: they will not harm innocent civilians. However, during a train heist, a member of the gang, Jasper Boone, inadvertently causes the death of a conductor. This incident leads to a fallout within the gang, as its members are torn between their code and their loyalty to one another. The impact of the conductor's death weighs heavily on the gang, especially Jasper, who is wracked with guilt and decides that he must atone for his actions.  Act 3: The Hole in the Wall gang's notoriety attracts the attention of a legendary group of lawmen called the Pinkerton Agents, led by their relentless and calculating leader, Marshal Douglas Hunt. Hunt rounds up a posse to capture Cassidy and his gang. As the Marshal and the Pinkerton Agents close in on the gang, tensions rise within the group. After a final heist goes awry, Tom Speed loses his life, and the gang finds themselves cornered by Marshal Hunt and his men in a tense stand-off. Act 4: Jasper, burdened by the guilt of his past mistakes, voluntarily surrenders to the Pinkerton Agents in exchange for assurances that his comrades will be spared from the gallows. The remaining gang members are amazed by Jasper's bravery and sacrifice, which ignites a spark of redemption in each of them. The gang members, unwilling to face capture, part ways and disappear into the night. Act 5: Marshal Hunt, feeling conflicted about the outcome of the standoff, retires from law enforcement, only to receive news years later that the Hole in the Wall gang members have turned their lives around. Butch Cassidy becomes a rancher in Argentina, Sundance Kid starts a horse training business, Hank Jones becomes a master blacksmith, and Eliza Grey starts a school for orphaned children. The film ends with the revelation that Jasper's sacrifice for his fellow gang members had a profound impact on their lives, forever changing the course of their futures. The movie \\"Breaking the Wall\\" is a thrilling, emotional, and engaging adventure that explores the captivating world of the wild west, the intriguing personalities of Butch Cassidy's Hole in the Wall gang, and the actions that lead to the ultimate redemption of these legendary outlaws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to get off a ski lift with a snowboard  Check large poles that hold up the lift for notices about unloading, such as \\" prepare to unload \\" lift the safety bar up when you see that sign.  Check to see if you have everything with you.  Lift the front end of your snowboard up a little when you see the sign that says \\" ski tips up \\".","output":"After following these initial steps, the most logical next event would be the process of safely unloading from the ski lift and getting back on the snow. To do this, follow these detailed steps: 1. Position yourself properly: As the ski lift approaches the unloading area, make sure your snowboard is parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the chairlift. You want to be sitting on the edge of the chairlift seat, with your back foot resting on your snowboard's stomp pad. 2. Look ahead and survey the area: Pay attention to other skiers and snowboarders in the unloading area. Identify a clear path where you can smoothly exit the lift. 3. Prepare to land: When the chairlift arrives at the platform, bend your knees slightly and lean forward, getting ready to use your snowboard as a platform to stand on. Make sure your front foot is securely strapped into the binding and your back foot is still on the stomp pad. 4. Exit the lift: Gently push off the chairlift seat with your hands while transferring your weight from the edge of the seat to your snowboard. Use your free back foot to guide your snowboard onto the snow, maintaining balance as both your board and the chairlift continue to move forward. 5. Glide away: Once you've landed on the snow, continue to glide forward, keeping your knees slightly bent and your weight centered over your snowboard. Steer with your back foot and avoid leaning too far forward or backward. 6. Safe distance: Glide a safe distance away from the unloading area to prevent collisions with incoming skiers and snowboarders. Make sure not to stop suddenly; this can cause a bottleneck for others trying to exit the lift. 7. Strap in your back foot: Once you are clear of the unloading area, come to a complete stop by applying pressure on your heel or toe edge, depending on your preferred braking method. Set your snowboard on a flat surface, and strap your back foot into the binding. 8. Check your gear: Before you continue snowboarding, take a moment to ensure all your equipment is secure and in good condition. Double-check your bindings, and make any necessary adjustments. 9. Plan your route: Familiarize yourself with the terrain and resort map to determine your desired route. Identify trails that match your snowboarding skill level and any landmarks that will help you navigate the mountain. 10. Enjoy the rest of your day: With your gear secure and route planned, proceed down the mountain and enjoy your snowboarding experience. Remember to always be aware of your surroundings and other riders to ensure safety for everyone. By following these steps, you will successfully unload from the ski lift with a snowboard and can continue your day on the mountain in a safe and efficient manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes.  Two groups f people presented allergy symptoms. Group Alpha inhaled some allergens, but they were in a very protected environment, while Group Beta ingested some allergens and was exposed to a wide variety of other allergens.  Which group had some people that were exposed to certain medications? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Group Beta had some people that were exposed to certain medications. The reason for this inference is that while both groups presented allergy symptoms, Group Alpha was in a very protected environment and only inhaled allergens. This suggests that the allergens causing their symptoms were limited to those that can be airborne, such as pollen or dust mites. On the other hand, Group Beta not only ingested allergens but was also exposed to a wide variety of other allergens.  Given that the exposure to various allergens was more diverse in Group Beta, it is more likely that some people in this group came into contact with specific medications that could trigger allergies. Additionally, since Group Beta ingested allergens, it's possible that some of the allergens they consumed could have been medications or substances with similar properties.  Allergic reactions to medications are not uncommon, and they can vary in severity from mild symptoms, such as skin rash or itching, to more severe ones, such as anaphylaxis. These types of medication-induced allergies can be triggered by various classes of drugs, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen), and anticonvulsants, among others. It is crucial to note that accurately determining whether someone in Group Beta was exposed to certain medications would require further investigation and examination of each individual's specific case. Ideally, this would involve gathering additional information about the allergy symptoms they displayed, the allergens they were exposed to, and their medical history, including any known allergies to medications. Moreover, allergy testing could be conducted to confirm the trigger for their allergic reaction. This might include skin tests, blood tests, or supervised oral drug challenges, where small amounts of the suspected medication are administered in a controlled environment to observe the individual's response. In conclusion, it is more likely that Group Beta had some people who were exposed to certain medications, as they were subjected to a wider range of allergens and also ingested allergens. However, to confirm this assumption, more information and testing would be necessary to establish a clear connection between the individuals' allergic symptoms and the specific medications to which they may have been exposed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

În contextul dreptului european al concurenţei, sectorul autovehiculelor este guvernat din anul 1985 de un regulament general privind exceptarea pe categorii, pentru a se ţine cont de caracteristicile sale specifice: situaţia de oligopol, produse de înaltă tehnicitate şi durată de viaţă îndelungată. Translate this to English?","output":"In the context of European competition law, the automotive sector has been governed since 1985 by a general regulation on block exemptions, taking into account its specific characteristics: an oligopolistic situation, high-tech and long-lasting products. In the context of the European competition law, the automotive sector holds a special place, given its unique features. Since 1985, it has been regulated by a general regulation concerning block exemptions, aiming to address the specific characteristics of this sector: the oligopolistic situation of the market, the high-technology, and the extended lifespan of the products. An oligopolistic situation stands for a market that is highly concentrated among a small number of large firms. This often results in those key companies having significant influence on the market, which in turn can affect competition. The automotive sector generally exhibits this type of market structure, with a limited number of major manufacturers dominating the market. In addition to the oligopolistic state of the market, the automotive sector is also characterized by producing high-tech and long-lasting products. This particularity makes this industry distinct from other industries in terms of competition. High-tech goods require substantial investment in research and development (R&D), as well as continuous innovation to meet the ever-growing demand for advanced technology. These investments contribute to consolidating the market's oligopolistic character, as smaller companies may struggle to keep pace with larger competitors regarding R&D. Furthermore, the long-lasting nature of automotive products implies that consumers are less likely to purchase vehicles frequently. Consequently, this results in a sector relatively less dynamic in terms of competition, with fewer transactional opportunities to enter the market. The general regulation on block exemptions, introduced in 1985, was designed to account for these specific aspects of the automotive sector under the European competition law. By applying this regulation, it aims to maintain a balanced competitive environment and prevent large manufacturers from abusing their dominant position in the market. Additionally, it allows for more flexibility in the application of the rules, especially when innovation and highly technical aspects are involved, ensuring that the overall competitiveness of the European automotive sector prevails in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Fruit-eating bats receive food from plants and, in return, help these plants by doing what?   A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the question being asked. The question concerns the relationship between fruit-eating bats and plants, specifically what the bats do to help plants in return for receiving food from them. Step 2: Research or recall relevant information about fruit-eating bats and their role in plant ecosystems. Fruit-eating bats, also known as frugivorous bats, are important pollinators and seed dispersers in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. They primarily feed on fruits and nectar of various plants. Step 3: Formulate a concise answer based on the knowledge gathered. Fruit-eating bats help plants by pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds. As the bats eat fruits, they spread pollen from one plant to another, facilitating pollination. Additionally, when bats consume fruits and excrete seeds away from the parent plant, they aid in seed dispersal, contributing to the spread and growth of plant populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translate to Romanian Romanian:","output":"Milos Bugarin, conducătorul Camerei de Comerț a Serbiei, afirmă că nu a existat nicio boicotare a produselor provenite din Kosovo. Explicație detaliată și lungă: Recent, Milos Bugarin, liderul Camerei de Comerț a Serbiei, a făcut o declarație în care susține că produsele provenite din Kosovo nu au fost boicotate de către Serbia. Această afirmație vine în contextul în care relațiile economice dintre cele două state sunt tensionate din cauza disputelor politice și istorice dintre ele. Acest lucru este important, deoarece boicotul reprezintă un act voluntar de a nu cumpăra, vinde sau utiliza anumite bunuri sau servicii dintr-un anumit loc sau țară. Când o țară își boicotează vecinul, pot apărea consecințe economice negative, cum ar fi pierderea locurilor de muncă, scăderea veniturilor și creșterea tensiunilor politice. Prin negarea unui astfel de boicot, Bugarin încearcă să transmită un mesaj de stabilitate și cooperare între Serbia și Kosovo în ceea ce privește comerțul și relațiile economice. Aceasta înseamnă că Serbia nu a avut intenția de a destabiliza economia Kosovo-ului prin refuzul de a cumpăra produsele acestuia și de a afecta negativ populația și mediul de afaceri din această țară. Totuși, este important de menționat că, deși Bugarin a negat un boicot oficial, există posibilitatea ca persoane sau organizații individuale să fi luat măsuri de boicotare în mod independent de deciziile guvernului sau ale Camerei de Comerț. Aceasta ar putea însemna că, în ciuda acestor afirmații, produsele provenite din Kosovo s-au confruntat cu rezistență pe piața locală din Serbia. În concluzie, afirmativa lui Milos Bugarin cu privire la inexistența unui boicot al produselor kosovare de către Serbia reflectă intențiile autorităților sârbe de a menține relații economice stabile cu Kosovo, în ciuda tensiunilor politice existente. Fie că această declarație este un efort de a indrepta percepțiile față de Serbia, fie că reprezintă realitatea situației economice actuale dintre cele două țări, rămâne de văzut.

According to the first sentence, by late afternoon, the Dow Jones was up 12.81 points, or 0.1 percent, at 9,331.77. This implies that during the course of the day, it gained 12.81 points to reach this figure. The second sentence seems to portray the morning trading situation of the same day.

Also, both sentences detail that the Dow Jones had gained 201 points on Monday to its highest level since July 2002. This information from two distinct periods of the same day should align, yet the numerical details provided (9310.20 vs 9331.77) show a discrepancy in the values.

Instructions: In this task the focus is on physical knowledge about the world. Given the provided goal task in the input, describe a process that would lead to the asked outcome. This process often involves physical motions with objects, such as moving them, arranging them in a certain way, mixing them, shaking them, etc.  Input: how do you rinse off? Output:","output":"To rinse off, you would typically use water to wash away any soap, dirt, or debris from your body, hair, or any other surface that needs cleaning.  Using the definition, I recognized that the primary goal is to wash away unwanted substances, and the most common and effective way to achieve this is by using water. Water acts as a universal solvent and helps break down and dilute various substances like soap and dirt.  Here's a step-by-step process to rinse off: 1. Stand under a running shower or hold a container filled with water above the area that needs rinsing. 2. Pour or let the water flow or shower onto the surface, ensuring it covers the entire area. 3. Use your hands to gently rub or splash the water on the surface, helping to facilitate the rinsing process. 4. Continue pouring or directing water over the area so that the soap, dirt, or debris is washed away. 5. Once the area is clean and free of unwanted substances, stop the water flow or cease pouring from the container, allowing the excess water to drain off. By following these actions, the definition of the goal task is met by removing any unwanted substances using water effectively."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Althou... i wonder why i haven't heard of it before.\\" First of all, the movie starts with tits. Lots of tits. Tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to. Who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots! So, about the mysterious darkwolf character (a little spoilers ahead, but who really cares...) He's your average everyday biker. Not even super-tough looking, but like the old wise woman says in the movie \\"he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before.\\" Just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy. Pretty original. I even had look twice when they first used the \\"red glowing eyes\\" SPECIAL EFFECT! I mean my god, that \\"lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer\\" effect has been used since the seventies. It looks plain ugly here! And don't get me started with the werewolf 3D-CGI. As said before, like an bad and old video game. And finally, as i do like werewolf films, like i said. They prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own. Darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well, about some silly legends of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline. BUT. It almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement \\"the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched\\" starts random-slashing. Which just doesn't make any sense, why even bother telling us the rules of killing, when they aren't even gonna play by them... Aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a sony handycam or something, filming mostly the floor and walls. Just add growling noises and you've got a super werewolf effect. The gore is partially OK. But when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand, just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims, it just doesn't do the trick for me...

Several elephants pulled leafy branches from the tree covered the sleeping baby. Flies can be a problem in Africa and the branches protected the baby from the flies. The elephants were so gentle and quiet that they did not even wake up the baby. Then the elephants walked away.    An English magazine offers another story.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: As you can see in Figure above , solid and liquid solutes generally become more soluble as the temperature increases. This is true for solvents other than water as well. This effect varies quite a bit by substance. For example, the solubility of KNO 3 has a very strong temperature dependence (its solubility curve has a large slope), whereas the solubility of NaCl is minimally influenced by temperature (its solubility curve is nearly flat). For gaseous solutes, solubility decreases at higher temperatures. We will look more at this effect later in the lesson.  I am facing a new situation today: Keith was a studying for his chemistry exam. He got interested in solubility of different substances. For that, he conducted five tests, test A, test B, test C, test D, and test E. in test A, he used some liquid solute in a solvent in room temperature. Then in test B, he increased the temperature. In test C, he used some gaseous solute in a solvent in room temperature. But in test D, he increased the temperature. Finally, in test E he replaced the solvents in each of the earlier tests with water.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which case the solute would be less soluble, case C or case D?","output":"Based on the information from the background article and the description of the tests Keith conducted:  - In Test C, he used a gaseous solute in a solvent at room temperature. - In Test D, he used the same gaseous solute in the same solvent but increased the temperature.

Since the temperature was increased in Test D compared to Test C, the solute would be less soluble in Test D.

Many people still remember when they were young, they often played games like hide-and-seek and chess. Playing teaches children how to get along with others, and it also helps to exercise the mind and body. However, children today spent most of their playing time in front of the computer, playing video games.

Although some people will say that gaming is helpful, it brings many problems as well. One big problem is that kids who spend most of their time on games might have difficulty communicating with real people.

Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter  has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing  a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition  of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. A:","output":"What is the main focus of the article on drunken driving in the United States? A) The historical context of alcohol consumption in the US B) The national epidemic of drunken driving and its consequences C) The effectiveness of raising the legal drinking age D) The comparison between alcohol prohibition and the drug trade"},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Do you have any skiing equipment you are no longer need? A ski school in the far north of India could put it to good use. In March we published a photo story about the extraordinary Zsnskar region in northern India,which is cut off from the outside world for more than seven months of the year,and only accessible  via a frozen river.We also included information about the limited use of skiing in the region and the recent creation of the Zanskar Ski School: \\"Despite the difficulties of travelling through the region when the snow comes,skiing hasn't traditionally been used as a means of transport by the locals,largely because trees don't grow here,so there is little in the way of raw materials  from which to make skis.In 1995,a group of British scientists in the region noticed the lack of skis and one of them returned to set up the Zanskar Ski School in Padam.The school provides lessons for a small fee and rents skis to the local people.Among the benefits that the school hopes to bring are improved education--children often find it difficult to get to school through the deep snow--and the possibility of offering ski tours to tourists in the future.So far,more than 300 local people have received training,and local doctors and policemen regularly borrow skis.\\" But,what we weren't able to include in the article is that the ski school is always on the look out for old skiing equipment--particularly of a size suitable for children--and,I thought.now the European ski season is drawing to a close,there might be a few of you out there who have some old equipment you'd like to see go to a good home.If that's the ease you can get in touch with the school via their website www.zanskarskischooL.org.

When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him.

The U's struck twice in the last nine minutes to register their first away win since promotion from League Two. Bolton have now failed to score in their last four matches and have not won a game since Phil Parkinson was named manager of the month for August. Second best for most of the afternoon, Wanderers failed to seriously test goalkeeper Simon Eastwood despite using six different strikers during the course of the game. Oxford shaded a dull first half, with Maguire forcing Mark Howard into a scrambling save early on. Bolton picked up briefly after the break as Charlie Raglan headed Zach Clough's cross from under his own crossbar. But it was Oxford who made the running late on, Kane Hemmings firing at Howard, who then denied sub Alex MacDonald with another snap shot. Thomas became the first player other than Hemmings to score away from home for the U's this season with nine minutes left. And Maguire added insult to injury in the final minute, tapping into an empty net after Howard had palmed away Hemmings' stinging shot. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Answer this question: who came up with the big 5 personality theory??","output":"The Big Five personality theory, also known as the Five-Factor Model (FFM), is a widely accepted and well-established psychological model that seeks to explain the nuances of human personality through five broad dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN). This model has its roots in the Lexical Hypothesis, which suggests that the most important individual-differences are encoded into natural language. The development of the Big Five personality theory is a result of the collaborative effort of several researchers over an extended period. The foundation was initially laid by two independent research teams working during the 1960s and 1970s:  1. Warren T. Norman’s team at the University of Michigan, including notable contributions by researchers such as Louis R. Goldberg and Raymond Cattell. 2. Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal’s team at the U.S. Air Force Personnel Laboratory, involving significant contributions from J.M. Digman and numerous other researchers through the years. The initial work from Tupes and Christal in 1961 was based on the psychological analysis of military servicemen within the U.S. Air Force. At the time, they identified five broad factors for personality traits – a striking resemblance to the Big Five model known today. Although their research was groundbreaking, it went relatively unnoticed by the scientific community at the time, especially since their paper was published in an Air Force Technical Report, rather than an academic journal. Simultaneously, Norman and his team, building upon the work of psychologists like Cattell and Gordon Allport, developed their research by assessing thousands of adjectives found in the English language. These adjectives were reduced in number to describe the most significant personality differences. Norman’s team eventually arrived at similar conclusions regarding the existence of five overarching factors.  However, the Big Five framework only began to gain wider acceptance during the 1980s, primarily due to the work of psychologists Paul Costa and Robert McCrae. They further developed the theory and validated it through various systematic techniques, including statistical methodologies like factor analysis. Costa and McCrae's work eventually led to the creation of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) – an assessment instrument widely used to measure the Big Five personality traits. In conclusion, the development of the Big Five personality theory is attributed to various psychologists and researchers, including Tupes and Christal, Norman, Goldberg, Cattell, Costa, and McCrae, who worked collectively over several decades to approximate human personality in a comprehensive and empirically supported manner. The Big Five theory's legacy reflects academic collaboration and the gradual accumulation of knowledge to deepen our understanding of human personality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

Premise: The blacksmith's shop in the center of the village became the focus of this activity because it was the blacksmith who often officiated at these ceremonies, striking his anvil with a hammer to signify that the union was official. Hypothesis: The blacksmith shop is always busy with customers. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While it is true that the blacksmith's shop in the center of the village became the focus of this activity because the blacksmith often officiated at ceremonies, this information does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the blacksmith shop is always busy with customers. The premise and the hypothesis are related, yet distinct concepts. The premise provides us with information about the significance and role of the blacksmith's shop in the village's traditions and ceremonies. It tells us that the shop was central to the union ceremonies, and that the blacksmith played an important part in solidifying these unions. By striking his anvil with a hammer, the blacksmith symbolically linked the union of two people with the strong and lasting nature of forged metal. However, the hypothesis focuses on the business aspect of the blacksmith's shop. It posits that the shop is always busy with customers, but the premise given does not provide any direct evidence supporting this claim. We know that the blacksmith's shop held a central role in certain ceremonies, but that does not guarantee constant customer activity within the shop. It is plausible to assume that the blacksmith's shop might be busier than other shops due to its central role in village ceremonies and perhaps because the blacksmith would be providing services like forging tools and fixing equipment. However, it is crucial to differentiate between the shop's importance in ceremonies and its overall customer traffic. The premise provided does not give sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the blacksmith shop is always busy with customers. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. While the blacksmith's shop has a significant role in village ceremonies and traditions, this fact does not directly lead to the conclusion that the shop would always be busy with customers. The premise and hypothesis are related, but they focus on different aspects of the blacksmith's shop: one on its symbolic and ceremonial relevance, the other on its commercial success and customer traffic."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Infectious disease occurs when a person is infected by a pathogen from another person or an animal. It is a problem that causes harm at both individual and macro scales. The Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) operates a surveillance system to minimize infectious disease contagions. However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading. We believe that this study's models can help eliminate reporting delays in existing surveillance systems and, therefore, minimize costs to society.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Orci was born in Mexico City on July 20, 1973, to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother. His mother immigrated to the United States with her parents after Fidel Castro came to power. Orci grew up in Mexico, and moved with his family to the United States at the age of 10. He was raised in Texas, Los Angeles and Canada. In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman confirmed to Variety that they are no longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate on television. Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider-Man film franchise, while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3. Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman's K/O Paper Products continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios, and has created the series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O'Brien for the 2014-15 season and Limitless was created for the 2015-16 season from the 2011 film.  Prior to the split of Kurtzman and Orci, the duo were lined up to write the third film in the new Star Trek series. In May 2014, Skydance and Paramount Pictures announced that Orci was to direct the third installment of the Star Trek reboot franchise, after Abrams moved on to direct Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This would have marked Orci's directorial debut, and he was to write the script alongside co-writers JD Payne and Patrick McKay. Due to his commitment to Star Trek 3, he dropped out of a new Power Rangers film, for which he would have been executive producer. But on December 5, it was announced he would no longer be directing the Star Trek film. He remains credited as a producer on the film, and was replaced by Doug Jung and cast member Simon Pegg as the script writers after Orci's initial script was dropped. Orci was replaced as director by Justin Lin, who had previously directed films in The Fast and the Furious franchise.  Orci created Matador with the idea that the main character would be a \\"soccer player by day who is a spy by night\\", and called him a \\"Latin James Bond\\". The series was broadcast on the El Rey Network created by Robert Rodriguez. It was renewed for a second season shortly before the pilot was broadcast, which had been directed by Rodriguez.

Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army. After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade.

In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views.

Here is an article: President Barack Obama signaled Monday he'll propose a major infrastructure program and an extension of a payroll tax break in the jobs speech he planned to deliver Thursday before a joint session of Congress. In an animated Labor Day talk before an enthusiastic crowd of union members in Detroit, Mr. Obama, who has been battered by low poll numbers and a sense that he's been unable to recharge the economy, sought to seize the initiative at the outset of a week in which both parties will focus heavily on job-creation ideas. \\"We've got roads and bridges across this country that need to be rebuilt,\\" Mr. Obama said. \\"We've got private companies with the equipment and manpower to do the building. We've got more than one million unemployed construction workers ready to get dirty right now.\\" President Barack Obama at a Labor Day event in Detroit. Mr. Obama also stressed his desire to extend a payroll tax holiday for workers, which has reduced the Social Security tax rate from 6.2% to 4.2% of earnings but expires at year's end. Mr. Obama didn't mention whether he will also push to expand the reduction to cover employers, who also pay 6.2%, an idea backed by some in the administration. \\"I think putting money back in the pockets of working families is the best way to get demand rising, because that means businesses hiring and that means the economy growing,\\" Mr. Obama said. As important as the speech's content was its tone. It was feisty and framed in part as a challenge to Republicans to join his jobs push and, as the president put it, to prove they care as much about the middle class as they say they do. Mr. Obama delivered the address as his approval ratings had slipped to the lowest of his presidency, with voters frustrated he and members of Congress had been unable to jump-start the economy. Adding to the frustration was a report Friday showing that the U.S. created no new jobs in August and unemployment remained at 9.1%. Both parties are focusing on jobs this week. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is laying out his jobs plan Tuesday in Las Vegas. The GOP candidates hold a debate on Wednesday—the first to include Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the newly minted front-runner—and job creation will likely to be a major topic. Mr. Obama is scheduled to deliver his address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday evening, promising to offer a broad plan to add more jobs. The White House has been debating whether to put forth a limited package that both parties can agree on, or to offer a grander vision that is unlikely to pass Congress but could serve as a rallying point for Democrats heading toward the election and to underline the differences between the two parties. Both parties are aware of polls showing the public deeply disenchanted with the bickering that surrounded the recent debate on raising the federal debt limit. Both have sought in recent days to show they're willing to reach across party lines, as Mr. Obama did Monday. \\"I still believe both parties can work together to solve our problems,\\" said the president. \\"Given the urgency of this moment, given the hardship families are facing, we've got to get together.\\" He balanced that with strong words for Republicans, addressing a concern among many rank-and-file Democrats that the president has not done enough to challenge Republicans. \\"We're going to see if we've got some straight-shooters in Congress,\\" Mr. Obama said. \\"You say you're the party of tax cuts. Prove you'll fight as hard for tax cuts for working families as for oil companies and most affluent Americans. Show us what you've got.\\" In recent days, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.) has said Republicans could support at least parts of Mr. Obama's infrastructure plans, particularly a proposal to give states more control over such projects. He has also cited Mr. Obama's support of a Georgia program, popular with Republicans, that allows companies to audition workers for eight weeks while the workers receive unemployment checks. The next few months could be critical for both parties. Congress will struggle to strike another budget deal, Republicans will try to sort out their presidential field, and Mr. Obama will work to regain his footing—and all will wait to see if the economy shows more signs of life. After the Thursday speech, Mr. Obama plans to travel the country promoting his job-creation ideas. It starts Friday with a trip to Richmond, Va.

These techniques have been used to convert various establishments McDonald's of different Spanish cities around a show [...] Make this lower case","output":"These techniques have been used to convert various establishments McDonald's of different Spanish cities around a show. These techniques have been employed to transform multiple McDonald's establishments in different Spanish cities into a spectacular display. To provide you with specific details, let's delve into the strategies and processes involved in this transformation. First, it is essential to analyze the location and demographic of each Spanish city where a McDonald's establishment is present. Oftentimes, a city's culture, history, and dominant age group can influence the overall atmosphere and marketing strategies that would be effective. One technique used is the incorporation of the local culture and architectural styles in the interior and exterior design of the McDonald's establishments. By blending with the city's historic and cultural appeal, McDonald's creates an atmosphere that resonates with local patrons. This could include elements such as Spanish-tiled floors, intricate ironwork accents, or even incorporating regional artworks and materials. Another technique is to create a digital, immersive experience within the McDonald's establishments. This can include interactive touchscreens showcasing the local city's highlights, upcoming events, or special promotions. These digital features can keep customers engaged while waiting for their orders, enhancing their overall experience and visiting frequency. Customizing the menu and offerings according to regional preferences and local seasonal ingredients is another technique McDonald's adopts in different Spanish cities. By offering regional dishes and adapting to local tastes, McDonald's demonstrates its commitment to understanding and catering to the unique preferences and needs of various Spanish communities. Focusing on local artistic and theatrical scenes, McDonald's may also opt to host events, sponsor shows, or support community initiatives in these Spanish cities. This could involve collaborating with local talents and artists, creating unique events, or sponsoring relevant celebrations. The aim is to connect with the locals and create a sense of community and belonging around the McDonald's brand. In line with the idea of collaboration, McDonald's may also partner with local schools, universities, or businesses to offer internships, scholarships, or other opportunities. This fosters goodwill and allows the brand to form strong connections with the community while providing valuable resources and support. Finally, sustainability initiatives can also be implemented in these McDonald's establishments. By adopting eco-friendly practices such as energy-efficient LED lighting, using solar panels, recycling waste, or installing electric vehicle charging stations, McDonald's demonstrates its dedication to environmental responsibility and stewardship, which can attract environmentally-conscious customers. In conclusion, transforming McDonald's establishments in different Spanish cities into spectacular shows implicates a combination of various techniques, including the incorporation of local culture and history, offering a customized menu, partnering with local businesses and schools, and implementing sustainability initiatives. These strategies not only enhance the customer experience but also build strong connections with the local community, ensuring a more profound integration of the McDonald's brand."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: Article: The owner of a missing cat is asking for help. \\"My baby has been missing for over a month now, and I want him back so badly,\\" said Mrs. Brown, a 56-year-old woman. Mrs. Brown lives by herself in a trailer park near Clovis. She said that Clyde, her 7-year-old cat, didn't come home for dinner more than a month ago. The next morning he didn't appear for breakfast either. After Clyde missed an extra-special lunch, she called the police. When the policeman asked her to describe Clyde, she told him that Clyde had beautiful green eyes, had all his teeth but was missing half of his left ear, and was seven years old and completely white. She then told the officer that Clyde was about a foot high. A bell went off. \\"Is Clyde your child or your pet?\\" the officer suspiciously asked. \\"Well, he's my cat, of course,\\" Mrs. Brown replied. \\"Lady, you're supposed to report missing PERSONS, not missing CATS,\\" said the _ policeman. \\"Well, who can I report this to?\\" she asked. \\"You can't. You have to ask around your neighborhood or put up flyers,\\" replied the officer. Mrs. Brown figured that a billboard would work a lot better than an 8\\"x11\\" piece of paper on a telephone pole. There was an empty billboard at the end of her street just off the interstate  highway. The billboard had a phone number on it. She called that number, and they told her they could blow up a picture of Clyde (from Mrs. Brown's family album) and put it on the billboard for all to see. \\"But how can people see it when they whiz  by on the interstate?\\" she asked. \\"Oh, don't worry, ma'am, they only whiz by between 2 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. The rest of the day, the interstate is so full of commuters that no one moves.\\" They told her it would cost only 3,000 a month. So she took most of the money out of her savings account and rented the billboard for a month. The month has passed, but Clyde has not appeared.

The soybeans don't need to be finely chopped, as long as they're mixed in well. -Let them soak for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the water runs clear. This recipe makes approximately 1 cup of virgin natto. -Rinse the beans well with cool water and drain the colander before proceeding. If you don't have a colander, soak the soybeans in clean water for five minutes. -Shake the beans well afterward to remove the excess moisture. As you rinse the soybeans, remove any shrunken or discolored beans.","output":"-Shake the beans well afterward to remove the excess moisture. As you rinse the soybeans, remove any shrunken or discolored beans. Explanation: The correct answer is shaking the beans well to remove excess moisture and removing any shrunken or discolored beans. This is because after washing the soybeans, you need to get rid of excess water and ensure that only good quality beans are used. - The first choice is incorrect because it doesn't make sense to mention the soybeans don't need to be finely chopped, as it is not relevant to the provided instructions. - The second choice is incorrect because it says to let them soak for 1 to 3 minutes, but that is not the next step after rinsing the soybeans. - The third choice is incorrect because it mentions rinsing the beans and draining the colander, which has already been done in the previous step."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: This will remove any tangles or knots from the hair before misting and styling them. When picking out a brush match it to the doll's hair. For example, if your doll has straight hair use the normal brush. But if it has wavy hair use the pick, both sold in-store and online at American Girl. Curly doll hair should be handled with extreme care. Separate tangles carefully with the pick so it doesn't get damaged. This will calm the stray pieces and keep it down. Be sure to brush the hair after a few mists and not drench them. Bottles made for especially their hair are sold again at American Girl. To reduce tangles, you can mix a small amount of conditioner into the water. Don't make it thick at all or it might clog your bottle. With these items you can style the doll's hair. These styles can range from simple ponytails to complicated pullback flipped braids. Again, these styles vary from what hair your doll comes with.  To make buns on a doll with textured, curly hair, divide in half and pull each half through a hairband, but only part of the way. This will loop the hair in the back and make two buns. Summary:","output":"The article provides guidance on how to properly maintain and style American Girl doll hair while avoiding damage. It emphasizes the importance of choosing the right brush according to the type of doll's hair: a normal brush for straight hair, and a pick for wavy hair. Curly hair requires extra care, using the pick to separate tangles gently. To style the hair, misting is recommended, with American Girl offering special bottles for this purpose. One can add a small amount of conditioner to the water to reduce tangles, but ensuring the mixture isn't too thick to prevent clogging. The article mentions that various hairstyles can be achieved, ranging from simple ponytails to intricate braids. For dolls with textured, curly hair, buns can be created by splitting the hair into two halves and partially pulling each half through a hairband, resulting in loops that form two buns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Falcons opened the scoring with a field goal from NFL legend Morten Andersen which set the all-time record for field goals, cementing the Dane's place in league history. The Panthers opened the game with several running plays which would set the tone for the game.

The game ended 10-3. In total the Panthers only passed 7 times, connecting on 4.

I went to this salon for the first time because my boyfriend lives in the apartment complex located behind the shopping plaza that Modern Salon is in.  I made an appointment with the idea to get my hair cut and some fun color added into my long hair, kind of a rose gold ombre effect that is so popular right now.    My appointment was with Janine.  She is fantastic.  Since I wanted something a little more complex she was very honest telling me that she does not quite have the skill level to give me the ombre coloring that I wanted and checked to see if there was another stylist available to do the color.  Thankfully there was a senior stylist available to do the color.  Janine went ahead and cut my hair beautifully and I would definitely go back to Janine for another hair cut.  The senior stylist that squeezed me in for my color was awful.  I regret that I do not remember her name.  She had no patience for me.  I had some pictures of the type of color effect I wanted and she kept arguing with me that all of the pictures were different and that I needed to pick one.  I finally settled on one of the pictures as an example and she got to work.  She did not talk to me the entire time, just to her assistants that were helping her juggle 3 clients at the same time.  She added the color to my hair and as I sat with foil in, I realized she only did the top half of my head when she and I discussed doing the bottom around the face more.  I got her attention again and asked if she was going to add more to the bottom and again she started arguing with me about how this is exactly what the picture showed and that I would see once she was done.  Needless to say that it was not exactly what the picture was and not at all what I wanted.  Since I have very dark hair and my hair took longer to lift to the desired color, she told me that I would have to go home and come back later that day or tomorrow for her to finish!  I HAD TO GO HOME HALF BLONDE HALF BRUNETTE.  It was NOT a good look for an Asian girl to have.    I went to the front counter and when I was told what the total was for the day, I burst into tears (not my proudest moment).  They immediately got the manager and I told her that her Senior Stylist was not listening to me and that I was horrified that I had to go home with half of a hair color.  The manager was great and understood completely.  She ended up comping the entire thing and scheduled me an appointment for the next day with a different stylist completely.    The second stylist was Victoria.  She was fantastic and listened and gave me exactly what I wanted.  I would definitely go back to her.  Overall, traumatic experience but I would go back only because the salon treated me well and tried to correct it as quickly as possible.  AND I don't think the stylist from before works there anymore. :) Options: A. negative; B. positive;","output":"B. positive The review is positive because the client highlights the positive aspects of their experience with Janine and Victoria, both talented and attentive stylists, which compensated for the negative experience with the senior stylist.

The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down, or \\"dropping out,\\" the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that in order to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built in May 1st 1776, according to a cornerstone). Coincidentally, another relevant event related to that date is the foundation of the Illuminati Society. For the pigs, the House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tried to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate...

These people had a job to take care of everyone's health. They made sure that everyone stayed fit and strong. But these days, they are feeling worried. This is because, more and more people are becoming obese. Obese means becoming very overweight. It's like having too much air in a balloon, making it bigger and bigger.  Obesity rates mean how many people are obese in a given area, like a town or a country. Now, these rates are increasing, which means that more and more people are becoming obese. The Health Officials are unhappy about this because obesity can lead to many health problems.   When you're obese, it can be hard to walk, run, or play with friends. It can also make you feel tired more easily. Obesity can also cause some other health problems like heart issues, diabetes and other illnesses. It's like trying to carry a big, heavy bag with you everywhere you go - it's not good for your body. There are many reasons why people become obese. One reason is eating too much of unhealthy food. Unhealthy food has less good stuff in it, like vitamins and minerals that make our bodies strong and healthy. Instead, they have lots of sugar, salt, and fat. These things can make us gain weight very fast. It's like watering a plant too much - it won't grow well if you give it more than it needs. Another reason for obesity is not exercising enough. Exercising is like a magical potion for our bodies - it helps us stay fit, healthy, and full of energy. But if we don't exercise, our bodies can become weak, and obesity may sneak in. To help people avoid becoming obese, the Health Officials are working on many plans. They want to teach everyone about eating healthy food and exercising regularly. They also want to help people who are already obese to become healthier again. When everyone works together to eat healthy and exercise, the obesity rates will not rise anymore, and the Health Officials will be happy again. So let's all do our part and live healthy lives, make good choices and stay strong!"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],E={key:0},q={key:1};function F(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
