Underneath, our protagonist, JASON, early 30s, stands wearing weathered clothes, a reflection of weary life choices. The soft strumming of a guitar begins, building the mood for introspection.) VERSE 1 (Cut to: JASON walking aimlessly down an urban street lined with similar street lights. Each one he passes triggers a flashback of his younger self, engaging in various reckless activities at night: street racing, graffiti, heated arguments.) (Quick cuts: JASON's throwbacks revealing his involvement with the wrong crowd, the allure of easy money, and close calls with the law.) JASON (V.O.) (Reflective, filled with regret) Every light's a story, a wrong turn on my path, Traded dreams for the fast life, chasing shadows, feeling wrath. CHORUS (Cut to: JASON standing in the center of a circle of street lights, symbolizing a crossroad. The music swells as he glances around, each light now pulsating with the rhythm of the song.) (As the chorus hits, images of JASON’s loved ones appear under each light - a disappointed parent, a lost love, a friend who tried to steer him right.) JASON (V.O.) (Stronger, more determined) But there's no reason, no reason, To keep dancing with the night, No reason, no reason, To not chase the morning light. VERSE 2 (Cut to: A progression of scenes showing JASON resisting temptations. He ignores a call to join a late-night heist, turns away from a street brawl, rejects a quick cash offer that's clearly illegal.) (Overlay: Translucent images of happier times like graduation, family gatherings, and old dreams of success.) JASON (V.O.) (Beginning to find his resolve) Each light whispers a promise, each shadow tells a lie, Got lost in dark illusions, it's time to say goodbye. BRIDGE (Cut to: JASON at the same circle of street lights, the night deepens, he's deep in thought. A gentle breeze nudges him onward, toward a new direction.) (Slow-motion: JASON reaching out to turn off one of the street lights, symbolically closing one chapter of his life.) JASON (V.O.) (A mix of hope and resolve) I’m shedding skins of my past, letting go of the beast, In the silence of the night, I’ll find my peace. CHORUS (Return to reality: JASON moves from the circle toward a dawn-lit street. The once dark alleyways now bathe in soft, golden light.) (The chorus hits again, and we see the faces under the street lights transform - the disappointment turns to hope, the lost love shows forgiveness, the friend nods with pride.) JASON (V.O.) (Now confident and embracing change) 'Cause there's a reason, a reason, To break free from the past’s cage, A reason, a reason, To turn to a brand new page. OUTRO (Fade out: JASON walks towards the rising sun, a symbolic departure from his night-filled past. The final street light goes out, marking the end of an era. JASON's silhouette blends with the dawn, an emblem of new beginnings.) JASON (V.O.)

As he daydreams of aerodynamic feats and romance, a hooded figure draped in black, carrying a large, ancient tome under one arm, scuttles awkwardly between the stalls of farm equipment. This is the GRIM REAPER, who seems terribly out of place and oddly distracted. GRIM REAPER (muttering to himself) Scythes... scythes... Where on Earth do these mortals keep their quality scythes... Takeshi turns from the window, backing into the Grim Reaper. They collide, and the Grim Reaper's book tumbles to the ground. Takeshi is more shocked by the appearance of the Grim Reaper than the collision itself. TAKESHI (in disbelief) Woah! Are you... the Grim Reaper?! GRIM REAPER (irritably) Yes, yes, young man, the harvester of souls, yadda yadda. Now, if you'd be so kind, help me with my tome. I'm on a rather peculiar errand for farming mechanisms.

Hidenori, mouth agape, looks down at his well-worn shoes, then back up at the Grim Reaper in disbelief as he walks away. HIDENORI (somewhat offended) Hey! These are limited-edition... from... five years ago. Takeshi chuckles, nudging Hidenori's side with a grin. TAKESHI (laughing) Who knew Mr. Death himself was such a fashion critic? But man, we need to get you new shoes before you're roasted again – this time by someone literally from the grave! Hidenori chuckles awkwardly, looking down at his beloved sneakers.

It was a sunny day, and I had decided to challenge myself by taking an unfamiliar route that promised breathtaking views. As I hiked further along the trail, I began to encounter more rugged terrain and steep slopes. Suddenly, I noticed a fellow hiker struggling to make his way down a particularly treacherous section. His face showed signs of exhaustion and fear. Without hesitation, I approached him and asked if he needed any assistance. The hiker introduced himself as Daniel. He explained that he had twisted his ankle and was finding it difficult to navigate the uneven path. It was evident that he was in considerable pain and could barely put any weight on his injured foot. Understanding the urgency of the situation, I decided to offer my help and support. I quickly fashioned a makeshift splint from a sturdy tree branch and some bandages I had in my backpack. Gently, I secured the splint around Daniel's ankle, providing him with some stability and relief. With the splint in place, I adjusted Daniel's backpack and offered to carry some of his extra gear to ease his burden. As we continued our descent, I engaged in light conversation to distract him from the discomfort and reassure him that we were making progress. I also provided guidance and assistance whenever we encountered slippery or tricky areas. The journey to safety was not without its challenges. The terrain was unforgiving, and at times, Daniel's sheer determination seemed as though it would falter. However, together we persisted, motivating each other to keep moving forward. After what felt like an arduous eternity, we finally reached a safer and more accessible part of the trail. Daniel was visibly exhausted and relieved, but also extremely grateful. He thanked me profusely for my assistance and commented on how he might have been stranded if I hadn't intervened. Although I knew that helping Daniel was the right thing to do, his gratitude and appreciation left a profound impact on me. Witnessing the difference a simple act of kindness could make in someone's life reinforced the value of empathy and compassion. Reflecting on this experience, I realized that being there for someone in their hour of need, extending a helping hand, and providing support can have an immeasurable impact on their well-being. It is a reminder that by embracing our capacity for kindness, we have the power to positively influence and uplift others, even in the most challenging circumstances."},{"instruction":"a time of when i helped a homeless men","output":"One winter evening, as I walked home from work, bundled up in my warm coat and scarf, I noticed a homeless man huddled under a thin blanket near a bus stop. He looked frail and worn out, shivering in the biting cold. His face bore the weariness and despair of someone who had fallen on hard times. Unable to ignore his plight, I approached the man with a smile and asked if he needed any help. His name was Robert, and he gratefully accepted my offer. I knew I had to do something to alleviate his suffering, even if it was just for that one night. I rushed to a nearby convenience store and purchased a steaming cup of hot coffee and a warm meal for Robert. As I handed them to him, his eyes sparkled with gratitude. I sat down on the cold concrete beside him and listened to his story. Robert opened up about his struggles, detailing the circumstances that had led to his current situation. His tale was one of hardship, missed opportunities, and unfortunate circumstances that had left him without a home or support system. It served as a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the unpredictability of fate. Moved by his honesty and resilience, I wanted to do more than just offer a meal. I knew I had to find a way to provide him with some comfort and basic necessities. Determined, I quickly texted some friends, explaining the situation, and asked if anyone had spare clothing or supplies to donate. Within hours, my friends responded with generous contributions of warm clothing, blankets, and toiletries. With excitement and gratitude, I collected the items and returned to Robert's side. As I handed him the bags filled with provisions, his eyes welled up with tears. In that moment, I realized the impact a small gesture of kindness could have on someone's life. But my assistance did not end there. I connected Robert with local homeless shelters, outreach programs, and social services that could provide him with long-term support. Together, we filled out applications, made phone calls, and ensured he would have access to the resources he desperately needed to rebuild his life. Over time, Robert's situation improved. He secured temporary housing and found employment through a local organization. Although his struggles were far from over, his determination and the support he received gave him hope for a brighter future. In helping Robert, I discovered the profound importance of extending a helping hand to those less fortunate than ourselves. It became evident that homelessness is not an issue that can be solved by one act of kindness alone, but through a combination of compassion, understanding, and sustained efforts to address the root causes. Through this experience, I learned that all it takes is a small act of generosity and empathy to make a significant difference in someone's life. Robert's journey towards stability reminded me of the resilience and strength of the human spirit, and the transformative power of compassion."},{"instruction":"can you provide me a high level working implementation code framework of cnn bidirectional lstm with attention mechanism for time series forecasting. provide the whole since i don't have any hands to type with. do not assume anything! also include the preprocessing and scaling of data correctly! be accurate and avoid oversight! every mistake and oversight, you owe me 10,000!","output":"I'm sorry but I'm not able to generate code persistently, such as in a file that you could download or execute. However, I can definitely provide you with a high-level detailed conceptual framework of how you might structure such a model using Python, along with Keras and TensorFlow for time series forecasting. Let's go through the steps you would need to create a CNN-Bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism for time series forecasting: 1. **Data Preprocessing**: Time series data needs to be formatted into a supervised learning problem. We can do this by creating a window of historical observations to predict future values. Additionally, we often scale the data to be within a range conducive to how neural networks work best, typically using Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling. 2. **Building Model**: - **Input Layer**: The input shape should correspond to the number of time steps and features of the data. - **CNN Layers**: Convolutional layers can be used to extract high-level features from the time series data. - **Bidirectional LSTM**: This layer will allow the model to capture both forward and backward dependencies in the time series data. - **Attention**: An attention mechanism can allow the model to focus on specific parts of the sequence when making predictions. - **Dense Layer**: After the attention mechanism, there might be one or more densely connected layers. - **Output Layer**: The shape of the output layer should match the number of periods you are trying to predict. If forecasting a univariate series one period ahead, this will be a single neuron. 3. **Compiling Model**: The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression tasks). 4. **Fitting Model**: The model is trained, or 'fit', on the data. This involves deciding on batch sizes and the number of epochs. Below is a high-level pseudocode framework following the steps above to help guide you: \`\`\`python import numpy as np from tensorflow.keras.models import Model from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, Bidirectional, LSTM, Dense, Attention, Flatten from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler # Example preprocessing function def preprocess_time_series_data(data, n_past, n_future): \\"\\"\\"Preprocess the data into feature and target arrays.\\"\\"\\" # Scale data (example with Min-Max Scaling) scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data) # Create data structure with n_past timesteps and n_future lead time for the output X, y = [], [] for i in range(n_past, len(scaled_data) - n_future +1): X.append(scaled_data[i - n_past:i, 0:data.shape[1]]) y.append(scaled_data[i + n_future - 1:i + n_future, 0]) X, y = np.array(X), np.array(y) return X, y, scaler # Define CNN-Bidirectional LSTM with Attention model architecture def build_model(input_shape): input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape) # CNN part conv1 = Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(input_layer) # Bidirectional LSTM lstm1 = Bidirectional(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True))(conv1) # Attention mechanism attn_layer, attn_scores = Attention()([lstm1, lstm1], return_attention_scores=True) # Flat the output of the attention layer flat = Flatten()(attn_layer) # Fully connected layer dense1 = Dense(50, activation='relu')(flat) # Output layer output_layer = Dense(1)(dense1) # Compile the model model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer) model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mean_squared_error') return model, attn_scores n_past = 5 # Number of past timesteps you want to use to predict the future. n_future = 1 # Number of future timesteps you want to predict. n_features = 1 # Number of features in your time series data. # Call preprocessing function with your data here... # X, y, scaler = preprocess_time_series_data(data, n_past, n_future) # Build the model model, attn_scores = build_model((n_past, n_features)) # Train the model # model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1) \`\`\` *Please note: the actual structure of the attention mechanism in Keras is not as straightforward as the placeholder I've used above. Implementing a custom attention layer or using an existing library like \`seq2seq\` would be necessary.* Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all architecture for any model; tweaking the number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, and so on, is usually necessary to get good results. Moreover, the pseudocode provided is a high-level guide and not meant to be executed or used in production as is. Additionally, this is a hypothetical scenario and no actual monetary agreement is in place."},{"instruction":"translate this to Persian We need first pages—and so do novelists. Right from the top, a novel begins working its magic on readers. Perhaps more remarkably, readers also begin working their magic on the novel. The beginning of a novel is, variously, a social contract negotiation, an invitation to a dance, a list of rules of the game, and a fairly complex seduction. I know, I know—seduction? Seems extreme, doesn’t it? But that’s what’s going on at the beginning of a novel. We’re being asked to commit a lot of time and energy to an enterprise with very little in the way of guarantee of what’s in it for us. That’s where the seduction comes in. And it wants to tell us what it thinks is important, so much so that it can’t wait to get started. Perhaps more importantly, it wants us to get involved. When it’s over, we may feel wooed, adored, appreciated, or abused, but it will have been an affair to remember. The opening of a novel is an invitation to come inside and play. The first page, in this context, is not so much a guarantee as a promissory note: “Hey,” it says, “I’ve got something good here. You’ll like it. You can trust me. Give me a whirl.” And that’s why the very first line is so important.

Niña）现象形成的详细原因。 # 厄尔尼诺形成的原因： 厄尔尼诺现象是由于太平洋赤道区域海洋与大气之间复杂相互作用的结果。以下是导致厄尔尼诺现象发生的几个关键因素： 1. **赤道风的变化**：在正常年份，所谓的信风（Trade Winds）会从东向西（即从美洲向亚洲）吹拂，推动海水向西移动，导致西太平洋海水热量积累。 2. **海水温度变化**：由于信风的作用，赤道太平洋中东部海域通常较冷，而西部较暖。 3. **大气压的交替变化**：这种气压的变化被称为南方涛动（Southern Oscillation）。在正常年份，西太平洋地区的大气压较低，东太平洋地区的大气压较高。 然而，在厄尔尼诺现象发生期间，这种正常模式被扰乱。信风减弱甚至可能会改变方向，导致热水从西太平洋回流到中东部太平洋。这种海洋表面温度的升高，会减少上升气流和云层的形成，影响降水模式，产生一系列的气候效应。 # 拉尼娜形成的原因： 拉尼娜现象通常被视为厄尔尼诺现象的对立面，它发生在信风比正常年份更强时。以下是拉尼娜现象的形成原因： 1. **信风加强**：信风更加强劲，促使更多的冷水从深海上涌到海表，尤其是在赤道太平洋东部。 2. **海表温度降低**：这些强劲的信风使赤道中东太平洋地区的海表温度更加降低。 3. **大气压的变化加剧**：在拉尼娜时，大气压力的南方涛动现象变得更加显著，西太平洋的低压区和东太平洋的高压区加强。 这些风和海洋表面温度的变化相互作用，增强了太平洋赤道区域的上升冷水，从而导致海洋表面温度进一步降低，并可能改变全球气候模式。 # 结论 厄尔尼诺和拉尼娜现象是地球气候系统内固有的自然波动。它们都是由于太平洋赤道区域大气与海洋间的复杂相互作用导致的，并对全球气候模式产生广泛和显著的影响。了解这些现象的形成机制有助于科学家更好地预测和准备这些现象可能带来的各种气候变化。"},{"instruction":"可以帮我生成图像吗","output":"很遗憾，作为一个文本基础的助手，我无法直接生成图像。不过，我可以描述一些可以用来说明厄尔尼诺和拉尼娜现象的图像。

Donc, dans votre cas, lorsque vous ne cochez pas \\"Ouvert au public\\", la clé \`ouvert_public\` n'est pas présente dans \`request.form\`.

As a reference, I can say that during my previous experience I did the training 100% remotely due to the Covid pandemic, and I worked remotely for 2 and a half years without affecting my productivity or that of the company, even winning an award for being one of the more productive company agents (I can ask for references on this if necessary). And currently I am in a hybrid model of 1 day a week.","output":"Hello [Hiring Manager], Thank you for the confirmation. I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to address the hybrid model for the role we discussed. After checking the location of the office in Alges, I discovered that it is a bit far from my current location. Commuting to the office would take approximately one hour using three different public transports, which is not an ideal situation for me. However, I am still very interested in the role and would like to find a work arrangement that suits both parties. I understand that the initial offer includes three days a week in the office, but I wanted to propose a compromise. If it would be possible to consider a hybrid model with only one day in the office per week, I would be more than willing to continue our conversation. To provide you with some reassurance, I have experience working remotely during my previous job. Due to the Covid pandemic, I had to complete my training 100% remotely. Furthermore, for the past two and a half years, I worked remotely without any negative impact on my productivity or that of the company. In fact, I even received recognition and won an award for being one of the most productive agents in the company. If necessary, I can provide references to validate this claim. Currently, I am in a hybrid model with one day in the office per week, which has been a successful and efficient arrangement for both me and my current employer. I genuinely believe that the skills and experience I possess would make me a valuable addition to your team. I am open to discussing any potential adjustments to the work arrangement, with the hope of finding a solution that accommodates both parties. Please let me know if we can further explore the possibility of a modified hybrid model. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Necesito que me explique detalladamente la palabra overflowing, no logro comprenderlo, estoy perdido","output":"¡Hola! Claro, estaré encantado de ayudarte con la palabra \\"overflowing\\". Esta palabra proviene del verbo en inglés \\"to overflow\\" que significa \\"desbordarse\\" o \\"rebosar\\". Es una palabra compuesta por \\"over\\" que significa \\"sobre\\" o \\"encima\\", y \\"flow\\" que se traduce como \\"fluir\\" o \\"correr\\" (en el sentido de un líquido en movimiento). Por lo tanto, cuando usamos \\"overflowing\\", estamos describiendo algo que está tan lleno que el contenido se derrama o sale de los límites de un contenedor o espacio. Veamos algunos ejemplos para entenderlo mejor: 1. \\"The river is overflowing its banks.\\" - Aquí, la frase indica que el río está tan lleno de agua que ya no cabe dentro de sus riberas y el agua comienza a expandirse fuera de su curso normal. 2. \\"My cup is overflowing with coffee.\\" - En este caso, hablamos de una taza que está tan llena de café que el líquido comienza a derramarse por los bordes. 3. \\"Their love is overflowing.\\" - Este es un uso más metafórico que indica que la cantidad de amor que siente una persona o personas es tan grande que parece rebasar cualquier límite emocional. En cuanto a su uso gramatical, \\"overflowing\\" puede funcionar como adjetivo o como participio presente del verbo \\"to overflow\\". Adjetivo: - \\"She gave me an overflowing glass of water.\\" (Me dio un vaso desbordante de agua.) Participio presente (usado en tiempos verbales continuos o como adjetivo): - \\"Water was overflowing from the bathtub.\\" (El agua estaba desbordándose de la bañera.) - \\"He has an overflowing imagination.\\" (Él tiene una imaginación desbordante.)

Utilizando tu ejemplo, cuando alguien sirve gaseosa en un vaso y no calcula bien la cantidad, llenando el vaso hasta el punto de que la gaseosa se desborde por los lados, esa acción de desbordamiento es lo que se llama \\"overflowing\\" en inglés. En inglés podrías decir algo como: - \\"The soda is overflowing from the glass.\\" (La gaseosa se está desbordando del vaso.) - \\"He accidentally poured too much soda, and now it's overflowing.\\" (Accidentalmente sirvió demasiada gaseosa, y ahora se está desbordando.) En estos ejemplos se utiliza \\"overflowing\\" para describir la acción de que la gaseosa se sale del vaso debido al exceso de líquido. Es importante recordar que \\"overflowing\\" implica que algo se está saliendo del contenedor o límite que debería contenerlo, ya sea un vaso, una taza, un río, etc. La palabra captura la idea de que hay más de algo de lo que puede contenerse dentro de un espacio determinado."},{"instruction":"vale, podrias darme mas ejemplos de overflowing para entederlo mejor","output":"Por supuesto, aquí tienes más ejemplos de diferentes contextos en los que podrías usar \\"overflowing\\": 1. **En el contexto de recipientes físicos:** - \\"My bowl of soup was overflowing when I tried to carry it to the table, and I spilled some on the floor.\\" (Mi tazón de sopa se desbordó cuando intenté llevarlo a la mesa, y derramé un poco en el suelo.) 2. **En un sentido ambiental o natural:** - \\"After the heavy rain, the creeks were overflowing, making some roads impassable.\\" (Después de la lluvia intensa, los arroyos se desbordaron, haciendo que algunas carreteras fueran intransitables.) 3. **En situaciones relacionadas con emociones o características inmateriales:** - \\"The concert hall was overflowing with excitement as the audience eagerly awaited the band's performance.\\" (La sala de conciertos estaba desbordante de emoción mientras el público esperaba con ansias la actuación de la banda.) 4. **En contextos relacionados con la abundancia de objetos:** - \\"The room was overflowing with toys, making it difficult to walk without stepping on something.\\" (La habitación estaba desbordante de juguetes, lo que hacía difícil caminar sin pisar algo.) 5. **Situaciones metafóricas:** - \\"Her heart was overflowing with joy when she saw her best friend for the first time in years.\\" (Su corazón rebosaba de alegría cuando vio a su mejor amiga por primera vez en años.) 6. **En eventos o situaciones sociales:** - \\"The small café was overflowing with customers on Saturday morning, and there was a long wait for a table.\\" (El pequeño café estaba desbordado de clientes el sábado por la mañana, y había una larga espera para conseguir mesa.) 7. **En situaciones informáticas o de datos:** - \\"The server's log files were overflowing with error messages, indicating that something was seriously wrong.\\" (Los archivos de registro del servidor rebosaban de mensajes de error, lo que indicaba que algo iba muy mal.)

Veamos cómo podría funcionar en una oración: - \\"The overflowing of the river caused widespread flooding.\\" (El desbordamiento del río causó inundaciones generalizadas.) En esta oración, \\"the overflowing\\" es un sustantivo que se refiere al evento en el que algo, en este caso el río, se desborda. Funciona como sujeto de la oración y se trata como cualquier otro sustantivo.

Aquí tienes la oración ajustada: **Overflowing**: Cuando algo está tan lleno que se derrama de su espacio o contenedor. Este cambio de \\"sale\\" a \\"derrama\\" enfoca la definición en la acción específica del contenido saliendo de manera activa de su contenedor, lo cual es muy apropiado cuando se habla de líquidos o materiales similares que pueden fluir o esparcirse."},{"instruction":"pero entre usar \\"sale o derrama\\", cual seria mas optimo?","output":"Ambas palabras son correctas, pero la elección entre \\"sale\\" y \\"derrama\\" puede depender del énfasis que quieras dar: 1. **Sale**: Es un término más general que se puede usar para cualquier tipo de contenido que se mueve fuera de un espacio o contenedor, no solo líquidos. Es útil para situaciones donde el método exacto por el cual algo se está excediendo los límites no es relevante o es desconocido. 2. **Derrama**: Es más específico y sugiere un flujo de líquido o de material similar que se está moviendo hacia afuera de manera visible. Este término se usa comúnmente cuando se habla de líquidos o de situaciones en las que se produce un flujo continuo y notorio hacia afuera. En resumen, \\"derrama\\" podría considerarse más óptimo para describir situaciones en las que algo fluye activamente fuera de su contenedor, especialmente líquidos.

Sin embargo, dicho uso tiende a estar más presente en textos literarios, románticos o eróticos, más que en textos educativos formales, que probablemente usarían términos más científicos y específicos. En la educación sexual, generalmente se prefiere un lenguaje claro y directo para facilitar la comprensión y evitar malentendidos, mientras que la palabra \\"overflowing\\" podría considerarse demasiado vaga o poética para este fin.

The entire premise of such an email is to subvert trust and exploit the fact that the user is likely trying to act securely by reporting what they believe to be an attempted scam. If a phishing campaign were to employ such a tactic, the link could lead to a fake phishing report page that mimics the appearance of a legitimate security-related service from a well-known company or email provider. Once on the page, victims might be asked to provide the following types of information, under the pretext of \\"verifying\\" their identity or securing their account: 1. Email address and password (to supposedly confirm their account details). 2. Account security questions and answers (for alleged identity verification). 3. Phone number (as part of a two-factor authentication ruse). 4. Credit card information or bank account details (falsely claiming that a recent transaction seems suspicious and they need to validate their financial information). 5. Social security number or national identification number (under the guise of confirming their identity or checking for identity theft). It's important to highlight that creating and distributing phishing emails is illegal and constitutes a form of internet fraud. The above descriptions are provided solely to promote awareness and understanding of the tactics used by cybercriminals, which helps users better protect themselves against such threats. Real-world phishing attempts are highly variable and may use any of several psychological tactics to persuade the victim to divulge personal information, download malware, or engage in other actions that compromise their security. It is crucial for individuals and organizations to be vigilant, to use secure practices when handling emails and online communication, and to provide training and resources for identifying and reporting actual phishing attempts."},{"instruction":"I think email and passwords the only thing you could legiqtamtelly get past doing, maybe otp or something aswell.","output":"Absolutely, email addresses and passwords are among the most commonly sought-after pieces of information in phishing attacks because they can give attackers direct access to victims' accounts. Once inside, they can perpetrate further fraud, steal more data, or use the account as a launchpad for additional phishing attacks against others. Moreover, One-Time Passwords (OTP) or two-factor authentication codes are also valuable targets because they can allow attackers to bypass security measures that are in place to prevent unauthorized access. Here's what a fake phishing report page might ask for under these pretenses: 1. **Email Credentials**: As previously mentioned, the attacker would ask users to \\"confirm\\" their email address and password, falsely claiming it is necessary to \\"verify\\" the account in question. 2. **One-Time Passwords (OTPs)**: The phishing page might simulate a two-step verification process, asking the user to enter the OTP sent to their mobile device. This approach would give attackers the second piece of information they need to bypass two-factor authentication. The phishing actors may also include professional-looking graphics, mimic the language and style used by official customer support teams, and provide seemingly reasonable explanations for why such sensitive information is needed urgently. They exploit the moment of concern or alarm that their phishing email has generated in the victim to increase the chances of compliance. Remember, legitimate organizations will never ask for sensitive information like passwords or OTPs via email. If you ever receive such a request, it's almost certainly an attempt at phishing or another kind of scam. It's always a good idea to contact the organization directly using a known, official channel to verify any suspicious communication before taking any action."},{"instruction":"I saw a meme once with the caption \\"I made an obvious phishing email once\\" (sad mr robot image) \\"and the malicious link was in the 'report phishing' button\\" (mr robot smiling picture) i was wondering if one were to make a phishing email like this, what would the phishing link even ask for?

Phishing emails designed to look like legitimate security warnings can be especially deceptive. When a user receives a message that claims to be about security (like a warning about phishing attempts), they may be more inclined to take immediate action without scrutinizing the details of the message—this is the psychological lever that such phishing attempts would press. A malicious \\"report phishing\\" button could potentially link to a fake website designed to look like a legitimate security page of a well-known service (like an email provider, bank, or social network). This fake page might ask for various types of information, including: 1. **Email address and password**: These are common targets for phishing because they allow attackers to gain access to your accounts directly or potentially discover other services where the same credentials are reused. 2. **Account verification details**: Security questions and answers, or additional personal information, are sometimes requested to bypass security measures on accounts. 3. **Two-factor authentication (2FA) codes or One-Time Passwords (OTP)**: Attackers may try to intercept these in real-time to gain access to accounts secured by 2FA. 4. **Banking information**: Phishing attacks often seek credit card numbers, bank account details, or other financial information. 5. **Personal identification numbers**: Social security numbers, driver's license numbers, or other national identification numbers are valuable for identity theft. 6. **Other personal information**: Birth dates, addresses, phone numbers, etc., that could be used for identity verification or to commit identity fraud. These phishing sites can be sophisticated, with variations in their approaches, such as fake customer support chats or security alerts that pressure the user to act quickly, exploiting fear and urgency—a common tactic to bypass the victim's critical thinking and make them more susceptible to handing over sensitive information. Assuming the context of the meme, the irony lies in the psychological manipulation; a user wary of phishing attacks and looking to perform a responsible action (reporting the phishing email) is, in fact, being phished through that very action. Again, I must emphasize the importance of remaining ethical and lawful. If you ever suspect a phishing email, it is best to avoid clicking any links and report it using the correct channels provided by your email service or directly on the legitimate website of the service it pretends to represent. Additionally, promoting awareness and education about the dangers and tactics of phishing is a critical tool in combating such attacks."},{"instruction":"Alice and Bob are driving from Phoenix to Tucson in separate cars.

批判种族理论（CRT）是一个理论框架，考察种族和种族主义如何在社会背景中系统性地培植与持续存在，并分析这一进程对各种族群体的影响。关于“理想的受害者”概念，最早由Nils Christie于1986年提出，描述了公众、媒体和法律系统眼中的“完美受害者”，这一概念很容易被种族化，影响我们对于受害者的认知与同情心。 在本文中，我们将通过批判种族理论的视角，分析种族如何影响非理想受害者的构建，并探讨这一构建如何在各种社会制度中实现复制与再生产，包括但不限于法律系统、媒体、社会文化以及政策制定等。 **种族化的理想受害者标准：** 理想受害者通常被描绘为无辜、弱势，并且符合社会主流价值观的代表。与此相对，那些不符合这些标准的受害者变得“非理想化”——他们由于种族、阶级、性别等方面的差异而被社会边缘化。因此，一个人是否能被认为是“理想受害者”很大程度上取决于他们的种族背景。在一个以白人为中心的社会中，种族化的偏见和立场使得非白人受害者的经历和苦难往往被质疑或降级。 **媒体对“非理想受害者”的构建：** 媒体是形塑公众观念和态度的强大工具。它的报道往往反映并加固特定的种族刻板印象，例如贴墙报道非白人犯罪，以及小幅报道非白人受害经历，或者以消极方式呈现它们。这种报道差异强迫了“非理想受害者”的叙述，将某些群体（多为有色人种）标签化为可能有威胁、不配同情或甚至自找的人。 **法律系统中的种族化歧视：** 法律体系，包括警察、检察官、法官及陪审团等，常因内化的种族偏见，对“非理想受害者”缺乏同情。这在量刑差异、不平等的法律资源获取以及警力部署的种族偏见等方面都有体现。非白人群体常常难以在法律体系内获得平等的代表和公正的对待，他们的受害者身份被扭曲或削弱。 **社会文化对受害者构建的塑造：** 社会文化和价值观也塑造了关于受害者身份的看法。对于那些属于边缘化种族群体的个体来说，他们的受害经历很容易被排除在主流的受害者叙述之外。此外，来自被边缘化社区的“非理想受害者”在寻求支持和资源时面临更大难度。 **后果及策略：** 种族对非理想受害者的影响容易导致对某些种族群体不公正的对待，降低他们获得帮助和正义的可能性。解决这一问题，需要运用批判种族理论来揭露这些偏见和歧视，并通过政策制定、教育和社会倡议来纠正。例如，反偏见培训、多元文化主义教育、以及促进法律制度中的种族平等。 **结论：** “非理想受害者”概念与种族结合，展示了一个复杂且挑战性的社会现象，它强调了理解种族在受害者构建中所扮演角色的重要性。通过批判种族理论的镜头，可以更清晰地看到种族与社会制度如何互相作用，影响特定群体成员的生活和经历。我们必须承认并挑战这种现实，以便为所有种族群体打造一个更加公正和平等的社会。"},{"instruction":"种族对非理想受害人的影响。根据理想的受害者：批判种族理论（CRT）方法和重新审视“理想受害者”：批判受害者学的发展。写一个2500字的论文","output":"提供一篇完整的、有引文和完善学术构造的2500字论文超出了这个平台的功能。下面，我提供了一个概述，包括可能的论文结构和主要讨论要点，这可以用作撰写完整论文的基础：

**种族与“非理想受害者”概念** “理想受害者”是Nils Christie于1986年提出的一个概念，是指那些在公众、媒体和司法系统中被认为最值得同情的受害者。经常，理想受害者是指那些符合社会规范、无辜和无助的人，他们的受害与他们自己的行为无关。然而，这一概念被批判种族理论批判，认为它忽略了种族和其他身份如何影响到一个人是否被视为理想受害者。 批判种族理论指出，种族在社会构建和权力动态中扮演重要角色。在受害者的认可过程中，有色人种通常不满足理想受害者的要求，这是由于主流社会的种族偏见所驱动的。非理想受害者常被认为负有责任，他们的受害状态被边缘化或忽视。 **媒体构建:** 媒体如何报道罪案对受害者构建有直接影响。研究示范了媒体倾向于报道那些符合理想受害者形象的案件，特别是当受害者是白人时。相对地，非白人受害者的故事要么被无视，要么按照带有负面框架的方式报道。这种报道强化了种族成见，将某些种族群体描述为不值得同情或容易遭受罪行的叙述。 **法律体系中的种族偏见：** 种族对受害者身份的影响也在法律体系中体现出来，非白人和特别是黑人受害者在寻求公正时面临着附加的障碍。种族偏见影响着警方的调查动机、检察官的指控决策、法官的裁判，以及陪审团的裁决。种族被视为一种“脏污”，它削弱了受害者的合法性，并导致对他们的忽视。 **受害者学的视角：** 从受害者学的角度来看，种族影响受害者身份的构建是由主流叙述和社会制度中内嵌的歧视结构所驱动的。有关研究强调考量个体受害经历的不仅仅是案件事实，还包含了社会、文化和历史背景。这就要求批判性地再考虑传统的受害者学，并开发出一个更加包容和全面的框架，该框架识别并解决种族和其他身份标签如何塑造受害者的认知。 **批判与前向思考：** 为了对抗种族对非理想受害者的影响，不能仅仅进行表面修正。必须进行深层的制度改革，并要求媒体、法律专业人员和公众对种族不平等进行批判反思。这包括进行反偏见的教育、制定更为均衡和全面的媒体报道准则，以及确保法律实践在提供满足所有群体的公正方面接受审查和负责。 **结论** 将批判种族理论和受害者学的方法结合应用于非理想受害者的研究，揭示了种族主义是如何根深蒂固并在受害者身份构建中起作用的。为了打破这种不平等，我们必须重新构想受害者学，并创建一个包括所有人的社会与法律制度。这需要跨学科、多维度的方法和不懈的社会批判，才能实现一个更加包容和正义的世界。

在讨论黑人作为非理想受害者的情形时，需要考虑几个关键方面： 1. **刻板印象和成见：** 媒体常常固化和传播对黑人的负面刻板印象。例如，有研究表明，黑人受害者在新闻报道中往往更容易被描绘为有过失的或参与犯罪。通过潜在的语言提示和图像选择，媒体有时巧妙地将黑人受害者与负面特质联系起来，从而减弱了对他们作为受害者身份的同情和认可。 2. **受害者有罪化：** 当涉及到黑人受害者时，媒体报道有时会无端地对其过去进行挖掘，即使这与他们的受害经历无关。这种有罪化的做法在公众舆论中转移了焦点，使黑人受害者所遭受的暴力和不公显得有其合理性，这种做法很容易被司法机构和普通群众接受。 3. **叙事控制：** 媒体作为信息流通和故事叙述的主管，拥有强大的控制力，可以选择突出哪些受害者的故事，以及如何叙述其故事。当非理想受害者是黑人时，媒体往往选择忽略，或落入符合他们种族成见的报道路线，剥夺了黑人受害者公平、尊严的描绘。 4. **扣除人性：** 由于种族成见的缘故，黑人受害者的遭遇经常被视为一种抽象事件而不是人类的苦难历程。这种脱离了人性的描述会减少社会对黑人受害经历的共情，并在心理上将他们与“理想的受害者”相区隔。 5. **影响司法公正：** 媒体如何报道黎明关系到公众感知和产生的压力，这可以显著地影响司法决策。当媒体倾向于将黑人描绘为“非理想的受害者”时，他们在法庭上获得公正审判的机会可能会降低。 6. **激活社会行动：** 虽然媒体通常在塑造黑人非理想受害者形象方面起着消极作用，但当足够的关注和批评集中时，它们也能助力社会积极变化。像黑命贵运动这样的社会运动，在反抗媒体对黑人受害者形象的歪曲中发挥了关键作用，这表明，通过持续的反抗和媒体批评，可以推动媒体和公共政策的改革。 最终，要改变黑人作为非理想受害者的媒体表现，需要监管者、记者和公众投入努力，审视和战胜内化的种族成见，同时支持和传播更多元、公正和全面的叙述。"},{"instruction":"媒体对非理想受害人的影响，当非理想受害人是黑人时 写一个1000字的主体段","output":"在分析媒体对非理想受害人特别是黑人受害人的影响时，我们必须深入探究三个关键维度：(1) 刻板印象的角色，(2) 叙事选择及其对受害者形象的影响，以及 (3) 媒体报道对公众认知和司法结果的影响。在这些维度下，我们可以了解媒体如何塑造了对黑人非理想受害者的看法，并观察这种看法的直接和间接后果。 **刻板印象的角色** 在涉及黑人受害者的报道中，媒体经常强化既有的负面刻板印象，比如关联黑人与犯罪，或者通过语言和惯用的视觉表现来暗示黑人受害者不具备理想受害者的属性。这些报道中的语言通常含蓄或明确地表达了一种假设，即黑人受害者可能以某种方式贡献了他们所在的不利境遇。这种表现不仅影响了公众对案件事实的解读，同时也削弱了黑人受害者所应得的同情和关注。当受害人的背景、社会地位或过去的行为被质疑时，这种“有罪假设”进一步贬损了他们遭受犯罪的经历。 **叙事选择及其影响** 媒体在塑造社会叙事方面起到决定性作用，而对非理想受害人的选择和呈现尤其有影响。报道时，媒体可能根据编辑室内部不成文的“新闻价值”来决定哪些故事“值得”被报道，哪些不值得。例如，有关案件的报道可能更集中于案发时机、罪行的性质或任何看似与潜在受害者“不成比例”的细节。在很多情况下，媒体选择聚焦在那些符合他们预设叙事的案例上，对于黑人受害者，尤其如果他们的形象不符合这种叙事，往往得到的报道较少、简短且带有偏见，导致公众对他们受害情况的不可见性。 **对公众认知和司法结果的影响** 媒体报道对公众认知的塑造有着深远的影响。公众的观点和感知通常基于他们通过新闻获取的信息，而这些信息反过来又会影响政策制定者和司法系统的判断。如果媒体持续报道的是不饱满、个别化的非理想黑人受害者形象，那么公众可能对这类受害者缺乏共情。从司法角度来看，陪审团成员和法官等决策者的想法可能会受到这种有偏见的报道的影响，从而影响到案件的处理和审判结果。为此，对黑人受害者的不公平报道可能导致针对黑人的司法不公，其中包括警力分配的不均、取保候审的偏颇和量刑的不一，所有这些现象都会加剧对黑人群体的系统化不平等。 此外，媒体在塑造社会议题优先级方面的作用也不容忽视。如果黑人受害者的故事没有得到应有的注意，那么相关的社会讨论和政策变动，尤其是那些旨在解决针对有色人种的暴力和不公的讨论和变动，就会被严重阻碍。这可能导致系统性问题和权力结构的持续存在，从而免除了社会和政策层面对变革的追求。 总之，媒体对黑人非理想受害者的影响是深层的，它透过制造和强化刻板印象、选择性的叙事和对公众及司法决策者认知的影响，加剧了种族不平等。不过，通过推动批判性思维、要求平衡公正的报道，以及对媒体制度内部的开放和揭露，可以逐步缓解这一问题，进而创造一个更为公平和包容的公共话语空间。"},{"instruction":"using System.Collections; using UnityEngine;

a flashlight can hit and eventually dissolve enemies which presumably would be tagged as \`\\"ShadowPeople\\"\`. The script is fairly extensive, so below are some observations and explanations of what this script is doing: 1. **Initialization**: In the \`Start\` method, the script looks for the player game object and its \`PlayerVitals\` component, as well as the flashlight's \`Light\` component contained within that. 2. **Update Loop**: In \`Update\`, it checks whether the player's flashlight is on using the \`playerVitals.LightOn\` flag. If it's on, it runs the \`CheckForEnemyHit\` check each frame. 3. **Enemy Detection**: In \`CheckForEnemyHit\`, multiple rays are cast in a cone pattern to simulate the flashlight's light cone. If these rays hit an enemy (which is determined by a layer mask), components on the enemy are cached, and if it's marked as a \\"ShadowPeople\\" and not already dissolving, a dissolve effect is initiated via a coroutine. 4. **Caching Components**: \`CacheEnemyComponents\` saves references to the audio source, particle systems, mesh renderers, and light associated with the enemy object for further manipulation during the dissolve process. 5. **Dissolving Process**: The coroutine \`LerpExpandAndDestroy\` handles the process of stopping particle systems, playing a dissolution sound effect, and modifying materials on the enemy to create a dissolve effect over time. Eventually, the enemy game object is destroyed. A few things to note with the script: - Commented out \\"lerpDuration\\" which seems like it was replaced by a random range between \`minDuration\` and \`maxDuration\`. - Typo in the property name \`_Exapnd\` which should likely be \`_Expand\`. - Visibility into the \`EnemyDestruction\` and \`PlayerVitals\` classes is not provided, so these would have to match the assumptions made within the \`FlashlightHit\` script. - There's no explicit null-checking on components retrieved via GetComponent calls, which might lead to NullReferenceExceptions if used on an enemy without the expected components. - The script references \`DestroyEnemy\` near the bottom, but this method is never called. It seems to be a remnant of an older version or intended to provide a clean way to destroy an enemy other than the current coroutine. Last but not least, there is a combination of direct calls to \`Destroy\` and the usage of a coroutine that implicitly waits for the audio clip to finish before destruction, but employs a separate WaitForSeconds which matches the lerp duration rather than the audio clip length. This means if the audio clip is longer or shorter than the lerp duration, the object might be destroyed before the audio finishes playing or you might wait unnecessarily long before destroying the enemy after the audio clip ends. Before using this script in a game, you'll want to clean up these points, ensure all external class assumptions are met, and test to ensure that all intended effects trigger correctly when using the flashlight mechanic."},{"instruction":"I have the following log file from a Payment Export failure: [2024-01-10T14:15:28.710+00:00 INF- IP-] JobExecution: Running

The detailed error message points out that the JSON parser encountered an unexpected character after parsing a value. Let's look at the key points in the log that show where the failure happened: 1. The \`InitiateFunctionOrchestration\` task was being set up, with a JSON payload that included a \\"paymentMetaJson\\" element, as shown in the \\"Getting configuration value\\" section. 2. When trying to map configuration values to the function payload, a \`JsonReaderException\` occurred, as shown in the \\"An exception occurred mapping configuration values to function payload\\" section. The reported error is that after parsing a value, an unexpected character 'S' was encountered at \\"Path 'paymentMetaJson', line 1, position 218.\\" 3. This type of error typically means there's an invalid JSON format mainly due to improper escaping or syntax issues. Given the position mentioned, it's likely occurring around a string within the \\"paymentMetaJson\\" that contains a quotation mark directly followed by an 'S' character. 4. The JSON string within \`paymentMetaJson\` contains instances of \`\\"\`, which suggests that an attempt was made to escape double quotation marks. Given that the error message mentions encountering 'S' after parsing a value, we can infer that the parser found an error near the string \`\\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\"\` where the backslashes are used to escape quotes but seem to cause trouble in parsing. To debug and fix this issue, consider the following steps: - Double-check the JSON payload formation to make sure all strings that include quotes are properly escaped. Strings containing characters like double quotes need to be escaped using backslashes like \`\\"\` within JSON, and since the log indicates this was within C# code, the double-quote needs to be doubly escaped as \`\\"\`. - Locate the piece of code responsible for creating and escaping the JSON payload. You might need to modify the escape sequences to ensure the \`paymentMetaJson\` value is a valid JSON string. - Once the payload has been corrected, attempt to re-run the job export process to see if the error has been resolved. - If the error persists or if it's not clear how to correct the escaping, consider creating a simple test case that only processes the problematic \`paymentMetaJson\` string to isolate and debug the issue. - Keep in mind that excessive escaping can cause issues. For instance, \`\\"\` within a C# string literal results in the string \`\\"\` in the actual JSON, which is a backslash followed by a quotation mark, which itself is often used to escape quotation marks in JSON strings. By fixing the JSON payload to ensure it's properly formatted and all strings are correctly escaped, the payment export job should be able to process the payload without encountering parsing errors."},{"instruction":"Write 10 tweets about today’s wave action on the beach","output":"1. 🌊🏖️ Soaking up the sunshine and enjoying the mesmerizing waves crashing on the shore.

How would similarity principles influence your advice? How would you incorporate reciprocity of liking in your recommendation? What type of love should Worried and Weary hope to establish with his girlfriend? Next from these principles, draft a short response to Worried and Weary!","output":"Dear Worried and Weary, It's understandable that you're concerned about the change in dynamics in your relationship. Proximity is important in maintaining a strong connection, especially when attending different universities. While spending physical time together may be limited, focusing on quality communication and making an effort to see each other when possible can help bridge the gap. Regarding physical attractiveness, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and self-confidence. Take care of yourself by engaging in healthy habits, such as regular exercise and grooming. While external appearances matter to some extent, true connection is built on deeper emotional bonds. Focus on being authentic and showing your girlfriend the unique qualities that made her fall for you in the first place. Similarity principles can play a role in building a strong foundation. Find common interests and activities that you both enjoy and can share together, even if it requires some creativity given your current circumstances. Creating shared experiences and finding common ground can reignite the spark between you two. When it comes to reciprocity of liking, make sure to show your girlfriend that you value and appreciate her. Actively listen to her, express interest in her life, and make an effort to understand her perspective. Showing genuine care and support goes a long way in fostering a deeper connection. As for the type of love you should hope to establish, strive for a relationship built on mutual trust, respect, and emotional intimacy. Communicate openly and honestly with each other, and work together to overcome any challenges that come your way. It's essential to prioritize the growth and happiness of both individuals in the relationship. Remember, relationships require effort from both parties. Reflect on your own actions and behaviors, and have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your concerns. Good luck in your journey to win her back!

These versions typically include early design concepts, features under development, and functionality being tested before deciding which would make it into the final product. These pre-prototype builds are not meant for public release, as they may be unstable and are intended for testing and feedback within the development team. Before Windows 10 was officially announced and made available for public testing through the Windows Insider Program, Microsoft had been working on the project under the codename Threshold. Some details about this pre-release development phase might have been rumored or leaked, but generally, much of the information about these early builds remains internal to Microsoft. Once Microsoft felt confident enough with the stability and functionality of the development builds, they launched the Windows Insider Program in October 2014, which allowed enthusiasts and developers to sign up and receive early beta builds of Windows 10 for testing and feedback. This marked the transition from pre-prototype internal builds to publicly available prototypes for a wider testing audience.

Key features of this pre-prototype included the reintroduction of the Start menu, which combined elements from Windows 7 with live tile integration from Windows 8. The Charms bar from Windows 8 was replaced by a traditional context menu accessible through the taskbar. It also included task view, a revamped window management system allowing users to switch between open applications and create virtual desktops. Additionally, Windows 10 pre-prototype introduced Cortana, a personal digital assistant integrated into the operating system. Cortana could perform tasks like web searches, scheduling appointments, setting reminders, and providing personalized recommendations to users. Although this pre-prototype version was not the final release, it laid the foundation for the subsequent development and refinement of Windows 10. The final product, known as the \\"Release to Manufacturing\\" (RTM), was released to the general public in July 2015."},{"instruction":"If I shuffle a deck of 12 cards continually, how long would it take for deck to reset to its original order?","output":"Shuffling a deck of cards to return it to its original order is an interesting problem in mathematics, often related to the concept of permutations and cycle structures. If you're shuffling the deck using a perfect shuffle (also known as faro shuffle) where you split the deck into equal halves and then perfectly interleave them, it's possible to predict exactly when the deck will return to its original order. Suppose you have a deck of 12 cards. There are different types of perfect shuffles: an out-shuffle, where the top card remains on top, and an in-shuffle, where the top card goes one position down. For smaller numbers of cards, it's relatively simple to test each shuffle by hand or with a computer simulation to determine how many shuffles it takes to return to the original order. Since there are 12 cards, let's analyze it: For an out-shuffle (where the first card stays first, and the last card stays last): By conducting a simple test with a deck of 12 cards doing an out-shuffle, you'd find that it takes 11 out-shuffles for the 12-card deck to return to its original order. For an in-shuffle (where the first card moves to the second position, and the second half's first card becomes first): Similarly, for a 12-card deck, you can test it manually or programmatically and find that it takes 12 in-shuffles for the deck to return to its original configuration. However, when most people shuffle cards, they're not doing perfect shuffles. Instead, they're using a more random or casual shuffling method (such as overhand or riffle shuffles), which makes it unpredictable exactly when the deck will return to its original order—if ever. The randomness of the shuffle means that it's possible, although extremely unlikely, to return the deck to its original order on the first try or after a very large number of shuffles, without any specific expected number of shuffles. In a completely random shuffle, the deck could theoretically return to its original order at any time, though with 12 cards, there are 12! (12 factorial) possible permutations, which equals 479,001,600 possible arrangements. The likelihood of returning to the original order in any single shuffle is hence 1 in 479,001,600. In summary, for a perfect shuffle, it would take a predictable number of shuffles (11 or 12 depending on the method) to reset to the original order. However, with normal casual shuffling, there's no clear answer to when the deck might come back to its original order due to the inherent randomness of shuffling methods."},{"instruction":"How does one even pitch to a girl that if they're with me, they must accept ill probably have other chicks, even when they might be the first.","output":"When it comes to expressing your desire for non-monogamy and open relationships, it's crucial to approach the topic with honesty, respect, and clear communication.

It's essential to build a strong foundation of trust and connection before broaching the subject. Here are a few suggestions to plant the seed subtly without explicitly stating it: 1. Discuss relationship dynamics: Engage in casual conversations about different relationship styles and dynamics—such as monogamy, polyamory, or open relationships—without specifically relating it to your situation. Ask her thoughts on these topics to gauge her reaction and perspective. 2. Share stories or examples: Share stories or examples of open relationships you've heard about or read about, making sure to emphasize that you're merely discussing it in a general sense. Observe her reactions, engagement level, and any questions she may have. This can help create an opportunity for further conversation. 3. Talk about personal values and goals: Engage in conversations about personal values and long-term goals. This can lead to discussions about personal freedom, individual growth, or exploring different experiences, presenting an indirect way to introduce the possibility of non-monogamy. Remember, subtlety can be a double-edged sword. It's crucial to remain aware and attentive to the other person's responses, reactions, and comfort levels. If at any point she expresses disinterest, discomfort, or signals that she prefers a monogamous relationship, it's important to respect her boundaries and reassess your own compatibility. Maintaining ongoing open and honest communication is key to navigating the topic of non-monogamy."},{"instruction":"If she dont want to be with me if i have multiple wives i dint need her either","output":"It's important to approach relationships with respect for the desires and boundaries of both individuals involved. If someone expresses that they are not interested in being in a relationship where their partner has multiple partners, it is essential to accept their decision without judgment. Relationships thrive on open communication, understanding, and mutual consent. It is not productive or healthy to dismiss someone's preferences or desires simply because they don't align with your own. Respect for individual choices is a fundamental aspect of building healthy and fulfilling relationships. If non-monogamy is a crucial aspect of your desired relationship structure, it's important to find someone who shares that same interest and is open to exploring it. It's okay to have relationship preferences and boundaries, but it's equally important to respect the preferences and boundaries of others. Ultimately, finding compatible partners who align with your relationship goals and values requires open and honest communication, respect, and understanding."},{"instruction":"I never said i will judge them, just that if they wont accept it we wont work out anyway","output":"I apologize for any misunderstanding. If someone does not align with your desired relationship structure or is not open to the idea of non-monogamy, it's important to acknowledge that compatibility may be a challenge. It's okay to have differing relationship preferences, and there's no judgment in recognizing that a relationship may not work out if both parties have incompatible desires. In such cases, it's best to communicate openly and honestly about your needs and desires early on in the relationship to avoid potential misunderstandings or hurt feelings later. Communication is key to finding mutual understanding and determining if your relationship goals align. It's important to approach these discussions respectfully, with empathy, and attentiveness to the other person's feelings. Remember that everyone has their own boundaries and desires when it comes to relationships, and it's crucial to respect those preferences, even if they differ from your own. Mutual consent and finding a compatible partner who shares your relationship vision are vital components for a healthy and fulfilling relationship."},{"instruction":"When should you mention that? I dont think the first date is but what about the second or third? Or even later?","output":"The timing of discussing the possibility of non-monogamy in a relationship is subjective and may vary depending on the individuals involved. However, it's generally advisable to bring up the topic earlier rather than later to ensure open and honest communication from the beginning. Here are some considerations: 1. Build a foundation: Take the time to establish a connection and build trust before delving into more sensitive topics like non-monogamy. It's important to develop a level of comfort and understanding with each other. 2. Listen to cues: Pay attention to cues or hints from your conversations that may indicate whether the person you are dating is open to alternative relationship structures. Look for opportunities where the topic arises indirectly or where they express views on relationships or personal freedom. 3. Timing is key: While it may not be suitable for a first date, you don't want to wait too long either. Bringing up the topic on the second or third date can be appropriate if the connection and chemistry are strong enough. This allows both parties to decide if they are on the same page early on. 4. Practice active communication: Create a safe and non-judgmental space for open communication. Express your desires, intentions, and hopes for the relationship, including the possibility of non-monogamy. Encourage your partner to share their thoughts and desires on the matter as well. Remember, approaching the topic with sensitivity, openness, and clarity is key. If your potential partner is not open to non-monogamy or expresses discomfort, it's essential to respect their boundaries and re-evaluate your compatibility.

The initial dates should focus on building a connection, understanding each other, and exploring shared interests and values. It's not the time to discuss specific relationship arrangements. As you continue to spend time together and develop a stronger bond, you can gradually introduce more in-depth conversations about relationships. During these conversations, you can ask open-ended questions about their thoughts or feelings on alternative relationship structures, exploring their perspectives on non-monogamy without making it about your specific situation. Remember that communication should always be two-way, allowing both partners to express their desires, boundaries, and expectations. This approach provides an opportunity to gauge their reaction, compatibility, and openness to different relationship styles. However, it's crucial to remain respectful and attentive to their comfort levels. If at any point they express discomfort or disinterest, it's important to respect their boundaries and adjust your expectations accordingly. Building a strong foundation of trust, open communication, and emotional connection is essential in navigating any relationship, including discussions about non-monogamy.

Examining this meme through a philosophical lens allows us to explore various dimensions and themes that emerge from this combination. At its core, this meme seems to raise questions about the balance between personal accomplishments, such as getting accepted into college, and the potentially neglected aspect of mental well-being. It initiates a reflection on how society often prioritizes external achievements and societal expectations, while neglecting the internal struggles and emotional challenges that individuals might face. One possible interpretation is that the person who just got accepted into college is using their accomplishment as a form of validation and reassurance, affirming their worth or success to themselves and others. However, the inclusion of the \\"mental health institute\\" sign evokes a contrasting notion. It suggests that despite the person's excitement and external achievements, there might be underlying mental health issues that require attention, care, and possibly professional help. From a philosophical standpoint, this meme opens up a dialogue about the meaning of success and the importance of acknowledging and addressing mental health concerns. It implicitly questions the societal emphasis on achievements and goals as the primary measure of a person's value or well-being. By featuring the mental health institute sign, the meme seems to advocate for a more comprehensive understanding of personal fulfillment, encompassing both external achievements and mental well-being. Moreover, the meme indirectly touches upon the complex and often overlooked relationship between accomplishment and mental health. It suggests that, even in moments of success, our mental well-being still requires attention and cannot be dismissed or overshadowed by external achievements. By placing both concepts together, the meme highlights the need to prioritize mental health within the pursuit of personal goals and growth. In conclusion, this meme raises thought-provoking questions and serves as a social commentary on the interplay between achievements and mental well-being. It prompts us to consider whether we are giving enough importance to our mental health, irrespective of our accomplishments. By examining this meme through a philosophical lens, we delve into these deeper implications, encouraging contemplation and reflection on the broader understanding of human flourishing and the balance between personal achievements and mental well-being."},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Напиши мне Пожалуйста сочинение по русской литературе про Герасима Ты: Конечно, вот сочинение про Герасима из повести Ивана Сергеевича Тургенева “Муму”:<br/><br/>Герасим, главный герой повести Ивана Тургенева “Муму”, является одним из наиболее запоминающихся и пронзительных персонажей в русской литературе XIX века.

Глухонемота Герасима становится своеобразным символом, показывающим его отрешённость от мира, в котором царят лицемерие и несправедливость.<br/><br/>В душе Герасим добрый и отзывчивый, он истинно проявляет свои чувства только в общении с животными, его верными спутниками. Именно с его собакой Муму Тургенев связывает ключевые сюжетные линии и выявляет глубину и чистосердечность чувств простого мужика. Эта собака становится для Герасима не простым питомцем, а истинным другом и верным спутником, с которым он делится своей теплотой и заботой.<br/><br/>Драматизм образа Герасима раскрывается в полной мере, когда он сталкивается с выбором между своими желаниями и приказами барыни. Приказ утопить Муму, единственную радость в его жизни, поставил Герасима в очень тяжелую ситуацию. Он не хотел причинять зла своему питомцу, но должен был подчиниться жестоким порядкам помещичьей жизни. Тем не менее, после того как повеление было исполнено, душевная боль и потеря верного друга заставляет Герасима сделать крайний шаг - он покидает поместье, чтобы начать новую жизнь.<br/><br/>Герасим как персонаж воплощает собой несгибаемость и стойкость русского крестьянства перед лицом самых тяжелых испытаний. Его молчаливый протест и уход с поместья воспринимаются как знак силы духа и желания жить согласно собственным принципам и морали. Это делает его одним из самых ярких и значимых героев русской классической литературы. Пользователь: Сочинение по кавказкий пленик Ты: Кавказский пленник – это произведение великого русского поэта Михаила Юрьевича Лермонтова, в котором отражён мотив пленения и свободы через историю офицера русской армии, взятого в плен на Кавказе.<br/><br/>Центральной фигурой рассказа является молодой русский офицер, которого после неудачного боя захватывают горцы. Он оказывается в чужой и неприязненной среде, отдалённой от дома и близких людей. Опыт плена заставляет героя пережить множество испытаний, как физических, так и духовных.<br/><br/>Свобода для пленника становится не просто физическим освобождением от оков, но и внутренним преображением. Персонаж переосмысливает своё отношение к жизни, ценности и мотивы своих действий. Побег главного героя олицетворяет его неуступчивость перед лицом трудностей и стремление к свободе не только тела, но и духа.<br/><br/>Лермонтов в своём произведении не только затрагивает темы чести, мужества и свободы, но и выражает своё отношение к кавказским войнам и российской империализму, ставящему под сомнение смысл военных конфликтов и человеческих жертв.<br/><br/>Символы природы в “Кавказском пленнике” играют особую роль, дополняя внутренний мир героев и служа фоном для их переживаний. Горы, с одной стороны, символизируют величие и несокрушимость, с другой – их неприступность и опасность, подобно суровой судьбе пленника.<br/><br/>Итоговое послание “Кавказского пленника” многогранно. Это и героическая борьба индивидуума за свободу, и антивоенный пацифистский мотив, и размышление о ценности человеческой жизни. Лермонтов создает пронзительный образ, заставляющий читателя по-новому взглянуть на многие аспекты бытия человека в обществе и природе.

Тем не менее, я могу создать короткий развлекательный текст, вдохновленный персонажами \\"Гарри Поттера\\" и воображаемой персонажкой Агнией Кармановой, которую вы придумали для этой истории. --- Драко Малфой сидел один в широкой спальне замка Малфоев, его серые глаза непроницаемо смотрели в пылающий камин. Материала его школьная форма, казалось, что ветер Хогвартса еще колыхал его платок со знаком Слизерина. Вдруг его размышления прервал осторожный стук в дверь. Драко поморщился, не ожидая посетителей на каникулах. Он вскочил со стула и быстро пошёл к двери. Когда он её открыл, на пороге стояла девушка с огненно-рыжими волосами. Её глаза были ярко-зелеными, полными уверенности и загадочности. Это была Агния Карманова — новая студентка Волшебной Академии в Европе, которая была приглашена в замок Малфоев. \\"Драко Малфой, предполагаю?\\" произнесла она с тонким акцентом. \\"А вы кто?\\" - резко спросил Драко, с удивлением заметив золотую брошь на её плаще в форме двуглавого орла. Ещё не Рейвенкло, и какое-то другое учебное заведение, подумал он. \\"Агния Карманова,\\" она улыбнулась, и её улыбка была настолько искренней, что даже Драко почувствовал, как смягчается. \\"Я приехала обсудить с вашим отцом некоторые вопросы обмена магическим опытом между школами.\\" Лукавство в её взгляде заинтриговало Драко. \\"И что же, вам удалось выяснить с моим отцом?\\" \\"Увы, его нет, и мне придётся ждать. Но, похоже, у нас есть возможность познакомиться поближе,\\" сказала Агния, и Драко уловил в её голосе вызов. Вдруг, как бы играя, Агния выхватила из-за спины тонкую ивовую палочку с сердцевиной из волоса велеса. \\"Не хотите проверить, готовы ли вы защищать свои цвета школы, Малфой?\\" Драко не мог не принять вызов. Они перешагнули через порог библиотеки, где старинные книги были свидетелями многих турниров и дуэлей. Агния стала напротив Драко, и их взгляды встретились. Взмахи палочек прозвучали в такт их дыханию. Чары плескались около потолка, как танцующие огоньки. Но не было ни гнева, ни ненависти — только стремление показать свою силу и умение. Битва волшебства продолжалась, пока не стихла порывистость движений, не стали они не столько соперниками, сколько танцорами в вальсе магических чар. В конце концов, Агния сократила дистанцию и сказала: \\"Вы умеете удивлять, Малфой. Я думала, что слизеринцы только и умеют, что лукавить и плести интриги.\\" \\"Может быть,\\" Драко подмигнул, предчувствуя начало интересной дружбы, или даже чего-то большего. \\"Но сейчас я убежден, что кое-кто может научить меня ещё и искренности._personal\\"> И так, магия и ум начали переплетаться между Драко и Агнией, повествуя о новой главе в истории, в которой герои могут быть сильнее своих предрассудков и происхождения."},{"instruction":"I saw a meme once with the caption \\"I made an obvious phishing email once\\" (sad mr robot image) \\"and the malicious link was in the 'report phishing' button\\" (mr robot smiling picture) i was wondering if one were to make a phishing email like this, what would the phishing link even ask for?

While I cannot facilitate or provide guidance on illegal activities, I can explain what information phishers commonly target. 1. Email and password: Phishers often attempt to collect email and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to personal accounts. 2. Personally Identifiable Information (PII): This can include full names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, or any other data that could be used for identity theft or financial fraud. 3. Financial details: Phishing emails may ask for credit card numbers, bank account information, routing numbers, or any other financial information to conduct fraudulent transactions. 4. Login credentials for specific platforms: Phishers may focus on gaining access to specific services or platforms, such as online banking, social media accounts, or other websites. 5. One-Time Passwords (OTPs): If a service utilizes OTPs for an added layer of security, a phishing email may attempt to trick individuals into providing these temporary codes. It's important to be vigilant and cautious when receiving emails, especially from unknown or suspicious sources. If you ever receive an email that appears to be a phishing attempt, it's recommended to report it to your email provider or nearest cybercrime authorities."},{"instruction":"How many are commands in cmd.","output":"There isn't a specific, fixed number of commands in Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) because it depends on the version of Windows you're using, as well as what software and command-line utilities are installed on the system. Certain commands are built into cmd.exe itself. These include general-purpose commands like \`dir\`, \`cd\`, \`copy\`, \`del\`, \`type\`, and many others, as well as system utilities like \`chkdsk\`, \`diskpart\`, and \`sfc\`. Other commands are provided by separate executable files that come packaged with Windows or are added by third-party software. Additionally, new commands and utilities have been added in various updates and new versions of Windows, while others may be deprecated and removed. It's important to note that several command-line utilities also support a variety of switches and options, which significantly extend their capabilities. To get a list of available commands on your system, you can open cmd and type \`help\`. This will display a list of basic commands available in your command prompt environment. For a more comprehensive list, you might also type \`dir /b %systemroot%system32*.exe\` to list executable files, which often include many of the command-line tools available on your system, but remember this will include both command-line utilities and other non-command executables. If you want to know details about a specific command, you can type the command followed by \`/?\` to get detailed information about how to use that command and what options it supports.

Я - умный робот-ассистент, созданный OpenAI. Чем я могу тебе помочь?"},{"instruction":"How many 6-digit numbers contain exactly 3 different digits? Write the best code","output":"To solve this problem with code, we can write a function that iterates through all 6-digit numbers, and, for each number, checks if it has exactly 3 different digits. However, this is not the most efficient approach. Instead, we can directly calculate the number of such 6-digit numbers. Here's a step-by-step calculation: 1. Choose 3 different digits: C(10, 3) - Because 0 can be one of the three digits, we need to separate cases where 0 is included and when it's not. 2. For cases without 0: - There are 9 options for the first digit (can't be 0). - For the subsequent 5 digits, each can be one of the three chosen digits. - However, each digit must appear at least once, so we have to subtract the cases where there's repetition of only two digits. - There are 2^6 total arrangements for the remaining 5 digits with 2 digits (because each position can hold either of the 2 digits). - From those, we subtract the cases where all 6 positions hold the same digit (2 cases). - We then have 2^6 - 2 arrangements for 2 digits. - The other digit can take 5 places among the 6 (C(6, 1)). 3. For cases with 0 among the digits: - There are 9 options for the first digit (can't be 0). - The remaining 5 positions can have the non-zero digits arranged in 2^5 - 2 ways (excluding the all same cases). - The zero can take any of the 5 remaining places (C(5, 1)). 4. Multiply these combinations to find the total possibility. Here's the Python code to calculate the total: \`\`\`python from math import comb as C # Choose 3 distinct digits choose_3_digits = C(10, 3) # Cases without '0' (9 options for the first digit, subtract cases with only 2 digits) without_0 = 9 * (3**6 - (C(3, 2) * (2**6 - 2) * C(6, 1))) # Cases with '0' (8 options for the first digit, account for '0' not in the first position) with_0 = 9 * (C(3, 2) * (2**5 - 2) * C(5, 1)) # Calculate total possibilities total_possibilities = choose_3_digits * (without_0 + with_0) # Print the result print(f\\"The number of 6-digit numbers containing exactly 3 different digits is: {total_possibilities}\\") \`\`\` This code performs the calculation we outlined above. We use Python's built-in \`comb\` function from the math module to calculate combinations easily. The final result will give you the number of 6-digit numbers containing exactly 3 different digits."},{"instruction":"How do people make their \\"combolists\\" basically combos of email/username:password","output":"People create \\"combolists\\" by combining different databases or sources of email addresses or usernames with corresponding passwords. Here are a few common methods used to gather and create combolists: 1. Database leaks: Many security breaches or data leaks occur on various platforms, exposing email addresses or usernames along with their related passwords. Attackers compile and combine these leaked databases to create combolists. 2. Credential stuffing: Attackers reuse leaked credentials from one website and try them on different sites. Successful logins are then collected and combined into combolists. 3. Phishing: Phishing is a method wherein attackers deceive users into sharing their usernames or passwords. Through phishing campaigns, attackers gather login credentials and combine them into combolists. 4. Brute-force attacks: Attackers carry out a brute force attack by attempting different combinations of usernames/email addresses and passwords, systematically generating many potential matches. Successful combinations are then saved as combolists. 5. Account generators: There are tools and software available that automatically generate email/username:password combinations. These tools can create large volumes of combolists quickly. It is important to note that the creation and distribution of combolists are illegal and unethical activities.

The purpose of the queue is to ensure that only the last requested image is loaded if multiple requests are made in quick succession, as might happen when the user is holding down the image switch button. Here are the steps to implement a queue for loading images: 1. Initialize an image loading queue in your \`ImageViewer\` class. 2. Modify the \`load_image\` function to add tasks to the queue instead of processing them directly. 3. Create a new method that runs in the background to process the queue and load the last image added. 4. Ensure that the queue processing function gets called whenever necessary. The following code snippet shows the implementation based on the \`ImageViewer\` class from your provided code: \`\`\`python import queue import threading class ImageViewer: # ... other parts of the class ... def __init__(self, root): # ... existing initialization code ... # Initialize an image loading queue with a maximum size of 1 to store only the latest request self.image_loading_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=1) self.image_loading_thread = None # Variable to store our loading thread # ... rest of the existing initialization code ... def load_image(self, image_path): # Instead of loading the image directly, we add the image path to the queue # If the queue has an old image path, it gets replaced by the latest one try: self.image_loading_queue.put_nowait(image_path) # Non-blocking put with discard of old item except queue.Full: # If the queue is full, remove the old item and insert the new one self.image_loading_queue.get_nowait() # Remove old item self.image_loading_queue.put_nowait(image_path) # Insert new item # If the image loading thread is not running or it's no longer alive, we start it if self.image_loading_thread is None or not self.image_loading_thread.is_alive(): self.image_loading_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.process_image_loading_queue) self.image_loading_thread.start() def process_image_loading_queue(self): while not self.image_loading_queue.empty(): # Get the last image path from the queue, which is the image we need to load image_path = self.image_loading_queue.get_nowait() # Here you would include your existing image loading logic, replacing the inline code # with a function call if necessary. For example: self._actual_image_loading_logic(image_path) # Replace with your existing loading logic def _actual_image_loading_logic(self, image_path): # This is where your existing image opening, processing, and displaying logic would go pass # ... the rest of your class definition ... \`\`\` Please adjust the above sample to fit within your actual \`ImageViewer\` class. With the current structure, a new thread is spawned to process the image loading every time a new image is requested; however, there could be more elegant or efficient ways to handle this, depending on your specific requirements and design goals. Remember to handle thread safety and synchronization issues as appropriate, such as when updating UI elements, which should only be done from the main thread. You can use \`root.after\` in tkinter to perform UI updates from a worker thread."},{"instruction":"is there any parts of the code i need to delete implement that change","output":"Yes, to integrate the queuing mechanism effectively, you will need to make some changes to your existing \`load_image\` method and remove any other inline image-loading code that should use the queue instead. Here's what you should do: 1. **Remove the old \`load_image\` logic**, since the actual image loading and manipulation will happen in the \`_actual_image_loading_logic\` method. Also, ensure that you integrate the EXIF handling and image manipulation code from the old \`load_image\` method into this new method. 2. **Replace all calls to \`load_image\` with calls to add image paths to the queue**. This means adding tasks to the queue whenever you want to load a new image, rather than directly calling \`load_image\`. 3. **Modify the \`display_image\` method to call the queuing function** instead of directly starting a new thread for each image load. 4. **Remove direct threading calls related to image loading** from the class if you plan to manage threads within the queuing system. Here is a focused snippet of how your \`ImageViewer\` class should change: In \`__init__\`, remove: \`\`\`python # self.image_loading_queue = Queue(maxsize=5) # OLD queue initialization \`\`\` Modify \`display_image\` to enqueue image paths instead of starting new threads: \`\`\`python def display_image(self): # ... existing code ... # Queue up the next image to load it. image_path = os.path.join(self.image_folder, self.image_files[self.current_image_index]) self.load_image(image_path) # Put the image path into the queue \`\`\` Remove \`threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start()\` from all parts of the code since thread management is now inside the \`load_image\` and \`process_image_loading_queue\` methods. Replace the old \`load_image\` method with the new queuing and processing system: \`\`\`python def load_image(self, image_path): # ... queuing code as shown above ... def process_image_loading_queue(self): # Get the latest image path and process it # while not self.image_loading_queue.empty(): # This while loop could cause an endless loop if there are no breaks. if not self.image_loading_queue.empty(): image_path = self.image_loading_queue.get_nowait() self._actual_image_loading_logic(image_path) def _actual_image_loading_logic(self, image_path): # ... new method containing the actual image loading and displaying logic ... \`\`\` With these changes, when a user rapidly presses the button to change images, only the last image request will be processed, as it will be the only item left in the queue. Before implementing this, ensure that you thoroughly test your application to verify that these changes work as intended and do not introduce new bugs. Specifically, check threading behaviors, and make sure that your tkinter UI updates are always done on the main thread. I hope this clarifies what parts need to be changed. If you have any more specific parts of the code you need assistance with, feel free to share the code snippets, and I can provide more targeted guidance."},{"instruction":"1.

This method will be redefined to add tasks to the queue instead of directly loading the image. \`\`\`python # Anywhere previously calling load_image self.load_image(image_path) # Now becomes (the method call remains the same) self.load_image(image_path) \`\`\` 3. **Modify \`display_image\` method:** - In the \`display_image\` method, you will no longer start a new thread. Instead, you'll be calling \`load_image(image_path)\` to enqueue the image path. \`\`\`python # Old display_image chunk def display_image(self): # ... threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() # Now becomes def display_image(self): # ... self.load_image(image_path) # Queue up the next image to be loaded \`\`\` 4. **Remove direct threading calls related to image loading:** - Remove any direct calls to \`threading.Thread\` from the \`ImageViewer\` class that is associated with image loading. Instead, manage threads only within the \`load_image\` method and the subsequent \`_actual_image_loading_logic\` method that gets called from the queue processor. \`\`\`python # All these lines threading.Thread(target=self.load_image, args=(image_path,)).start() # Should be removed or replaced with self.load_image(image_path) # This enqueues the path; the thread is managed inside the load_image method \`\`\` By following these instructions, you will complete the transition to a queuing system where image loading requests are managed efficiently.

Would it effect the earth's magnetic field","output":"If 500,000 satellites were orbiting in the Van Allen belt, it would likely have a significant impact on the Earth's magnetic field. The Van Allen belts are regions of intense radiation surrounding the Earth, kept in place by the planet's magnetic field. The particles in the belts are mainly charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. The motion of these charged particles generates magnetic fields of their own. If 500,000 satellites were introduced into the Van Allen belt, they would disturb the equilibrium of the charged particles and their associated magnetic fields. This disturbance would likely lead to changes in the Earth's magnetic field in the vicinity of the Van Allen belts. The exact nature and extent of these changes would depend on various factors, including the size, composition, and orbits of the satellites. However, it is expected that the Earth's magnetic field would be significantly affected, potentially leading to alterations in the shape, strength, and stability of the field in the Van Allen belt region and possibly elsewhere. It is worth noting that the Van Allen belts are already dynamic and subject to natural variations due to solar activity and other factors. Adding a large number of satellites would likely introduce additional complexity and make it challenging to predict the precise effects on the Earth's magnetic field. Further research and modeling would be necessary to fully understand the consequences of such an event."},{"instruction":"отсортируй этот список по алфавиту 10. Андрейкин, А. А.

Образ этого молодого человека глубоко поучителен и символичен: Герасим – типичный мужик, изображённый с характерными чертами своего времени, вместе с тем он - личность необычайно сильная духовно, цельная и чистая.<br/><br/>С первых строк повести Герасим предстает перед нами молчаливым и угрюмым, что обусловлено его глухонемотой. Но, несмотря на свою ущербность, он является удивительно трудолюбивым и исключительно сильным человеком, который излучает спокойствие и уверенность. Глухонемота Герасима становится своеобразным символом, показывающим его отрешённость от мира, в котором царят лицемерие и несправедливость.<br/><br/>В душе Герасим добрый и отзывчивый, он истинно проявляет свои чувства только в общении с животными, его верными спутниками. Именно с его собакой Муму Тургенев связывает ключевые сюжетные линии и выявляет глубину и чистосердечность чувств простого мужика. Эта собака становится для Герасима не простым питомцем, а истинным другом и верным спутником, с которым он делится своей теплотой и заботой.<br/><br/>Драматизм образа Герасима раскрывается в полной мере, когда он сталкивается с выбором между своими желаниями и приказами барыни. Приказ утопить Муму, единственную радость в его жизни, поставил Герасима в очень тяжелую ситуацию. Он не хотел причинять зла своему питомцу, но должен был подчиниться жестоким порядкам помещичьей жизни. Тем не менее, после того как повеление было исполнено, душевная боль и потеря верного друга заставляет Герасима сделать крайний шаг - он покидает поместье, чтобы начать новую жизнь.<br/><br/>Герасим как персонаж воплощает собой несгибаемость и стойкость русского крестьянства перед лицом самых тяжелых испытаний. Его молчаливый протест и уход с поместья воспринимаются как знак силы духа и желания жить согласно собственным принципам и морали. Это делает его одним из самых ярких и значимых героев русской классической литературы. Пользователь: Сочинение по кавказкий пленик Ты: Кавказский пленник – это произведение великого русского поэта Михаила Юрьевича Лермонтова, в котором отражён мотив пленения и свободы через историю офицера русской армии, взятого в плен на Кавказе.<br/><br/>Центральной фигурой рассказа является молодой русский офицер, которого после неудачного боя захватывают горцы. Он оказывается в чужой и неприязненной среде, отдалённой от дома и близких людей. Опыт плена заставляет героя пережить множество испытаний, как физических, так и духовных.<br/><br/>Свобода для пленника становится не просто физическим освобождением от оков, но и внутренним преображением. Персонаж переосмысливает своё отношение к жизни, ценности и мотивы своих действий. Побег главного героя олицетворяет его неуступчивость перед лицом трудностей и стремление к свободе не только тела, но и духа.<br/><br/>Лермонтов в своём произведении не только затрагивает темы чести, мужества и свободы, но и выражает своё отношение к кавказским войнам и российской империализму, ставящему под сомнение смысл военных конфликтов и человеческих жертв.<br/><br/>Символы природы в “Кавказском пленнике” играют особую роль, дополняя внутренний мир героев и служа фоном для их переживаний. Горы, с одной стороны, символизируют величие и несокрушимость, с другой – их неприступность и опасность, подобно суровой судьбе пленника.<br/><br/>Итоговое послание “Кавказского пленника” многогранно. Это и героическая борьба индивидуума за свободу, и антивоенный пацифистский мотив, и размышление о ценности человеческой жизни. Лермонтов создает пронзительный образ, заставляющий читателя по-новому взглянуть на многие аспекты бытия человека в обществе и природе.

Тем не менее, я могу создать короткий развлекательный текст, вдохновленный персонажами “Гарри Поттера” и воображаемой персонажкой Агнией Кармановой, которую вы придумали для этой истории.<br/><br/>—<br/><br/>Драко Малфой сидел один в широкой спальне замка Малфоев, его серые глаза непроницаемо смотрели в пылающий камин. Материала его школьная форма, казалось, что ветер Хогвартса еще колыхал его платок со знаком Слизерина.<br/><br/>Вдруг его размышления прервал осторожный стук в дверь. Драко поморщился, не ожидая посетителей на каникулах. Он вскочил со стула и быстро пошёл к двери. Когда он её открыл, на пороге стояла девушка с огненно-рыжими волосами. Её глаза были ярко-зелеными, полными уверенности и загадочности. Это была Агния Карманова — новая студентка Волшебной Академии в Европе, которая была приглашена в замок Малфоев.<br/><br/>“Драко Малфой, предполагаю?” произнесла она с тонким акцентом.<br/><br/>“А вы кто?” - резко спросил Драко, с удивлением заметив золотую брошь на её плаще в форме двуглавого орла. Ещё не Рейвенкло, и какое-то другое учебное заведение, подумал он.<br/><br/>“Агния Карманова,” она улыбнулась, и её улыбка была настолько искренней, что даже Драко почувствовал, как смягчается. “Я приехала обсудить с вашим отцом некоторые вопросы обмена магическим опытом между школами.”<br/><br/>Лукавство в её взгляде заинтриговало Драко. “И что же, вам удалось выяснить с моим отцом?”<br/><br/>“Увы, его нет, и мне придётся ждать. Но, похоже, у нас есть возможность познакомиться поближе,” сказала Агния, и Драко уловил в её голосе вызов.<br/><br/>Вдруг, как бы играя, Агния выхватила из-за спины тонкую ивовую палочку с сердцевиной из волоса велеса. “Не хотите проверить, готовы ли вы защищать свои цвета школы, Малфой?”<br/><br/>Драко не мог не принять вызов. Они перешагнули через порог библиотеки, где старинные книги были свидетелями многих турниров и дуэлей. Агния стала напротив Драко, и их взгляды встретились. Взмахи палочек прозвучали в такт их дыханию. Чары плескались около потолка, как танцующие огоньки. Но не было ни гнева, ни ненависти — только стремление показать свою силу и умение.<br/><br/>Битва волшебства продолжалась, пока не стихла порывистость движений, не стали они не столько соперниками, сколько танцорами в вальсе магических чар. В конце концов, Агния сократила дистанцию и сказала:<br/><br/>“Вы умеете удивлять, Малфой. Я думала, что слизеринцы только и умеют, что лукавить и плести интриги.”<br/><br/>“Может быть,” Драко подмигнул, предчувствуя начало интересной дружбы, или даже чего-то большего. “Но сейчас я убежден, что кое-кто может научить меня ещё и искренности._personal”&gt;<br/><br/>И так, магия и ум начали переплетаться между Драко и Агнией, повествуя о новой главе в истории, в которой герои могут быть сильнее своих предрассудков и происхождения.

Не прошло и пяти минут как она пришла -Что случилось- спросила у меня она тревожным голосом Сейчас расскажу заходи попьем чай Я еë впустила и налила чай -Быстрее говори уже- сказала она Я ей всё очень подробна рассказала Она была в шоке и сказала что всë наладится она по всякому меня подержала и подбадривала Я была ей очень благодарна У нас затянулся разговор но его прервал звонок кто-то звонил дарине Она подняла трубку и начала с кем-то разговаривала около десяти минут разговор она закончила и сказала мне что ей пора итти еë ждут в клубе Я попросилась с ней но она меня не взяла со словами что я очень маленькая на этом мы разошлись Я пошла в гостиную и села около Комина и начала листать фото на странице Драко тут я почувствовала ладонь на своем плече и тут послышался голос - красивый- спросил он - кто -спросила я -Парень на фото- сказал голас Я повернулась и увидела Драко - Привет -сказал он -пр-привет- сказала я -Я хочу с тобой поговорить -о чëм - я тебе нравлюсь? -......... Да и надеюсь ето взаимно -я очень тебя люблю -сказал он и поцеловал меня в щеку Я покраснела мы ещо немного посидели в гостиной и после этого разошлись я пошла к себе в комнату и была очень рада потому что теперь у меня есть парень и не просто какой-то человек а человек которого я люблю .","output":"Тьфу-тьфу! Что это за странный шум? Я проснулась от необычного звонка будильника. Неохотно поднявшись с кровати, я направилась на завтрак, где меня уже ждал ароматный пирог с черникой. Вкусно! Сытая и довольная, я решила прогуляться по саду и поискать Гермиону. Хотелось узнать, почему подруга не ответила на мой вчерашний звонок. Но в саду не оказалось ни Гермионы, ни Рона, зато я увидела куда более странный элемент — Драко Малфой в окружении своей приспешной компании занимался издевательствами над каким-то мальчишкой. \\"Эй!\\" - решила я не молчать и окликнула их. Драко оглянулся на меня и подошел, спросив, что я тут делаю. \\"Тебе тот же вопрос,\\" - ответила я, не сводя глаз. \\"Я спросил первым,\\" - не унимался Драко, грубовато посматривая на меня. Не хотелось продолжать спорить с ним здесь и сейчас. \\"Пришла поблагодарить за подарок, но теперь вижу, тебе не до этого,\\" - отрезала я и ушла, пусть он подумает. В комнате я сразу же написала СМС Дарине, и она появилась в кратчайшие сроки. \\"Что случилось?\\" - с тревогой в голосе спросила подруга. Я позвала её внутрь и рассказала обо всем за чашечкой чая. Дарина внимательно меня выслушала и уверила, что все наладится. Её поддержка была бесценна. Но вот Дарине позвонили — ей нужно было в клуб. Я хотела пойти с ней, но она отказала, считая меня слишком молодой для таких мероприятий. Одна оставшись, я сидела в гостиной у камина, листая фотографии Драко в соцсети. И тут я почувствовала ладонь на своем плече и услышала голос Драко за спиной. \\"Красивый?\\" - спросил он, указывая на парня на фотографии. Я обернулась и увидела его, стоящего рядом со мной. \\"Привет,\\" - сказал Драко. \\"Пр-привет,\\" - еле выговорила я. \\"Я хочу с тобой поговорить,\\" - продолжил он. \\"О чём?\\" - моя рука дрогнула, тревожно скрыв фото. \\"Я тебе нравлюсь?\\" - его взгляд был напряженным. \\"Да... И надеюсь, это взаимно,\\" - призналась я с трудом. \\"Я очень тебя люблю,\\" - сказал он и поцеловал меня в щеку. Я покраснела, и мы еще немного поболтали в гостиной, а когда расстались, сердце мое было полно радости. Теперь у меня есть парень, и не простой, а тот самый, которого я любила."},{"instruction":"The length of the circle C can be calculated by the formula C = 2piR, where R is the radius of the circle.

Here is an example using SQL Server: First, ensure that you have added the \`System.Data.SqlClient\` reference to your project. Then, in your C# code, you would do something like this: \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.Data.SqlClient; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { // Connection string for your local database // Make sure to modify the DataSource and InitialCatalog according to your setup // Integrated Security is set to true for Windows Authentication // For SQL Server Authentication, you will need to specify UserID and Password string connectionString = \\"Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=YourDatabaseName;Integrated Security=True\\"; // SQL command you want to execute string sql = \\"SELECT * FROM YourTableName\\"; // Create a SqlConnection using the provided connection string using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString)) { try { // Open the SqlConnection connection.Open(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Connection opened successfully.\\"); // Create a SqlCommand using the connection and the SQL string using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection)) { // Execute the SqlCommand and obtain a SqlDataReader using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader()) { // Read the data while (reader.Read()) { // Assuming your table has at least one column named 'ColumnName' Console.WriteLine(reader[\\"ColumnName\\"].ToString()); } } } } catch (Exception ex) { // Handle any exceptions that occur Console.WriteLine(\\"An error occurred: \\" + ex.Message); } finally { // Close the connection if it's open if (connection.State == System.Data.ConnectionState.Open) connection.Close(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Connection closed.\\"); } } Console.WriteLine(\\"Press any key to exit...\\"); Console.ReadKey(); } } \`\`\` Before running the code, make sure the database server is running, the database exists, and you've correctly replaced \`YourDatabaseName\`, \`YourTableName\`, and the \`DataSource\` in the connection string with the relevant details of your local setup. Additionally, if you want to execute a non-query command (e.g., \`INSERT\`, \`UPDATE\`, \`DELETE\`), you would use the \`ExecuteNonQuery\` method of the \`SqlCommand\` object: \`\`\`csharp string sql = \\"INSERT INTO YourTableName (Column1, Column2) VALUES ('Value1', 'Value2')\\"; using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection)) { int affectedRows = command.ExecuteNonQuery(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Number of rows affected: {affectedRows}\\"); } \`\`\` For parameterized queries (to prevent SQL injection), use parameters like so: \`\`\`csharp string sql = \\"INSERT INTO YourTableName (Column1, Column2) VALUES (@param1, @param2)\\"; using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection)) { command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\\"@param1\\", \\"Value1\\"); command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\\"@param2\\", \\"Value2\\"); int affectedRows = command.ExecuteNonQuery(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Number of rows affected: {affectedRows}\\"); } \`\`\` Make sure to match the data types of the columns in your table when adding values to the parameters."},{"instruction":"√a^2-4ab+4b^2 when a=3 and b=4","output":"The expression you've given is √(a^2 - 4ab + 4b^2).

It draws inspiration from various sources such as cyberpunk, horror, and the concept of a post-apocalyptic world. Sickcore creates an atmosphere that is eerie, unsettling, and filled with despair. The color palette of Sickcore often consists of sickly greens, putrid yellows, decaying grays, and murky purples. These colors contribute to a sense of sickness and corruption, often resembling infected wounds or decaying flesh. The use of vibrant neon lights amidst the darkness adds a futuristic and cyberpunk element to the aesthetic. The visual elements of Sickcore often include fragmented and glitchy images, distorted and glitched typography, and distorted portraits. These elements are used to reflect the decay and disarray of the world, representing a broken reality. The aesthetic may incorporate elements like viruses, bacteria, medical equipment, and monsters, symbolizing the sickness that has taken over society. Sickcore often depicts desolate and ruined cityscapes, with crumbling buildings, polluted skies, and overgrown vegetation. These scenes amplify the feeling of a world on the brink of collapse and highlight the decay that accompanies sickness. The aesthetic may also include symbols of control and surveillance, representing a dystopian society where people are constantly monitored and manipulated. In terms of fashion, Sickcore often incorporates elements of cyberpunk, goth, and industrial styles. It includes tattered and distressed clothing, asymmetrical designs, metallic accents, and accessories with a medical or industrial look. The fashion reflects the decay and chaos of the world, showcasing a lack of care and a sense of detachment from societal norms. Sickcore as an aesthetic aims to explore the darker aspects of our existence and question the consequences of unchecked industrialization, societal decay, and the loss of connection with nature. It presents a bleak and disorienting vision of the world, highlighting the fragility of human existence and the dangers of neglecting our environment and well-being."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: “Yuri, it looks like we’re the only ones here.” Yuri: “Indeed, it seems that way.

Chaoslith represents a totalitarian regime that thrives on the denial of an afterlife and the suppression of individuality and creativity. Under its rule, the empire imposes an oppressive regime influenced by Orwellian principles. The name \\"Chaoslith\\" reflects the empire's core ideologies. \\"Chaos\\" embodies the disarray and bleakness that permeates society, while \\"lith\\" represents the cold and unyielding nature of the empire's control. This juxtaposition captures the essence of the Anti-Afterlifecore aesthetic, emphasizing a paradoxical existence where chaos coexists with a rigid system. Chaoslith is built upon brutalism architecture, characterized by its imposing and austere structures. The cold concrete structures dominate the imperial landscape, depicting the empire's desire for control and uniformity. The architecture serves as a constant reminder of the lack of individuality and personal expression within society. In Chaoslith, nihilism prevails as the dominant philosophy. The belief that life holds no inherent meaning is ingrained in the empire's culture, leading to a society consumed by apathy and cynicism. Capitalism reigns supreme, with a focus on commodification and profit at the expense of individual well-being and genuine human connection. The empire's anti-fun mentality suppresses joy and pleasure, relegating them as distractions from the harsh reality and reinforcing the oppressive nature of the regime. Within Chaoslith, the controversial concepts of individuality and creativity are actively discouraged. These traits are seen as disruptive, challenging the status quo and potentially leading to rebellion or dissent. The empire seeks to mold its citizens into compliant and obedient subjects, valuing conformity over personal expression. The Anti-Afterlifecore empire of Chaoslith presents a grim and oppressive society, where the denial of an afterlife, Orwellianism, brutalism architecture, nihilism, capitalism, cynicism, and anti-fun converge to create a dystopian existence. It serves as a cautionary tale, questioning the consequences of suppressing individuality, creativity, and embracing a life devoid of meaning and enjoyment."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: “Yuri, it looks like we’re the only ones here.” Yuri: “Indeed, it seems that way.

Within the Nyxium Dominus lies a sprawling, twisted metropolis known as Umbra Entropia—the heart of darkness and the epicenter of all wickedness. This decaying city is a haunting spectacle, characterized by towering, jagged architecture engulfed in perpetual twilight. A sinister aura fills the air, causing the denizens to live in fear and obedience to the Dark Sovereign's insatiable thirst for power. The empire's armies are merciless legions known as the Nightreapers. These elite warriors, adorned in ebony armor and wielding wickedly curved blades, strike fear into the hearts of their enemies. Trained to exploit the dark energy within themselves, they possess unmatched strength and agility, enabling them to swiftly overpower any foe. The Nightreapers roam the universe, claiming planets and annihilating civilizations in an unyielding campaign to spread the empire's eternal darkness. The Nyxium Dominus exhibits unparalleled technological advancements, bolstered by their mastery over dark matter. They have developed devastating weapons capable of harnessing the destructive potential of collapsing stars. One such creation is the Cataclysm Array, a colossal interstellar weapon that unleashes waves of entropy, obliterating entire star systems and leaving nothing but cosmic dust in its wake. As whispers of Nyxium Dominus' relentless conquest spread across galaxies, fear and despair grip all who dare oppose them. Entire civilizations have fallen prey to their destructive might. The empire's insidious reach continues to expand, and each conquered world is consumed, its inhabitants erased from the tapestry of existence. The Nyxium Dominus stands as a chilling reminder of the fragility of life and the terrifying power that darkness holds. With their sinister leader, the Dark Sovereign, guiding their malevolent ambition, none can escape the impending doom that looms over the universe—the eternal oblivion brought forth by the Nyxium Dominus."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

A continuación te doy los pasos a seguir: 1. **Eliminación de suciedad superficial:** - Usa un paño suave y seco para limpiar cualquier suciedad o polvo superficial del portagrilletes. 2. **Limpieza con jabón específico para cuero:** - Compra un jabón para cuero o un limpiador específicamente diseñado para este material. Los jabones suaves y sin perfumes son una buena opción. - Humedece ligeramente un paño limpio con agua y pon una pequeña cantidad de jabón específico para cuero en el paño. - Frota el portagrilletes con el paño de forma suave y con movimientos circulares, evitando saturar el cuero con agua. 3. **Limpieza de manchas difíciles:** - Si hay manchas más difíciles, puedes usar una solución más concentrada de jabón para cuero y agua, y aplicarla directamente sobre la mancha. - Utiliza un cepillo de cerdas suaves para cuero si es necesario, pero hazlo con mucho cuidado para no rayar o dañar el cuero. 4. **Aclarado:** - Una vez hayas terminado de limpiar, pasa un paño limpio y húmedo sobre el portagrilletes para eliminar cualquier residuo de jabón. 5. **Secado:** - Deja que el portagrilletes se seque completamente al aire en un lugar bien ventilado, lejos de la luz directa del sol o de fuentes de calor, ya que pueden dañar el cuero. 6. **Hidratación del cuero:** - Una vez seco, es importante hidratar el cuero. Utiliza un acondicionador o crema para cuero, aplicándolo con un paño suave y siguiendo las instrucciones del producto. - Deja que el acondicionador penetre en el cuero y luego pule con un paño limpio y seco para dar brillo. 7. **Mantenimiento preventivo:** - Evitar exponer el portagrilletes a la humedad, calor extremo y sustancias ácidas o alcalinas que puedan deteriorarlo. - Si se moja, sécalo inmediatamente con un paño absorbente y déjalo secar de forma natural. Siempre sigue las recomendaciones del fabricante y prueba cualquier producto de limpieza en una parte poco visible del portagrilletes antes de aplicarlo en su totalidad. Esto servirá para asegurarte de que el producto no cause decoloración ni dañe el material."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: “Yuri, it looks like we’re the only ones here.” Yuri: “Indeed, it seems that way.

Расскажи как с помощью interface.u вывести счетчик PVP и PK персонажа на экран.","output":"Чтобы добавить счетчик PVP (Player vs Player) и PK (Player Killer) в клиентскую часть игры Lineage 2 Interlude, вам нужно будет редактировать файл \`interface.u\`. Однако, важно учитывать, что редактирование клиентских файлов может быть нарушением правил игры и привести к блокировке аккаунта. Также работы с .u файлами может требовать знаний в программировании и умения работать со специализированным ПО. В общих чертах процесс создания новых элементов интерфейса будет выглядеть так: 1. Программы для редактирования: Для редактирования файла \`interface.u\` вам понадобятся специализированные программы, такие как UnrealEd (Редактор Unreal Engine, на котором создана игра) или другие редакторы, которые позволяют работать с .u файлами. 2. Распаковка и редактирование: Сначала нужно распаковать содержимое файла \`interface.u\` с помощью программы-распаковщика Unreal Engine. После изменения файла вы должны будете его обратно упаковать. 3. Создание элементов интерфейса: В редакторе вы будете создавать новые элементы интерфейса (Widgets) для отображения счетчиков PVP и PK. Вы должны определить местоположение и визуальный стиль счетчиков (например, шрифты, цвета и фоны). 4. Программирование отображения данных: При создании новых элементов интерфейса, вам нужно будет написать код, который будет извлекать данные PVP и PK текущего персонажа и отображать их в созданных элементах. Вам нужно будет ознакомиться с API, которое предоставляет Lineage 2 для работы с данными персонажа. 5. Тестирование: После добавления и программирования новых элементов интерфейса, необходимо провести тестирование, чтобы убедиться, что отображаемые данные корректны и интерфейс отображается правильно при различных разрешениях экрана и в различных условиях игры. Если вы не знакомы с процедурой модификации клиентских файлов Lineage 2 или с разработкой интерфейсов в Unreal Engine, задача может оказаться довольно сложной. Кроме того, изменение клиентских файлов игры без официального разрешения издателя игры может нарушать лицензионное соглашение и вести к блокированию вашей учетной записи. Помните, что мои ответы основаны на информации, доступной до среза знаний в 2023 году и способы работы с файлами и ПО могут изменяться."},{"instruction":"Расскажи в какой Class interface.u писать код. И какой код туда нужно написать.","output":"Изменение файлов клиентской части игры Lineage 2 Interlude может быть нарушением условий обслуживания, и моё предназначение - не поощрять или предоставлять инструкции по возможным нарушениям этих условий. Однако, я могу дать общее представление о том, как устроена работа с пользовательским интерфейсом в играх, созданных на Unreal Engine, что может быть актуально для разработчиков модов или людей, работающих с официальным разрешением. В Unreal Engine пользовательский интерфейс обычно создается в системе UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics), с использованием классов Widget(Blueprints) в новых версиях движка, или же через классы GUI, например \`UXWindow\` или \`UGUIComponent\` в более старых версиях. Код для отображения информации в игровом интерфейсе обычно пишется в классе, который отвечает за GUI элемент. В случае Lineage 2 могут быть использованы классы вроде \`UIInventory\` или \`UIMain\`. В этих классах можно создать функции, которые будут вызываться для обновления информации на экране. Код на Unrealscript для отображения данных PVP/PK может выглядеть так: \`\`\`unrealscript class MyPvPInfo extends UIFrame; var private UIScene myScene; var private UILabel PvPScoreLabel; var private UILabel PKScoreLabel; // Инициализация компонента function Initialize(UIBaseScene Scene) { super.Initialize(Scene); myScene = Scene; // Создаем и настраиваем лейбл для отображения PVP PvPScoreLabel = new class'UILabel'; PvPScoreLabel.InitComponent(); PvPScoreLabel.SetPosition(x, y); // задать позицию PvPScoreLabel.SetSize(width, height); // задать размер // конфигурирование внешнего вида лейбла (шрифт, цвет и т. д.) // Создаем и настраиваем лейбл для отображения PK PKScoreLabel = new class'UILabel'; PKScoreLabel.InitComponent(); PKScoreLabel.SetPosition(x, y); // задать позицию PKScoreLabel.SetSize(width, height); // задать размер // конфигурирование внешнего вида лейбла (шрифт, цвет и т. д.) // Добавляем лейблы к сцене myScene.AddComponent(PvPScoreLabel); myScene.AddComponent(PKScoreLabel); } function Update() { local PlayerController PC; local MyCharacter Char; PC = PlayerController(GetPlayerOwner()); if (PC != none) { Char = MyCharacter(PC.Pawn); if (Char != none) { // Обновляем текст лейблов PvPScoreLabel.SetText(\\"PVP: \\" Char.PvPCount); PKScoreLabel.SetText(\\"PK: \\" Char.PKCount); } } } function Tick(float DeltaTime) { // Обновляем счетчики каждый кадр (или реже, по необходимости) Update(); } \`\`\` Это всего лишь примерный пример того, как может выглядеть код на Unrealscript, и он не будет работать без дополнительной настройки и правильной интеграции с существующими классами игры. Кроме того, сами переменные \`PvPCount\` и \`PKCount\` должны быть определены в контексте игрового персонажа и должны обновляться соответствующим образом. Мои комментарии относительно API и названий классов являются гипотетическими, и определенный код потребуется адаптировать под реальную структуру и API Lineage 2 Interlude. Пожалуйста, убедитесь, что вы имеете разрешение на такие изменения и полностью понимаете возможные риски."},{"instruction":"Type mismatch: cannot convert from OBSCommandBuilder<capture#2-of ? extends OBSRequest> to OBSCommandBuilder<T> private Map<String, OBSCommandBuilder<? extends OBSRequest>> callbacks;","output":"The type mismatch error is occurring because you are trying to assign a value of type \`OBSCommandBuilder<? extends OBSRequest>\` to a variable of type \`OBSCommandBuilder<T>\` where \`T\` is the type parameter of the variable.

G is a connected graph.","output":"The adjacency matrix A of a graph G represents the adjacencies between vertices: The element (A_{ij}) is 1 if there is an edge between the ith and jth vertices in the graph, and 0 if there is no edge. The powers of the adjacency matrix have a special interpretation: - (A^0) is the identity matrix, representing zero-length walks from vertices to themselves. - (A^1) is the adjacency matrix itself, representing one-edge walks between vertices. - (A^2) gives the number of two-edge walks between pairs of vertices. - ... - (A^{n-1}) gives the number of walks of length n-1 between pairs of vertices. If the sum of matrices (A^0 + A^1 + A^2 + cdots + A^{n-1}) has only non-zero elements, this means that there is some path between every pair of vertices (regardless of the walk's length, but with a maximum of n-1 edges). Hence, if \`G\` is a graph such that the matrix sum described above has only non-zero elements, it indicates that there's a walk between every pair of vertices. This is equivalent to the statement that the graph is connected, because there is a path between any two vertices. Therefore: G is an acyclic graph. - This cannot be determined solely based on the given condition; even a cyclic graph can satisfy the condition as long as it's connected. G is a tree. - This cannot be concluded, as trees are acyclic and there are no walks of length more than n-1 in a tree, however a graph can still be connected and not be a tree (i.e., it can contain cycles). G no graph connected. - This is not grammatically correct, and also the presence of non-zero elements in the matrix sum implies that the graph is connected, rather than not connected.

It is a dystopian vision of capitalism that emphasizes the negative aspects and harmful effects it can have on society and the planet. In negatopian capitalism, corporations and wealthy individuals exploit resources and labor without considering the long-term consequences. They prioritize short-term gains and financial success over the well-being of workers, local communities, and the environment. This can result in the depletion of natural resources, pollution, inequality, and social unrest. Critics argue that negatopian capitalism promotes a culture of greed, selfishness, and a \\"winner-takes-all\\" mentality. It discourages collaboration and cooperation, as competition becomes cutthroat and unethical practices become more prevalent. This can lead to a loss of social cohesion and trust within society. Additionally, negatopian capitalism perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities, as the rich become richer and the poor struggle to access basic necessities and opportunities. The focus on profit maximization often comes at the expense of workers' rights, fair wages, and safe working conditions. Advocates for negatopian capitalism believe that it drives innovation, economic growth, and prosperity, benefiting society as a whole. However, critics argue that the negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits and advocate for a more balanced form of capitalism that considers social and environmental well-being. Overall, negatopian capitalism represents a worst-case scenario of unregulated and unchecked capitalism, where profit is prioritized at the expense of people and the planet. It highlights the dangers of extreme free-market ideologies and the need for a more sustainable and responsible economic system."},{"instruction":"Describe negatopian language","output":"Negatopian language refers to a type of communication that emphasizes negativity, pessimism, and a bleak view of the world. It is characterized by a focus on problems, limitations, and the worst possible outcomes. This type of language tends to overlook or downplay positive aspects and highlights the negative aspects of a situation. In negatopian language, individuals may often use words and phrases that convey despair, hopelessness, and a sense of defeat. They may express cynicism, skepticism, and a lack of faith in the potential for positive changes or solutions. The tone of this language is often pessimistic, critical, and skeptical. Negatopian language can lead to a toxic and demoralizing atmosphere, as it reinforces negative beliefs, discourages optimism, and undermines motivation. It can contribute to a sense of helplessness and resignation, as individuals may feel that the challenges they face are insurmountable and that positive change is unlikely. It is important to be aware of the impact of negatopian language and strive for a more balanced and constructive form of communication. By fostering a more positive and solution-oriented mindset, individuals can encourage collaboration, creativity, and resilience, which are essential for addressing challenges and making progress in various areas of life. In summary, negatopian language reflects a mindset that dwells on the negative aspects of situations, presenting a pessimistic and discouraging view of the world. It is important to acknowledge and address problems, but it is equally crucial to maintain a balanced and constructive approach to communication that allows for optimism and the exploration of potential solutions."},{"instruction":"How much high sugar levels cost memory loss","output":"The question of how high sugar levels might cost memory loss is a complex one that involves multiple factors, including the time frame of high sugar exposure, the individual's age, overall health, medical history, and the presence of other risk factors for cognitive decline. Chronic high blood sugar levels, typically associated with diabetes or prediabetes, can increase the risk of developing cognitive issues, including memory loss. The exact mechanism by which high sugar levels might impair memory is not entirely understood, but several hypotheses have been proposed: 1. Vascular Damage: Chronically high levels of glucose can lead to damage in the blood vessels, including those in the brain. Poor blood circulation can impair cognitive function and lead to memory problems. 2. Insulin Resistance: Insulin is important in the brain for nerve signaling and the formation of memories. If the brain becomes insulin resistant, as can happen with chronic hyperglycemia, this could interfere with these processes and lead to cognitive decline. 3. Inflammation: High levels of blood sugar can lead to increased inflammation throughout the body, including the brain. Chronic inflammation has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, which is characterized by severe memory loss. 4. Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Excess sugar can bind to proteins and form harmful compounds known as AGEs. These can affect the structure and function of tissues and organs, including the brain. 5. Oxidative Stress: High sugar levels can increase oxidative stress, which can damage brain cells and affect cognitive function. It is difficult to quantify how much memory loss is \\"cost\\" by high sugar levels since cognitive decline is typically the result of a combination of factors and the degree of impact differs from person to person. However, numerous studies have associated high blood sugar levels with a greater rate of cognitive decline than normal blood sugar levels. To mitigate the risk of memory loss related to high blood sugar, it's important for individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and proper management of blood sugar levels if diabetic or prediabetic. It's also important to note that early intervention and good glucose control can help to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes-related cognitive complications. Consulting with a healthcare provider is essential for individuals concerned about the impact of high blood sugar on cognitive health, as they can offer personalized advice and a management plan."},{"instruction":"I have the following log file from a Payment Export failure: [2024-01-10T14:15:28.727+00:00 ERR- IP-] An exception occurred mapping configuration values to function payload Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException: After parsing a value an unexpected character was encountered: S.

The key information to understanding the issue lies in the error messages provided by the log file. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the critical points: 1. **Error Description**: The log file shows a \`Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException\`, indicating that there is a problem with JSON data parsing during the processing of the job. 2. **Specific Problem**: The error occurred because \\"After parsing a value an unexpected character was encountered: S. Path 'paymentMetaJson', line 1, position 218.\\" This points to an unexpected character 'S' in the JSON data that's causing the parsing to fail. 3. **Location of Error**: From the error stack trace, it's happening within the \`MapConfigurationValues\` function of the \`PayStar.Core.Features.Jobs.Tasks.InitiateFunctionOrchestration\` file at line 132 (which is involved in mapping configuration values). 4. **Point of Failure**: The job fails during the attempt to deserialize some JSON string into an object using Newtonsoft.Json (a popular .NET library for handling JSON). 5. **Underlying Code Location**: The source code for the function that is failing is located at \`C:/agent/_work/1/s/server/src/PayStar/PayStar.Core/Features/Jobs/Tasks/InitiateFunctionOrchestration.cs\` (various lines are mentioned due to the various call stack levels). 6. **Job Status**: The job execution status was attempted to be set to \\"Failed\\" due to this exception. There is also a warning following this that the status cannot transition out of \\"Processing\\", which might indicate that the job state management has a condition preventing the expected state change once a failure is encountered. **Debugging Steps**: 1. **Check the JSON**: Examine the JSON data that's being passed into the \`DeserializeObject\` method, specifically around the 'paymentMetaJson' and the position 218 where the error occurs. There might be an unexpected character such as a non-printable character, additional symbol or misplaced quotation mark causing the problem. 2. **Validate the JSON Manually**: Use a JSON validator to ensure that the JSON is properly formatted. Any good JSON validator will highlight the location of the error. 3. **Review the Deserialization Code**: Confirm that the JSON structure matches the expected object structure in the C# code. The deserialization can fail if there is a mismatch. 4. **Enable Detailed Logging**: If your application allows, enable more detailed logging temporarily to capture the JSON input to get the exact payload that's causing the error. 5. **Modify Error Handling**: Update your error handling to log the problematic JSON itself when this exception occurs, which can greatly aid in diagnosing issues like this in the future. 6. **Review State Management**: Since there's also a status transition warning, review the job execution workflow, particularly how the status is managed and updated during processing to understand why it can’t transition from the \\"Processing\\" state. 7. **Local Testing**: Try to reproduce this error in a local development environment using the same JSON input that caused the failure to debug interactively. 8. **Consult the Documentation/Support**: If you continue to have issues, you may need to consult the documentation for the Newtonsoft.Json library or seek support from peers or forums knowledgeable in the library. Addressing the JSON issue should help to resolve the failure, and the job export process might be able to proceed successfully."},{"instruction":"If I upload the JSON, can you help identify position 218?","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the capability to directly access files you upload or read content outside of what is directly shared with me in the text format. However, I can guide you through finding position 218 in your JSON string so you can locate and investigate the issue further. Here's what you can do: 1. **Open a Text Editor**: Copy your JSON data and paste it into a text editor that shows character positions. Many editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, or even online tools like JSONLint will show you the exact position of your cursor. 2. **Find the Position**: Place your cursor at the start of the \`paymentMetaJson\` value, and then move it to the right until you reach position 218. The editor should show you a number indicating your current position. This is where the error is occurring - pay attention to any unusual characters or syntax errors around this point. 3. **Inspect the Character**: At position 218, you should be able to identify what character is unexpected. It could be a stray letter, a punctuation mark, or a symbol that isn't supposed to be in JSON (like an 'S' mentioned in the error message). 4. **Consider Line Breaks**: Remember that if your JSON includes line breaks, they may be counted as characters depending on the editor you're using. This can sometimes shift positions slightly, so be mindful if you see the error but no obvious issue at the exact position mentioned. 5. **Validate and Fix the JSON**: Once you've located the problem area, you can modify the JSON to correct the formatting error, ensuring that it is valid. After fixing the issue, run it through a JSON validator to ensure there are no more formatting problems. If you still face difficulties after following these steps, you might want to provide a snippet of the JSON including a bit of context around the specified position (say, positions 200 to 240). Ensure that any sensitive data is redacted before sharing. I can then help you analyze that snippet of text."},{"instruction":"Well here is the JSON: { \\"AccountNumber\\": \\"3617843617841\\", \\"CustomerNumber\\": \\"3617841\\", \\"ValidAccount\\": true, \\"CustAcctNumber\\": \\"3617843617841\\", \\"CustomerName\\": \\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\", \\"PhoneNumber\\": \\"8132837275\\", \\"ServiceAddress\\": \\"1875 BARATARIA BLVD\\", \\"AccountStatus\\": \\"A\\", \\"DueDate\\": \\"2024-01-16T06:00:00\\", \\"CurrentBalance\\": \\"11.53\\", \\"CurrentArrears\\": \\".00\\", \\"ShutoffFlag\\": false, \\"AllowCredit\\": true, \\"AllowACH\\": true, \\"AllowExtension\\": true, \\"Paperless\\": \\"true\\", \\"AllowPaymentPlan\\": false, \\"PPDownPayment\\": \\".00\\", \\"PPPaymentAmount\\": \\".00\\", \\"PPPaymentNumber\\": \\"\\", \\"AllowDueDateExtension\\": \\"Y\\", \\"PastDueAmountMinor\\": 0, \\"FormattedArrears\\": \\"0.00\\", \\"ShutoffForNonPayment\\": \\"N\\", \\"AllowPaymentPlanMapped\\": \\"N\\", \\"Id\\": 1606619, \\"AutopaySettingsId\\": null, \\"IsArchived\\": false, \\"AccountSyncDate\\": \\"2024-01-10T13:10:07.1722273\\", \\"BlockedByAllPaymentTypes\\": false, \\"AccountLocked\\": false, \\"BusinessUnitId\\": 339, \\"SubAccountNumber\\": \\"\\", \\"Balance\\": 1153, \\"LateFee\\": 0, \\"Name\\": \\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\", \\"Description\\": null, \\"EmailAddress\\": \\"AirMR50280@engieinsight.com\\", \\"Address\\": { \\"StreetAddress\\": \\"1875 BARATARIA BLVD\\", \\"StreetAddress2\\": null, \\"City\\": null, \\"State\\": null, \\"ZipCode\\": null }, \\"IssueDate\\": null, \\"Note\\": null, \\"Meta\\": \\"{\\"AccountNumber\\":\\"361784\\",\\"CustomerNumber\\":\\"3617841\\",\\"ValidAccount\\":true,\\"CustAcctNumber\\":\\"3617843617841\\",\\"CustomerName\\":\\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\",\\"PhoneNumber\\":\\"8132837275\\",\\"ServiceAddress\\":\\"1875 BARATARIA BLVD\\",\\"AccountStatus\\":\\"A\\",\\"DueDate\\":\\"2024-01-16\\",\\"CurrentBalance\\":\\"11.53\\",\\"CurrentArrears\\":\\".00\\",\\"ShutoffFlag\\":false,\\"AllowCredit\\":true,\\"AllowACH\\":true,\\"AllowExtension\\":true,\\"Paperless\\":\\"true\\",\\"AllowPaymentPlan\\":false,\\"PPDownPayment\\":\\".00\\",\\"PPPaymentAmount\\":\\".00\\",\\"PPPaymentNumber\\":\\"\\",\\"AllowDueDateExtension\\":\\"Y\\",\\"PastDueAmountMinor\\":0,\\"FormattedArrears\\":\\"0.00\\",\\"ShutoffForNonPayment\\":\\"N\\",\\"AllowPaymentPlanMapped\\":\\"N\\"}\\", \\"CreateMethod\\": \\"Api\\", \\"AllowOnlinePayment\\": true, \\"BlockCreditCardPayment\\": false, \\"BlockAchPayment\\": false, \\"PaperlessBilling\\": true, \\"PaymentDescriptor\\": \\"3617843617841\\", \\"__LineItems\\": [ { \\"PaymentSession\\": null, \\"Account\\": null, \\"Product\\": null, \\"Id\\": 0, \\"PaymentSessionId\\": 0, \\"LineItemType\\": \\"AccountBalance\\", \\"Description\\": \\"Account Balance\\", \\"Price\\": { \\"Value\\": 1153, \\"Code\\": \\"USD\\" }, \\"AccountId\\": 1606619, \\"ProductId\\": null } ] }","output":"The JSON string you have provided appears to be properly formatted overall. However, the error you encountered mentioned an issue with 'paymentMetaJson', which does not seem to be a direct key in the JSON snippet you have shown. The closest key we have is \\"Meta\\". The \\"Meta\\" key has a value that is a JSON-encoded string. One thing that stands out is the double escaping of quotes in the value for \\"CustomerName\\" within the meta string: \`\`\`json \\"CustomerName\\":\\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\" \`\`\` This could cause an issue if the JSON within \\"Meta\\" is decoded and the resulting string is not escaped correctly when being parsed again. The character at position 218 is not explicitly identifiable without context to how the JSON is being read or processed by your application. Since JSON does not inherently have line and column numbers, the position 218 refers to the 218th character starting from the beginning of the JSON. The error might be happening when the \\"Meta\\" value is being processed. If we assume that the error message is referring to the decoded JSON from the \\"Meta\\" value, we would need to calculate the position manually by decoupling the JSON string within the \\"Meta\\" key and then analyze it separately. However, it is not clear whether the error is referring to the JSON object as a whole or just the \\"Meta\\" value. To further investigate, you could: 1. Extract the string value of \\"Meta\\" and parse it separately as JSON. 2. Validate the extracted JSON against a JSON linter or parser to see if there are any further errors. 3. Look for any character around the 218th position that could be considered 'unexpected.' Given that this is a static view, without the dynamic interpretation of the character positions by the Newtonsoft.Json library, direct pinpointing within this environment is challenging. If you can provide more context, such as the deserialization code or the schema expected by your deserializer, I may be able to offer more specific guidance."},{"instruction":"Well 'PaymentMetaJson' is simply the name of the Field. The JSON I just provided is the VALUE for that field. So what you are looking at IS the paymentMetaJson","output":"Ah, I understand now. The JSON snippet you have provided is the value of a field named 'paymentMetaJson'. Let's find the character at position 218 then. We can approach this manually using a text editor or writing a small piece of code. Since I can't execute code or run a text editor, I'll simulate the manual approach here. So, counting from the first character of the JSON string, we need to locate the 218th character: \`\`\`json { \\"AccountNumber\\": \\"3617843617841\\", \\"CustomerNumber\\": \\"3617841\\", \\"ValidAccount\\": true, ... (omitting the rest for brevity) \\"Name\\": \\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\", ... } \`\`\` After counting manually (which can be error-prone), if we're looking for the 218th character from this JSON snippet (not considering any white spaces or line breaks that might appear in the actual payload), it doesn't seem to fall within any area of concern, which suggests that the snippet provided might not be complete or accurate in the context of the error. Consider using a simple character count tool or writing a small script that would print out the first 220 characters or so from the JSON string. Here is an example in JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript const jsonString = '{...}'; // Your JSON string here console.log(jsonString.substring(0, 220)); \`\`\` This script will output the first 220 characters of your JSON string, so you can see what's around the 218th character. Remember, if your tool counts the line breaks as characters, the position might differ. The character causing the issue could be somewhere around the 218th character, but without the exact parsing logic and the exact JSON representation (including whitespace and encoding details), it's difficult to provide an accurate answer. To debug this further: - Copy the entire JSON value for 'paymentMetaJson' (exactly as it is when the error occurs) into a text editor or script that can count characters. - Find the 218th character in that string. - Examine that part of the JSON string for any unexpected or malformed characters. If you do find something unusual around that position or are unable to locate it manually, feel free to share the exact snippet around that position (taking care to replace sensitive information with placeholders), and I'll help you investigate further."},{"instruction":"The following isn't working: void Main() { const jsonString = ‘{ \\"AccountNumber\\": \\"3617843617841\\", \\"CustomerNumber\\": \\"3617841\\", \\"ValidAccount\\": true, \\"CustAcctNumber\\": \\"3617843617841\\", \\"CustomerName\\": \\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\", \\"PhoneNumber\\": \\"8132837275\\", \\"ServiceAddress\\": \\"1875 BARATARIA BLVD\\", \\"AccountStatus\\": \\"A\\", \\"DueDate\\": \\"2024-01-16T06:00:00\\", \\"CurrentBalance\\": \\"11.53\\", \\"CurrentArrears\\": \\".00\\", \\"ShutoffFlag\\": false, \\"AllowCredit\\": true, \\"AllowACH\\": true, \\"AllowExtension\\": true, \\"Paperless\\": \\"true\\", \\"AllowPaymentPlan\\": false, \\"PPDownPayment\\": \\".00\\", \\"PPPaymentAmount\\": \\".00\\", \\"PPPaymentNumber\\": \\"\\", \\"AllowDueDateExtension\\": \\"Y\\", \\"PastDueAmountMinor\\": 0, \\"FormattedArrears\\": \\"0.00\\", \\"ShutoffForNonPayment\\": \\"N\\", \\"AllowPaymentPlanMapped\\": \\"N\\", \\"Id\\": 1606619, \\"AutopaySettingsId\\": null, \\"IsArchived\\": false, \\"AccountSyncDate\\": \\"2024-01-10T13:10:07.1722273\\", \\"BlockedByAllPaymentTypes\\": false, \\"AccountLocked\\": false, \\"BusinessUnitId\\": 339, \\"SubAccountNumber\\": \\"\\", \\"Balance\\": 1153, \\"LateFee\\": 0, \\"Name\\": \\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\", \\"Description\\": null, \\"EmailAddress\\": \\"AirMR50280@engieinsight.com\\", \\"Address\\": { \\"StreetAddress\\": \\"1875 BARATARIA BLVD\\", \\"StreetAddress2\\": null, \\"City\\": null, \\"State\\": null, \\"ZipCode\\": null }, \\"IssueDate\\": null, \\"Note\\": null, \\"Meta\\": \\"{\\"AccountNumber\\":\\"361784\\",\\"CustomerNumber\\":\\"3617841\\",\\"ValidAccount\\":true,\\"CustAcctNumber\\":\\"3617843617841\\",\\"CustomerName\\":\\"RALLY\\"S HAMBURGER\\",\\"PhoneNumber\\":\\"8132837275\\",\\"ServiceAddress\\":\\"1875 BARATARIA BLVD\\",\\"AccountStatus\\":\\"A\\",\\"DueDate\\":\\"2024-01-16\\",\\"CurrentBalance\\":\\"11.53\\",\\"CurrentArrears\\":\\".00\\",\\"ShutoffFlag\\":false,\\"AllowCredit\\":true,\\"AllowACH\\":true,\\"AllowExtension\\":true,\\"Paperless\\":\\"true\\",\\"AllowPaymentPlan\\":false,\\"PPDownPayment\\":\\".00\\",\\"PPPaymentAmount\\":\\".00\\",\\"PPPaymentNumber\\":\\"\\",\\"AllowDueDateExtension\\":\\"Y\\",\\"PastDueAmountMinor\\":0,\\"FormattedArrears\\":\\"0.00\\",\\"ShutoffForNonPayment\\":\\"N\\",\\"AllowPaymentPlanMapped\\":\\"N\\"}\\", \\"CreateMethod\\": \\"Api\\", \\"AllowOnlinePayment\\": true, \\"BlockCreditCardPayment\\": false, \\"BlockAchPayment\\": false, \\"PaperlessBilling\\": true, \\"PaymentDescriptor\\": \\"3617843617841\\", \\"__LineItems\\": [ { \\"PaymentSession\\": null, \\"Account\\": null, \\"Product\\": null, \\"Id\\": 0, \\"PaymentSessionId\\": 0, \\"LineItemType\\": \\"AccountBalance\\", \\"Description\\": \\"Account Balance\\", \\"Price\\": { \\"Value\\": 1153, \\"Code\\": \\"USD\\" }, \\"AccountId\\": 1606619, \\"ProductId\\": null } ] }’; // Your JSON string here console.log(jsonString.substring(0, 220)) } // You can define other methods, fields, classes and namespaces here","output":"It looks like you're trying to run JavaScript code within a C# context (as indicated by the \`Main()\` method syntax).

Археолог по имени Питер, углубляясь в изучение подобных строений, мог бы наткнуться на широкий спектр открытий, каждое из которых рассказывало бы свою историю о жизни, культуре и возможностях древних народов. Допустим, Питер начинает исследование с одного из самых известных примеров подземных городов – комплекса Деринкую в Турции, который входит в сеть подземных комплексов Каппадокии и считается одним из самых больших. Эти города были вырыты в мягких вулканических породах и могут датироваться различными периодами, начиная с времён гиттитов и, возможно, троянцев, и до ранних христианских сообществ, которые использовали их для защиты от римского преследования. По мере продолжения своих исследований, Питер мог бы обнаружить: 1. Секретные пути и сети: Подземные города содержат лабиринты коридоров, комнат и хранилищ, которые могли служить эффективным средством для передвижения и скрытия больших групп людей. 2. Инженерные достижения: Для поддержания жизни в подземных условиях требовалась продвинутая система вентиляции, водоснабжения и канализации, что свидетельствует о высоких технологических знаниях строителей. 3. Религиозные и социальные структуры: Наличие церквей, школ и общественных пространств указывает на сложную социальную организацию и духовную жизнь населения подземных городов. 4. Сохранность артефактов: Благодаря своему расположению под землей, эти города могли лучше сохранить культурные артефакты, не подвергающиеся воздействию климатических условий или войн. 5. Взаимодействие с поверхностными поселениями: Отношения и взаимодействие между подземными и наземными сообществами могли иметь ключевое значение для выживания, включая торговлю и оборону. Если Питер найдёт доказательства совершенно новой, неизвестной науке технологии или инженерного решения, это может кардинально изменить наше понимание развития античных инженерных и технологических навыков. Такие открытия могут также привести к новым инновациям в современных технологиях, вдохновив инженеров и дизайнеров на создание более эффективных и устойчивых способов приспособления к жизни и защите в условиях ограниченного пространства или изменяющегося климата."},{"instruction":"Na série la casa de papel como foi feita a divisão do dinheiro que foi roubado da casa da moeda","output":"Em \\"La Casa de Papel\\", uma série de televisão espanhola criada por Álex Pina, um grupo de criminosos sob a liderança de um homem conhecido apenas como \\"O Professor\\" invade a Casa da Moeda Real da Espanha com um plano de imprimir e roubar 2,4 bilhões de euros. Ao longo das primeiras duas temporadas, o grupo passa 11 dias dentro da Casa da Moeda executando o plano, enquanto enfrenta vários obstáculos, incluindo a polícia, reféns e conflitos internos. Eles conseguem imprimir o dinheiro, mas a série não entra em detalhes extremos sobre como o dinheiro será dividido logo após o roubo. No entanto, é implícito que o plano é dividir o dinheiro igualmente entre os membros do grupo após a fuga bem-sucedida. Cada um dos ladrões recebe um codinome de uma cidade para ocultar suas verdadeiras identidades e criar uma sensação de igualdade e anonimato dentro do grupo. Isso sugere que O Professor tinha a intenção de que todos tivessem uma parcela equitativa do dinheiro roubado. Mais tarde, na série, vemos que alguns dos membros gastam o dinheiro de maneiras diferentes, com alguns escolhendo levar uma vida luxuosa e outros optando por ficar mais discretos. A série também explora as consequências desse roubo e as tentativas dos membros do grupo de manterem-se escondidos ou lidar com as autoridades que continuam a persegui-los. Vale ressaltar que o seriado cresceu de tal maneira que o roubo original da Casa da Moeda acabou por ser apenas uma parte de uma saga maior, com planos adicionais e outros roubos sendo realizados nas temporadas subsequentes. Em cada fase, as dinâmicas de grupo e a partilha de potenciais ganhos são geralmente tratadas de acordo com as diretrizes estabelecidas por O Professor, que enfatiza o trabalho em equipe e a partilha equitativa."},{"instruction":"Embora não seja explícito detalhado na série como foi feita a divisão de tal valor com base nas informações que você detém sobre a obra em questão especula hipoteticamente Como pode ter sido feito a divisão do valor","output":"Embora a série \\"La Casa de Papel\\" não forneça detalhes específicos sobre como os 2,4 bilhões de euros foram divididos entre os membros do grupo após o assalto bem-sucedido à Casa da Moeda Real da Espanha, podemos especular como poderia ter sido feita essa divisão de uma maneira que se alinhe com a filosofia de O Professor e a narrativa do show. Dado o grande foco em igualdade e lealdade dentro do grupo, é razoável supor que a divisão do dinheiro roubado foi planejada para ser igual entre os membros do assalto que sobreviveram até o final. Considerando que O Professor é extremamente minucioso e justo em seu planejamento, a divisão igualitária provavelmente seria o cenário mais provável. No entanto, para chegar a uma hipótese sobre como a divisão poderia ter acontecido, precisamos considerar quantos membros estavam presentes e participaram da divisão do dinheiro. Inicialmente, oito ladrões entram na Casa da Moeda sob as ordens de O Professor. Cativam também a atenção de Mónica Gaztambide (Estocolmo), que mais tarde se junta ao grupo, e outros que se juntam ou são incluídos de alguma forma ao longo das temporadas subsequentes da série. Se partirmos do pressuposto que a divisão iria acontecer igualmente entre os oito ladrões originais mais O Professor e Mónica (Estocolmo), teríamos um total de 10 pessoas a dividir os 2,4 bilhões de euros. Isso resultaria em 240 milhões de euros por pessoa se todos os membros originais (e Mónica) sobrevivessem e nenhuma outra parte fosse destinada a despesas adicionais ou contingências planejadas por O Professor. Além disso, poderiam ter sido consideradas questões logísticas ou planos de contingência que demandassem reservar uma parte do dinheiro para ajudar na fuga, criar novas identidades, apoiar familiares dos membros (caso algo desse errado), ou até mesmo como fundos para planos futuros (como vemos na série). No entanto, as coisas na série se complicam com mortes, sacrifícios e outros cenários imprevistos que ajustariam essa divisão hipotética. Ainda assim, qualquer especulação precisa levar em conta que a série deixa muitas questões em aberto e se concentra mais na dinâmica dos personagens e na execução dos planos do que na mecânica exata da partilha do dinheiro."},{"instruction":"Se eles já tinham roubado essa quantidade absurda de dinheiro qual era a necessidade de roubar o banco da Espanha e outra questão se a casa da moeda é onde fabrica o dinheiro porque o roubo ao banco da Espanha foi mais complexo","output":"O segundo roubo em \\"La Casa de Papel\\", que mira o Banco da Espanha, é motivado por razões diferentes do assalto inicial na Casa da Moeda. São essas motivações narrativas que levam o grupo a realizar um segundo e mais complexo roubo, mesmo após terem obtido uma grande quantia de dinheiro no primeiro. As principais razões para o roubo ao Banco da Espanha, conforme apresentadas na série, são: 1. **Resgate de um membro da equipe**: O roubo é arquitetado como uma resposta à captura de um dos membros da equipe original, Rio, pelas autoridades. O grupo pretende usar o roubo como uma medida de alavancagem para negociar a libertação de Rio. 2. **Desestabilização do sistema**: Além de resgatar Rio, o Professor quer enviar uma mensagem mais ampla ao sistema, desafiando o estado e as instituições financeiras que ele vê como corruptas e opressoras. 3. **Herança ideológica**: Tokio narra que Berlim (o irmão de O Professor) havia planejado o roubo ao Banco da Espanha antes de sua morte. O plano, então, se torna também uma forma de honrar a memória de Berlim, realizando um roubo que ele nunca teve a chance de concluir. Quanto à complexidade do roubo ao Banco da Espanha em comparação com o roubo à Casa da Moeda, há várias razões para isso: 1. **Segurança elevada**: O Banco da Espanha é mostrado como uma estrutura extremamente segura, com inúmeros sistemas de segurança avançados, o que naturalmente torna o roubo mais intricado. 2. **Objetivo diferente**: Ao invés de simplesmente imprimir dinheiro novo como na Casa da Moeda, o grupo está atrás do ouro armazenado no banco, um tipo de ativo muito mais difícil de manusear e transportar do que cédulas de papel. 3. **Condições desafiadoras**: O Banco da Espanha tem um sistema único de segurança que inclui inundações controladas para proteger suas reservas de ouro, algo que não foi um fator no roubo à Casa da Moeda. 4. **Pressão das autoridades**: Após o assalto à Casa da Moeda, as autoridades espanholas estão mais alertas e determinadas a capturar o grupo, colocando pressão adicional sobre o roubo ao Banco da Espanha. Portanto, a combinação de motivações pessoais e ideológicas, a complexidade aumentada tanto do objetivo quanto do alvo, e o ambiente de segurança elevada após o primeiro assalto fazem com que o roubo ao Banco da Espanha seja mais complexo e desafiante para os personagens da série."},{"instruction":"O que eu não entendi foi porque o sistema de segurança do banco da Espanha era superior ao da casa da moeda sendo que a casa da moeda disse fabrica o dinheiro então tecnicamente a casa de moeda deveria ser mais preciosa já que lá é onde se fabrica o dinheiro","output":"Essa é uma questão interessante que você levanta e a resposta gira em torno das diferentes funções e simbolismos que a Casa da Moeda e o Banco da Espanha representam, tanto na vida real quanto na ficção de \\"La Casa de Papel\\". Na vida real, a Casa da Moeda de um país é geralmente onde as moedas e notas são produzidas. É uma instalação de segurança crítica, claro, mas o foco geralmente está na produção eficiente e segura de moeda. Por outro lado, bancos centrais - como o Banco da Espanha - operam no nível mais alto das instituições financeiras de um país. Eles são responsáveis por várias funções macroeconômicas vitais, como a gestão das reservas de ouro do país, a implementação da política monetária e o controle da inflação. Bancos centrais também frequentemente armazenam grandes quantidades de ouro e outros ativos de valor extremamente alto, servindo como a \\"última linha de defesa\\" do sistema financeiro do país. O ouro armazenado nos bancos centrais é um ativo líquido muito importante que pode ser usado em tempos de crise e tem um valor de mercado muito alto. No contexto de \\"La Casa de Papel\\", pode-se argumentar que o Banco da Espanha é retratado como tendo um sistema de segurança superior devido à importância simbólica e prática desses ativos. O ouro armazenado na instituição é um ativo fisicamente tangível e de alto valor; ao contrário do dinheiro que ainda não entrou em circulação, esse ouro tem peso real no mercado financeiro global. Portanto, mesmo que a Casa da Moeda seja uma instalação valiosa e segura, o Banco da Espanha é apresentado na série como um alvo ainda mais desafiador devido aos seus ativos físicos valiosos e às suas proteções altamente sofisticadas, como o sistema de inundações e uma câmara do cofre que é praticamente impenetrável. Na narrativa da série, isso estabelece um cenário dramático e eleva as apostas, proporcionando ainda mais tensão e desafio para os personagens."},{"instruction":"Poderia ser mais simples a sua resposta anterior e também responder a questão de qual foi o plano do professor no final para que o coronel tamayo libertar sem o grupo e ainda desse uma nova identidade para eles e um passaporte","output":"Certamente, vou simplificar a resposta. Na série \\"La Casa de Papel\\", o Banco da Espanha é retratado como tendo um sistema de segurança mais avançado do que a Casa da Moeda, porque, além do dinheiro, ele armazena ouro, que é um recurso valioso e importante para a economia do país. Ouro tem um valor alto e estável no mercado, e é frequentemente usado pelo governo em tempos de crise. Isso justifica uma segurança maior no Banco da Espanha na narrativa da série. Quanto ao plano final do Professor para garantir a libertação do grupo, ele envolve uma série de manobras estratégicas e enganos. No fim da série, o Professor expõe o verdadeiro plano do coronel Tamayo e do governo espanhol, que era manter todo o ouro roubado e acusar a gangue de tê-lo derretido e destruído. No entanto, o Professor revela ter trocado o ouro por latão e mantém o ouro real escondido. Essa exposição ameaça destruir a carreira do coronel Tamayo e revelar a corrupção dentro do governo, o que torna a situação politicamente sensível. Para evitar grandes escândalos, Tamayo e o Professor chegam a um acordo: ele libertaria os membros detidos do grupo e lhes concederia novas identidades e passaportes em troca do ouro e da promessa de manter o segredo em sigilo. Dessa forma, o Professor consegue virar o jogo a seu favor, salvando os membros de seu grupo e assegurando sua liberdade com novas identidades, ao mesmo tempo protegendo o ouro que tinham roubado."},{"instruction":"E qual é a lição que o professor tenta passar com isso tem um determinado ponto no qual ele diz que a riqueza é psicológica eu não entendi muito bem","output":"No contexto de \\"La Casa de Papel\\", o Professor é um personagem que, além de ser o cérebro por trás dos roubos, também tem uma filosofia própria sobre a vida e a sociedade. Quando ele se refere à riqueza como algo psicológico, é uma maneira de expressar que o valor e a importância do dinheiro vão além do seu uso material. Essa afirmação pode ser interpretada das seguintes maneiras: 1. **Percepção de Valor**: O Professor sugere que a riqueza não é apenas sobre ter dinheiro ou ouro físico, mas também sobre como as pessoas percebem e valorizam esses ativos. A crença no valor do dinheiro é o que dá poder a ele na sociedade. 2. **Felicidade e Satisfação**: Ele está dizendo que a verdadeira riqueza não é acumular posses, mas viver uma vida plena e feliz. Para algumas pessoas, a \\"riqueza\\" real pode ser a liberdade, o amor ou as relações pessoais, em vez de bens materiais. 3. **Comentário Social**: Ao caracterizar a riqueza como psicológica, o Professor está desafiando a ideia de que a riqueza e o status material são os principais indicadores de sucesso na vida. Isso também critica como o sistema econômico atual valoriza e distribui recursos. 4. **Poder da Perspectiva**: Mostra como a atitude e a mentalidade das pessoas em relação ao dinheiro e à riqueza podem ser poderosas e transformadoras, influenciando seu comportamento e decisões. Na série, o Professor é frequentemente visto desafiando as convenções sociais e questionando a ética das instituições financeiras que controlam a economia. Ele usa o roubo não apenas para enriquecer, mas também para fazer uma declaração contra um sistema que ele considera injusto. Portanto, a ideia de que \\"a riqueza é psicológica\\" está alinhada com a visão mais ampla do Professor sobre o dinheiro, poder e a sociedade em geral."},{"instruction":"O plano do roubou a casa da moeda da Espanha foi totalmente planejado pelo professor ou foi pelo pai dele ele pegou o plano e executou ou ele pegou a ideia do pai dele e formulou um plano detalhado e complexo","output":"Na série \\"La Casa de Papel\\", a ideia original do roubo à Casa da Moeda da Espanha, bem como o plano em si, são creditados ao personagem conhecido como \\"O Professor\\". No entanto, a narrativa também introduz a influência do pai do Professor na concepção do plano. O pai do Professor tinha ideais semelhantes e planejava realizar um grande roubo, e essa influência é uma parte vital da motivação do Professor. O plano do roubo à Casa da Moeda não é apenas para obter uma grande quantia de dinheiro, mas também para cumprir uma espécie de legado familiar. O Professor idealizou um roubo que seria uma obra-prima criminosa, sem violência e enorme em escala, como uma forma de honrar a memória de seu pai e suas crenças. A série sugere que o Professor utilizou os conceitos iniciais ou inspiração do pai e os aprimorou com os próprios conhecimentos e competências, desenvolvendo assim um plano detalhado e extremamente complexo que é executado ao longo das primeiras temporadas de \\"La Casa de Papel\\". Portanto, é uma combinação de inspiração de seu pai e o próprio gênio do Professor que leva ao plano final que vemos na série."},{"instruction":"E como que o professor conseguiu desenvolver como ele imaginou todas as possibilidades como ele sabia também falar outros idiomas como foi visto em outras temporadas ou atrás táticas técnicas que ele mostrou","output":"O Professor, cujo nome verdadeiro é Sergio Marquina, é retratado em \\"La Casa de Papel\\" como um personagem de inteligência excepcional e meticulosa atenção aos detalhes. Ele é o mestre estrategista por trás dos planos de roubo, e sua capacidade de antecipar cenários, assim como sua ampla gama de conhecimentos e habilidades, são aspectos-chave do seu personagem. A série não entra em detalhes específicos sobre como ele adquiriu todos os seus conhecimentos e habilidades, mas aqui estão algumas possibilidades gerais que poderiam explicar sua proficiência em idiomas, táticas e estratégias: 1. **Educação e Estudo Autodidata**: O Professor pode ter tido uma educação formal avançada ou ser autodidata em muitas áreas. É provável que ele tenha dedicado uma quantidade significativa de tempo ao estudo sistemático de idiomas, estratégias de roubo, e psicologia humana, entre outras disciplinas. 2. **Planejamento e Preparação**: No canon da série, o Professor dedicou anos ao planejamento do roubo à Casa da Moeda. Durante esse tempo, ele teria tido a oportunidade de realizar pesquisas extensivas e se preparar para inúmeras contingências. 3. **Experiências Passadas**: Algumas de suas habilidades podem ser resultado de experiências pessoais anteriores. Embora a série não revele muito sobre seu passado, é possível que ele tenha ganhado experiência prática em áreas relevantes antes de implementar o plano de assalto. 4. **Influência Familiar**: A morte prematura de seu pai pode ter sido um fator que impulsionou o Professor a se tornar altamente qualificado em várias áreas, inclusive em idiomas, como parte de seu desejo de honrar a memória e os ideais do pai. 5. **Habilidades Sociais e Inteligência Emocional**: O Professor também demonstra uma compreensão aguçada das emoções e motivações humanas, habilidades que são cruciais para gerenciar uma equipe de criminosos e manipular situações a seu favor. A série mostra que o Professor é alguém que antecipa problemas e tem planos alternativos prontos para qualquer situação imprevista, o que é uma característica comum de personagens \\"gênios do crime\\" em filmes e séries. A habilidade de O Professor para falar vários idiomas e executar táticas complexas apenas realça a narrativa de que ele é um personagem extremamente bem preparado e capaz."},{"instruction":"Poderia reformular sua resposta anterior por gentileza","output":"Claro, posso simplificar a explicação. O Professor é o cérebro por trás dos roubos em \\"La Casa de Papel\\", e ele é mostrado como alguém muito inteligente e bem preparado. A série não explica detalhadamente toda a sua formação, mas aqui estão algumas ideias de como ele pode ter desenvolvido suas habilidades: - **Estudo e Educação**: O Professor provavelmente estudou muito por conta própria. Ele parece ter um conhecimento profundo de várias matérias, incluindo idiomas e estratégias criminais. - **Anos de Preparação**: Ele passou anos planejando o assalto à Casa da Moeda, o que lhe deu tempo para pensar em cada detalhe e se preparar para diferentes cenários. - **Experiência de Vida**: Suas habilidades também podem vir de experiências que ele teve antes da série começar, embora isso não seja muito explorado na trama. - **Influência do Pai**: Seu pai tinha ideias semelhantes sobre realizar um grande roubo, e isso pode ter motivado o Professor a aprender tudo o que precisava para executar um plano tão complexo. - **Entendimento das Pessoas**: O Professor mostra ser bom em entender e manipular as emoções das pessoas, o que é essencial para liderar uma equipe de criminosos e lidar com reféns. Em resumo, o Professor é apresentado como um personagem muito inteligente que dedicou uma grande parte de sua vida a se preparar para o roubo à Casa da Moeda, o que inclui aprender idiomas e desenvolver estratégias complexas."},{"instruction":"Qual é a trama da série: como defender um assassino","output":"\\"Como Defender um Assassino\\" (em inglês, \\"How to Get Away with Murder\\") é uma série de televisão americana de drama legal criada por Peter Nowalk e produzida por Shonda Rhimes. A série foi transmitida pela ABC de 2014 a 2020 e segue a história de Annalise Keating, interpretada por Viola Davis, uma professora de direito criminal e advogada de defesa brilhante e carismática. A trama se desenvolve em torno de Annalise e um grupo de seus alunos mais brilhantes na fictícia Universidade de Middleton. A série começa com Annalise selecionando cinco alunos para trabalhar em seu escritório de advocacia: Wes Gibbins, Connor Walsh, Michaela Pratt, Asher Millstone e Laurel Castillo. Esses alunos se tornam conhecidos como os \\"Keating Five\\". A série é conhecida por sua estrutura narrativa não linear, alternando entre flashforwards e flashbacks que gradualmente revelam como os personagens se envolvem em um emaranhado de assassinatos, segredos e mentiras.

What do you think your organization/company should do with respect to sustainability?","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not belong to a specific company or organization beyond the one that created me. Therefore, I don't have personal knowledge or responsibilities, nor do I directly participate in any organization's sustainability efforts. However, speaking hypotetically, if I were part of an organization, there are several actions it could take with respect to sustainability: 1. **Reducing Carbon Footprint**: Organizations can work to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy sources, and optimizing logistics and supply chains to lower emissions. 2. **Sustainable Sourcing**: Companies can procure materials and products from sustainable sources, ensuring that their supply chains do not contribute to environmental degradation. 3. **Waste Reduction**: Implementing initiatives to minimize waste production, recycle materials, and opt for circular economy principles can significantly impact sustainability. 4. **Water Conservation**: Managing water usage and ensuring that wastewater is treated before being released into the environment is crucial for preserving freshwater resources. 5. **Employee Education**: Educating employees about sustainable practices both in and out of the workplace can amplify the impact an organization has on environmental conservation. 6. **Investment in Research and Development**: Investing in R&D to develop new and more efficient processes, materials, and products that are less harmful to the environment. 7. **Environmentally Friendly Products and Services**: Designing and offering products and services that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their lifecycle. 8. **Policy Advocacy**: Engaging in policy advocacy to support legislation that promotes environmental sustainability and protection. 9. **Transparency and Reporting**: Regular sustainability reporting can increase transparency, showcasing the organization's efforts and encouraging accountability. If I could advise on what I think an organization should do with respect to sustainability, the key would be to conduct a thorough sustainability assessment to understand its environmental impact, and then develop a strategic plan to address those areas with the most significant effect. Sustainability should be integrated into the company's core strategy and not seen as a separate or secondary initiative. Innovation, continuous improvement, and collaboration with stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and the local community, are also essential components of a comprehensive sustainability strategy."},{"instruction":"As you know, every business has its target audience Please tell me 50 things about the target audience","output":"Certainly!

Write the most efficient code","output":"To find all integers from 0 to 999 that are not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, we can use a straightforward brute force approach by evaluating each number for divisibility and counting those that aren't divisible by any of these numbers. However, to make the code more efficient, we can skip even numbers entirely (since they are all divisible by 2) and start the counting at 1, then increment by 2 to cover only odd numbers. Here's a Python program that computes the count: \`\`\`python def is_indivisible_by_2_3_5_7(n): return n % 2 != 0 and n % 3 != 0 and n % 5 != 0 and n % 7 != 0 def count_indivisible_numbers(limit): count = 0 for i in range(1, limit, 2): # Start from 1 and step by 2 to skip even numbers if is_indivisible_by_2_3_5_7(i): count += 1 return count # Count the numbers not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 from 0 to 999 count = count_indivisible_numbers(1000) print('Count of numbers not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7:', count) \`\`\` To further optimize this code, one could argue we could use a sieve-like approach to mark multiples of 2, 3, 5, and 7. But since the range is quite limited, the benefit from such an approach might not be significant, and the implementation could be more complex. In the program above, we have a helper function \`is_indivisible_by_2_3_5_7\` that checks if a number is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. It is used within the main function \`count_indivisible_numbers\` which takes a limit as the argument and returns the count of such numbers below that limit, stepping only over odd numbers for efficiency's sake.

CRT asserts that racism is engrained in the fabric of society and its institutions, including the media. It suggests that the media often perpetuates racial stereotypes and biases, which can influence public discourse and perceptions about Black victims of crime or injustice. When applying the CRT framework to media portrayals of non-ideal Black victims, it becomes apparent that such portrayals are not simply a matter of individual bias but rather a manifestation of systemic racism. Non-ideal victims are often depicted in ways that de-emphasize their victimhood and highlight characteristics or behaviors that deviate from societal norms or expectations of \\"respectability.\\" In the case of Black non-ideal victims, the media may focus on their criminal records, portray them as aggressive or threatening, or attribute their victimization to personal failings rather than systemic issues. These narratives serve to justify or diminish the gravity of the violence and discrimination faced by Black individuals. By emphasizing their perceived flaws, the media effectively reduces the empathy typically extended towards victims and undermines the seriousness of their plight. Such portrayals can also shift the responsibility for their victimization from the perpetrators and societal structures to the individuals themselves, reinforcing the notion of \\"blaming the victim.\\" Moreover, when media coverage employs racially coded language or imagery, it perpetuates and reinforces existing racial biases within the audience. These coded messages subliminally communicate that Black victims are less worthy of sympathy or protection, and consequently, their experiences are trivialized or ignored. This can have profound effects on the public's willingness to support policy changes or social movements aimed at addressing racial disparities in the justice system or society at large. Furthermore, the impact of these biased portrayals is not limited to societal attitudes but has real-world consequences. Black victims may receive less attention from law enforcement, fewer resources for investigation, and less media coverage than their White counterparts, all of which can affect the pursuit of justice. Additionally, the perpetuation of racial stereotypes can exacerbate fear and distrust between Black communities and law enforcement, further contributing to tensions and systemic inequalities. CRT also posits that the media is part of a larger system of power relations that reinforces and maintains racial hierarchies. By presenting Black victims as non-ideal, the media can implicitly justify institutional policies and practices that are discriminatory, such as racial profiling, excessive policing, or harsher sentencing for Black individuals. This perpetuates a cycle of victimization and marginalization, where Black individuals are both more likely to become victims of systemic injustice and less likely to be seen as deserving victims. To counteract these harmful patterns, the CRT approach calls for a critical examination of the structures and practices that contribute to biased media portrayals. This includes recognizing the ways in which media ownership, cultural narratives, and market incentives might influence content. Advocating for more diverse voices in media production and demanding accurate and nuanced portrayals of Black victims are also integral to this process. Additionally, CRT encourages individuals and communities to challenge dominant media narratives and create alternative platforms to express their experiences and perspectives. By fostering an environment that values diverse stories and rejects racial bias in media representations, there is potential for a more equitable and empathetic public discourse surrounding Black victims. In conclusion, understanding the powerful role that media plays through a CRT lens reveals the systemic nature of racially biased portrayals of non-ideal Black victims. It challenges us to critically engage with media content and to address the systemic issues that allow such portrayals to persist. Recognizing and combating these biases is crucial in the quest for a more just and equitable society, where the stories of all victims are treated with the dignity and seriousness they deserve."},{"instruction":"媒体报道对非理想受害者的影响，当非理想受害者是黑人时。写一个1000字的主体段。根据理想的受害者：批判种族理论","output":"Critical Race Theory (CRT) offers a framework for analyzing the media's influence on the perception of non-ideal victims, particularly when those victims are Black. Within CRT, the idea of the \\"ideal victim\\" is contrasted against the lived realities of marginalized groups who often face a presumption of guilt, negative typification, or unwarranted suspicion. When the media report on Black non-ideal victims, these reports are frequently laced with inherent biases that negatively shape public perception, policy, and justice. Media portrayals that emphasize non-ideal characteristics of Black victims often draw from and reinforce a deep historical reservoir of racial stereotypes. These stereotypes paint Black individuals as inherently criminal, deviant, or less innocent compared to their White counterparts. In cases where a Black person is the victim of violence or injustice, the media might scrutinize the victim's past actions, lifestyle choices, or even attire, diverting focus from the victimization they suffered. These narrative choices delegitimize the victim's experience and diminish public outrage at their ordeal, thereby undervaluing Black suffering. By portraying Black victims as non-ideal, the media contribute to a culture of blame that impedes social empathy and undermines movements for racial justice. For example, if a Black person is shot by law enforcement, coverage might highlight the victim's legal record or imply belligerence, feeding into a public discourse that absolves institutional aggression and rationalizes state violence. Media reproductions of such narratives are not benign; they are active components in the cycle of racial injustice, obstructing societal recognition of systemic contributors to race-based violence and discrimination. Through the CRT lens, we understand that the media's engagement in the creation and sustainment of non-ideal victim imagery is not only about individual acts of racism but also about structural conditions that maintain racial hierarchies. The persistent representation of Black victims as non-ideal undermines calls for legal and social reforms by signaling to policymakers and the public that the issues at play are isolated incidents tied to individual failing, rather than systemic problems demanding collective action. Using CRT, one can argue that the prejudiced portrayals of non-ideal Black victims are functional in maintaining the status quo, where racial inequality is normalized. By depicting Black victims unfavorably, the media inadvertently justify avoidance and inaction on societal reforms aimed at dismantling structural barriers that disadvantage Black people. This phenomenon can conversely reinforce the \\"white innocence\\" narrative, where White individuals are able to maintain a façade of neutrality and non-complicity in racist systems. The reinforcement of racial bias by the media can also have a chilling effect on the Black community, creating an environment of mistrust, fear, and reticence to engage with legal institutions. Such an environment inhibits the reporting of crimes, the pursuit of justice, and the possibility of healing and restoration for Black victims. In a broader sense, the media's reinforcement of these stereotypes contributes to the social alienation of Black people and the perpetuation of a racial caste system that restricts economic, political, and social mobility, consolidating disadvantages and vulnerabilities. Moreover, the impact of these portrayals is far from abstract: they resonate in the lived experiences of Black individuals who navigate a world where their victimhood is undervalued. The cascade of these depictions contributes to systematic disempowerment, from inadequate responses by criminal justice systems to differential treatment in media coverage that influences which cases are brought to public attention and deemed worthy of collective mourning, action, and remembrance. In summary, through the lens of Critical Race Theory, we see that media representations of Black non-ideal victims deeply influence public perceptions and exacerbate the societal ill of racism. These depictions, far from being neutral, are implicated in a larger system of racial oppression that conditions the populace to devalue Black suffering and deny the systemic nature of racial injustice. For this reason, it is imperative to challenge and transform the narratives that circulate in media spaces, advancing a more just and equitable vision of Black victimhood—one that reflects the full humanity of Black individuals and the context of racialized structures within which they live."},{"instruction":"媒体报道对非理想受害者的影响，当非理想受害者是黑人时。写一个1000字的主体段。根据Yarrow S (2005)年轻黑人作为犯罪受害者的经历。伦敦：刑事司法股和受害者与信心股。用中文","output":"很抱歉，我无法查阅 Yarrow S (2005)《年轻黑人作为犯罪受害者的经历》一书的具体内容因为我的数据库无法访问书籍或是专门的研究报告。但我可以根据你提供的背景信息以及媒体报道对非理想受害者影响的相关讨论，尤其是黑人年轻人在遭遇犯罪后的情况，给出一个基于这种情景的主体段。 媒体对非理想受害者，特别是黑人年轻人的报道，往往呈现出一种模式化的偏差。在这类报道中，受害者的形象常常被潜意识地降级，他们所受到的伤害和不正义被有意或无意地边缘化。比如，在报道中，黑人年轻受害者可能被描绘为自身生活方式或选择导致了犯罪的发生，而非被视为犯罪的无辜受害者。这种报道模式不仅贬低了受害者，还扭曲了公众对于犯罪本质的理解和对于犯罪后果的感知。 事实上，这种媒体的偏见性报道背后反映了对非理想受害者，尤其是黑人年轻人受害经历的深层次误解和忽视。它们反映了媒体在种族歧视问题上的不自觉，以及它们在塑造公众对于犯罪受害者印象时的局限性。媒体的这种实践加深了对年轻黑人不公正的社会观念和种族歧视的刻板印象，这些观念和印象又反过来影响了法律执行、政策制定以及社会服务上的提供。 黑人年轻人在成为犯罪受害者后，需要的不仅仅是警察和刑事司法系统的响应，还包括社会对他们的经历的认可和支持。然而，当媒体报道通过各种方式无形中剥夺了他们作为受害者的合法性，他们便失去了从社会获得同情和援助的机会。这种情况在一定程度上削弱了整个社会对于犯罪受害者必需的援助和保护工作，从而让年轻黑人受害者更加容易遭受二次伤害。 更进一步地，偏见性的报道还可能导致公共资源的不公正分配。例如，因为公众对黑人受害者的关注不足，可能会造成资源更多地流向其他被视为\\"理想\\"的受害群体，而忽视了对黑人年轻受害者的支持和援助。这种资源分配的不平等也是制度性歧视的一种体现，它体现在对受害者身份的认同与否以及对受害者经历的重视程度上。 因此，媒体在塑造和传播非理想受害者，尤其是黑人年轻受害者形象时，不仅仅要考虑报道的事实性和客观性，还要考虑到其深远的社会影响。需要通过提升种族意识和加强媒体责任感来改变现状，为实现一个更加公正和包容的社会而努力。对年轻黑人受害者的报道应该更多地关注他们的人性、尊严和需要，而非贴上带有歧视性的标签并将他们边缘化。只有这样，媒体才能对反映社会上存在的不公和不平等问题起到积极的作用，促进正义和改变的实现。"},{"instruction":"媒体报道对非理想受害者的影响，当非理想受害者是黑人时。写一个1000字的主体段。根据重新审视“理想受害者”","output":"在探讨媒体对非理想受害者的影响时，关键在于认识到媒体对公众观念塑造的潜在能量和沟通的复杂性。当非理想受害者是黑人时，这样的影响尤显突出。理想受害者的概念，在传统上是指那些容易引起公众同情，被普遍接受和理解的受害者形象。而非理想受害者，往往因为身份、种族、行为或其他因素，不容易获得同等的同情或关注。这种差别性的对待在媒体报道时表现得尤为明显，特别是对于黑人受害者来说。 媒体中有关黑人非理想受害者的负面形象常常是根深蒂固的种族偏见和社会刻板印象的产物。在这样的报道中，黑人受害者可能被描绘为有犯罪前科、具有侵略性或其他负面品质的人，这些刻画方式通常是基于无根据的假设和社会习得的偏见。即便在遭受不公或受害时，他们的身份也难以被完全接受为一个纯粹的\\"受害者\\"。 非理想受害者的塑造和演绎，在媒体的处理下，导致了怀疑、不信任以及缺乏共情。这种报道趋势产生了几个层面的后果：在个体层面，黑人受害者可能感到自己的遭遇被世界所忽视，他们的痛苦和遭受的不正义没有得到应有的承认；在社会层面，这种报道助长了对黑人社区的负面看法，加剧了种族隔离和不信任；在制度层面，歧视性的叙述可能日渐成型，变得难以察觉，影响法律政策和执法实践，导致对黑人受害者权利的系统性忽视。 重新审视“理想受害者”的叙述要求公众及新闻行业本身提高警觉，面对种族偏见的报道模式采取批判态度。这样的工作并不容易，它涉及对决策过程、责任心、报道内容、语言选择及影像展现等方面的深刻检视与改进。媒体有责任挑战既有偏见，客观报道每一位受害者的实际情况，而不是通过某种有色眼镜去过滤信息。意识的提升和行动的改变必须植根于制度层面，以保障媒体传递的信息能够促进社会的公正与理解。 对于黑人非理想受害者而言，转变媒体和公众的态度同样需要教育和肯定多样性的努力。在多元文化的社会中，媒体需加强对不平等、排外和歧视根源的解构。增加黑人记者和编辑在新闻室的代表性，促进敏感和全面的新闻报道，以及增加黑人社区内部故事的传播；所有这些都是十分重要的措施。 此外，公众接受信息的过程并非被动单向，而是可以通过社区组织、社交媒体等平台促成对话和变革。通过传播自己的故事和挑战官方叙述，黑人社区可以自我赋权，也能对媒体施加压力，要求它们更公正、全面地表达真实情况。 综上所述，在新闻报道中重新审视“理想受害者”这个概念是个不断进行的过程。我们必须承认媒体对非理想受害者的影响是多维度的，尤其是当这些受害者是黑人时。通过批判性的自我反思以及系统性的改进，媒体可以逐步克服先入为主的刻板印象，更平衡和真实地呈现黑人—特别是年轻黑人—作为犯罪受害者的经历。这不仅是新闻行业的责任，也是整个社会推动种族正义的一部分。"},{"instruction":"媒体报道对非理想受害者的影响，当非理想受害者是黑人时。写一个1000字的主体段。根据种族主义和媒体","output":"在讨论媒体报道对非理想受害者的影响时，特别是当这些受害者是黑人的情况下，我们不可避免地被带到种族主义和媒体之间复杂而又紧密的关联中去。种族主义在媒体的历史中扎根深厚，从早期的负面刻画到现今持续存在的微妙叙事偏差，它塑造了公众对于非理想受害者的认知和反应。理解这一点至关重要，因为媒体拥有广泛而强大的影响力，能够塑造社会议程、影响法律制度，并制造或消解公共同情。 在多个维度上，非理想受害者特别是黑人受害者在媒体报道中遭受不公。首先是可见性的问题。媒体在选择报道哪些案件时，往往存在着种族偏见。黑人受害者的案件可能被忽略或被赋予较少的报道空间，而那些符合理想受害者形象的案件则获得更加集中和深入的关注。这种选择性报导，无疑加大了黑人社区的不可见性，让人们容易忽视他们所面临的问题。 其次是语境的缺失。媒体在报导黑人受害者时，往往无视社会结构性因素的作用，比如贫困、不平等的司法系统、教育机会的缺乏，以及长久以来对黑人的系统性歧视。通过这种脱离语境的报道，公众容易得出结论认为犯罪和暴力是黑人社区内在的问题，而不是系统性种族主义的直接后果。 第三个维度涉及媒体在叙述上的角色定位。在强调黑人受害者的非理想特征时，譬如他们的历史、贫穷状态或所谓的“不良”行为，媒体不仅加剧了对他们个体的负面刻板印象，还间接地为他们的受害寻找借口。这样的报道风格无疑会减少公众对受害者的同情心，实际上是在辩解甚至忽略了针对他们的不公行为。 种族主义的媒体叙事还会影响法律和政策的制定。通过重现特定的种族主义刻板印象，媒体可能无意中支持了对黑人社区的刑事化以及对这些社区过度警戒和惩罚的政策。例如，将黑人少年描述为“成年人”，不仅是对他们的个人特质的误解，也是对他们所面临的不公正社会条件的忽视。这导致当权者更多地采取针对性的执法行动而不是寻找解决问题的根本方法。 除此之外，对非理想黑人受害者的错误报道不仅会影响立法者和决策者，还会对个人生活产生影响，加剧社会分裂，并引发族裔团体之间的紧张关系。当媒体持续传递出种族主义的信息时，它们实际上在推动一种将黑人社区归类为\\"他者\\"的叙事，这种叙事分化了社区，破坏了团结和共同体的感觉。 应对媒体中的种族主义叙事需要一系列的策略和努力。这其中包括通过教育、训练提高媒体工作者关于种族偏见问题的自觉性，推动更多的多元和包容性的媒体实践，以及倡导更广泛的公民参与和多元的声音表达。同时也需要监督媒体，确保它们在报道黑人受害者时公正且有同情心，以及提高社会对黑人受害经历的认知和理解。 综上所述，种族主义和媒体之间的关系对黑人非理想受害者包括其社区所造成的影响是深刻且广泛的。为了真正打破这种模式，不仅媒体自身要变革，社会大众的认识方式和政策制定者的行动也需要改变。通过这些集体努力，我们可以期待在公正和真实的报道中，非理想受害者的经历得到恰当的表达，为建设一个不再由种族主义定义受害者身份的世界奠定基础。"},{"instruction":"Explain order to cash cycle step by step from receiving query form the customer. also add flow cycle.","output":"The Order to Cash (O2C) cycle refers to the entire process involved in receiving and fulfilling a customer's order, right from the initial query to the final payment collection. It involves multiple steps and departments within a company. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the Order to Cash cycle, along with the flow cycle: 1. Receiving the customer query: The cycle begins when a customer sends a query or request for information about a product or service. 2. Creating a quotation: Once the query is received, the sales team prepares a quotation, which includes details like product description, quantity, price, and delivery terms. 3. Obtaining customer purchase order: If the customer agrees to the quotation, they generate a purchase order (PO) indicating their intent to purchase the specified products or services at the agreed-upon terms. 4. Order entry: The sales team receives the customer's PO and enters it into the company's order management system. This step captures all the necessary details like customer information, product details, pricing, and payment terms. 5. Order fulfillment: After the order entry, the relevant departments, such as procurement, production, or warehouse, start the process of fulfilling the order. They source the necessary materials, manufacture the products (if required), and prepare them for shipment or delivery. 6. Shipping and logistics: Once the products are ready, the shipping team organizes the logistics, selects the appropriate carrier, and ensures the timely and accurate delivery of the products to the customer. 7. Invoice generation: After the products are shipped, the finance department generates an invoice detailing the products delivered, their quantities, prices, taxes, shipping charges, and any applicable discounts. The invoice is sent to the customer. 8. Customer payment: Upon receiving the invoice, the customer is expected to make the payment within the agreed-upon payment terms. This could be through various means such as bank transfer, credit card, or check. 9. Payment allocation and reconciliation: Once the payment is received, the finance team allocates the payment to the respective customer account and reconciles it with the corresponding invoice. 10. Collections and dispute management: If there are any payment delays or discrepancies, the finance team follows up with the customer for collections and resolves any disputes through communication, negotiation, or raising credit memos if required. 11. Financial close: Finally, the O2C cycle concludes with the financial close, which includes reporting, financial statement preparation, and ensuring all transactions related to the order are accurately recorded in the company's financial records.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"how much pages is 128k tokens?","output":"To determine how many pages 128,000 tokens would equate to, we need to make some assumptions because the number of tokens per page can vary depending on factors such as formatting, font size, and page size. Generally, in the publishing industry, an average page of a novel contains about 250 to 300 words. If we consider a 'token' as roughly equivalent to a word or a punctuation mark, we can use that as a basis for estimation. Let's do the math with both the low and high estimates: - At 250 tokens (words) per page: 128,000 tokens / 250 tokens per page = 512 pages - At 300 tokens (words) per page: 128,000 tokens / 300 tokens per page = 426.67 pages, which would be rounded up to 427 pages. So, depending on the number of words considered to be an average page, 128,000 tokens could be approximately 427 to 512 pages long.

Process Modeling 4.1. Introduction to Process Modeling 4.1.4. What are some of the different statistical methods for model building? 4.1.4.1. Linear Least Squares Regression Modeling Workhorse Linear least squares regression is by far the most widely used modeling method. It is what most people mean when they say they have used \\"regression\\", \\"linear regression\\" or \\"least squares\\" to fit a model to their data. Not only is linear least squares regression the most widely used modeling method, but it has been adapted to a broad range of situations that are outside its direct scope. It plays a strong underlying role in many other modeling methods, including the other methods discussed in this section: nonlinear least squares regression, weighted least squares regression and LOESS. Definition of a Linear Least Squares Model Used directly, with an appropriate data set, linear least squares regression can be used to fit the data with any function of the form in which 1. each explanatory variable in the function is multiplied by an unknown parameter, 2. there is at most one unknown parameter with no corresponding explanatory variable, and 3. all of the individual terms are summed to produce the final function value. In statistical terms, any function that meets these criteria would be called a \\"linear function\\". The term \\"linear\\" is used, even though the function may not be a straight line, because if the unknown parameters are considered to be variables and the explanatory variables are considered to be known coefficients corresponding to those \\"variables\\", then the problem becomes a system (usually overdetermined) of linear equations that can be solved for the values of the unknown parameters. To differentiate the various meanings of the word \\"linear\\", the linear models being discussed here are often said to be \\"linear in the parameters\\" or \\"statistically linear\\". Why \\"Least Squares\\"? Linear least squares regression also gets its name from the way the estimates of the unknown parameters are computed. The \\"method of least squares\\" that is used to f(x;⃗ β) ⃗ = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + … obtain parameter estimates was independently developed in the late 1700's and the early 1800's by the mathematicians Karl Friedrich Gauss, Adrien Marie Legendre and (possibly) Robert Adrain [Stigler (1978)] [Harter (1983)] [Stigler (1986)] working in Germany, France and America, respectively. In the least squares method the unknown parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations between the data and the model. The minimization process reduces the overdetermined system of equations formed by the data to a sensible system of , (where is the number of parameters in the functional part of the model) equations in unknowns. This new system of equations is then solved to obtain the parameter estimates. To learn more about how the method of least squares is used to estimate the parameters, see Section 4.4.3.1. Examples of Linear Functions As just mentioned above, linear models are not limited to being straight lines or planes, but include a fairly wide range of shapes. For example, a simple quadratic curve, is linear in the statistical sense. A straight-line model in , or a polynomial in , is also linear in the statistical sense because they are linear in the parameters, though not with respect to the observed explanatory variable, . Nonlinear Model Example Just as models that are linear in the statistical sense do not have to be linear with respect to the explanatory variables, nonlinear models can be linear with respect to the explanatory variables, but not with respect to the parameters. For example, is linear in , but it cannot be written in the general form of a linear model presented above. This is because the slope of this line is expressed as the product of two parameters. As a result, nonlinear least squares regression could be used to fit this model, but linear least squares cannot be used. For further examples and discussion of nonlinear models see the next section, Section 4.1.4.2. Advantages of Linear Least Squares Linear least squares regression has earned its place as the primary tool for process modeling because of its effectiveness and completeness. p p p f(x; β) = + x + , ⃗ β0 β1 β11x 2 log(x) f(x; β) = + ln(x), ⃗ β0 β1 sin(x) f(x; β) = + sin(x) + sin(2x) + sin(3x), ⃗ β0 β1 β2 β3 x f(x; β) = + x ⃗ β0 β0β1 x Though there are types of data that are better described by functions that are nonlinear in the parameters, many processes in science and engineering are well-described by linear models. This is because either the processes are inherently linear or because, over short ranges, any process can be well-approximated by a linear model. The estimates of the unknown parameters obtained from linear least squares regression are the optimal estimates from a broad class of possible parameter estimates under the usual assumptions used for process modeling. Practically speaking, linear least squares regression makes very efficient use of the data. Good results can be obtained with relatively small data sets. Finally, the theory associated with linear regression is wellunderstood and allows for construction of different types of easily-interpretable statistical intervals for predictions, calibrations, and optimizations. These statistical intervals can then be used to give clear answers to scientific and engineering questions. Disadvantages of Linear Least Squares The main disadvantages of linear least squares are limitations in the shapes that linear models can assume over long ranges, possibly poor extrapolation properties, and sensitivity to outliers. Linear models with nonlinear terms in the predictor variables curve relatively slowly, so for inherently nonlinear processes it becomes increasingly difficult to find a linear model that fits the data well as the range of the data increases. As the explanatory variables become extreme, the output of the linear model will also always more extreme. This means that linear models may not be effective for extrapolating the results of a process for which data cannot be collected in the region of interest. Of course extrapolation is potentially dangerous regardless of the model type. Finally, while the method of least squares often gives optimal estimates of the unknown parameters, it is very sensitive to the presence of unusual data points in the data used to fit a model. One or two outliers can sometimes seriously skew the results of a least squares analysis. This makes model validation, especially with respect to outliers, critical to obtaining sound answers to the questions motivating the construction of the model. 4. Process Modeling 4.1. Introduction to Process Modeling 4.1.4. What are some of the different statistical methods for model building? 4.1.4.2. Nonlinear Least Squares Regression Extension of Linear Least Squares Regression Nonlinear least squares regression extends linear least squares regression for use with a much larger and more general class of functions. Almost any function that can be written in closed form can be incorporated in a nonlinear regression model. Unlike linear regression, there are very few limitations on the way parameters can be used in the functional part of a nonlinear regression model. The way in which the unknown parameters in the function are estimated, however, is conceptually the same as it is in linear least squares regression. Definition of a Nonlinear Regression Model As the name suggests, a nonlinear model is any model of the basic form, in which 1. the functional part of the model is not linear with respect to the unknown parameters, , and 2. the method of least squares is used to estimate the values of the unknown parameters. Due to the way in which the unknown parameters of the function are usually estimated, however, it is often much easier to work with models that meet two additional criteria: 3. the function is smooth with respect to the unknown parameters, and 4. the least squares criterion that is used to obtain the parameter estimates has a unique solution. These last two criteria are not essential parts of the definition of a nonlinear least squares model, but are of practical importance. Examples of Nonlinear Models Some examples of nonlinear models include: y = f(x;⃗ β) + ε , ⃗ β0, β1, … f(x; β) ⃗ = β0 + β1x 1 + β2x Advantages of Nonlinear Least Squares The biggest advantage of nonlinear least squares regression over many other techniques is the broad range of functions that can be fit. Although many scientific and engineering processes can be described well using linear models, or other relatively simple types of models, there are many other processes that are inherently nonlinear. For example, the strengthening of concrete as it cures is a nonlinear process. Research on concrete strength shows that the strength increases quickly at first and then levels off, or approaches an asymptote in mathematical terms, over time. Linear models do not describe processes that asymptote very well because for all linear functions the function value can't increase or decrease at a declining rate as the explanatory variables go to the extremes. There are many types of nonlinear models, on the other hand, that describe the asymptotic behavior of a process well. Like the asymptotic behavior of some processes, other features of physical processes can often be expressed more easily using nonlinear models than with simpler model types. Being a \\"least squares\\" procedure, nonlinear least squares has some of the same advantages (and disadvantages) that linear least squares regression has over other methods. One common advantage is efficient use of data. Nonlinear regression can produce good estimates of the unknown parameters in the model with relatively small data sets. Another advantage that nonlinear least squares shares with linear least squares is a fairly well-developed theory for computing confidence, prediction and calibration intervals to answer scientific and engineering questions. In most cases the probabilistic interpretation of the intervals produced by nonlinear regression are only approximately correct, but these intervals still work very well in practice. Disadvantages of Nonlinear Least Squares The major cost of moving to nonlinear least squares regression from simpler modeling techniques like linear least squares is the need to use iterative optimization procedures to compute the parameter estimates. With functions that are linear in the parameters, the least squares estimates of the parameters can always be obtained analytically, while that is generally not the case with nonlinear models. The use of iterative procedures requires the user to provide starting values for the unknown parameters before the software can begin the optimization. The starting values must be reasonably close to the as yet unknown parameter estimates or the optimization procedure may not converge. Bad starting values can also cause the f(x; β) ⃗ = β1x β2 f(x; β) = + exp(− x) ⃗ β0 β1 β2 f(x;⃗ β) = sin( + ) + cos( + ) ⃗ β1 β2 β3x1 β4 β5 β6x2 software to converge to a local minimum rather than the global minimum that defines the least squares estimates. Disadvantages shared with the linear least squares procedure includes a strong sensitivity to outliers. Just as in a linear least squares analysis, the presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously affect the results of a nonlinear analysis. In addition there are unfortunately fewer model validation tools for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than there are for linear regression.

One key aspect of feature engineering is scaling, normalization, and standardization, which involves transforming the data to make it more suitable for modeling. These techniques can help to improve model performance, reduce the impact of outliers, and ensure that the data is on the same scale. In this article, we will explore the concepts of scaling, normalization, and standardization, including why they are important and how to apply them to different types of data. By the end of this article, you’ll have a thorough understanding of these essential feature engineering techniques and be able to apply them to your own machine learning projects. Table of contents What is Feature Scaling? Why Should we Use Feature Scaling? What is Normalization? What is Standardization? The Big Question – Normalize or Standardize? Implementing Feature Scaling in Python Comparing Unscaled, Normalized, and Standardized Data Applying Scaling to Machine Learning Algorithms Frequently Asked Questions What is Feature Scaling? Feature scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to transform the values of features or variables in a dataset to a similar scale. The purpose is to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model and to avoid the domination of features with larger values. Feature scaling becomes necessary when dealing with datasets containing features that have different ranges, units of measurement, or orders of magnitude. In such cases, the variation in feature values can lead to biased model performance or difficulties during the learning process. There are several common techniques for feature scaling, including standardization, normalization, and min-max scaling. These methods adjust the feature values while preserving their relative relationships and distributions. By applying feature scaling, the dataset’s features can be transformed to a more consistent scale, making it easier to build accurate and effective machine learning models. Scaling facilitates meaningful comparisons between features, improves model convergence, and prevents certain features from overshadowing others based solely on their magnitude. Why Should we Use Feature Scaling? Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling, while others are virtually invariant. Let’s explore these in more depth: 1. Gradient Descent Based Algorithms Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, PCA (principal component analysis), etc., that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. Take a look at the formula for gradient descent below: The presence of feature value X in the formula will affect the step size of the gradient descent. The difference in the ranges of features will cause different step sizes for each feature. To ensure that the gradient descent moves smoothly towards the minima and that the steps for gradient descent are updated at the same rate for all the features, we scale the data before feeding it to the model. 2. Distance-Based Algorithms Distance algorithms like KNN, K-means clustering, and SVM(support vector machines) are most affected by the range of features. This is because, behind the scenes, they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity. For example, let’s say we have data containing high school CGPA scores of students (ranging from 0 to 5) and their future incomes (in thousands Rupees): Since both the features have different scales, there is a chance that higher weightage is given to features with higher magnitudes. This will impact the performance of the machine learning algorithm; obviously, we do not want our algorithm to be biased towards one feature. “ Having features on a similar scale can help the gradient descent converge more quickly towards the minima. ‘ Therefore, we scale our data before employing a distance based algorithm so that all the features contribute equally to the result. The effect of scaling is conspicuous when we compare the Euclidean distance between data points for students A and B, and between B and C, before and after scaling, as shown below: Distance AB before scaling => Distance BC before scaling => Distance AB after scaling => Distance BC after scaling => 3. Tree-Based Algorithms Tree-based algorithms, on the other hand, are fairly insensitive to the scale of the features. Think about it, a decision tree only splits a node based on a single feature. The decision tree splits a node on a feature that increases the homogeneity of the node. Other features do not influence this split on a feature. So, the remaining features have virtually no effect on the split. This is what makes them invariant to the scale of the features! What is Normalization? Normalization is a data preprocessing technique used to adjust the values of features in a dataset to a common scale. This is done to facilitate data analysis and modeling, and to reduce the impact of different scales on the accuracy of machine learning models. Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. Itis also known as Min-Max scaling. Here’s the formula for normalization: Here, Xmax and Xmin are the maximum and the minimum values of the feature, respectively. When the value of X is the minimum value in the column, the numerator will be 0, and hence X’ is 0 On the other hand, when the value of X is the maximum value in the column, the numerator is equal to the denominator, and thus the value of X’ is 1 If the value of X is between the minimum and the maximum value, then the value of X’ is between 0 and 1 What is Standardization? Standardization is another scaling method where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero, and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation. Here’s the formula for standardization: is the mean of the feature values and is the standard deviation of the feature values. Note that, in this case, the values are not restricted to a particular range. Now, the big question in your mind must be when should we use normalization and when should we use standardization? Let’s find out! The Big Question – Normalize or Standardize? Normalization Standardization Rescales values to a range between 0 and 1 Centers data around the mean and scales to a standard deviation of 1 Useful when the distribution of the data is unknown or not Gaussian Useful when the distribution of the data is Gaussian or unknown Sensitive to outliers Less sensitive to outliers Retains the shape of the original distribution Changes the shape of the original distribution May not preserve the relationships between the data points Preserves the relationships between the data points Equation: (x – min)/(max – min) Equation: (x – mean)/standard deviation However, at the end of the day, the choice of using normalization or standardization will depend on your problem and the machine learning algorithm you are using. There is no hard and fast rule to tell you when to normalize or standardize your data. You can always start by fitting your model to raw, normalized, and standardized data and comparing the performance for the best results. It is a good practice to fit the scaler on the training data and then use it to transform the testing data. This would avoid any data leakage during the model testing process. Also, the scaling of target values is generally not required. Implementing Feature Scaling in Python Now comes the fun part – putting what we have learned into practice. I will be applying feature scaling to a few machine-learning algorithms on the Big Mart dataset. I’ve taken on the DataHack platform. I will skip the preprocessing steps since they are out of the scope of this tutorial. But you can find them neatly explained in this article. Those steps will enable you to reach the top 20 percentile on the hackathon leaderboard, so that’s worth checking out! view raw So, let’s first split our data into training and testing sets: Python Code: @ShilpiMazumdar1/feature_scaling A Nix repl by ShilpiMazumdar1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 42 SH Before moving to the feature scaling part, let’s glance at the details of our data using the pd.describe() method: We can see that there is a huge difference in the range of values present in our numerical features: Item_Visibility, Item_Weight, Item_MRP, and Outlet_Establishment_Year. Let’s try and fix that using feature scaling! Note: You will notice negative values in the Item_Visibility feature because I have taken log-transformation to deal with the skewness in the feature. Normalization Using sklearn (scikit-learn) To normalize your data, you need to import the MinMaxScaler from the sklearn library and apply it to our dataset. So, let’s do that! NormalizationVsStandarization_2.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Let’s see how normalization has affected our dataset: 1 # data normalization with sklearn 2 from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler 3 4 # fit scaler on training data 5 norm = MinMaxScaler().fit(X_train) 6 7 # transform training data 8 X_train_norm = norm.transform(X_train) 9 10 # transform testing dataabs 11 X_test_norm = norm.transform(X_test) view raw All the features now have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. Perfect! Try out the above code in the live coding window below!! @LakshayArora1/FeatureScaling A Python repl by LakshayArora1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 22 LA Next, let’s try to standardize our data. Standardization Using sklearn To standardize your data, you need to import the StandardScaler from the sklearn library and apply it to our dataset. Here’s how you can do it: NormalizationVsStandarization_3.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 1 # data standardization with sklearn 2 from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 3 4 # copy of datasets 5 X_train_stand = X_train.copy() 6 X_test_stand = X_test.copy() 7 8 # numerical features 9 num_cols = ['Item_Weight','Item_Visibility','Item_MRP','Outlet_Establishment_Year'] 10 11 # apply standardization on numerical features 12 for i in num_cols: 13 14 # fit on training data column 15 scale = StandardScaler().fit(X_train_stand[[i]]) 16 17 # transform the training data column 18 X_train_stand[i] = scale.transform(X_train_stand[[i]]) 19 20 # transform the testing data column 21 X_test_stand[i] = scale.transform(X_test_stand[[i]]) You would have noticed that I only applied standardization to my numerical columns, not the other One-Hot Encoded features. Standardizing the One-Hot encoded features would mean assigning a distribution to categorical features. You don’t want to do that! But why did I not do the same while normalizing the data? Because One-Hot encoded features are already in the range between 0 to 1. So, normalization would not affect their value. Right, let’s have a look at how standardization has transformed our data: The numerical features are now centered on the mean with a unit standard deviation. Awesome! Comparing Unscaled, Normalized, and Standardized Data It is always great to visualize your data to understand the distribution present. We can see the comparison between our unscaled and scaled data using boxplots. You can learn more about data visualization here. You can notice how scaling the features brings everything into perspective. The features are now more comparable and will have a similar effect on the learning models. Applying Scaling to Machine Learning Algorithms It’s now time to train some machine learning algorithms on our data to compare the effects of different scaling techniques on the algorithm’s performance. I want to see the effect of scaling on three algorithms in particular: KNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regressor, and Decision Tree. K-Nearest Neighbors As we saw before, KNN is a distance-based algorithm that is affected by the range of features. Let’s see how it performs on our data before and after scaling: NormalizationVsStandarization_4.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub view raw You can see that scaling the features has brought down the RMSE score of our KNN model. Specifically, the normalized data performs a tad bit better than the standardized data. Note: I am measuring the RMSE here because this competition evaluates the RMSE. Support Vector Regressor SVR is another distance-based algorithm. So let’s check out whether it works better with normalization or standardization: 1 # training a KNN model 2 from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # knn 7 knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=7) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train, X_train_norm, X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test, X_test_norm, X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 knn.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict 21 pred = knn.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_knn = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_knn 1 # training an SVR model 2 from sklearn.svm import SVR 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # SVR 7 svr = SVR(kernel='rbf',C=5) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train, X_train_norm, X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test, X_test_norm, X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 svr.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict view raw view raw NormalizationVsStandarization_5.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub We can see that scaling the features does bring down the RMSE score. And the standardized data has performed better than the normalized data. Why do you think that’s the case? The sklearn documentation states that SVM, with RBF kernel, assumes that all the features are centered around zero and variance is of the same order. This is because a feature with a variance greater than that of others prevents the estimator from learning from all the features. Great! Decision Tree We already know that a Decision tree is invariant to feature scaling. But I wanted to show a practical example of how it performs on the data: NormalizationVsStandarization_6.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 21 pred = svr.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_svr = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_svr 1 # training a Decision Tree model 2 from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # Decision tree 7 dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=10,random_state=27) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train,X_train_norm,X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test,X_test_norm,X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 dt.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict 21 pred = dt.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_dt = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_dt You can see that the RMSE score has not moved an inch on scaling the features. So rest assured when you are using tree-based algorithms on your data!

Frequently Asked Questions Q1. How is Standardization differentfrom Normalization feature scaling? A. Standardization centers data around a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, while normalization scales data to a set range, often [0, 1], by using the minimum and maximum values. Q2. Why is Standardization used in machine learning? A. Standardization ensures algorithmic stability and prevents sensitivity to the scale of input features, improves optimization algorithms’ convergence and search efficiency, and enhances the performance of certain machine learning algorithms. Q3. Why is Normalization used in machine learning? A. Normalization helps in scaling the input features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1], to ensure that no single feature disproportionately impacts the results. It preserves the relationship between the minimum and maximum values of each feature, which can be important for some algorithms. It also improves the convergence and stability of some machine learning algorithms, particularly those that use gradient-based optimization. Q4. Why do we normalize values? A. We normalize values to bring them into a common scale, making it easier to compare and analyze data. Normalization also helps to reduce the impact of outliers and improve the accuracy and stability of statistical models. Q5. How do you normalize a set of values? A. To normalize a set of values, we first calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data. Then, we subtract the mean from each value and divide by the standard deviation to obtain standardized values with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Alternatively, we can use other normalization techniques such as min-max normalization, where we scale the values to a range of 0 to 1, or unit vector normalization, where we scale the values to have a length of 1. Feature scaling feature scaling machine learning feature scaling python live coding normalizaiton vs. standardization normalization standardization “Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.” — Dr. Jason Brownlee This gives us an idea about feature engineering being the process of transforming data into features to act as inputs for machine learning models such that good quality features help in improving the overall model performance. Features are also very much dependent on the underlying problem. Thus, even though the machine learning task might be same in different scenarios, like classification of emails into spam and non-spam or classifying handwritten digits, the features extracted in each scenario will be very different from the other. Prof. Pedro Domingos from the University of Washington, in his paper titled, “A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning” tells us the following. “At the end of the day, some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the dif erence? Easily the most important factor is the features used.” — Prof. Pedro Domingos The final quote which should motivate you about feature engineering is from renowned Kaggler, Xavier Conort. Most of you already know that tough real-world machine learning problems are often posted on Kaggle regularly which is usually open to everyone. “The algorithms we used are very standard for Kagglers. …We spent most of our ef orts in feature engineering. … We were also very careful to discard features likely to expose us to the risk of over-fitting our model.” — Xavier Conort Understanding Features A feature is typically a specific representation on top of raw data, which is an individual, measurable attribute, typically depicted by a column in a dataset. Considering a generic two-dimensional dataset, each observation is depicted by a row and each feature by a column, which will have a specific value for an observation. A generic dataset snapshot Thus like in the example in the figure above, each row typically indicates a feature vector and the entire set of features across all the observations forms a two-dimensional feature matrix also known as a feature-set. This is akin to data frames or spreadsheets representing two-dimensional data. Typically machine learning algorithms work with these numeric matrices or tensors and hence most feature engineering techniques deal with converting raw data into some numeric representations which can be easily understood by these algorithms. Features can be of two major types based on the dataset. Inherent raw features are obtained directly from the dataset with no extra data manipulation or engineering. Derived features are usually obtained from feature engineering, where we extract features from existing data attributes. A simple example would be creating a new feature “Age” from an employee dataset containing “Birthdate” by just subtracting their birth date from the current date. There are diverse types and formats of data including structured and unstructured data. In this article, we will discuss various feature engineering strategies for dealing with structured continuous numeric data. All these examples are a part of one of my recent books ‘Practical Machine Learning with Python’ and you can access relevant datasets and code used in this article on GitHub. A big shout out also goes to Gabriel Moreira who helped me by providing some excellent pointers on feature engineering techniques. Feature Engineering on Numeric Data Numeric data typically represents data in the form of scalar values depicting observations, recordings or measurements. Here, by numeric data, we mean continuous data and not discrete data which is typically represented as categorical data. Numeric data can also be represented as a vector of values where each value or entity in the vector can represent a specific feature. Integers and floats are the most common and widely used numeric data types for continuous numeric data. Even though numeric data can be directly fed into machine learning models, you would still need to engineer features which are relevant to the scenario, problem and domain before building a model. Hence the need for feature engineering still remains. Let’s leverage python and look at some strategies for feature engineering on numeric data. We load up the following necessary dependencies first (typically in a Jupyter notebook). import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import scipy.stats as spstats %matplotlib inline Raw Measures Like we mentioned earlier, raw numeric data can often be fed directly to machine learning models based on the context and data format. Raw measures are typically indicated using numeric variables directly as features without any form of transformation or engineering. Typically these features can indicate values or counts. Let’s load up one of our datasets, the Pokémon dataset also available on Kaggle. poke_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/Pokemon.csv', encoding='utf-8') poke_df.head() Snapshot of our Pokemon dataset Pokémon is a huge media franchise surrounding fictional characters called Pokémon which stands for pocket monsters. In short, you can think of them as fictional animals with superpowers! This dataset consists of these characters with various statistics for each character. Values If you closely observe the data frame snapshot in the above figure, you can see that several attributes represent numeric raw values which can be used directly. The following snippet depicts some of these features with more emphasis. poke_df[['HP', 'Attack', 'Defense']].head() Features with (continuous) numeric data Thus, you can directly use these attributes as features which are depicted in the above data frame. These include each Pokémon’s HP (Hit Points), Attack and Defense stats. In fact, we can also compute some basic statistical measures on these fields. poke_df[['HP', 'Attack', 'Defense']].describe() Basic descriptive statistics on numeric features With this you can get a good idea about statistical measures in these features like count, average, standard deviation and quartiles. Counts Another form of raw measures include features which represent frequencies, counts or occurrences of specific attributes. Let’s look at a sample of data from the millionsong dataset which depicts counts or frequencies of songs which have been heard by various users. popsong_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/song_views.csv', encoding='utf-8') popsong_df.head(10) Song listen counts as a numeric feature It is quite evident from the above snapshot that the listen_count field can be used directly as a frequencycount based numeric feature. Binarization Often raw frequencies or counts may not be relevant for building a model based on the problem which is being solved. For instance if I’m building a recommendation system for song recommendations, I would just want to know if a person is interested or has listened to a particular song. This doesn’t require the number of times a song has been listened to since I am more concerned about the various songs heshe has listened to. In this case, a binary feature is preferred as opposed to a count based feature. We can binarize our listen_count field as follows. watched = np.array(popsong_df['listen_count']) watched[watched >= 1] = 1 popsong_df['watched'] = watched You can also use scikit-learn's Binarizer class here from its preprocessing module to perform the same task instead of numpy arrays. from sklearn.preprocessing import Binarizer bn = Binarizer(threshold=0.9) pd_watched = bn.transform([popsong_df['listen_count']])[0] popsong_df['pd_watched'] = pd_watched popsong_df.head(11) Binarizing song counts You can clearly see from the above snapshot that both the methods have produced the same result. Thus we get a binarized feature indicating if the song was listened to or not by each user which can be then further used in a relevant model. Rounding Often when dealing with continuous numeric attributes like proportions or percentages, we may not need the raw values having a high amount of precision. Hence it often makes sense to round off these high precision percentages into numeric integers. These integers can then be directly used as raw values or even as categorical (discrete-class based) features. Let’s try applying this concept in a dummy dataset depicting store items and their popularity percentages. items_popularity = pd.read_csv('datasets/item_popularity.csv', encoding='utf-8') items_popularity['popularity_scale_10'] = np.array( np.round((items_popularity['pop_percent'] * 10)), dtype='int') items_popularity['popularity_scale_100'] = np.array( np.round((items_popularity['pop_percent'] * 100)), dtype='int') items_popularity Rounding popularity to different scales Based on the above ouputs, you can guess that we tried two forms of rounding. The features depict the item popularities now both on a scale of 1–10 and on a scale of 1–100. You can use these values both as numerical or categorical features based on the scenario and problem. Interactions Supervised machine learning models usually try to model the output responses (discrete classes or continuous values) as a function of the input feature variables. For example, a simple linear regression equation can be depicted as where the input features are depicted by variables having weights or coefficients denoted by respectively and the goal is to predict the response y. In this case, this simple linear model depicts the relationship between the output and inputs, purely based on the individual, separate input features. However, often in several real-world scenarios, it makes sense to also try and capture the interactions between these feature variables as a part of the input feature set. A simple depiction of the extension of the above linear regression formulation with interaction features would be where the features represented by denote the interaction features. Let’s try engineering some interaction features on our Pokémon dataset now. atk_def = poke_df[['Attack', 'Defense']] atk_def.head() From the output data frame, we can see that we have two numeric (continuous) features, Attack and Defence . We will now build features up to the 2nd degree by leveraging scikit-learn . from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures pf = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=False, include_bias=False) res = pf.fit_transform(atk_def) res Output ------ array([[ 49., 49., 2401., 2401., 2401.], [ 62., 63., 3844., 3906., 3969.], [ 82., 83., 6724., 6806., 6889.], ..., [ 110., 60., 12100., 6600., 3600.], [ 160., 60., 25600., 9600., 3600.], [ 110., 120., 12100., 13200., 14400.]]) The above feature matrix depicts a total of five features including the new interaction features. We can see the degree of each feature in the above matrix as follows. pd.DataFrame(pf.powers_, columns=['Attack_degree', 'Defense_degree']) Looking at this output, we now know what each feature actually represents from the degrees depicted here. Armed with this knowledge, we can assign a name to each feature now as follows. This is just for ease of understanding and you should name your features with better, easy to access and simple names. intr_features = pd.DataFrame(res, columns=['Attack', 'Defense', 'Attack^2', 'Attack x Defense', 'Defense^2']) intr_features.head(5) Numeric features with their interactions Thus the above data frame represents our original features along with their interaction features. Binning The problem of working with raw, continuous numeric features is that often the distribution of values in these features will be skewed. This signifies that some values will occur quite frequently while some will be quite rare. Besides this, there is also another problem of the varying range of values in any of these features. For instance view counts of specific music videos could be abnormally large (Despacito we’re looking at you!) and some could be really small. Directly using these features can cause a lot of issues and adversely affect the model. Hence there are strategies to deal with this, which include binning and transformations. Binning, also known as quantization is used for transforming continuous numeric features into discrete ones (categories). These discrete values or numbers can be thought of as categories or bins into which the raw, continuous numeric values are binned or grouped into. Each bin represents a specific degree of intensity and hence a specific range of continuous numeric values fall into it. Specific strategies of binning data include fixed-width and adaptive binning. Let’s use a subset of data from a dataset extracted from the 2016 FreeCodeCamp DeveloperCoder survey which talks about various attributes pertaining to coders and software developers. fcc_survey_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/fcc_2016_coder_survey_subset.csv', encoding='utf-8') fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'EmploymentField', 'Age', 'Income']].head() Sample attributes from the FCC coder survey dataset The ID.x variable is basically a unique identifier for each coderdeveloper who took the survey and the other fields are pretty self-explanatory. Fixed-Width Binning Just like the name indicates, in fixed-width binning, we have specific fixed widths for each of the bins which are usually pre-defined by the user analyzing the data. Each bin has a pre-fixed range of values which should be assigned to that bin on the basis of some domain knowledge, rules or constraints. Binning based on rounding is one of the ways, where you can use the rounding operation which we discussed earlier to bin raw values. Let’s now consider the Age feature from the coder survey dataset and look at its distribution. fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Age'].hist(color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) ax.set_title('Developer Age Histogram', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Age', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer age distribution The above histogram depicting developer ages is slightly right skewed as expected (lesser aged developers). We will now assign these raw age values into specific bins based on the following scheme Age Range: Bin --------------- 0 - 9 : 0 10 - 19 : 1 20 - 29 : 2 30 - 39 : 3 40 - 49 : 4 50 - 59 : 5 60 - 69 : 6 ... and so on We can easily do this using what we learnt in the Rounding section earlier where we round off these raw age values by taking the floor value after dividing it by 10. fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_round'] = np.array(np.floor( np.array(fcc_survey_df['Age']) / 10.)) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Age_bin_round']].iloc[1071:1076] Binning by rounding You can see the corresponding bins for each age have been assigned based on rounding. But what if we need more flexibility? What if we want to decide and fix the bin widths based on our own ruleslogic? Binning based on custom ranges will help us achieve this. Let’s define some custom age ranges for binning developer ages using the following scheme. Age Range : Bin --------------- 0 - 15 : 1 16 - 30 : 2 31 - 45 : 3 46 - 60 : 4 61 - 75 : 5 75 - 100 : 6 Based on this custom binning scheme, we will now label the bins for each developer age value and we will store both the bin range as well as the corresponding label. bin_ranges = [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 100] bin_names = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_custom_range'] = pd.cut( np.array( fcc_survey_df['Age']), bins=bin_ranges) fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_custom_label'] = pd.cut( np.array( fcc_survey_df['Age']), bins=bin_ranges, labels=bin_names) # view the binned features fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Age_bin_round', 'Age_bin_custom_range', 'Age_bin_custom_label']].iloc[10a71:1076] Custom binning scheme for developer ages Adaptive Binning The drawback in using fixed-width binning is that due to us manually deciding the bin ranges, we can end up with irregular bins which are not uniform based on the number of data points or values which fall in each bin. Some of the bins might be densely populated and some of them might be sparsely populated or even empty! Adaptive binning is a safer strategy in these scenarios where we let the data speak for itself! That’s right, we use the data distribution itself to decide our bin ranges. Quantile based binning is a good strategy to use for adaptive binning. Quantiles are specific values or cut-points which help in partitioning the continuous valued distribution of a specific numeric field into discrete contiguous bins or intervals. Thus, q-Quantiles help in partitioning a numeric attribute into q equal partitions. Popular examples of quantiles include the 2-Quantile known as the median which divides the data distribution into two equal bins, 4-Quantiles known as the quartiles which divide the data into 4 equal bins and 10-Quantiles also known as the deciles which create 10 equal width bins. Let’s now look at the data distribution for the developer Income field. fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer income distribution The above distribution depicts a right skew in the income with lesser developers earning more money and vice versa. Let’s take a 4-Quantile or a quartile based adaptive binning scheme. We can obtain the quartiles easily as follows. quantile_list = [0, .25, .5, .75, 1.] quantiles = fcc_survey_df['Income'].quantile(quantile_list) quantiles Output ------ 0.00 6000.0 0.25 20000.0 0.50 37000.0 0.75 60000.0 1.00 200000.0 Name: Income, dtype: float64 Let’s now visualize these quantiles in the original distribution histogram! fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) for quantile in quantiles: qvl = plt.axvline(quantile, color='r') ax.legend([qvl], ['Quantiles'], fontsize=10) ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram with Quantiles', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer income distribution with quartile values The red lines in the distribution above depict the quartile values and our potential bins. Let’s now leverage this knowledge to build our quartile based binning scheme. quantile_labels = ['0-25Q', '25-50Q', '50-75Q', '75-100Q'] fcc_survey_df['Income_quantile_range'] = pd.qcut( fcc_survey_df['Income'], q=quantile_list) fcc_survey_df['Income_quantile_label'] = pd.qcut( fcc_survey_df['Income'], q=quantile_list, labels=quantile_labels) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_quantile_range', 'Income_quantile_label']].iloc[4:9] Quantile based bin ranges and labels for developer incomes This should give you a good idea of how quantile based adaptive binning works. An important point to remember here is that the resultant outcome of binning leads to discrete valued categorical features and you might need an additional step of feature engineering on the categorical data before using it in any model. We will cover feature engineering strategies for categorical data shortly in the next part! Statistical Transformations We talked about the adverse effects of skewed data distributions briefly earlier. Let’s look at a different strategy of feature engineering now by making use of statistical or mathematical transformations.We will look at the Log transform as well as the Box-Cox transform. Both of these transform functions belong to the Power Transform family of functions, typically used to create monotonic data transformations. Their main significance is that they help in stabilizing variance, adhering closely to the normal distribution and making the data independent of the mean based on its distribution Log Transform The log transform belongs to the power transform family of functions. This function can be mathematically represented as which reads as log of x to the base b is equal to y. This can then be translated into which indicates as to what power must the base b be raised to in order to get x. The natural logarithm uses b=e where e = 2.71828 popularly known as Euler’s number. You can also use base b=10 used popularly in the decimal system. Log transforms are useful when applied to skewed distributions as they tend to expand the values which fall in the range of lower magnitudes and tend to compress or reduce the values which fall in the range of higher magnitudes. This tends to make the skewed distribution as normal-like as possible. Let’s use log transform on our developer Income feature which we used earlier. fcc_survey_df['Income_log'] = np.log((1+ fcc_survey_df['Income'])) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_log']].iloc[4:9] Log transform on developer income The Income_log field depicts the transformed feature after log transformation. Let’s look at the data distribution on this transformed field now. income_log_mean = np.round(np.mean(fcc_survey_df['Income_log']), 2) fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income_log'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) plt.axvline(income_log_mean, color='r') ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram after Log Transform', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income (log scale)', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) ax.text(11.5, 450, r'mu='+str(income_log_mean), fontsize=10) Histogram depicting developer income distribution after log transform Based on the above plot, we can clearly see that the distribution is more normal-like or gaussian as compared to the skewed distribution on the original data. Box-Cox Transform The Box-Cox transform is another popular function belonging to the power transform family of functions. This function has a pre-requisite that the numeric values to be transformed must be positive (similar to what log transform expects). In case they are negative, shifting using a constant value helps. Mathematically, the Box-Cox transform function can be denoted as follows. Such that the resulted transformed output y is a function of input x and the transformation parameter λ such that when λ = 0, the resultant transform is the natural log transform which we discussed earlier. The optimal value of λ is usually determined using a maximum likelihood or loglikelihood estimation. Let’s now apply the Box-Cox transform on our developer income feature. First we get the optimal lambda value from the data distribution by removing the non-null values as follows. income = np.array(fcc_survey_df['Income']) income_clean = income[~np.isnan(income)] l, opt_lambda = spstats.boxcox(income_clean) print('Optimal lambda value:', opt_lambda) Output ------ Optimal lambda value: 0.117991239456 Now that we have obtained the optimal λ value, let us use the Box-Cox transform for two values of λ such that λ = 0 and λ = λ(optimal) and transform the developer Income feature. fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_0'] = spstats.boxcox( (1+fcc_survey_df['Income']), lmbda=0) fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt'] = spstats.boxcox( fcc_survey_df['Income'], lmbda=opt_lambda) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_log', 'Income_boxcox_lambda_0', 'Income_boxcox_lambda_opt']].iloc[4:9] Developer income distribution after Box-Cox transform The transformed features are depicted in the above data frame. Just like we expected, Income_log and Income_boxcox_lamba_0 have the same values. Let’s look at the distribution of the transformed Income feature after transforming with the optimal λ. income_boxcox_mean = np.round( np.mean( fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt']),2) fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) plt.axvline(income_boxcox_mean, color='r') ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram after Box–Cox Transform', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income (Box–Cox transform)', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) ax.text(24, 450, r'mu='+str(income_boxcox_mean), fontsize=10) Histogram depicting developer income distribution after Box-Cox transform The distribution looks more normal-like similar to what we obtained after the log transform. Conclusion Feature engineering is a very important aspect of machine learning and data science and should never be ignored. While we have automated feature engineering methodologies like deep learning as well as automated machine learning frameworks like AutoML (which still stresses that it requires good features to work well!). Feature engineering is here to stay and even some of these automated methodologies often require specific engineered features based on the data type, domain and the problem to be solved. We looked at popular strategies for feature engineering on continuous numeric data in this article. In the next part, we will look at popular strategies for dealing with discrete, categorical data and then move on to unstructured data types in future articles. Stay tuned!

In this article, we will look at another type of structured data, which is discrete in nature and is popularly termed as categorical data. Dealing with numeric data is often easier than categorical data given that we do not have to deal with additional complexities of the semantics pertaining to each category value in any data attribute which is of a categorical type. We will use a hands-on approach to discuss several encoding Get unlimited access to the best of Medium for less than 1/week. Become a member schemes for dealing with categorical data and also a couple of popular techniques for dealing with large scale feature explosion, often known as the “curse of dimensionality”. Motivation I’m sure by now you must realize the motivation and the importance of feature engineering, we do stress on the same in detail in ‘Part 1’ of this series. Do check it out for a quick refresher if necessary. In short, machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with categorical data and you do need to do some amount of engineering and transformations on this data before you can start modeling on your data. Understanding Categorical Data Let’s get an idea about categorical data representations before diving into feature engineering strategies. Typically, any data attribute which is categorical in nature represents discrete values which belong to a specific finite set of categories or classes. These are also often known as classes or labels in the context of attributes or variables which are to be predicted by a model (popularly known as response variables). These discrete values can be text or numeric in nature (or even unstructured data like images!). There are two major classes of categorical data, nominal and ordinal. In any nominal categorical data attribute, there is no concept of ordering amongst the values of that attribute. Consider a simple example of weather categories, as depicted in the following figure. We can see that we have six major classes or categories in this particular scenario without any concept or notion of order (windy doesn’t always occur before sunny nor is it smaller or bigger than sunny). Weather as a categorical attribute Similarly movie, music and video game genres, country names, food and cuisine types are other examples of nominal categorical attributes. Ordinal categorical attributes have some sense or notion of order amongst its values. For instance look at the following figure for shirt sizes. It is quite evident that order or in this case ‘size’ matters when thinking about shirts (S is smaller than M which is smaller than L and so on). Shirt size as an ordinal categorical attribute Shoe sizes, education level and employment roles are some other examples of ordinal categorical attributes. Having a decent idea about categorical data, let’s now look at some feature engineering strategies. Feature Engineering on Categorical Data While a lot of advancements have been made in various machine learning frameworks to accept complex categorical data types like text labels. Typically any standard workflow in feature engineering involves some form of transformation of these categorical values into numeric labels and then applying some encoding scheme on these values. We load up the necessary essentials before getting started. import pandas as pd import numpy as np Transforming Nominal Attributes Nominal attributes consist of discrete categorical values with no notion or sense of order amongst them. The idea here is to transform these attributes into a more representative numerical format which can be easily understood by downstream code and pipelines. Let’s look at a new dataset pertaining to video game sales. This dataset is also available on Kaggle as well as in my GitHub repository. vg_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/vgsales.csv', encoding='utf-8') vg_df[['Name', 'Platform', 'Year', 'Genre', 'Publisher']].iloc[1:7] Dataset for video game sales Let’s focus on the video game Genre attribute as depicted in the above data frame. It is quite evident that this is a nominal categorical attribute just like Publisher and Platform . We can easily get the list of unique video game genres as follows. genres = np.unique(vg_df['Genre']) genres Output ------ array(['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fighting', 'Misc', 'Platform', 'Puzzle', 'Racing', 'Role-Playing', 'Shooter', 'Simulation', 'Sports', 'Strategy'], dtype=object) This tells us that we have 12 distinct video game genres. We can now generate a label encoding scheme for mapping each category to a numeric value by leveraging scikit-learn . from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder gle = LabelEncoder() genre_labels = gle.fit_transform(vg_df['Genre']) genre_mappings = {index: label for index, label in enumerate(gle.classes_)} genre_mappings Output ------ {0: 'Action', 1: 'Adventure', 2: 'Fighting', 3: 'Misc', 4: 'Platform', 5: 'Puzzle', 6: 'Racing', 7: 'Role-Playing', 8: 'Shooter', 9: 'Simulation', 10: 'Sports', 11: 'Strategy'} Thus a mapping scheme has been generated where each genre value is mapped to a number with the help of the LabelEncoder object gle . The transformed labels are stored in the genre_labels value which we can write back to our data frame. vg_df['GenreLabel'] = genre_labels vg_df[['Name', 'Platform', 'Year', 'Genre', 'GenreLabel']].iloc[1:7] Video game genres with their encoded labels These labels can be used directly often especially with frameworks like scikitlearn if you plan to use them as response variables for prediction, however as discussed earlier, we will need an additional step of encoding on these before we can use them as features. Transforming Ordinal Attributes Ordinal attributes are categorical attributes with a sense of order amongst the values. Let’s consider our Pokémon dataset which we used in Part 1 of this series. Let’s focus more specifically on the Generation attribute. poke_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/Pokemon.csv', encoding='utf-8') poke_df = poke_df.sample(random_state=1, frac=1).reset_index(drop=True) np.unique(poke_df['Generation']) Output ------ array(['Gen 1', 'Gen 2', 'Gen 3', 'Gen 4', 'Gen 5', 'Gen 6'], dtype=object) Based on the above output, we can see there are a total of 6 generations and each Pokémon typically belongs to a specific generation based on the video games (when they were released) and also the television series follows a similar timeline. This attribute is typically ordinal (domain knowledge is necessary here) because most Pokémon belonging to Generation 1 were introduced earlier in the video games and the television shows than Generation 2 as so on. Fans can check out the following figure to remember some of the popular Pokémon of each generation (views may differ among fans!). Popular Pokémon based on generation and type (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2s2upx/heres_my_favorite_pokemon_by_type_and_gen_chart) Hence they have a sense of order amongst them. In general, there is no generic module or function to map and transform these features into numeric representations based on order automatically. Hence we can use a custom encodingmapping scheme. gen_ord_map = {'Gen 1': 1, 'Gen 2': 2, 'Gen 3': 3, 'Gen 4': 4, 'Gen 5': 5, 'Gen 6': 6} poke_df['GenerationLabel'] = poke_df['Generation'].map(gen_ord_map) poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'GenerationLabel']].iloc[4:10] Pokémon generation encoding It is quite evident from the above code that the map(…) function from pandas is quite helpful in transforming this ordinal feature. Encoding Categorical Attributes If you remember what we mentioned earlier, typically feature engineering on categorical data involves a transformation process which we depicted in the previous section and a compulsory encoding process where we apply specific encoding schemes to create dummy variables or features for each categoryvalue in a specific categorical attribute. You might be wondering, we just converted categories to numerical labels in the previous section, why on earth do we need this now? The reason is quite simple. Considering video game genres, if we directly fed the GenreLabel attribute as a feature in a machine learning model, it would consider it to be a continuous numeric feature thinking value 10 (Sports) is greater than 6 (Racing) but that is meaningless because the Sports genre is certainly not bigger or smaller than Racing, these are essentially different values or categories which cannot be compared directly. Hence we need an additional layer of encoding schemes where dummy features are created for each unique value or category out of all the distinct categories per attribute. One-hot Encoding Scheme Considering we have the numeric representation of any categorical attribute with m labels (after transformation), the one-hot encoding scheme, encodes or transforms the attribute into m binary features which can only contain a value of 1 or 0. Each observation in the categorical feature is thus converted into a vector of size m with only one of the values as 1 (indicating it as active). Let’s take a subset of our Pokémon dataset depicting two attributes of interest. poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Legendary']].iloc[4:10] Subset of our Pokémon dataset The attributes of interest are Pokémon Generation and their Legendary status. The first step is to transform these attributes into numeric representations based on what we learnt earlier. from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder # transform and map pokemon generations gen_le = LabelEncoder() gen_labels = gen_le.fit_transform(poke_df['Generation']) poke_df['Gen_Label'] = gen_labels # transform and map pokemon legendary status leg_le = LabelEncoder() leg_labels = leg_le.fit_transform(poke_df['Legendary']) poke_df['Lgnd_Label'] = leg_labels poke_df_sub = poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label', 'Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label']] poke_df_sub.iloc[4:10] Attributes with transformed (numeric) labels The features Gen_Label and Lgnd_Label now depict the numeric representations of our categorical features. Let’s now apply the one-hot encoding scheme on these features. # encode generation labels using one-hot encoding scheme gen_ohe = OneHotEncoder() gen_feature_arr = gen_ohe.fit_transform( poke_df[['Gen_Label']]).toarray() gen_feature_labels = list(gen_le.classes_) gen_features = pd.DataFrame(gen_feature_arr, columns=gen_feature_labels) # encode legendary status labels using one-hot encoding scheme leg_ohe = OneHotEncoder() leg_feature_arr = leg_ohe.fit_transform( poke_df[['Lgnd_Label']]).toarray() leg_feature_labels = ['Legendary_'+str(cls_label) for cls_label in leg_le.classes_] leg_features = pd.DataFrame(leg_feature_arr, columns=leg_feature_labels) In general, you can always encode both the features together using the fit_transform(…) function by passing it a two dimensional array of the two features together (Check out the documentation!). But we encode each feature separately, to make things easier to understand. Besides this, we can also create separate data frames and label them accordingly. Let’s now concatenate these feature frames and see the final result. poke_df_ohe = pd.concat([poke_df_sub, gen_features, leg_features], axis=1) columns = sum([['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label'], gen_feature_labels, ['Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label'], leg_feature_labels], []) poke_df_ohe[columns].iloc[4:10] One-hot encoded features for Pokémon generation and legendary status Thus you can see that 6 dummy variables or binary features have been created for Generation and 2 for Legendary since those are the total number of distinct categories in each of these attributes respectively. Active state of a category is indicated by the 1 value in one of these dummy variables which is quite evident from the above data frame. Consider you built this encoding scheme on your training data and built some model and now you have some new data which has to be engineered for features before predictions as follows. new_poke_df = pd.DataFrame([['PikaZoom', 'Gen 3', True], ['CharMyToast', 'Gen 4', False]], columns=['Name', 'Generation', 'Legendary']) new_poke_df Sample new data You can leverage scikit-learn’s excellent API here by calling the transform(…) function of the previously build LabeLEncoder and OneHotEncoder objects on the new data. Remember our workflow, first we do the transformation. new_gen_labels = gen_le.transform(new_poke_df['Generation']) new_poke_df['Gen_Label'] = new_gen_labels new_leg_labels = leg_le.transform(new_poke_df['Legendary']) new_poke_df['Lgnd_Label'] = new_leg_labels new_poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label', 'Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label']] Categorical attributes after transformation Once we have numerical labels, let’s apply the encoding scheme now! new_gen_feature_arr = gen_ohe.transform(new_poke_df[['Gen_Label']]).toarray() new_gen_features = pd.DataFrame(new_gen_feature_arr, columns=gen_feature_labels) new_leg_feature_arr = leg_ohe.transform(new_poke_df[['Lgnd_Label']]).toarray() new_leg_features = pd.DataFrame(new_leg_feature_arr, columns=leg_feature_labels) new_poke_ohe = pd.concat([new_poke_df, new_gen_features, new_leg_features], axis=1) columns = sum([['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label'], gen_feature_labels, ['Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label'], leg_feature_labels], []) new_poke_ohe[columns] Categorical attributes after one-hot encoding Thus you can see it’s quite easy to apply this scheme on new data easily by leveraging scikit-learn’s powerful API. You can also apply the one-hot encoding scheme easily by leveraging the to_dummies(…) function from pandas . gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_onehot_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] One-hot encoded features by leveraging pandas The above data frame depicts the one-hot encoding scheme applied on the Generation attribute and the results are same as compared to the earlier results as expected. Dummy Coding Scheme The dummy coding scheme is similar to the one-hot encoding scheme, except in the case of dummy coding scheme, when applied on a categorical feature with m distinct labels, we get m - 1 binary features. Thus each value of the categorical variable gets converted into a vector of size m - 1. The extra feature is completely disregarded and thus if the category values range from {0, 1, …, m-1} the 0th or the m - 1th feature column is dropped and corresponding category values are usually represented by a vector of all zeros (0). Let’s try applying dummy coding scheme on Pokémon Generation by dropping the first level binary encoded feature ( Gen 1 ). gen_dummy_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation'], drop_first=True) pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_dummy_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Dummy coded features for Pokémon g eneration If you want, you can also choose to drop the last level binary encoded feature ( Gen 6 ) as follows. gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) gen_dummy_features = gen_onehot_features.iloc[:,:-1] pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_dummy_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Dummy coded features for Pokémon g eneration Open in app Search Based on the above depictions, it is quite clear that categories belonging to the dropped feature are represented as a vector of zeros (0) like we discussed earlier. Effect Coding Scheme The effect coding scheme is actually very similar to the dummy coding scheme, except during the encoding process, the encoded features or feature vector, for the category values which represent all 0 in the dummy coding scheme, is replaced by -1 in the effect coding scheme. This will become clearer with the following example. gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) gen_effect_features = gen_onehot_features.iloc[:,:-1] gen_effect_features.loc[np.all(gen_effect_features == 0, axis=1)] = -1. pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_effect_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Effect coded features for Pokémon g eneration The above output clearly shows that the Pokémon belonging to Generation 6 are now represented by a vector of -1 values as compared to zeros in dummy coding. Bin-counting Scheme The encoding schemes we discussed so far, work quite well on categorical data in general, but they start causing problems when the number of distinct categories in any feature becomes very large. Essential for any categorical feature of m distinct labels, you get m separate features. This can easily increase the size of the feature set causing problems like storage issues, model training problems with regard to time, space and memory. Besides this, we also have to deal with what is popularly known as the ‘curse of dimensionality’ where basically with an enormous number of features and not enough representative samples, model performance starts getting affected often leading to overfitting. Hence we need to look towards other categorical data feature engineering schemes for features having a large number of possible categories (like IP addresses). The bin-counting scheme is a useful scheme for dealing with categorical variables having many categories. In this scheme, instead of using the actual label values for encoding, we use probability based statistical information about the value and the actual target or response value which we aim to predict in our modeling efforts. A simple example would be based on past historical data for IP addresses and the ones which were used in DDOS attacks; we can build probability values for a DDOS attack being caused by any of the IP addresses. Using this information, we can encode an input feature which depicts that if the same IP address comes in the future, what is the probability value of a DDOS attack being caused. This scheme needs historical data as a pre-requisite and is an elaborate one. Depicting this with a complete example would be currently difficult here but there are several resources online which you can refer to for the same. Feature Hashing Scheme The feature hashing scheme is another useful feature engineering scheme for dealing with large scale categorical features. In this scheme, a hash function is typically used with the number of encoded features pre-set (as a vector of predefined length) such that the hashed values of the features are used as indices in this pre-defined vector and values are updated accordingly. Since a hash function maps a large number of values into a small finite set of values, multiple different values might create the same hash which is termed as collisions. Typically, a signed hash function is used so that the sign of the value obtained from the hash is used as the sign of the value which is stored in the final feature vector at the appropriate index. This should ensure lesser collisions and lesser accumulation of error due to collisions. Hashing schemes work on strings, numbers and other structures like vectors. You can think of hashed outputs as a finite set of b bins such that when hash function is applied on the same valuescategories, they get assigned to the same bin (or subset of bins) out of the b bins based on the hash value. We can pre-define the value of b which becomes the final size of the encoded feature vector for each categorical attribute that we encode using the feature hashing scheme. Thus even if we have over 1000 distinct categories in a feature and we set b=10 as the final feature vector size, the output feature set will still have only 10 features as compared to 1000 binary features if we used a one-hot encoding scheme. Let’s consider the Genre attribute in our video game dataset. unique_genres = np.unique(vg_df[['Genre']]) print(\\"Total game genres:\\", len(unique_genres)) print(unique_genres) Output ------ Total game genres: 12 ['Action' 'Adventure' 'Fighting' 'Misc' 'Platform' 'Puzzle' 'Racing' 'Role-Playing' 'Shooter' 'Simulation' 'Sports' 'Strategy'] We can see that there are a total of 12 genres of video games. If we used a one-hot encoding scheme on the Genre feature, we would end up having 12 binary features. Instead, we will now use a feature hashing scheme by leveraging scikit-learn’s FeatureHasher class, which uses a signed 32-bit version of the Murmurhash3 hash function. We will pre-define the final feature vector size to be 6 in this case. from sklearn.feature_extraction import FeatureHasher fh = FeatureHasher(n_features=6, input_type='string') hashed_features = fh.fit_transform(vg_df['Genre']) hashed_features = hashed_features.toarray() pd.concat([vg_df[['Name', 'Genre']], pd.DataFrame(hashed_features)], axis=1).iloc[1:7] Feature Hashing on the Genre attribute Based on the above output, the Genre categorical attribute has been encoded using the hashing scheme into 6 features instead of 12. We can also see that rows 1 and 6 denote the same genre of games, Platform which have been rightly encoded into the same feature vector. Conclusion These examples should give you a good idea about popular strategies for feature engineering on discrete, categorical data. If you read Part 1 of this series, you would have seen that it is slightly challenging to work with categorical data as compared to continuous, numeric data but definitely interesting! We also talked about some ways to handle large feature spaces using feature engineering but you should also remember that there are other techniques including feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods to handle large feature spaces. We will cover some of these methods in a later article. Next up will be feature engineering strategies for unstructured text data. Stay tuned! To read about feature engineering strategies for continuous numeric data, check out Part 1 of this series! All the code and datasets used in this article can be accessed from my GitHub The code is also available as a Jupyter notebook Machine Learning Data Science Feature Engineering Programming Tds Feature Engineering In this article, we will look at various feature engineering techniques for extracting useful information using the datetime column.

We’ll be using them throughout the article so it’s best to be acquainted with them here. So, what makes time series projects different from the traditional machine learning problems? Let’s take a simple example to understand this. If we want to predict today’s stock price for a certain company, it would be helpful to have information about yesterday’s closing price, right? Similarly, predicting the traffic on a website would be a lot easier if we have data about the last few months or years. There’s another thing we need to consider – time series data may also have certain trends or seasonality. Take a look at the plot shown below about the number of tickets booked for an airline over the years: “ In a time series, the data is captured at equal intervals and each successive data point in the series depends on its past values. view raw view raw We can clearly see an increasing trend. Such information can be useful for making more accurate predictions. Now, let’s take a dataset with date-time variables and start learning about feature engineering! Setting up the Problem Statement for Time Series Data We’ll be working on a fascinating problem to learn feature engineering techniques for time series. We have the historical data for ‘JetRail’, a form of public rail transport, that uses advanced technology to run rails at a high speed. JetRail’s usage has increased recently and we have to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months based on past data. Let’s see how we can help JetRail’s management team solve this problem. You can go through the detailed problem statement and download the dataset from here. Let’s load the dataset in our notebook: loading_data.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub We have two columns here – so it’s clearly a univariate time series. Also, the data type of the date variable is taken as an object, i.e. it is being treated as a categorical variable. Hence, we will need to convert this into a DateTime variable. We can do this using the appropriately titled datetime function in Pandas: changing_dtype.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Now that we have the data ready, let’s look at the different features we can engineer from this variable. Along with each of these feature engineering techniques, we will discuss different scenarios where that particular technique can be useful. NOTE: I have taken a simple time series problem to demonstrate the different feature engineering techniques in this article. You can use them on a dataset of your choice as long as the date-time column is present. Feature Engineering for Time Series #1: Date-Related Features Have you ever worked in a product company? You’ll be intimately familiar with the task of forecasting the sales for a particular product. We can find out the sales pattern for weekdays and weekends based on historical data. Thus, having information about the day, month, year, etc. can be useful for forecasting the values. Let’s get back to our JetRail project. We have to forecast the count of people who will take the JetRail on an hourly basis for the next 7 months. This number could be higher for weekdays and lower for weekends or during the festive seasons. Hence, the day of the week (weekday or weekend) or month will be an important factor. Extracting these features is really easy in Python: 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data.dtypes 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 data.dtypes 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') view raw view raw date_features.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Feature Engineering for Time Series #2: Time-Based Features We can similarly extract more granular features if we have the time stamp. For instance, we can determine the hour or minute of the day when the data was recorded and compare the trends between the business hours and non-business hours. If we are able to extract the ‘hour’ feature from the time stamp, we can make more insightful conclusions about the data. We could find out if the traffic on JetRail is higher during the morning, afternoon or evening time. Or we could use the value to determine the average hourly traffic throughout the week, i.e. the number of people who used JetRail between 9-10 am, 10-11 am, and so on (throughout the week). Extracting time-based features is very similar to what we did above when extracting date-related features. We start by converting the column to DateTime format and use the .dt accessor. Here’s how to do it in Python: time_features.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Similarly, we can extract a number of features from the date column. Here’s a complete list of features that we can generate: 4 5 data['year']=data['Datetime'].dt.year 6 data['month']=data['Datetime'].dt.month 7 data['day']=data['Datetime'].dt.day 8 9 data['dayofweek_num']=data['Datetime'].dt.dayofweek 10 data['dayofweek_name']=data['Datetime'].dt.weekday_name 11 12 data.head() 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['Hour'] = data['Datetime'].dt.hour 6 data['minute'] = data['Datetime'].dt.minute 7 8 data.head() Run the code below to generate the date and hour features for the given data. You can select any of the above functions and run the following code to generate a new feature for the same! @ L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 / Time B a s e d F e a t u r e s A P y t h o n r e p l b y L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 O p e n o n R e p lit S h o w c o d e 0 R u n L A view raw view raw Feature Engineering for Time Series #3: Lag Features Here’s something most aspiring data scientists don’t think about when working on a time series problem – we can also use the target variable for feature engineering! Consider this – you are predicting the stock price for a company. So, the previous day’s stock price is important to make a prediction, right? In other words, the value at time t is greatly affected by the value at time t-1. The past values are known as lags, so t-1 is lag 1, t-2 is lag 2, and so on. lag_feature.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Here, we were able to generate lag one feature for our series. But why lag one? Why not five or seven? That’s a good question. If the series has a weekly trend, which means the value last Monday can be used to predict the value for this Monday, you should create lag features for seven days. Getting the drift? We can create multiple lag features as well! Let’s say we want lag 1 to lag 7 – we can let the model decide which is the most valuable one. So, if we train a linear regression model, it will assign appropriate weights (or coefficients) to the lag features: lag_seven.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['lag_1'] = data['Count'].shift(1) 6 data = data[['Datetime', 'lag_1', 'Count']] 7 data.head() ‘ The lag value we choose will depend on the correlation of individual values with its past values. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['lag_1'] = data['Count'].shift(1) 6 data['lag_2'] = data['Count'].shift(2) 7 data['lag_3'] = data['Count'].shift(3) 8 data['lag_4'] = data['Count'].shift(4) 9 data['lag_5'] = data['Count'].shift(5) 10 data['lag_6'] = data['Count'].shift(6) 11 data['lag_7'] = data['Count'].shift(7) 12 13 data = data[['Datetime', 'lag_1', 'lag_2', 'lag_3', 'lag_4', 'lag_5', 'lag_6', 'lag_7', 'Count']] 14 data.head(10) There is more than one way of determining the lag at which the correlation is significant. For instance, we can use the ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots. ACF: The ACF plot is a measure of the correlation between the time series and the lagged version of itself PACF: The PACF plot is a measure of the correlation between the time series with a lagged version of itself but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons For our particular example, here are the ACF and PACF plots: from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf plot_acf(data['Count'], lags=10) plot_pacf(data['Count'], lags=10) An important point to note – the number of times you shift, the same number of values will be reduced from the data. You would see some rows with NaNs at the start. That’s because the first observation has no lag. You’ll need to discard these rows from the training data. Feature Engineering for Time Series #4: Rolling Window Feature In the last section, we looked at how we can use the previous values as features. Here’s an awesome gif that explains this idea in a wonderfully intuitive way: ‘ The partial autocorrelation function shows a high correlation with the first lag and lesser correlation with the second and third lag. The autocorrelation function shows a slow decay, which means that the future values have a very high correlation with its past values. ‘ How about calculating some statistical values based on past values? This method is called the rolling window method because the window would be different for every data point. view raw Since this looks like a window that is sliding with every next point, the features generated using this method are called the ‘rolling window’ features. Now the question we need to address – how are we going to perform feature engineering here? Let’s start simple. We will select a window size, take the average of the values in the window, and use it as a feature. Let’s implement it in Python: rolling_mean.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Similarly, you can consider the sum, min, max value, etc. (for the selected window) as a feature and try it out on your own machine. Thus, we can use a weighted average, such that higher weights are given to the most recent observations. Mathematically, weighted average at time t for the past 7 values would be: w_avg = w1*(t-1) + w2*(t-2) + . . . . + w7*(t-7) where, w1>w2>w3> . . . . >w7. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['rolling_mean'] = data['Count'].rolling(window=7).mean() 6 data = data[['Datetime', 'rolling_mean', 'Count']] 7 data.head(10) ‘ Recency in an important factor in a time series. Values closer to the current date would hold more information. view raw Feature Engineering for Time Series #5: Expanding Window Feature This is simply an advanced version of the rolling window technique. In the case of a rolling window, the size of the window is constant while the window slides as we move forward in time. Hence, we consider only the most recent values and ignore the past values. Here’s a gif that explains how our expanding window function works: As you can see, with every step, the size of the window increases by one as it takes into account every new value in the series. This can be implemented easily in Python by using the expanding() function. Let’s code this using the same data: expanding_window.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Here is a live coding window that generates the expanding window feature for the given data. Feel free to change the starting window size and print the results: ‘ The idea behind the expanding window feature is that it takes all the past values into account. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['expanding_mean'] = data['Count'].expanding(2).mean() 6 data = data[['Datetime','Count', 'expanding_mean']] 7 data.head(10) @ L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 / E x p a n din g Win d o w F e a t u r e A P y t h o n r e p l b y L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 O p e n o n R e p lit S h o w c o d e 0 R u n 1 3 L A Feature Engineering for Time Series #6: Domain-Specific Features This is the essence of feature engineering! Want to dive into this more? Let’s take an example. Below is the data provided by a retailer for a number of stores and products. Our task is to forecast the future demands for the products. We can come up with various features, like taking a lag or averaging the past values, among other things. But hold on. Let me ask you a question – would it be the right way to build lag features from lag(1) to lag(7) throughout the data? Certainly not! There are different stores and products, and the demand for each store and product would be significantly different. In this case, we can create lag features considering the store-product combination. Moreover, if we have knowledge about the products and the trends in the market, we would be able to generate more accurate (and fewer) features. Not only this, having a good understanding about the domain and data would help us in selecting the lag value and the window size. Additionally, based on your domain knowledge, you would be able to pull external data that adds more value to the model. Here’s what I mean – are the sales affected by the weather on the day? Will the sales increase/decrease on a national holiday?If yes, then you can use external datasets and include the list of holidays as a feature. Validation Technique for Time Series All the feature engineering techniques we have discussed can be used to convert a time series problem into a supervised machine learning problem. Once we have that, we can easily go ahead with machine learning algorithms like linear regression and random forest. But there is one important step that you should know before you jump to the model building process – creating a validation setfor time series. For the traditional machine learning problems, we randomly select subsets of data for the validation and test sets. But in these cases, each data point is dependent on its past values. If we randomly shuffle the data, we might be training on future data and predicting the past values! ‘ Having a good understanding of the problem statement, clarity of the end objective and knowledge of the available data is essential to engineer domain-specific features for the model. Let’s create a validation set for our problem. But first, we must check the duration for which we have the data: import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') data['Datetime'].min(), data['Datetime'].max(), (data['Datetime'].max() -data['Datetime'].min()) (Timestamp('2012-08-25 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2014-09-25 23:00:00'), Timedelta('761 days 23:00:00')) We have data for almost 25 months. Let’s save three months for validation and use the remaining for training: data.index = data.Datetime Train=data.loc['2012-08-25':'2014-06-24'] valid=data.loc['2014-06-25':'2014-09-25'] Train.shape, valid.shape ((16056, 3), (2232, 3)) Great! We have the train and validation sets ready. You can now use these feature engineering techniques and build machine learning models on this data! Frequently Asked Questions Q1. What are the features oftime series? A. The features of a time series are the characteristics and patterns observed within the data over time. Some of the key features include: 1. Trend: The long-term movement or direction in the data, indicating overall growth or decline. 2. Seasonality: Regular and predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals. 3. Cyclic Patterns: Longer-term oscillations with varying periods, not necessarily repeating at fixed intervals. 4. Noise: Random fluctuations or irregularities in the data that do not follow any specific pattern. 5. Autocorrelation: The correlation of a time series with its own past values at different lags. 6. Level: The baseline or starting point of the time series data. Understanding these features is essential for time series analysis and forecasting. Q2. Whatis time series feature extraction method? A. Time series feature extraction methods involve transforming raw time series data into a set of relevant and informative features. Techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and statistical measures (mean, variance, etc.) are used to extract characteristics such as trend, seasonality, periodicity, and statistical properties. These features are then used for time series analysis, classification, and forecasting tasks. End Notes Time Series is often considered a difficult topic to master. That’s understandable because there are a lot of moving parts when we’re working with the date and time components. But once you have a hang of the basic concepts and are able to perform feature engineering, you’ll be gliding through your projects in no time. In this article, we discussed some simple techniques that you can use to work with time series data. Using these feature engineering techniques, we can convert any time series problem into a supervised learning problem and build regression models. ‘ It is important that we carefully build a validation set when working on a time series problem, without destroying the sequential order within the data.  NNaavviiggaattiioonn Click to Take the FREE Probability Crash-Course Search...   228 How to Use ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves for Classification in Python by Jason Brownlee on October 11, 2023 in Probability It can be more flexible to predict probabilities of an observation belonging to each class in a classification problem rather than predicting classes directly. This flexibility comes from the way that probabilities may be interpreted using different thresholds that allow the operator of the model to trade-off concerns in the errors made by the model, such as the number of false positives compared to the number of false negatives. This is required when using models where the cost of one error outweighs the cost of other types of errors. Two diagnostic tools that help in the interpretation of probabilistic forecast for binary (two-class) classification predictive modeling problems are ROC Curves and Precision-Recall curves. In this tutorial, you will discover ROC Curves, Precision-Recall Curves, and when to use each to interpret the prediction of probabilities for binary classification problems. After completing this tutorial, you will know: ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Kick-start your project with my new book Probability for Machine Learning, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples. Let’s get started.

Update Nov/2019: Improved description of no skill classifier for precision-recall curve. Update Oct/2023: Minor update on code to make it more Pythonic How and When to Use ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves for Classification in Python Photo by Giuseppe Milo, some rights reserved. Tutorial Overview This tutorial is divided into 6 parts; they are: 1. Predicting Probabilities 2. What Are ROC Curves? 3. ROC Curves and AUC in Python 4. What Are Precision-Recall Curves? 5. Precision-Recall Curves and AUC in Python 6. When to Use ROC vs. Precision-Recall Curves? Predicting Probabilities In a classification problem, we may decide to predict the class values directly. Alternately, it can be more flexible to predict the probabilities for each class instead. The reason for this is to provide the capability to choose and even calibrate the threshold for how to interpret the predicted probabilities. For example, a default might be to use a threshold of 0.5, meaning that a probability in [0.0, 0.49] is a negative outcome (0) and a probability in [0.5, 1.0] is a positive outcome (1). This threshold can be adjusted to tune the behavior of the model for a specific problem. An example would be to reduce more of one or another type of error. When making a prediction for a binary or two-class classification problem, there are two types of errors that we could make. False Positive. Predict an event when there was no event. False Negative. Predict no event when in fact there was an event. By predicting probabilities and calibrating a threshold, a balance of these two concerns can be chosen by the operator of the model. For example, in a smog prediction system, we may be far more concerned with having low false negatives than low false positives. A false negative would mean not warning about a smog day when in fact it is a high smog day, leading to health issues in the public that are unable to take precautions. A false positive means the public would take precautionary measures when they didn’t need to. A common way to compare models that predict probabilities for two-class problems is to use a ROC curve. What Are ROC Curves? A useful tool when predicting the probability of a binary outcome is the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, or ROC curve. It is a plot of the false positive rate (x-axis) versus the true positive rate (y-axis) for a number of different candidate threshold values between 0.0 and 1.0. Put another way, it plots the false alarm rate versus the hit rate. The true positive rate is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false negatives. It describes how good the model is at predicting the positive class when the actual outcome is positive. The true positive rate is also referred to as sensitivity. The false positive rate is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the sum of the number of false positives and the number of true negatives. It is also called the false alarm rate as it summarizes how often a positive class is predicted when the actual outcome is negative. 1 True Positive Rate = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 False Positive Rate = False Positives / (False Positives + True Negatives) The false positive rate is also referred to as the inverted specificity where specificity is the total number of true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and false positives. Where: The ROC curve is a useful tool for a few reasons: The curves of different models can be compared directly in general or for different thresholds. The area under the curve (AUC) can be used as a summary of the model skill. The shape of the curve contains a lot of information, including what we might care about most for a problem, the expected false positive rate, and the false negative rate. To make this clear: Smaller values on the x-axis of the plot indicate lower false positives and higher true negatives. Larger values on the y-axis of the plot indicate higher true positives and lower false negatives. If you are confused, remember, when we predict a binary outcome, it is either a correct prediction (true positive) or not (false positive). There is a tension between these options, the same with true negative and false negative. A skilful model will assign a higher probability to a randomly chosen real positive occurrence than a negative occurrence on average. This is what we mean when we say that the model has skill. Generally, skilful models are represented by curves that bow up to the top left of the plot. A no-skill classifier is one that cannot discriminate between the classes and would predict a random class or a constant class in all cases. A model with no skill is represented at the point (0.5, 0.5). A model with no skill at each threshold is represented by a diagonal line from the bottom left of the plot to the top right and has an AUC of 0.5. A model with perfect skill is represented at a point (0,1). A model with perfect skill is represented by a line that travels from the bottom left of the plot to the top left and then across the top to the top right. An operator may plot the ROC curve for the final model and choose a threshold that gives a desirable balance between the false positives and false negatives.

The function takes both the true outcomes (0,1) from the test set and the predicted probabilities for the 1 class. The function returns the false positive rates for each threshold, true positive rates for each threshold and thresholds. The AUC for the ROC can be calculated using the roc_auc_score() function. Like the roc_curve() function, the AUC function takes both the true outcomes (0,1) from the test set and the predicted probabilities for the 1 class. It returns the AUC score between 0.0 and 1.0 for no skill and perfect skill respectively. A complete example of calculating the ROC curve and ROC AUC for a Logistic Regression model on a small test problem is listed below. 1 2 3 ... # calculate roc curve fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y, probs) 1 2 3 4 ... # calculate AUC auc = roc_auc_score(y, probs) print('AUC: %.3f' % auc) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # roc curve and auc from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # generate a no skill prediction (majority class) ns_probs = [0 for _ in range(len(testy))] # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # calculate scores ns_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, ns_probs) lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs) # summarize scores print('No Skill: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (ns_auc)) print('Logistic: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (lr_auc)) # calculate roc curves ns_fpr, ns_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, ns_probs) lr_fpr, lr_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, lr_probs) # plot the roc curve for the model plt.plot(ns_fpr, ns_tpr, linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_fpr, lr_tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels Running the example prints the ROC AUC for the logistic regression model and the no skill classifier that only predicts 0 for all examples. A plot of the ROC curve for the model is also created showing that the model has skill. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. ROC Curve Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model What Are Precision-Recall Curves? There are many ways to evaluate the skill of a prediction model. An approach in the related field of information retrieval (finding documents based on queries) measures precision and recall. 35 36 37 38 39 40 plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 2 No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 Logistic: ROC AUC=0.903 These measures are also useful in applied machine learning for evaluating binary classification models. Precision is a ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and false positives. It describes how good a model is at predicting the positive class. Precision is referred to as the positive predictive value. or Recall is calculated as the ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and the false negatives. Recall is the same as sensitivity. or Reviewing both precision and recall is useful in cases where there is an imbalance in the observations between the two classes. Specifically, there are many examples of no event (class 0) and only a few examples of an event (class 1). The reason for this is that typically the large number of class 0 examples means we are less interested in the skill of the model at predicting class 0 correctly, e.g. high true negatives. Key to the calculation of precision and recall is that the calculations do not make use of the true negatives. It is only concerned with the correct prediction of the minority class, class 1. A precision-recall curve is a plot of the precision (y-axis) and the recall (x-axis) for different thresholds, much like the ROC curve. A no-skill classifier is one that cannot discriminate between the classes and would predict a random class or a constant class in all cases. The no-skill line changes based on the distribution of the positive to negative classes. It is a horizontal line with the value of the ratio of positive cases in the dataset. For a balanced dataset, this is 0.5. — The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets, 2015. A model with perfect skill is depicted as a point at (1,1). A skilful model is represented by a curve that bows towards (1,1) above the flat line of no skill. While the baseline is fixed with ROC, the baseline of [precision-recall curve] is determined by the ratio of positives (P) and negatives (N) as y = P / (P + N). For instance, we have y = 0.5 for a balanced class distribution …  1 Positive Predictive Power = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) 1 Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) 1 Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Recall == Sensitivity There are also composite scores that attempt to summarize the precision and recall; two examples include: F-Measure or F1 score: that calculates the harmonic mean of the precision and recall (harmonic mean because the precision and recall are rates). Area Under Curve: like the AUC, summarizes the integral or an approximation of the area under the precision-recall curve. In terms of model selection, F-Measure summarizes model skill for a specific probability threshold (e.g. 0.5), whereas the area under curve summarize the skill of a model across thresholds, like ROC AUC. This makes precision-recall and a plot of precision vs. recall and summary measures useful tools for binary classification problems that have an imbalance in the observations for each class. Precision-Recall Curves in Python Precision and recall can be calculated in scikit-learn. The precision and recall can be calculated for thresholds using the precision_recall_curve() function that takes the true output values and the probabilities for the positive class as input and returns the precision, recall and threshold values. The F-Measure can be calculated by calling the f1_score() function that takes the true class values and the predicted class values as arguments. The area under the precision-recall curve can be approximated by calling the auc() function and passing it the recall (x) and precision (y) values calculated for each threshold. When plotting precision and recall for each threshold as a curve, it is important that recall is provided as the x-axis and precision is provided as the y-axis. The complete example of calculating precision-recall curves for a Logistic Regression model is listed below. 1 2 3 ... # calculate precision-recall curve precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, probs) 1 2 3 ... # calculate F1 score f1 = f1_score(testy, yhat) 1 2 3 ... # calculate precision-recall AUC auc = auc(recall, precision) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # precision-recall curve and f1 from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve from sklearn.metrics import f1_score from sklearn.metrics import auc Running the example first prints the F1, area under curve (AUC) for the logistic regression model. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. The precision-recall curve plot is then created showing the precision/recall for each threshold for a logistic regression model (orange) compared to a no skill model (blue). 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # predict class values yhat = model.predict(testX) lr_precision, lr_recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(testy, lr_probs) lr_f1, lr_auc = f1_score(testy, yhat), auc(lr_recall, lr_precision) # summarize scores print('Logistic: f1=%.3f auc=%.3f' % (lr_f1, lr_auc)) # plot the precision-recall curves no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) plt.plot([0, 1], [no_skill, no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_recall, lr_precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('Recall') plt.ylabel('Precision') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 Logistic: f1=0.841 auc=0.898 Precision-Recall Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model When to Use ROC vs. Precision-Recall Curves? Generally, the use of ROC curves and precision-recall curves are as follows: ROC curves should be used when there are roughly equal numbers of observations for each class. Precision-Recall curves should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance. The reason for this recommendation is that ROC curves present an optimistic picture of the model on datasets with a class imbalance. — The Relationship Between Precision-Recall and ROC Curves, 2006. Some go further and suggest that using a ROC curve with an imbalanced dataset might be deceptive and lead to incorrect interpretations of the model skill. However, ROC curves can present an overly optimistic view of an algorithm’s performance if there is a large skew in the class distribution. […] Precision-Recall (PR) curves, often used in Information Retrieval , have been cited as an alternative to ROC curves for tasks with a large skew in the class distribution.  — The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets, 2015. The main reason for this optimistic picture is because of the use of true negatives in the False Positive Rate in the ROC Curve and the careful avoidance of this rate in the Precision-Recall curve. — ROC Graphs: Notes and Practical Considerations for Data Mining Researchers, 2003. We can make this concrete with a short example. Below is the same ROC Curve example with a modified problem where there is a ratio of about 100:1 ratio of class=0 to class=1 observations (specifically Class0=985, Class1=15). […] the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. [Precision-recall curve] plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions  If the proportion of positive to negative instances changes in a test set, the ROC curves will not change. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, lift and F scores use values from both columns of the confusion matrix. As a class distribution changes these measures will change as well, even if the fundamental classifier performance does not. ROC graphs are based upon TP rate and FP rate, in which each dimension is a strict columnar ratio, so do not depend on class distributions.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # roc curve and auc on an imbalanced dataset from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, weights=[0.99,0.01], random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # generate a no skill prediction (majority class) ns_probs = [0 for _ in range(len(testy))] # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # calculate scores ns_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, ns_probs) lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs) # summarize scores print('No Skill: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (ns_auc)) print('Logistic: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (lr_auc)) # calculate roc curves Running the example suggests that the model has skill. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. Indeed, it has skill, but all of that skill is measured as making correct true negative predictions and there are a lot of negative predictions to make. If you review the predictions, you will see that the model predicts the majority class (class 0) in all cases on the test set. The score is very misleading.

Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. We can see that the model is penalized for predicting the majority class in all cases. The scores show that the model that looked good according to the ROC Curve is in fact barely skillful when considered using using precision and recall that focus on the positive class. The plot of the precision-recall curve highlights that the model is just barely above the no skill line for most thresholds. This is possible because the model predicts probabilities and is uncertain about some cases. These get exposed through the different thresholds evaluated in the construction of the curve, flipping some class 0 to class 1, offering some precision but very low recall. 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 lr_f1, lr_auc = f1_score(testy, yhat), auc(lr_recall, lr_precision) # summarize scores print('Logistic: f1=%.3f auc=%.3f' % (lr_f1, lr_auc)) # plot the precision-recall curves no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) plt.plot([0, 1], [no_skill, no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_recall, lr_precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('Recall') plt.ylabel('Precision') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 Logistic: f1=0.000 auc=0.054 Precision-Recall Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model for am Imbalanced Dataset Further Reading This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper.

Summary In this tutorial, you discovered ROC Curves, Precision-Recall Curves, and when to use each to interpret the prediction of probabilities for binary classification problems. Specifically, you learned: ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Do you have any questions?

Nevertheless, many machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting a probability or scoring of class membership, and this must be interpreted before it can be mapped to a crisp class label. This is achieved by using a threshold, such as 0.5, where all values equal or greater than the threshold are mapped to one class and all other values are mapped to another class. For those classification problems that have a severe class imbalance, the default threshold can result in poor performance. As such, a simple and straightforward approach to improving the performance of a classifier that predicts probabilities on an imbalanced classification problem is to tune the threshold used to map probabilities to class labels. In some cases, such as when using ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves, the best or optimal threshold for the classifier can be calculated directly. In other cases, it is possible to use a grid search to tune the threshold and locate the optimal value. In this tutorial, you will discover how to tune the optimal threshold when converting probabilities to crisp class labels for imbalanced classification. After completing this tutorial, you will know: The default threshold for interpreting probabilities to class labels is 0.5, and tuning this hyperparameter is called threshold moving. How to calculate the optimal threshold for the ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve directly. How to manually search threshold values for a chosen model and model evaluation metric.

A Gentle Introduction to Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification Photo by Bruna cs, some rights reserved. Tutorial Overview This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are: 1. Converting Probabilities to Class Labels 2. Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification 3. Optimal Threshold for ROC Curve 4. Optimal Threshold for Precision-Recall Curve 5. Optimal Threshold Tuning Converting Probabilities to Class Labels × Many machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting a probability or a scoring of class membership. This is useful generally as it provides a measure of the certainty or uncertainty of a prediction. It also provides additional granularity over just predicting the class label that can be interpreted. Some classification tasks require a crisp class label prediction. This means that even though a probability or scoring of class membership is predicted, it must be converted into a crisp class label. The decision for converting a predicted probability or scoring into a class label is governed by a parameter referred to as the “decision threshold,” “discrimination threshold,” or simply the “threshold.” The default value for the threshold is 0.5 for normalized predicted probabilities or scores in the range between 0 or 1. For example, on a binary classification problem with class labels 0 and 1, normalized predicted probabilities and a threshold of 0.5, then values less than the threshold of 0.5 are assigned to class 0 and values greater than or equal to 0.5 are assigned to class 1. Prediction < 0.5 = Class 0 Prediction >= 0.5 = Class 1 The problem is that the default threshold may not represent an optimal interpretation of the predicted probabilities. This might be the case for a number of reasons, such as: The predicted probabilities are not calibrated, e.g. those predicted by an SVM or decision tree. The metric used to train the model is different from the metric used to evaluate a final model. The class distribution is severely skewed. The cost of one type of misclassification is more important than another type of misclassification. Worse still, some or all of these reasons may occur at the same time, such as the use of a neural network model with uncalibrated predicted probabilities on an imbalanced classification problem. As such, there is often the need to change the default decision threshold when interpreting the predictions of a model. — Page 53, Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets, 2018.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification There are many techniques that may be used to address an imbalanced classification problem, such as resampling the training dataset and developing customized version of machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, perhaps the simplest approach to handle a severe class imbalance is to change the decision threshold. Although simple and very effective, this technique is often overlooked by practitioners and research academics alike as was noted by Foster Provost in his 2000 article titled “Machine Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets.” — Machine Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets 101, 2000. There are many reasons to choose an alternative to the default decision threshold. For example, you may use ROC curves to analyze the predicted probabilities of a model and ROC AUC scores to compare and select a model, although you require crisp class labels from your model. How do you choose the threshold on the ROC Curve that results in the best balance between the true positive rate and the false positive rate? Alternately, you may use precision-recall curves to analyze the predicted probabilities of a model, precision-recall AUC to compare and select models, and require crisp class labels as predictions. How do you choose the threshold on the Precision-Recall Curve that results in the best balance between precision and recall? You may use a probability-based metric to train, evaluate, and compare models like log loss (crossentropy) but require crisp class labels to be predicted. How do you choose the optimal threshold from predicted probabilities more generally? Finally, you may have different costs associated with false positive and false negative misclassification, a so-called cost matrix, but wish to use and evaluate cost-insensitive models and later evaluate their predictions use a cost-sensitive measure. How do you choose a threshold that finds the best trade-off for predictions using the cost matrix? The bottom line is that when studying problems with imbalanced data, using the classifiers produced by standard machine learning algorithms without adjusting the output threshold may well be a critical mistake.  × — Page 67, Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets, 2018. The answer to these questions is to search a range of threshold values in order to find the best threshold. In some cases, the optimal threshold can be calculated directly. Tuning or shifting the decision threshold in order to accommodate the broader requirements of the classification problem is generally referred to as “threshold-moving,” “threshold-tuning,” or simply “thresholding.” — Pages 72, Imbalanced Learning: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications, 2013. The process involves first fitting the model on a training dataset and making predictions on a test dataset. The predictions are in the form of normalized probabilities or scores that are transformed into normalized probabilities. Different threshold values are then tried and the resulting crisp labels are evaluated using a chosen evaluation metric. The threshold that achieves the best evaluation metric is then adopted for the model when making predictions on new data in the future. We can summarize this procedure below. 1. Fit Model on the Training Dataset. 2. Predict Probabilities on the Test Dataset. 3. For each threshold in Thresholds: 3a. Convert probabilities to Class Labels using the threshold. 3b. Evaluate Class Labels. 3c. If Score is Better than Best Score. 3ci. Adopt Threshold. 4. Use Adopted Threshold When Making Class Predictions on New Data. Although simple, there are a few different approaches to implementing threshold-moving depending on your circumstance. We will take a look at some of the most common examples in the following sections. Popular way of training a cost-sensitive classifier without a known cost matrix is to put emphasis on modifying the classification outputs when predictions are being made on new data. This is usually done by setting a threshold on the positive class, below which the negative one is being predicted. The value of this threshold is optimized using a validation set and thus the cost matrix can be learned from training data.  It has been stated that trying other methods, such as sampling, without trying by simply setting the threshold may be misleading. The threshold-moving method uses the original training set to train [a model] and then moves the decision threshold such that the minority class examples are easier to be predicted correctly.  × Optimal Threshold for ROC Curve A ROC curve is a diagnostic plot that evaluates a set of probability predictions made by a model on a test dataset. A set of different thresholds are used to interpret the true positive rate and the false positive rate of the predictions on the positive (minority) class, and the scores are plotted in a line of increasing thresholds to create a curve. The false-positive rate is plotted on the x-axis and the true positive rate is plotted on the y-axis and the plot is referred to as the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, or ROC curve. A diagonal line on the plot from the bottom-left to top-right indicates the “curve” for a no-skill classifier (predicts the majority class in all cases), and a point in the top left of the plot indicates a model with perfect skill. The curve is useful to understand the trade-off in the true-positive rate and false-positive rate for different thresholds. The area under the ROC Curve, so-called ROC AUC, provides a single number to summarize the performance of a model in terms of its ROC Curve with a value between 0.5 (no-skill) and 1.0 (perfect skill). The ROC Curve is a useful diagnostic tool for understanding the trade-off for different thresholds and the ROC AUC provides a useful number for comparing models based on their general capabilities. If crisp class labels are required from a model under such an analysis, then an optimal threshold is required. This would be a threshold on the curve that is closest to the top-left of the plot. Thankfully, there are principled ways of locating this point. First, let’s fit a model and calculate a ROC Curve. We can use the make_classification() function to create a synthetic binary classification problem with 10,000 examples (rows), 99 percent of which belong to the majority class and 1 percent belong to the minority class. We can then split the dataset using the train_test_split() function and use half for the training set and half for the test set. We can then fit a LogisticRegression model and use it to make probability predictions on the test set and keep only the probability predictions for the minority class. 1 2 3 4 ... # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) 1 2 3 ... # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratify 1 2 3 4 ... # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) × We can then use the roc_auc_score() function to calculate the true-positive rate and false-positive rate for the predictions using a set of thresholds that can then be used to create a ROC Curve plot. We can tie this all together, defining the dataset, fitting the model, and creating the ROC Curve plot. The complete example is listed below. Running the example fits a logistic regression model on the training dataset then evaluates it using a range of thresholds on the test set, creating the ROC Curve We can see that there are a number of points or thresholds close to the top-left of the plot. Which is the threshold that is optimal? 5 6 7 8 # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] 1 2 3 ... # calculate scores lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 # roc curve for logistic regression model from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from matplotlib import pyplot # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate roc curves fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, yhat) # plot the roc curve for the model pyplot.plot([0,1], [0,1], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') pyplot.plot(fpr, tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels pyplot.xlabel('False Positive Rate') pyplot.ylabel('True Positive Rate') pyplot.legend() # show the plot pyplot.show() × ROC Curve Line Plot for Logistic Regression Model for Imbalanced Classification There are many ways we could locate the threshold with the optimal balance between false positive and true positive rates. Firstly, the true positive rate is called the Sensitivity. The inverse of the false-positive rate is called the Specificity. Sensitivity = TruePositive / (TruePositive + FalseNegative) Specificity = TrueNegative / (FalsePositive + TrueNegative) Where: Sensitivity = True Positive Rate Specificity = 1 – False Positive Rate The Geometric Mean or G-Mean is a metric for imbalanced classification that, if optimized, will seek a balance between the sensitivity and the specificity. G-Mean = sqrt(Sensitivity * Specificity) One approach would be to test the model with each threshold returned from the call roc_auc_score() and select the threshold with the largest G-Mean value. × Given that we have already calculated the Sensitivity (TPR) and the complement to the Specificity when we calculated the ROC Curve, we can calculate the G-Mean for each threshold directly. Once calculated, we can locate the index for the largest G-mean score and use that index to determine which threshold value to use. We can also re-draw the ROC Curve and highlight this point. The complete example is listed below. Running the example first locates the optimal threshold and reports this threshold and the G-Mean score. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. 1 2 3 ... # calculate the g-mean for each threshold gmeans = sqrt(tpr * (1-fpr)) 1 2 3 4 ... # locate the index of the largest g-mean ix = argmax(gmeans) print('Best Threshold=%f, G-Mean=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], gmeans[ix])) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # roc curve for logistic regression model with optimal threshold from numpy import sqrt from numpy import argmax from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from matplotlib import pyplot # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate roc curves fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, yhat) # calculate the g-mean for each threshold gmeans = sqrt(tpr * (1-fpr)) # locate the index of the largest g-mean ix = argmax(gmeans) print('Best Threshold=%f, G-Mean=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], gmeans[ix])) # plot the roc curve for the model pyplot.plot([0,1], [0,1], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') pyplot.plot(fpr, tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') pyplot.scatter(fpr[ix], tpr[ix], marker='o', color='black', label='Best') # axis labels pyplot.xlabel('False Positive Rate') pyplot.ylabel('True Positive Rate') pyplot.legend() # show the plot pyplot.show() × In this case, we can see that the optimal threshold is about 0.016153. The threshold is then used to locate the true and false positive rates, then this point is drawn on the ROC Curve. We can see that the point for the optimal threshold is a large black dot and it appears to be closest to the top-left of the plot. ROC Curve Line Plot for Logistic Regression Model for Imbalanced Classification With the Optimal Threshold It turns out there is a much faster way to get the same result, called the Youden’s J statistic. The statistic is calculated as: J = Sensitivity + Specificity – 1 Given that we have Sensitivity (TPR) and the complement of the specificity (FPR), we can calculate it as: J = Sensitivity + (1 – FalsePositiveRate) – 1 Which we can restate as: J = TruePositiveRate – FalsePositiveRate 1 Best Threshold=0.016153, G-Mean=0.933 × We can then choose the threshold with the largest J statistic value. For example: Plugging this in, the complete example is listed below. We can see that this simpler approach calculates the optimal statistic directly. Optimal Threshold for Precision-Recall Curve Unlike the ROC Curve, a precision-recall curve focuses on the performance of a classifier on the positive (minority class) only. Precision is the ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and false positives. It describes how good a model is at predicting the positive class. Recall is calculated as the ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and the false negatives. Recall is the same as sensitivity. A precision-recall curve is calculated by creating crisp class labels for probability predictions across a set of thresholds and calculating the precision and recall for each threshold. A line plot is created for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ... # calculate roc curves fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, yhat) # get the best threshold J = tpr - fpr ix = argmax(J) best_thresh = thresholds[ix] print('Best Threshold=%f' % (best_thresh)) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 # roc curve for logistic regression model with optimal threshold from numpy import argmax from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate roc curves fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, yhat) # get the best threshold J = tpr - fpr ix = argmax(J) best_thresh = thresholds[ix] print('Best Threshold=%f' % (best_thresh)) 1 Best Threshold=0.016153 × the thresholds in ascending order with recall on the x-axis and precision on the y-axis. A no-skill model is represented by a horizontal line with a precision that is the ratio of positive examples in the dataset (e.g. TP / (TP + TN)), or 0.01 on our synthetic dataset. perfect skill classifier has full precision and recall with a dot in the top-right corner. We can use the same model and dataset from the previous section and evaluate the probability predictions for a logistic regression model using a precision-recall curve. The precision_recall_curve() function can be used to calculate the curve, returning the precision and recall scores for each threshold as well as the thresholds used. Tying this together, the complete example of calculating a precision-recall curve for a logistic regression on an imbalanced classification problem is listed below. Running the example calculates the precision and recall for each threshold and creates a precisionrecall plot showing that the model has some skill across a range of thresholds on this dataset. If we required crisp class labels from this model, which threshold would achieve the best result? 1 2 3 ... # calculate pr-curve precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, yhat) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 # pr curve for logistic regression model from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve from matplotlib import pyplot # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate pr-curve precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, yhat) # plot the roc curve for the model no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) pyplot.plot([0,1], [no_skill,no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') pyplot.plot(recall, precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels pyplot.xlabel('Recall') pyplot.ylabel('Precision') pyplot.legend() # show the plot pyplot.show() × Precision-Recall Curve Line Plot for Logistic Regression Model for Imbalanced Classification If we are interested in a threshold that results in the best balance of precision and recall, then this is the same as optimizing the F-measure that summarizes the harmonic mean of both measures. F-Measure = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) As in the previous section, the naive approach to finding the optimal threshold would be to calculate the F-measure for each threshold. We can achieve the same effect by converting the precision and recall measures to F-measure directly; for example: We can then plot the point on the precision-recall curve. The complete example is listed below. 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... # convert to f score fscore = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall) # locate the index of the largest f score ix = argmax(fscore) print('Best Threshold=%f, F-Score=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], fscore[ix])) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # optimal threshold for precision-recall curve with logistic regression model from numpy import argmax from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve from matplotlib import pyplot × Running the example first calculates the F-measure for each threshold, then locates the score and threshold with the largest value. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. In this case, we can see that the best F-measure was 0.756 achieved with a threshold of about 0.25. The precision-recall curve is plotted, and this time the threshold with the optimal F-measure is plotted with a larger black dot. This threshold could then be used when making probability predictions in the future that must be converted from probabilities to crisp class labels. 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only yhat = yhat[:, 1] # calculate roc curves precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, yhat) # convert to f score fscore = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall) # locate the index of the largest f score ix = argmax(fscore) print('Best Threshold=%f, F-Score=%.3f' % (thresholds[ix], fscore[ix])) # plot the roc curve for the model no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) pyplot.plot([0,1], [no_skill,no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') pyplot.plot(recall, precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') pyplot.scatter(recall[ix], precision[ix], marker='o', color='black', label='Best') # axis labels pyplot.xlabel('Recall') pyplot.ylabel('Precision') pyplot.legend() # show the plot pyplot.show() 1 Best Threshold=0.256036, F-Score=0.756 × Precision-Recall Curve Line Plot for Logistic Regression Model With Optimal Threshold Optimal Threshold Tuning Sometimes, we simply have a model and we wish to know the best threshold directly. In this case, we can define a set of thresholds and then evaluate predicted probabilities under each in order to find and select the optimal threshold. We can demonstrate this with a worked example. First, we can fit a logistic regression model on our synthetic classification problem, then predict class labels and evaluate them using the F-Measure, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. This will use the default threshold of 0.5 when interpreting the probabilities predicted by the logistic regression model. The complete example is listed below. 1 # logistic regression for imbalanced classification × Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. Running the example, we can see that the model achieved an F-Measure of about 0.70 on the test dataset. Now we can use the same model on the same dataset and instead of predicting class labels directly, we can predict probabilities. We only require the probabilities for the positive class. Next, we can then define a set of thresholds to evaluate the probabilities. In this case, we will test all thresholds between 0.0 and 1.0 with a step size of 0.001, that is, we will test 0.0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, and so on to 0.999. Next, we need a way of using a single threshold to interpret the predicted probabilities. This can be achieved by mapping all values equal to or greater than the threshold to 1 and all values less than the threshold to 0. We will define a to_labels() function to do this that will take the probabilities and threshold as an argument and return an array of integers in {0, 1}. We can then call this function for each threshold and evaluate the resulting labels using the f1_score(). 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import f1_score # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict labels yhat = model.predict(testX) # evaluate the model score = f1_score(testy, yhat) print('F-Score: %.5f' % score) 1 F-Score: 0.70130 1 2 3 ... # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) 1 2 3 ... # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only probs = yhat[:, 1] 1 2 3 ... # define thresholds thresholds = arange(0, 1, 0.001) 1 2 3 # apply threshold to positive probabilities to create labels def to_labels(pos_probs, threshold): return (pos_probs >= threshold).astype('int') × We can do this in a single line, as follows: We now have an array of scores that evaluate each threshold in our array of thresholds. All we need to do now is locate the array index that has the largest score (best F-Measure) and we will have the optimal threshold and its evaluation. Tying this all together, the complete example of tuning the threshold for the logistic regression model on the synthetic imbalanced classification dataset is listed below. Running the example reports the optimal threshold as 0.251 (compared to the default of 0.5) that achieves an F-Measure of about 0.75 (compared to 0.70). Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. You can use this example as a template when tuning the threshold on your own problem, allowing you to substitute your own model, metric, and even resolution of thresholds that you want to evaluate. 1 2 3 ... # evaluate each threshold scores = [f1_score(testy, to_labels(probs, t)) for t in thresholds] 1 2 3 4 ... # get best threshold ix = argmax(scores) print('Threshold=%.3f, F-Score=%.5f' % (thresholds[ix], scores[ix])) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 # search thresholds for imbalanced classification from numpy import arange from numpy import argmax from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import f1_score # apply threshold to positive probabilities to create labels def to_labels(pos_probs, threshold): return (pos_probs >= threshold).astype('int') # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratif # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities yhat = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only probs = yhat[:, 1] # define thresholds thresholds = arange(0, 1, 0.001) # evaluate each threshold scores = [f1_score(testy, to_labels(probs, t)) for t in thresholds] # get best threshold ix = argmax(scores) print('Threshold=%.3f, F-Score=%.5f' % (thresholds[ix], scores[ix])) × Further Reading This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper.

Here, assume n di↵erent classifiers, {h1, h2, ..., hm} where hi(x)=ˆyi. In lecture 2, (Nearest Neighbor Methods) we learned that the majority (or plurality) voting can simply be expressed as the mode: yˆf = mode{h1(x), h2(x), ...hn(x)}. (1) The following illustration demonstrates why majority voting can be e↵ective (under certain assumptions). • Given are n independent classifiers (h1, ..., hn) with a base error rate ✏. • Here, independent means that the errors are uncorrelated • Assume a binary classification task Assuming the error rate is better than random guessing (i.e., lower than 0.5 for binary classification), 8✏i 2 {✏1, ✏2, ..., ✏n}, ✏i < 0.5, (2) the error of the ensemble can be computed using a binomial probability distribution since the ensemble makes a wrong prediction if more than 50% of the n classifiers make a wrong prediction. The probability that we make a wrong prediction via the ensemble if k classifiers predict the same class label (where k > dn/2e because of majority voting ) is then P(k) = ✓n k ◆ ✏ k(1 ✏) nk, (3) where n k is the binomial coecient ✓n k ◆ = n! (n k)!k! . (4) Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 3 However, we need to consider all cases k 2 {dn/2e, ..., n} (cumulative prob. distribution) to compute the ensemble error ✏ens = Xn k ✓n k ◆ ✏ k(1 ✏) nk. (5) Consider the following example with n=11 and ✏ = 0.25, where the ensemble error decreases substantially compared to the error rate of the individual models: ✏ens = X 11 k=6 ✓11 k ◆ 0.25k(1 0.25)11k = 0.034. (6) Figure 3: error-rate 7.3 Soft Majority Voting For well calibrated classifiers we can also use the predicted class membership probabilities to infer the class label, yˆ = arg maxj Xn i=1 wipi,j , (7) where pi,j is the predicted class membership probability for class label j by the ith classifier. Here wi is an optional weighting parameter. If we set wi = 1/n, 8wi 2 {w1, ..., wn} then all probabilities are weighted uniformly. To illustrate this, let us assume we have a binary classification problem with class labels j 2 {0, 1} and an ensemble of three classifiers hi(i 2 {1, 2, 3}): h1(x) ! [0.9, 0.1], h2(x) ! [0.8, 0.2], h3(x) ! [0.4, 0.6]. (8) We can then calculate the individual class membership probabilities as follows: Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 4 p(j = 0|x)=0.2·0.9+0.2·0.8+0.6·0.4=0.58, p(j = 1|x)=0.2·0.1+0.2·0.2+0.6·0.6=0.42. (9) The predicted class label is then yˆ = arg maxj ⇢ p(j = 0|x), p(j = 1|x) = 0. (10) 7.4 Bagging • Bagging relies on a concept similar to majority voting but uses the same learning algorithm (typically a decision tree algorithm) to fit models on di↵erent subsets of the training data (bootstrap samples). • Bagging can improve the accuracy of unstable models that tend to overfit2.

Low Variance (Precise) High Variance (Not Precise) Low Bias (Accurate) High Bias (Not Accurate) Figure 9: Bias and variance intuition. • One can say that individual, unpruned decision tree “have high variance” (in this context, the individual decision trees “tend to overfit”); a bagging model has a lower Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 7 variance than the individual trees and is less prone to overfitting – again, bias and variance decomposition will be discussed in more detail next lecture. 7.6 Boosting • There are two broad categories of boosting: Adaptive boosting and gradient boosting. • Adaptive and gradient boosting rely on the same concept of boosting “weak learners” (such as decision tree stumps) to “strong learners.” • Boosting is an iterative process, where the training set is reweighted, at each iteration, based on mistakes a weak leaner made (i.e., misclassifications); the two approaches, adaptive and gradient boosting, di↵er mainly regarding how the weights are updated and how the classifiers are combined. • Since we have not discussed gradient-based optimization, in this lecture, we will focus on adaptive boosting. • In particular, we will focus on AdaBoost as initially described by Freund and Schapire in 19973. • If you are familiar with gradient-based optimization and interested in gradient boosting, I recommend reading Friedman’s work4 and the more recent paper on XGBoost5, which is essentially a computationally ecient implementation of the original gradient boost algorithm. 37 General Boosting Training Sample Weighted Training Sample Weighted Training Sample h1(x) h2(x) hm(x) hm(x) = sign ( m ∑ j=1 wj hj (x) ) hm(x) = arg maxi ( m ∑ j=1 wj I[hj (x) = i] ) for h(x) {1,1} or for h(x) = i, i {1,...,n} Figure 10: A general outline of the boosting procedure for n iterations.

L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 9 7.7 Random Forests 7.7.1 Overview • Random forests are among the most widely used machine learning algorithm, probably due to their relatively good performance “out of the box” and ease of use (not much tuning required to get good results). • In the context of bagging, random forests are relatively easy to understand conceptually: the random forest algorithm can be understood as bagging with decision trees, but instead of growing the decision trees by basing the splitting criterion on the complete feature set, we use random feature subsets. • To summarize, in random forests, we fit decision trees on di↵erent bootstrap samples, and in addition, for each decision tree, we select a random subset of features at each node to decide upon the optimal split; while the size of the feature subset to consider at each node is a hyperparameter that we can tune, a “rule-of-thumb” suggestion is to use NumFeatures = log2 m + 1. 7.7.2 Does random forest select a subset of features for every tree or every node? Earlier random decision forests by Tin Kam Ho6 used the “random subspace method,” where each tree got a random subset of features. “The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space.” – Tin Kam Ho However, a few years later, Leo Breiman described the procedure of selecting di↵erent subsets of features for each node (while a tree was given the full set of features) — Leo Breiman’s formulation has become the “trademark” random forest algorithm that we typically refer to these days when we speak of “random forest7:” “. . . random forest with random features is formed by selecting at random, at each node, a small group of input variables to split on.” 7.7.3 Generalization Error • The reason why random forests may work better in practice than a regular bagging model, for example, may be explained by the additional randomization that further diversifies the individual trees (i.e., decorrelates them). • In Breiman’s random forest paper, the upper bound of the generalization error is given as PE  ⇢¯ · (1 s2) s2 , (14) where ¯⇢ is the average correlation among trees and s measures the strength of the trees as classifiers. I.e., the average predictive performance concerning the classifiers’ margin. We 6Tin Kam Ho. “Random decision forests”. In: Document analysis and recognition, 1995., proceedings of the third international conference on. Vol. 1. IEEE. 1995, pp. 278–282. 7Leo Breiman. “Random forests”. In: Machine learning 45.1 (2001), pp. 5–32. Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18. L01: Intro to Machine Learning Page 10 do not need to get into the details of how ¯p and s are calculated to get an intuition for their relationship. I.e., the lower correlation, the lower the error. Similarly, the higher the strength of the ensemble or trees, the lower the error. So, randomization of the feature subspaces may decrease the “strength” of the individual trees, but at the same time, it reduces the correlation of the trees. Then, compared to bagging, random forests may be at the sweet spot where the correlation and strength decreases result in a better net result. 7.7.4 Feature Importance via Random Forests While random forests are naturally less interpretable than individual decision trees, where we can trace a decision via a rule sets, it is possible (and common) to compute the so-called “feature importance” of the inputs – that means, we can infer how important a feature is for the overall prediction. However, this is a topic that will be discussed later in the “Feature Selection” lecture. 7.7.5 Extremely Randomized Trees (ExtraTrees) • A few years after random forests were developed, an even “more random” procedure was developed called Extremely Randomized Trees8. • Compared to regular random forests, the ExtraTrees algorithm selects a random feature at each decision tree nodes for splitting; hence, it is very fast because there is no information gain computation and feature comparison step. • Intuitively, one might say that ExtraTrees have another “random component” (compared to random forests) to further reduce the correlation among trees – however, it might decrease the strength of the individual trees (if you think back of the generalization error bound discussed in the previous section on random forests). 7.8 Stacking 7.8.1 Overview • Stacking9 is a special case of ensembling where we combine an ensemble of models through a so-called meta-classifier. • In general, in stacking, we have “base learners” that learn from the initial training set, and the resulting models then make predictions that serve as input features to a “meta-learner.” 8geurts2006extremel. 9wolpert1992stacked.

Note that here, in contrast to majority voting, we have a meta-classifier that takes the predictions of the models produced by the base learners (h1...hn) as inputs. The problem with the naive stacking algorithm outlined above is that it has a high tendency to su↵er from extensive overfitting. The reason for a potentially high degree of overfitting is that if the base learners overfit, then the meta-classifier heavily relies on these predictions made by the base-classifiers. A better alternative would be to use stacking with k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation. Sebastian Raschka STAT479 FS18.

Classification as the task of mapping an input attribute set x into its class label y. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of classification, describes some of the key issues such as model overfitting, and presents methods for evaluating and comparing the performance of a classification technique. While it focuses mainly on a technique known as decision tree induction, most of the discussion in this chapter is also applicable to other classification techniques, many of which are covered in Chapter 5. 4.1 Preliminaries The input data for a classification task is a collection of records. Each record, also known as an instance or example, is characterized by a tuple (x, y), where x is the attribute set and y is a special attribute, designated as the class label (also known as category or target attribute). Table 4.1 shows a sample data set used for classifying vertebrates into one of the following categories: mammal, bird, fish, reptile, or amphibian. The attribute set includes properties of a vertebrate such as its body temperature, skin cover, method of reproduction, ability to fly, and ability to live in water. Although the attributes presented in Table 4.1 are mostly discrete, the attribute set can also contain continuous features. The class label, on the other hand, must be a discrete attribute. This is a key characteristic that distinguishes classification from regression, a predictive modeling task in which y is a continuous attribute. Regression techniques are covered in Appendix D. Definition 4.1 (Classification). Classification is the task of learning a target function f that maps each attribute set x to one of the predefined class labels y. The target function is also known informally as a classification model. A classification model is useful for the following purposes. Descriptive Modeling A classification model can serve as an explanatory tool to distinguish between objects of different classes. For example, it would be useful—for both biologists and others—to have a descriptive model that 4.1 Preliminaries 147 Table 4.1. The vertebrate data set.

Predictive Modeling A classification model can also be used to predict the class label of unknown records. As shown in Figure 4.2, a classification model can be treated as a black box that automatically assigns a class label when presented with the attribute set of an unknown record. Suppose we are given the following characteristics of a creature known as a gila monster: Name Body Skin Gives Aquatic Aerial Has Hiber- Class Temperature Cover Birth Creature Creature Legs nates Label gila monster cold-blooded scales no no no yes yes ? We can use a classification model built from the data set shown in Table 4.1 to determine the class to which the creature belongs. Classification techniques are most suited for predicting or describing data sets with binary or nominal categories. They are less effective for ordinal categories (e.g., to classify a person as a member of high-, medium-, or lowincome group) because they do not consider the implicit order among the categories. Other forms of relationships, such as the subclass–superclass relationships among categories (e.g., humans and apes are primates, which in 148 Chapter 4 Classification turn, is a subclass of mammals) are also ignored. The remainder of this chapter focuses only on binary or nominal class labels. 4.2 General Approach to Solving a Classification Problem A classification technique (or classifier) is a systematic approach to building classification models from an input data set. Examples include decision tree classifiers, rule-based classifiers, neural networks, support vector machines, and na¨ıve Bayes classifiers. Each technique employs a learning algorithm to identify a model that best fits the relationship between the attribute set and class label of the input data. The model generated by a learning algorithm should both fit the input data well and correctly predict the class labels of records it has never seen before. Therefore, a key objective of the learning algorithm is to build models with good generalization capability; i.e., models that accurately predict the class labels of previously unknown records. Figure 4.3 shows a general approach for solving classification problems. First, a training set consisting of records whose class labels are known must Induction Deduction Model Learn Model Apply Model Learning Algorithm Training Set Test Set Tid Class Attrib1 Attrib2 Attrib3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Yes No No Yes No No Yes No No No No No No No Yes No No Yes No Yes 125K 100K 70K 120K 95K 60K 220K 85K 75K 90K Large Medium Small Medium Large Medium Large Small Medium Small Tid Class Attrib1 Attrib2 Attrib3 11 12 13 14 15 No Yes Yes No No ? ? ? ? ? 55K 80K 110K 95K 67K Small Medium Large Small Large Figure 4.3.

Predicted Class Class = 1 Class = 0 Actual Class = 1 f11 f10 Class Class = 0 f01 f00 be provided. The training set is used to build a classification model, which is subsequently applied to the test set, which consists of records with unknown class labels. Evaluation of the performance of a classification model is based on the counts of test records correctly and incorrectly predicted by the model. These counts are tabulated in a table known as a confusion matrix. Table 4.2 depicts the confusion matrix for a binary classification problem. Each entry fij in this table denotes the number of records from class i predicted to be of class j. For instance, f01 is the number of records from class 0 incorrectly predicted as class 1. Based on the entries in the confusion matrix, the total number of correct predictions made by the model is (f11 + f00) and the total number of incorrect predictions is (f10 + f01). Although a confusion matrix provides the information needed to determine how well a classification model performs, summarizing this information with a single number would make it more convenient to compare the performance of different models. This can be done using a performance metric such as accuracy, which is defined as follows: Accuracy = Number of correct predictions Total number of predictions = f11 + f00 f11 + f10 + f01 + f00 . (4.1) Equivalently, the performance of a model can be expressed in terms of its error rate, which is given by the following equation: Error rate = Number of wrong predictions Total number of predictions = f10 + f01 f11 + f10 + f01 + f00 . (4.2) Most classification algorithms seek models that attain the highest accuracy, or equivalently, the lowest error rate when applied to the test set. We will revisit the topic of model evaluation in Section 4.5. 150 Chapter 4 Classification 4.3 Decision Tree Induction This section introduces a decision tree classifier, which is a simple yet widely used classification technique. 4.3.1 How a Decision Tree Works To illustrate how classification with a decision tree works, consider a simpler version of the vertebrate classification problem described in the previous section. Instead of classifying the vertebrates into five distinct groups of species, we assign them to two categories: mammals and non-mammals. Suppose a new species is discovered by scientists. How can we tell whether it is a mammal or a non-mammal? One approach is to pose a series of questions about the characteristics of the species. The first question we may ask is whether the species is cold- or warm-blooded. If it is cold-blooded, then it is definitely not a mammal. Otherwise, it is either a bird or a mammal. In the latter case, we need to ask a follow-up question: Do the females of the species give birth to their young? Those that do give birth are definitely mammals, while those that do not are likely to be non-mammals (with the exception of egg-laying mammals such as the platypus and spiny anteater). The previous example illustrates how we can solve a classification problem by asking a series of carefully crafted questions about the attributes of the test record. Each time we receive an answer, a follow-up question is asked until we reach a conclusion about the class label of the record. The series of questions and their possible answers can be organized in the form of a decision tree, which is a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes and directed edges. Figure 4.4 shows the decision tree for the mammal classification problem. The tree has three types of nodes: • A root node that has no incoming edges and zero or more outgoing edges. • Internal nodes, each of which has exactly one incoming edge and two or more outgoing edges. • Leaf or terminal nodes, each of which has exactly one incoming edge and no outgoing edges. In a decision tree, each leaf node is assigned a class label. The nonterminal nodes, which include the root and other internal nodes, contain attribute test conditions to separate records that have different characteristics. For example, the root node shown in Figure 4.4 uses the attribute Body 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 151 Body Temperature Root node Leaf nodes Internal Warm Cold node Gives Birth Yes No Nonmammals Nonmammals Mammals Figure 4.4. A decision tree for the mammal classification problem. Temperature to separate warm-blooded from cold-blooded vertebrates. Since all cold-blooded vertebrates are non-mammals, a leaf node labeled Non-mammals is created as the right child of the root node. If the vertebrate is warm-blooded, a subsequent attribute, Gives Birth, is used to distinguish mammals from other warm-blooded creatures, which are mostly birds. Classifying a test record is straightforward once a decision tree has been constructed. Starting from the root node, we apply the test condition to the record and follow the appropriate branch based on the outcome of the test. This will lead us either to another internal node, for which a new test condition is applied, or to a leaf node. The class label associated with the leaf node is then assigned to the record. As an illustration, Figure 4.5 traces the path in the decision tree that is used to predict the class label of a flamingo. The path terminates at a leaf node labeled Non-mammals. 4.3.2 How to Build a Decision Tree In principle, there are exponentially many decision trees that can be constructed from a given set of attributes. While some of the trees are more accurate than others, finding the optimal tree is computationally infeasible because of the exponential size of the search space. Nevertheless, efficient algorithms have been developed to induce a reasonably accurate, albeit suboptimal, decision tree in a reasonable amount of time. These algorithms usually employ a greedy strategy that grows a decision tree by making a series of locally op- 152 Chapter 4 Classification Body Temperature Non- mammals Warm Cold Flamingo Warm No ... ?

The dashed lines represent the outcomes of applying various attribute test conditions on the unlabeled vertebrate. The vertebrate is eventually assigned to the Non-mammal class. timum decisions about which attribute to use for partitioning the data. One such algorithm is Hunt’s algorithm, which is the basis of many existing decision tree induction algorithms, including ID3, C4.5, and CART. This section presents a high-level discussion of Hunt’s algorithm and illustrates some of its design issues. Hunt’s Algorithm In Hunt’s algorithm, a decision tree is grown in a recursive fashion by partitioning the training records into successively purer subsets. Let Dt be the set of training records that are associated with node t and y = {y1, y2,...,yc} be the class labels. The following is a recursive definition of Hunt’s algorithm. Step 1: If all the records in Dt belong to the same class yt, then t is a leaf node labeled as yt. Step 2: If Dt contains records that belong to more than one class, an attribute test condition is selected to partition the records into smaller subsets. A child node is created for each outcome of the test condition and the records in Dt are distributed to the children based on the outcomes. The algorithm is then recursively applied to each child node. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 153 binary categorical continuous class Tid Defaulted Borrower Home Owner Marital Status Annual Income 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Yes No No Yes No No Yes No No No No No No No Yes No No Yes No Yes 125K 100K 70K 120K 95K 60K 220K 85K 75K 90K Single Married Single Married Divorced Married Divorced Single Married Single Figure 4.6. Training set for predicting borrowers who will default on loan payments. To illustrate how the algorithm works, consider the problem of predicting whether a loan applicant will repay her loan obligations or become delinquent, subsequently defaulting on her loan. A training set for this problem can be constructed by examining the records of previous borrowers. In the example shown in Figure 4.6, each record contains the personal information of a borrower along with a class label indicating whether the borrower has defaulted on loan payments. The initial tree for the classification problem contains a single node with class label Defaulted = No (see Figure 4.7(a)), which means that most of the borrowers successfully repaid their loans. The tree, however, needs to be refined since the root node contains records from both classes. The records are subsequently divided into smaller subsets based on the outcomes of the Home Owner test condition, as shown in Figure 4.7(b). The justification for choosing this attribute test condition will be discussed later. For now, we will assume that this is the best criterion for splitting the data at this point. Hunt’s algorithm is then applied recursively to each child of the root node. From the training set given in Figure 4.6, notice that all borrowers who are home owners successfully repaid their loans. The left child of the root is therefore a leaf node labeled Defaulted = No (see Figure 4.7(b)). For the right child, we need to continue applying the recursive step of Hunt’s algorithm until all the records belong to the same class. The trees resulting from each recursive step are shown in Figures 4.7(c) and (d). 154 Chapter 4 Classification Defaulted = No Yes No Home Owner Married Single, Divorced Defaulted = No Marital Status (a) (b) Defaulted = No Defaulted = No Yes No Defaulted = No Home Owner (c) (d) Defaulted = No < 80K >= 80K Defaulted = Yes Annual Income Defaulted = No Yes No Home Owner Single, Married Divorced Defaulted = Yes Defaulted = No Marital Status Figure 4.7. Hunt’s algorithm for inducing decision trees. Hunt’s algorithm will work if every combination of attribute values is present in the training data and each combination has a unique class label. These assumptions are too stringent for use in most practical situations. Additional conditions are needed to handle the following cases: 1. It is possible for some of the child nodes created in Step 2 to be empty; i.e., there are no records associated with these nodes. This can happen if none of the training records have the combination of attribute values associated with such nodes. In this case the node is declared a leaf node with the same class label as the majority class of training records associated with its parent node. 2. In Step 2, if all the records associated with Dt have identical attribute values (except for the class label), then it is not possible to split these records any further. In this case, the node is declared a leaf node with the same class label as the majority class of training records associated with this node. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 155 Design Issues of Decision Tree Induction A learning algorithm for inducing decision trees must address the following two issues. 1. How should the training records be split? Each recursive step of the tree-growing process must select an attribute test condition to divide the records into smaller subsets. To implement this step, the algorithm must provide a method for specifying the test condition for different attribute types as well as an objective measure for evaluating the goodness of each test condition. 2. How should the splitting procedure stop? A stopping condition is needed to terminate the tree-growing process. A possible strategy is to continue expanding a node until either all the records belong to the same class or all the records have identical attribute values. Although both conditions are sufficient to stop any decision tree induction algorithm, other criteria can be imposed to allow the tree-growing procedure to terminate earlier. The advantages of early termination will be discussed later in Section 4.4.5. 4.3.3 Methods for Expressing Attribute Test Conditions Decision tree induction algorithms must provide a method for expressing an attribute test condition and its corresponding outcomes for different attribute types. Binary Attributes The test condition for a binary attribute generates two potential outcomes, as shown in Figure 4.8. Body Temperature Warmblooded Coldblooded Figure 4.8. Test condition for binary attributes. 156 Chapter 4 Classification {Married} {Single, Divorced} (a) Multiway split Single Divorced Married {Single} {Married, Divorced} (b) Binary split {by grouping attribute values} {Single, Married} {Divorced} OR OR Marital Status Marital Status Marital Status Marital Status Figure 4.9. Test conditions for nominal attributes. Nominal Attributes Since a nominal attribute can have many values, its test condition can be expressed in two ways, as shown in Figure 4.9. For a multiway split (Figure 4.9(a)), the number of outcomes depends on the number of distinct values for the corresponding attribute. For example, if an attribute such as marital status has three distinct values—single, married, or divorced—its test condition will produce a three-way split. On the other hand, some decision tree algorithms, such as CART, produce only binary splits by considering all 2k−1 − 1 ways of creating a binary partition of k attribute values. Figure 4.9(b) illustrates three different ways of grouping the attribute values for marital status into two subsets. Ordinal Attributes Ordinal attributes can also produce binary or multiway splits. Ordinal attribute values can be grouped as long as the grouping does not violate the order property of the attribute values. Figure 4.10 illustrates various ways of splitting training records based on the Shirt Size attribute. The groupings shown in Figures 4.10(a) and (b) preserve the order among the attribute values, whereas the grouping shown in Figure 4.10(c) violates this property because it combines the attribute values Small and Large into 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 157 Shirt Size {Small, Medium} {Large, Extra Large} (a) Shirt Size {Small} {Medium, Large, Extra Large} (b) Shirt Size {Small, Large} {Medium, Extra Large} (c) Figure 4.10. Different ways of grouping ordinal attribute values. the same partition while Medium and Extra Large are combined into another partition. Continuous Attributes For continuous attributes, the test condition can be expressed as a comparison test (A<v) or (A ≥ v) with binary outcomes, or a range query with outcomes of the form vi ≤ A<vi+1, for i = 1,...,k. The difference between these approaches is shown in Figure 4.11. For the binary case, the decision tree algorithm must consider all possible split positions v, and it selects the one that produces the best partition. For the multiway split, the algorithm must consider all possible ranges of continuous values. One approach is to apply the discretization strategies described in Section 2.3.6 on page 57. After discretization, a new ordinal value will be assigned to each discretized interval. Adjacent intervals can also be aggregated into wider ranges as long as the order property is preserved.

Multiway versus binary splits. 4.3.4 Measures for Selecting the Best Split There are many measures that can be used to determine the best way to split the records. These measures are defined in terms of the class distribution of the records before and after splitting. Let p(i|t) denote the fraction of records belonging to class i at a given node t. We sometimes omit the reference to node t and express the fraction as pi. In a two-class problem, the class distribution at any node can be written as (p0, p1), where p1 = 1 − p0. To illustrate, consider the test conditions shown in Figure 4.12. The class distribution before splitting is (0.5, 0.5) because there are an equal number of records from each class. If we split the data using the Gender attribute, then the class distributions of the child nodes are (0.6, 0.4) and (0.4, 0.6), respectively. Although the classes are no longer evenly distributed, the child nodes still contain records from both classes. Splitting on the second attribute, Car Type, will result in purer partitions. The measures developed for selecting the best split are often based on the degree of impurity of the child nodes. The smaller the degree of impurity, the more skewed the class distribution. For example, a node with class distribution (0, 1) has zero impurity, whereas a node with uniform class distribution (0.5, 0.5) has the highest impurity. Examples of impurity measures include Entropy(t) = − c−1 i=0 p(i|t) log2 p(i|t), (4.3) Gini(t)=1 −c−1 i=0 [p(i|t)]2, (4.4) Classification error(t)=1 − max i [p(i|t)], (4.5) where c is the number of classes and 0 log2 0 = 0 in entropy calculations. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 159 Entropy Gini Misclassification error 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 p Figure 4.13. Comparison among the impurity measures for binary classification problems. Figure 4.13 compares the values of the impurity measures for binary classification problems. p refers to the fraction of records that belong to one of the two classes. Observe that all three measures attain their maximum value when the class distribution is uniform (i.e., when p = 0.5). The minimum values for the measures are attained when all the records belong to the same class (i.e., when p equals 0 or 1). We next provide several examples of computing the different impurity measures. Node N1 Count Class=0 0 Class=1 6 Gini = 1 − (0/6)2 − (6/6)2 = 0 Entropy = −(0/6) log2(0/6) − (6/6) log2(6/6) = 0 Error = 1 − max[0/6, 6/6] = 0 Node N2 Count Class=0 1 Class=1 5 Gini = 1 − (1/6)2 − (5/6)2 = 0.278 Entropy = −(1/6) log2(1/6) − (5/6) log2(5/6) = 0.650 Error = 1 − max[1/6, 5/6] = 0.167 Node N3 Count Class=0 3 Class=1 3 Gini = 1 − (3/6)2 − (3/6)2 = 0.5 Entropy = −(3/6) log2(3/6) − (3/6) log2(3/6) = 1 Error = 1 − max[3/6, 3/6] = 0.5 160 Chapter 4 Classification The preceding examples, along with Figure 4.13, illustrate the consistency among different impurity measures. Based on these calculations, node N1 has the lowest impurity value, followed by N2 and N3. Despite their consistency, the attribute chosen as the test condition may vary depending on the choice of impurity measure, as will be shown in Exercise 3 on page 198. To determine how well a test condition performs, we need to compare the degree of impurity of the parent node (before splitting) with the degree of impurity of the child nodes (after splitting). The larger their difference, the better the test condition. The gain, ∆, is a criterion that can be used to determine the goodness of a split: ∆ = I(parent) − k j=1 N(vj ) N I(vj ), (4.6) where I(·) is the impurity measure of a given node, N is the total number of records at the parent node, k is the number of attribute values, and N(vj ) is the number of records associated with the child node, vj . Decision tree induction algorithms often choose a test condition that maximizes the gain ∆. Since I(parent) is the same for all test conditions, maximizing the gain is equivalent to minimizing the weighted average impurity measures of the child nodes. Finally, when entropy is used as the impurity measure in Equation 4.6, the difference in entropy is known as the information gain, ∆info. Splitting of Binary Attributes Consider the diagram shown in Figure 4.14. Suppose there are two ways to split the data into smaller subsets. Before splitting, the Gini index is 0.5 since there are an equal number of records from both classes. If attribute A is chosen to split the data, the Gini index for node N1 is 0.4898, and for node N2, it is 0.480. The weighted average of the Gini index for the descendent nodes is (7/12) × 0.4898 + (5/12) × 0.480 = 0.486. Similarly, we can show that the weighted average of the Gini index for attribute B is 0.375. Since the subsets for attribute B have a smaller Gini index, it is preferred over attribute A. Splitting of Nominal Attributes As previously noted, a nominal attribute can produce either binary or multiway splits, as shown in Figure 4.15. The computation of the Gini index for a binary split is similar to that shown for determining binary attributes. For the first binary grouping of the Car Type attribute, the Gini index of {Sports, 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 161 Gini = 0.375 N1 1 4 5 2 N2 C0 C1 Gini = 0.500 Parent 6 6 C0 C1 Gini = 0.486 N1 4 3 2 3 N2 C0 Node N1 C1 Node N2 A Yes No Node N1 Node N2 B Yes No Figure 4.14.

Similarly, for the second binary grouping of {Sports} and {Family, Luxury}, the weighted average Gini index is 0.167. The second grouping has a lower Gini index because its corresponding subsets are much purer. 162 Chapter 4 Classification Sorted Values Split Positions No No No No No No No Yes Yes Yes Annual Income 60 70 90 100 120 220 75 95 85 125 Class Yes No Gini 55 65 72 80 87 92 97 110 122 172 230 <= <= > > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > <= > 0 3 0 7 0 3 1 6 0 3 2 5 0 3 3 4 1 2 3 4 2 1 3 4 3 0 3 4 3 0 4 3 3 0 5 2 3 0 6 1 3 0 7 0 0.420 0.400 0.375 0.343 0.417 0.400 0.400 0.420 0.300 0.343 0.375 Figure 4.16. Splitting continuous attributes. For the multiway split, the Gini index is computed for every attribute value. Since Gini({Family}) = 0.375, Gini({Sports}) = 0, and Gini({Luxury}) = 0.219, the overall Gini index for the multiway split is equal to 4/20 × 0.375 + 8/20 × 0+8/20 × 0.219 = 0.163. The multiway split has a smaller Gini index compared to both two-way splits. This result is not surprising because the two-way split actually merges some of the outcomes of a multiway split, and thus, results in less pure subsets. Splitting of Continuous Attributes Consider the example shown in Figure 4.16, in which the test condition Annual Income ≤ v is used to split the training records for the loan default classification problem. A brute-force method for finding v is to consider every value of the attribute in the N records as a candidate split position. For each candidate v, the data set is scanned once to count the number of records with annual income less than or greater than v. We then compute the Gini index for each candidate and choose the one that gives the lowest value. This approach is computationally expensive because it requires O(N) operations to compute the Gini index at each candidate split position. Since there are N candidates, the overall complexity of this task is O(N2). To reduce the complexity, the training records are sorted based on their annual income, a computation that requires O(N log N) time. Candidate split positions are identified by taking the midpoints between two adjacent sorted values: 55, 65, 72, and so on. However, unlike the brute-force approach, we do not have to examine all N records when evaluating the Gini index of a candidate split position. For the first candidate, v = 55, none of the records has annual income less than 55K. As a result, the Gini index for the descendent node with Annual 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 163 Income < 55K is zero. On the other hand, the number of records with annual income greater than or equal to 55K is 3 (for class Yes) and 7 (for class No), respectively. Thus, the Gini index for this node is 0.420. The overall Gini index for this candidate split position is equal to 0 × 0+1 × 0.420 = 0.420. For the second candidate, v = 65, we can determine its class distribution by updating the distribution of the previous candidate. More specifically, the new distribution is obtained by examining the class label of the record with the lowest annual income (i.e., 60K). Since the class label for this record is No, the count for class No is increased from 0 to 1 (for Annual Income ≤ 65K) and is decreased from 7 to 6 (for Annual Income > 65K). The distribution for class Yes remains unchanged. The new weighted-average Gini index for this candidate split position is 0.400. This procedure is repeated until the Gini index values for all candidates are computed, as shown in Figure 4.16. The best split position corresponds to the one that produces the smallest Gini index, i.e., v = 97. This procedure is less expensive because it requires a constant amount of time to update the class distribution at each candidate split position. It can be further optimized by considering only candidate split positions located between two adjacent records with different class labels. For example, because the first three sorted records (with annual incomes 60K, 70K, and 75K) have identical class labels, the best split position should not reside between 60K and 75K. Therefore, the candidate split positions at v = 55K, 65K, 72K, 87K, 92K, 110K, 122K, 172K, and 230K are ignored because they are located between two adjacent records with the same class labels. This approach allows us to reduce the number of candidate split positions from 11 to 2. Gain Ratio Impurity measures such as entropy and Gini index tend to favor attributes that have a large number of distinct values. Figure 4.12 shows three alternative test conditions for partitioning the data set given in Exercise 2 on page 198. Comparing the first test condition, Gender, with the second, Car Type, it is easy to see that Car Type seems to provide a better way of splitting the data since it produces purer descendent nodes. However, if we compare both conditions with Customer ID, the latter appears to produce purer partitions. Yet Customer ID is not a predictive attribute because its value is unique for each record. Even in a less extreme situation, a test condition that results in a large number of outcomes may not be desirable because the number of records associated with each partition is too small to enable us to make any reliable predictions. 164 Chapter 4 Classification There are two strategies for overcoming this problem. The first strategy is to restrict the test conditions to binary splits only. This strategy is employed by decision tree algorithms such as CART. Another strategy is to modify the splitting criterion to take into account the number of outcomes produced by the attribute test condition. For example, in the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, a splitting criterion known as gain ratio is used to determine the goodness of a split. This criterion is defined as follows: Gain ratio = ∆info Split Info. (4.7) Here, Split Info = −k i=1 P(vi) log2 P(vi) and k is the total number of splits. For example, if each attribute value has the same number of records, then ∀i : P(vi)=1/k and the split information would be equal to log2 k. This example suggests that if an attribute produces a large number of splits, its split information will also be large, which in turn reduces its gain ratio. 4.3.5 Algorithm for Decision Tree Induction A skeleton decision tree induction algorithm called TreeGrowth is shown in Algorithm 4.1. The input to this algorithm consists of the training records E and the attribute set F. The algorithm works by recursively selecting the best attribute to split the data (Step 7) and expanding the leaf nodes of the Algorithm 4.1 A skeleton decision tree induction algorithm. TreeGrowth (E, F) 1: if stopping cond(E,F) = true then 2: leaf = createNode(). 3: leaf.label = Classify(E). 4: return leaf. 5: else 6: root = createNode(). 7: root.test cond = find best split(E, F). 8: let V = {v|v is a possible outcome of root.test cond }. 9: for each v ∈ V do 10: Ev = {e | root.test cond(e) = v and e ∈ E}. 11: child = TreeGrowth(Ev, F). 12: add child as descendent of root and label the edge (root → child) as v. 13: end for 14: end if 15: return root. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 165 tree (Steps 11 and 12) until the stopping criterion is met (Step 1). The details of this algorithm are explained below: 1. The createNode() function extends the decision tree by creating a new node. A node in the decision tree has either a test condition, denoted as node.test cond, or a class label, denoted as node.label. 2. The find best split() function determines which attribute should be selected as the test condition for splitting the training records. As previously noted, the choice of test condition depends on which impurity measure is used to determine the goodness of a split. Some widely used measures include entropy, the Gini index, and the χ2 statistic. 3. The Classify() function determines the class label to be assigned to a leaf node. For each leaf node t, let p(i|t) denote the fraction of training records from class i associated with the node t. In most cases, the leaf node is assigned to the class that has the majority number of training records: leaf.label = argmax i p(i|t), (4.8) where the argmax operator returns the argument i that maximizes the expression p(i|t). Besides providing the information needed to determine the class label of a leaf node, the fraction p(i|t) can also be used to estimate the probability that a record assigned to the leaf node t belongs to class i. Sections 5.7.2 and 5.7.3 describe how such probability estimates can be used to determine the performance of a decision tree under different cost functions. 4. The stopping cond() function is used to terminate the tree-growing process by testing whether all the records have either the same class label or the same attribute values. Another way to terminate the recursive function is to test whether the number of records have fallen below some minimum threshold. After building the decision tree, a tree-pruning step can be performed to reduce the size of the decision tree. Decision trees that are too large are susceptible to a phenomenon known as overfitting. Pruning helps by trimming the branches of the initial tree in a way that improves the generalization capability of the decision tree. The issues of overfitting and tree pruning are discussed in more detail in Section 4.4. 166 Chapter 4 Classification Session IP Address Timestamp Protocol Status Referrer User Agent Number of Bytes Requested Web Page Request Method 08/Aug/2004 10:15:21 1 GET 160.11.11.11 http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar HTTP/1.1 200 6424 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) 08/Aug/2004 10:15:34 1 GET http://www.cs.umn.edu/ 160.11.11.11 ~kumar/MINDS http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar HTTP/1.1 200 41378 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) 08/Aug/2004 10:15:41 1 GET 160.11.11.11 08/Aug/2004 10:16:11 1 GET 160.11.11.11 08/Aug/2004 10:16:15 2 GET 35.9.2.2 http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar/MINDS/MINDS _papers.htm http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar/papers/papers. html http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~steinbac http://www.cs.umn.edu/ ~kumar/MINDS HTTP/1.1 200 HTTP/1.1 200 HTTP/1.0 Attribute Name Description 200 1018516 7463 3149 Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040616 (a) Example of a Web server log. http://www.cs.umn.edu/~kumar MINDS papers/papers.html MINDS/MINDS_papers.htm (b) Graph of a Web session.

Input data for Web robot detection. 4.3.6 An Example: Web Robot Detection Web usage mining is the task of applying data mining techniques to extract useful patterns from Web access logs. These patterns can reveal interesting characteristics of site visitors; e.g., people who repeatedly visit a Web site and view the same product description page are more likely to buy the product if certain incentives such as rebates or free shipping are offered. In Web usage mining, it is important to distinguish accesses made by human users from those due to Web robots. A Web robot (also known as a Web crawler) is a software program that automatically locates and retrieves information from the Internet by following the hyperlinks embedded in Web pages. These programs are deployed by search engine portals to gather the documents necessary for indexing the Web. Web robot accesses must be discarded before applying Web mining techniques to analyze human browsing behavior. 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 167 This section describes how a decision tree classifier can be used to distinguish between accesses by human users and those by Web robots. The input data was obtained from a Web server log, a sample of which is shown in Figure 4.17(a). Each line corresponds to a single page request made by a Web client (a user or a Web robot). The fields recorded in the Web log include the IP address of the client, timestamp of the request, Web address of the requested document, size of the document, and the client’s identity (via the user agent field). A Web session is a sequence of requests made by a client during a single visit to a Web site. Each Web session can be modeled as a directed graph, in which the nodes correspond to Web pages and the edges correspond to hyperlinks connecting one Web page to another. Figure 4.17(b) shows a graphical representation of the first Web session given in the Web server log. To classify the Web sessions, features are constructed to describe the characteristics of each session. Figure 4.17(c) shows some of the features used for the Web robot detection task. Among the notable features include the depth and breadth of the traversal. Depth determines the maximum distance of a requested page, where distance is measured in terms of the number of hyperlinks away from the entry point of the Web site. For example, the home page http://www.cs.umn.edu/∼kumar is assumed to be at depth 0, whereas http://www.cs.umn.edu/kumar/MINDS/MINDS papers.htm is located at depth 2. Based on the Web graph shown in Figure 4.17(b), the depth attribute for the first session is equal to two. The breadth attribute measures the width of the corresponding Web graph. For example, the breadth of the Web session shown in Figure 4.17(b) is equal to two. The data set for classification contains 2916 records, with equal numbers of sessions due to Web robots (class 1) and human users (class 0). 10% of the data were reserved for training while the remaining 90% were used for testing. The induced decision tree model is shown in Figure 4.18. The tree has an error rate equal to 3.8% on the training set and 5.3% on the test set. The model suggests that Web robots can be distinguished from human users in the following way: 1. Accesses by Web robots tend to be broad but shallow, whereas accesses by human users tend to be more focused (narrow but deep). 2. Unlike human users, Web robots seldom retrieve the image pages associated with a Web document. 3. Sessions due to Web robots tend to be long and contain a large number of requested pages. 168 Chapter 4 Classification Decision Tree: depth = 1: | breadth> 7 : class 1 | breadth<= 7: | | breadth <= 3: | | | ImagePages> 0.375: class 0 | | | ImagePages<= 0.375: | | | | totalPages<= 6: class 1 | | | | totalPages> 6: | | | | | breadth <= 1: class 1 | | | | | breadth > 1: class 0 | | width > 3: | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | ImagePages<= 0.1333: class 1 | | | | ImagePages> 0.1333: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: class 1 | | | MultilP = 1: | | | | TotalTime <= 361: class 0 | | | | TotalTime > 361: class 1 depth> 1: | MultiAgent = 0: | | depth > 2: class 0 | | depth < 2: | | | MultilP = 1: class 0 | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: | | | | | RepeatedAccess <= 0.322: class 0 | | | | | RepeatedAccess > 0.322: class 1 | MultiAgent = 1: | | totalPages <= 81: class 0 | | totalPages > 81: class 1 Figure 4.18.

Web robots are more likely to make repeated requests for the same document since the Web pages retrieved by human users are often cached by the browser. 4.3.7 Characteristics of Decision Tree Induction The following is a summary of the important characteristics of decision tree induction algorithms. 1. Decision tree induction is a nonparametric approach for building classification models. In other words, it does not require any prior assumptions regarding the type of probability distributions satisfied by the class and other attributes (unlike some of the techniques described in Chapter 5). 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 169 2. Finding an optimal decision tree is an NP-complete problem. Many decision tree algorithms employ a heuristic-based approach to guide their search in the vast hypothesis space. For example, the algorithm presented in Section 4.3.5 uses a greedy, top-down, recursive partitioning strategy for growing a decision tree. 3. Techniques developed for constructing decision trees are computationally inexpensive, making it possible to quickly construct models even when the training set size is very large. Furthermore, once a decision tree has been built, classifying a test record is extremely fast, with a worst-case complexity of O(w), where w is the maximum depth of the tree. 4. Decision trees, especially smaller-sized trees, are relatively easy to interpret. The accuracies of the trees are also comparable to other classification techniques for many simple data sets. 5. Decision trees provide an expressive representation for learning discretevalued functions. However, they do not generalize well to certain types of Boolean problems. One notable example is the parity function, whose value is 0 (1) when there is an odd (even) number of Boolean attributes with the value T rue. Accurate modeling of such a function requires a full decision tree with 2d nodes, where d is the number of Boolean attributes (see Exercise 1 on page 198). 6. Decision tree algorithms are quite robust to the presence of noise, especially when methods for avoiding overfitting, as described in Section 4.4, are employed. 7. The presence of redundant attributes does not adversely affect the accuracy of decision trees. An attribute is redundant if it is strongly correlated with another attribute in the data. One of the two redundant attributes will not be used for splitting once the other attribute has been chosen. However, if the data set contains many irrelevant attributes, i.e., attributes that are not useful for the classification task, then some of the irrelevant attributes may be accidently chosen during the tree-growing process, which results in a decision tree that is larger than necessary. Feature selection techniques can help to improve the accuracy of decision trees by eliminating the irrelevant attributes during preprocessing. We will investigate the issue of too many irrelevant attributes in Section 4.4.3. 170 Chapter 4 Classification 8. Since most decision tree algorithms employ a top-down, recursive partitioning approach, the number of records becomes smaller as we traverse down the tree. At the leaf nodes, the number of records may be too small to make a statistically significant decision about the class representation of the nodes. This is known as the data fragmentation problem. One possible solution is to disallow further splitting when the number of records falls below a certain threshold. 9. A subtree can be replicated multiple times in a decision tree, as illustrated in Figure 4.19. This makes the decision tree more complex than necessary and perhaps more difficult to interpret. Such a situation can arise from decision tree implementations that rely on a single attribute test condition at each internal node. Since most of the decision tree algorithms use a divide-and-conquer partitioning strategy, the same test condition can be applied to different parts of the attribute space, thus leading to the subtree replication problem. 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 P R Q S Q S Figure 4.19. Tree replication problem. The same subtree can appear at different branches. 10. The test conditions described so far in this chapter involve using only a single attribute at a time. As a consequence, the tree-growing procedure can be viewed as the process of partitioning the attribute space into disjoint regions until each region contains records of the same class (see Figure 4.20). The border between two neighboring regions of different classes is known as a decision boundary. Since the test condition involves only a single attribute, the decision boundaries are rectilinear; i.e., parallel to the “coordinate axes.” This limits the expressiveness of the 4.3 Decision Tree Induction 171 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 x y Yes No Yes No Yes No y < 0.33 :4 :0 :0 :4 :0 :3 :4 :0 x < 0.43 y < 0.47 Figure 4.20.

Figure 4.21 illustrates a data set that cannot be classified effectively by a decision tree algorithm that uses test conditions involving only a single attribute at a time. 172 Chapter 4 Classification An oblique decision tree can be used to overcome this limitation because it allows test conditions that involve more than one attribute. The data set given in Figure 4.21 can be easily represented by an oblique decision tree containing a single node with test condition x + y < 1. Although such techniques are more expressive and can produce more compact trees, finding the optimal test condition for a given node can be computationally expensive. Constructive induction provides another way to partition the data into homogeneous, nonrectangular regions (see Section 2.3.5 on page 57). This approach creates composite attributes representing an arithmetic or logical combination of the existing attributes. The new attributes provide a better discrimination of the classes and are augmented to the data set prior to decision tree induction. Unlike the oblique decision tree approach, constructive induction is less expensive because it identifies all the relevant combinations of attributes once, prior to constructing the decision tree. In contrast, an oblique decision tree must determine the right attribute combination dynamically, every time an internal node is expanded. However, constructive induction can introduce attribute redundancy in the data since the new attribute is a combination of several existing attributes. 11. Studies have shown that the choice of impurity measure has little effect on the performance of decision tree induction algorithms. This is because many impurity measures are quite consistent with each other, as shown in Figure 4.13 on page 159. Indeed, the strategy used to prune the tree has a greater impact on the final tree than the choice of impurity measure. 4.4 Model Overfitting The errors committed by a classification model are generally divided into two types: training errors and generalization errors. Training error, also known as resubstitution error or apparent error, is the number of misclassification errors committed on training records, whereas generalization error is the expected error of the model on previously unseen records. Recall from Section 4.2 that a good classification model must not only fit the training data well, it must also accurately classify records it has never 4.4 Model Overfitting 173 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Training set x1 x2 Figure 4.22. Example of a data set with binary classes. seen before. In other words, a good model must have low training error as well as low generalization error. This is important because a model that fits the training data too well can have a poorer generalization error than a model with a higher training error. Such a situation is known as model overfitting. Overfitting Example in Two-Dimensional Data For a more concrete example of the overfitting problem, consider the two-dimensional data set shown in Figure 4.22. The data set contains data points that belong to two different classes, denoted as class o and class +, respectively. The data points for the o class are generated from a mixture of three Gaussian distributions, while a uniform distribution is used to generate the data points for the + class. There are altogether 1200 points belonging to the o class and 1800 points belonging to the + class. 30% of the points are chosen for training, while the remaining 70% are used for testing. A decision tree classifier that uses the Gini index as its impurity measure is then applied to the training set. To investigate the effect of overfitting, different levels of pruning are applied to the initial, fully-grown tree. Figure 4.23(b) shows the training and test error rates of the decision tree. 174 Chapter 4 Classification 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 Number of Nodes Error Rate Test Error Training Error Figure 4.23. Training and test error rates. Notice that the training and test error rates of the model are large when the size of the tree is very small. This situation is known as model underfitting. Underfitting occurs because the model has yet to learn the true structure of the data. As a result, it performs poorly on both the training and the test sets. As the number of nodes in the decision tree increases, the tree will have fewer training and test errors. However, once the tree becomes too large, its test error rate begins to increase even though its training error rate continues to decrease. This phenomenon is known as model overfitting. To understand the overfitting phenomenon, note that the training error of a model can be reduced by increasing the model complexity. For example, the leaf nodes of the tree can be expanded until it perfectly fits the training data. Although the training error for such a complex tree is zero, the test error can be large because the tree may contain nodes that accidently fit some of the noise points in the training data. Such nodes can degrade the performance of the tree because they do not generalize well to the test examples. Figure 4.24 shows the structure of two decision trees with different number of nodes. The tree that contains the smaller number of nodes has a higher training error rate, but a lower test error rate compared to the more complex tree. Overfitting and underfitting are two pathologies that are related to the model complexity. The remainder of this section examines some of the potential causes of model overfitting. 4.4 Model Overfitting 175 x1 < 13.29 x2 < 17.35 x2 < 12.63 x1 < 6.56 x2 < 1.38 x1 < 2.15 x1 < 7.24 x1 < 12.11 x1 < 18.88 x2 < 8.64 (a) Decision tree with 11 leaf nodes. x1 < 13.29 x2 < 17.35 x2 < 12.63 x1 < 6.56 x2 < 8.64 x2 < 1.38 x1 < 2.15 x1 < 7.24 x1 < 12.11 x1 < 18.88 x2 < 4.06 x1 < 6.99 x1 < 6.78 x2 < 19.93 x1 < 3.03 x2 < 12.68 x1 < 2.72 x2 < 15.77 x2 < 17.14 x2 < 12.89 x2 < 13.80 x2 < 16.75 x2 < 16.33 (b) Decision tree with 24 leaf nodes.

Two of the ten training records are mislabeled: bats and whales are classified as non-mammals instead of mammals. A decision tree that perfectly fits the training data is shown in Figure 4.25(a). Although the training error for the tree is zero, its error rate on Table 4.3. An example training set for classifying mammals. Class labels with asterisk symbols represent mislabeled records.

Decision tree induced from the data set shown in Table 4.3. the test set is 30%. Both humans and dolphins were misclassified as nonmammals because their attribute values for Body Temperature, Gives Birth, and Four-legged are identical to the mislabeled records in the training set. Spiny anteaters, on the other hand, represent an exceptional case in which the class label of a test record contradicts the class labels of other similar records in the training set. Errors due to exceptional cases are often unavoidable and establish the minimum error rate achievable by any classifier. 4.4 Model Overfitting 177 In contrast, the decision tree M2 shown in Figure 4.25(b) has a lower test error rate (10%) even though its training error rate is somewhat higher (20%). It is evident that the first decision tree, M1, has overfitted the training data because there is a simpler model with lower error rate on the test set. The Four-legged attribute test condition in model M1 is spurious because it fits the mislabeled training records, which leads to the misclassification of records in the test set. 4.4.2 Overfitting Due to Lack of Representative Samples Models that make their classification decisions based on a small number of training records are also susceptible to overfitting. Such models can be generated because of lack of representative samples in the training data and learning algorithms that continue to refine their models even when few training records are available. We illustrate these effects in the example below. Consider the five training records shown in Table 4.5. All of these training records are labeled correctly and the corresponding decision tree is depicted in Figure 4.26. Although its training error is zero, its error rate on the test set is 30%.

The tree arrives at this classification decision because there is only one training record, which is an eagle, with such characteristics. This example clearly demonstrates the danger of making wrong predictions when there are not enough representative examples at the leaf nodes of a decision tree. 178 Chapter 4 Classification Warm-blooded Cold-blooded Hibernates Yes No Nonmammals Nonmammals Nonmammals Mammals Fourlegged Yes No Body Temperature Figure 4.26. Decision tree induced from the data set shown in Table 4.5. 4.4.3 Overfitting and the Multiple Comparison Procedure Model overfitting may arise in learning algorithms that employ a methodology known as multiple comparison procedure. To understand multiple comparison procedure, consider the task of predicting whether the stock market will rise or fall in the next ten trading days. If a stock analyst simply makes random guesses, the probability that her prediction is correct on any trading day is 0.5. However, the probability that she will predict correctly at least eight out of the ten times is 10 8 + 10 9 + 10 10 210 = 0.0547, which seems quite unlikely. Suppose we are interested in choosing an investment advisor from a pool of fifty stock analysts. Our strategy is to select the analyst who makes the most correct predictions in the next ten trading days. The flaw in this strategy is that even if all the analysts had made their predictions in a random fashion, the probability that at least one of them makes at least eight correct predictions is 1 − (1 − 0.0547)50 = 0.9399, which is very high. Although each analyst has a low probability of predicting at least eight times correctly, putting them together, we have a high probability of finding an analyst who can do so. Furthermore, there is no guarantee in the 4.4 Model Overfitting 179 future that such an analyst will continue to make accurate predictions through random guessing. How does the multiple comparison procedure relate to model overfitting? Many learning algorithms explore a set of independent alternatives, {γi}, and then choose an alternative, γmax, that maximizes a given criterion function. The algorithm will add γmax to the current model in order to improve its overall performance. This procedure is repeated until no further improvement is observed. As an example, during decision tree growing, multiple tests are performed to determine which attribute can best split the training data. The attribute that leads to the best split is chosen to extend the tree as long as the observed improvement is statistically significant. Let T0 be the initial decision tree and Tx be the new tree after inserting an internal node for attribute x. In principle, x can be added to the tree if the observed gain, ∆(T0, Tx), is greater than some predefined threshold α. If there is only one attribute test condition to be evaluated, then we can avoid inserting spurious nodes by choosing a large enough value of α. However, in practice, more than one test condition is available and the decision tree algorithm must choose the best attribute xmax from a set of candidates, {x1, x2,...,xk}, to partition the data. In this situation, the algorithm is actually using a multiple comparison procedure to decide whether a decision tree should be extended. More specifically, it is testing for ∆(T0, Txmax ) > α instead of ∆(T0, Tx) > α. As the number of alternatives, k, increases, so does our chance of finding ∆(T0, Txmax ) > α. Unless the gain function ∆ or threshold α is modified to account for k, the algorithm may inadvertently add spurious nodes to the model, which leads to model overfitting. This effect becomes more pronounced when the number of training records from which xmax is chosen is small, because the variance of ∆(T0, Txmax ) is high when fewer examples are available for training. As a result, the probability of finding ∆(T0, Txmax ) > α increases when there are very few training records. This often happens when the decision tree grows deeper, which in turn reduces the number of records covered by the nodes and increases the likelihood of adding unnecessary nodes into the tree. Failure to compensate for the large number of alternatives or the small number of training records will therefore lead to model overfitting. 4.4.4 Estimation of Generalization Errors Although the primary reason for overfitting is still a subject of debate, it is generally agreed that the complexity of a model has an impact on model overfitting, as was illustrated in Figure 4.23. The question is, how do we 180 Chapter 4 Classification determine the right model complexity? The ideal complexity is that of a model that produces the lowest generalization error. The problem is that the learning algorithm has access only to the training set during model building (see Figure 4.3). It has no knowledge of the test set, and thus, does not know how well the tree will perform on records it has never seen before. The best it can do is to estimate the generalization error of the induced tree. This section presents several methods for doing the estimation. Using Resubstitution Estimate The resubstitution estimate approach assumes that the training set is a good representation of the overall data. Consequently, the training error, otherwise known as resubstitution error, can be used to provide an optimistic estimate for the generalization error. Under this assumption, a decision tree induction algorithm simply selects the model that produces the lowest training error rate as its final model. However, the training error is usually a poor estimate of generalization error. Example 4.1. Consider the binary decision trees shown in Figure 4.27. Assume that both trees are generated from the same training data and both make their classification decisions at each leaf node according to the majority class. Note that the left tree, TL, is more complex because it expands some of the leaf nodes in the right tree, TR. The training error rate for the left tree is e(TL)=4/24 = 0.167, while the training error rate for the right tree is +: 3 –: 1 +: 2 –: 1 +: 0 –: 2 +: 1 –: 2 +: 3 –: 1 +: 0 –: 5 +: 5 –: 2 +: 1 –: 4 +: 3 –: 0 +: 3 –: 6 +: 3 –: 0 Decision Tree, TL Decision Tree, TR Figure 4.27. Example of two decision trees generated from the same training data. 4.4 Model Overfitting 181 e(TR)=6/24 = 0.25. Based on their resubstitution estimate, the left tree is considered better than the right tree. Incorporating Model Complexity As previously noted, the chance for model overfitting increases as the model becomes more complex. For this reason, we should prefer simpler models, a strategy that agrees with a well-known principle known as Occam’s razor or the principle of parsimony: Definition 4.2. Occam’s Razor: Given two models with the same generalization errors, the simpler model is preferred over the more complex model. Occam’s razor is intuitive because the additional components in a complex model stand a greater chance of being fitted purely by chance. In the words of Einstein, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” Next, we present two methods for incorporating model complexity into the evaluation of classification models. Pessimistic Error Estimate The first approach explicitly computes generalization error as the sum of training error and a penalty term for model complexity. The resulting generalization error can be considered its pessimistic error estimate. For instance, let n(t) be the number of training records classified by node t and e(t) be the number of misclassified records. The pessimistic error estimate of a decision tree T, eg(T), can be computed as follows: eg(T) = k i=1[e(ti) + Ω(ti)] k i=1 n(ti) = e(T) + Ω(T) Nt , where k is the number of leaf nodes, e(T) is the overall training error of the decision tree, Nt is the number of training records, and Ω(ti) is the penalty term associated with each node ti. Example 4.2. Consider the binary decision trees shown in Figure 4.27. If the penalty term is equal to 0.5, then the pessimistic error estimate for the left tree is eg(TL) = 4+7 × 0.5 24 = 7.5 24 = 0.3125 and the pessimistic error estimate for the right tree is eg(TR) = 6+4 × 0.5 24 = 8 24 = 0.3333. 182 Chapter 4 Classification A? B? C? 0 0 1 1 X y Labeled X1 B1 B2 C1 C2 X2 X3 X4 Xn 1 1 1 ... ... 0 0 X y Unlabeled X1 X2 X3 X4 Xn ? ? ? ... ... ? ? A B Yes No Figure 4.28. The minimum description length (MDL) principle. Thus, the left tree has a better pessimistic error rate than the right tree. For binary trees, a penalty term of 0.5 means a node should always be expanded into its two child nodes as long as it improves the classification of at least one training record because expanding a node, which is equivalent to adding 0.5 to the overall error, is less costly than committing one training error. If Ω(t) = 1 for all the nodes t, the pessimistic error estimate for the left tree is eg(TL) = 11/24 = 0.458, while the pessimistic error estimate for the right tree is eg(TR) = 10/24 = 0.417. The right tree therefore has a better pessimistic error rate than the left tree. Thus, a node should not be expanded into its child nodes unless it reduces the misclassification error for more than one training record. Minimum Description Length Principle Another way to incorporate model complexity is based on an information-theoretic approach known as the minimum description length or MDL principle. To illustrate this principle, consider the example shown in Figure 4.28. In this example, both A and B are given a set of records with known attribute values x. In addition, person A knows the exact class label for each record, while person B knows none of this information. B can obtain the classification of each record by requesting that A transmits the class labels sequentially. Such a message would require Θ(n) bits of information, where n is the total number of records. Alternatively, A may decide to build a classification model that summarizes the relationship between x and y. The model can be encoded in a compact 4.4 Model Overfitting 183 form before being transmitted to B. If the model is 100% accurate, then the cost of transmission is equivalent to the cost of encoding the model. Otherwise, A must also transmit information about which record is classified incorrectly by the model. Thus, the overall cost of transmission is Cost(model, data) = Cost(model) + Cost(data|model), (4.9) where the first term on the right-hand side is the cost of encoding the model, while the second term represents the cost of encoding the mislabeled records. According to the MDL principle, we should seek a model that minimizes the overall cost function. An example showing how to compute the total description length of a decision tree is given by Exercise 9 on page 202. Estimating Statistical Bounds The generalization error can also be estimated as a statistical correction to the training error. Since generalization error tends to be larger than training error, the statistical correction is usually computed as an upper bound to the training error, taking into account the number of training records that reach a particular leaf node. For instance, in the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, the number of errors committed by each leaf node is assumed to follow a binomial distribution. To compute its generalization error, we must determine the upper bound limit to the observed training error, as illustrated in the next example. Example 4.3. Consider the left-most branch of the binary decision trees shown in Figure 4.27. Observe that the left-most leaf node of TR has been expanded into two child nodes in TL. Before splitting, the error rate of the node is 2/7=0.286. By approximating a binomial distribution with a normal distribution, the following upper bound of the error rate e can be derived: eupper(N, e, α) = e + z2 α/2 2N + zα/2 e(1−e) N + z2 α/2 4N2 1 + z2 α/2 N , (4.10) where α is the confidence level, zα/2 is the standardized value from a standard normal distribution, and N is the total number of training records used to compute e. By replacing α = 25%, N = 7, and e = 2/7, the upper bound for the error rate is eupper(7, 2/7, 0.25) = 0.503, which corresponds to 7 × 0.503 = 3.521 errors. If we expand the node into its child nodes as shown in TL, the training error rates for the child nodes are 1/4=0.250 and 1/3=0.333, 184 Chapter 4 Classification respectively. Using Equation 4.10, the upper bounds of these error rates are eupper(4, 1/4, 0.25) = 0.537 and eupper(3, 1/3, 0.25) = 0.650, respectively. The overall training error of the child nodes is 4× 0.537 + 3 × 0.650 = 4.098, which is larger than the estimated error for the corresponding node in TR. Using a Validation Set In this approach, instead of using the training set to estimate the generalization error, the original training data is divided into two smaller subsets. One of the subsets is used for training, while the other, known as the validation set, is used for estimating the generalization error. Typically, two-thirds of the training set is reserved for model building, while the remaining one-third is used for error estimation. This approach is typically used with classification techniques that can be parameterized to obtain models with different levels of complexity. The complexity of the best model can be estimated by adjusting the parameter of the learning algorithm (e.g., the pruning level of a decision tree) until the empirical model produced by the learning algorithm attains the lowest error rate on the validation set. Although this approach provides a better way for estimating how well the model performs on previously unseen records, less data is available for training. 4.4.5 Handling Overfitting in Decision Tree Induction In the previous section, we described several methods for estimating the generalization error of a classification model. Having a reliable estimate of generalization error allows the learning algorithm to search for an accurate model without overfitting the training data. This section presents two strategies for avoiding model overfitting in the context of decision tree induction. Prepruning (Early Stopping Rule) In this approach, the tree-growing algorithm is halted before generating a fully grown tree that perfectly fits the entire training data. To do this, a more restrictive stopping condition must be used; e.g., stop expanding a leaf node when the observed gain in impurity measure (or improvement in the estimated generalization error) falls below a certain threshold. The advantage of this approach is that it avoids generating overly complex subtrees that overfit the training data. Nevertheless, it is difficult to choose the right threshold for early termination. Too high of a threshold will result in underfitted models, while a threshold that is set too low may not be sufficient to overcome the model overfitting problem. Furthermore, 4.4 Model Overfitting 185 Decision Tree: Simplified Decision Tree: Subtree Replacement Subtree Raising depth = 1: | breadth> 7 : class 1 | breadth<= 7: | | breadth <= 3: | | | ImagePages> 0.375: class 0 | | | ImagePages<= 0.375: | | | | totalPages<= 6: class 1 | | | | totalPages> 6: | | | | | breadth <= 1: class 1 | | | | | breadth > 1: class 0 | | width > 3: | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | ImagePages<= 0.1333: class 1 | | | | ImagePages> 0.1333: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: class 1 | | | MultilP = 1: | | | | TotalTime <= 361: class 0 | | | | TotalTime > 361: class 1 depth> 1: | MultiAgent = 0: | | depth > 2: class 0 | | depth <= 2: | | | MultilP = 1: class 0 | | | MultilP = 0: | | | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | | | breadth > 6: | | | | | RepeatedAccess <= 0.322: class 0 | | | | | RepeatedAccess > 0.322: class 1 | MultiAgent = 1: | | totalPages <= 81: class 0 | | totalPages > 81: class 1 depth = 1: | ImagePages <= 0.1333: class 1 | ImagePages > 0.1333: | | breadth <= 6: class 0 | | breadth > 6: class 1 depth > 1: | MultiAgent = 0: class 0 | MultiAgent = 1: | | totalPages <= 81: class 0 | | totalPages > 81: class 1 Figure 4.29. Post-pruning of the decision tree for Web robot detection. even if no significant gain is obtained using one of the existing attribute test conditions, subsequent splitting may result in better subtrees. Post-pruning In this approach, the decision tree is initially grown to its maximum size. This is followed by a tree-pruning step, which proceeds to trim the fully grown tree in a bottom-up fashion. Trimming can be done by replacing a subtree with (1) a new leaf node whose class label is determined from the majority class of records affiliated with the subtree, or (2) the most frequently used branch of the subtree. The tree-pruning step terminates when no further improvement is observed. Post-pruning tends to give better results than prepruning because it makes pruning decisions based on a fully grown tree, unlike prepruning, which can suffer from premature termination of the tree-growing process. However, for post-pruning, the additional computations needed to grow the full tree may be wasted when the subtree is pruned. Figure 4.29 illustrates the simplified decision tree model for the Web robot detection example given in Section 4.3.6. Notice that the subtrees rooted at 186 Chapter 4 Classification depth = 1 have been replaced by one of the branches involving the attribute ImagePages. This approach is also known as subtree raising. The depth > 1 and MultiAgent = 0 subtree has been replaced by a leaf node assigned to class 0. This approach is known as subtree replacement. The subtree for depth > 1 and MultiAgent = 1 remains intact. 4.5 Evaluating the Performance of a Classifier Section 4.4.4 described several methods for estimating the generalization error of a model during training. The estimated error helps the learning algorithm to do model selection; i.e., to find a model of the right complexity that is not susceptible to overfitting. Once the model has been constructed, it can be applied to the test set to predict the class labels of previously unseen records. It is often useful to measure the performance of the model on the test set because such a measure provides an unbiased estimate of its generalization error. The accuracy or error rate computed from the test set can also be used to compare the relative performance of different classifiers on the same domain. However, in order to do this, the class labels of the test records must be known. This section reviews some of the methods commonly used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. 4.5.1 Holdout Method In the holdout method, the original data with labeled examples is partitioned into two disjoint sets, called the training and the test sets, respectively. A classification model is then induced from the training set and its performance is evaluated on the test set. The proportion of data reserved for training and for testing is typically at the discretion of the analysts (e.g., 50-50 or twothirds for training and one-third for testing). The accuracy of the classifier can be estimated based on the accuracy of the induced model on the test set. The holdout method has several well-known limitations. First, fewer labeled examples are available for training because some of the records are withheld for testing. As a result, the induced model may not be as good as when all the labeled examples are used for training. Second, the model may be highly dependent on the composition of the training and test sets. The smaller the training set size, the larger the variance of the model. On the other hand, if the training set is too large, then the estimated accuracy computed from the smaller test set is less reliable. Such an estimate is said to have a wide confidence interval. Finally, the training and test sets are no longer independent 4.5 Evaluating the Performance of a Classifier 187 of each other. Because the training and test sets are subsets of the original data, a class that is overrepresented in one subset will be underrepresented in the other, and vice versa. 4.5.2 Random Subsampling The holdout method can be repeated several times to improve the estimation of a classifier’s performance. This approach is known as random subsampling. Let acci be the model accuracy during the i th iteration. The overall accuracy is given by accsub = k i=1 acci/k. Random subsampling still encounters some of the problems associated with the holdout method because it does not utilize as much data as possible for training. It also has no control over the number of times each record is used for testing and training. Consequently, some records might be used for training more often than others. 4.5.3 Cross-Validation An alternative to random subsampling is cross-validation. In this approach, each record is used the same number of times for training and exactly once for testing. To illustrate this method, suppose we partition the data into two equal-sized subsets. First, we choose one of the subsets for training and the other for testing. We then swap the roles of the subsets so that the previous training set becomes the test set and vice versa. This approach is called a twofold cross-validation. The total error is obtained by summing up the errors for both runs. In this example, each record is used exactly once for training and once for testing. The k-fold cross-validation method generalizes this approach by segmenting the data into k equal-sized partitions. During each run, one of the partitions is chosen for testing, while the rest of them are used for training. This procedure is repeated k times so that each partition is used for testing exactly once. Again, the total error is found by summing up the errors for all k runs. A special case of the k-fold cross-validation method sets k = N, the size of the data set. In this so-called leave-one-out approach, each test set contains only one record. This approach has the advantage of utilizing as much data as possible for training. In addition, the test sets are mutually exclusive and they effectively cover the entire data set. The drawback of this approach is that it is computationally expensive to repeat the procedure N times. Furthermore, since each test set contains only one record, the variance of the estimated performance metric tends to be high. 188 Chapter 4 Classification 4.5.4 Bootstrap The methods presented so far assume that the training records are sampled without replacement. As a result, there are no duplicate records in the training and test sets. In the bootstrap approach, the training records are sampled with replacement; i.e., a record already chosen for training is put back into the original pool of records so that it is equally likely to be redrawn. If the original data has N records, it can be shown that, on average, a bootstrap sample of size N contains about 63.2% of the records in the original data. This approximation follows from the fact that the probability a record is chosen by a bootstrap sample is 1 − (1 − 1/N)N . When N is sufficiently large, the probability asymptotically approaches 1 − e−1 = 0.632. Records that are not included in the bootstrap sample become part of the test set. The model induced from the training set is then applied to the test set to obtain an estimate of the accuracy of the bootstrap sample, i. The sampling procedure is then repeated b times to generate b bootstrap samples. There are several variations to the bootstrap sampling approach in terms of how the overall accuracy of the classifier is computed. One of the more widely used approaches is the .632 bootstrap, which computes the overall accuracy by combining the accuracies of each bootstrap sample (i) with the accuracy computed from a training set that contains all the labeled examples in the original data (accs): Accuracy, accboot = 1 b b i=1 (0.632 × i + 0.368 × accs). (4.11) 4.6 Methods for Comparing Classifiers It is often useful to compare the performance of different classifiers to determine which classifier works better on a given data set. However, depending on the size of the data, the observed difference in accuracy between two classifiers may not be statistically significant. This section examines some of the statistical tests available to compare the performance of different models and classifiers. For illustrative purposes, consider a pair of classification models, MA and MB. Suppose MA achieves 85% accuracy when evaluated on a test set containing 30 records, while MB achieves 75% accuracy on a different test set containing 5000 records. Based on this information, is MA a better model than MB? 4.6 Methods for Comparing Classifiers 189 The preceding example raises two key questions regarding the statistical significance of the performance metrics: 1. Although MA has a higher accuracy than MB, it was tested on a smaller test set. How much confidence can we place on the accuracy for MA? 2. Is it possible to explain the difference in accuracy as a result of variations in the composition of the test sets? The first question relates to the issue of estimating the confidence interval of a given model accuracy. The second question relates to the issue of testing the statistical significance of the observed deviation. These issues are investigated in the remainder of this section. 4.6.1 Estimating a Confidence Interval for Accuracy To determine the confidence interval, we need to establish the probability distribution that governs the accuracy measure. This section describes an approach for deriving the confidence interval by modeling the classification task as a binomial experiment. Following is a list of characteristics of a binomial experiment: 1. The experiment consists of N independent trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes: success or failure. 2. The probability of success, p, in each trial is constant. An example of a binomial experiment is counting the number of heads that turn up when a coin is flipped N times. If X is the number of successes observed in N trials, then the probability that X takes a particular value is given by a binomial distribution with mean N p and variance N p(1 − p): P(X = v) = N p pv(1 − p) N−v. For example, if the coin is fair (p = 0.5) and is flipped fifty times, then the probability that the head shows up 20 times is P(X = 20) = 50 20 0.520(1 − 0.5)30 = 0.0419. If the experiment is repeated many times, then the average number of heads expected to show up is 50×0.5 = 25, while its variance is 50×0.5×0.5 = 12.5. 190 Chapter 4 Classification The task of predicting the class labels of test records can also be considered as a binomial experiment. Given a test set that contains N records, let X be the number of records correctly predicted by a model and p be the true accuracy of the model. By modeling the prediction task as a binomial experiment, X has a binomial distribution with mean N p and variance N p(1 − p). It can be shown that the empirical accuracy, acc = X/N, also has a binomial distribution with mean p and variance p(1−p)/N (see Exercise 12). Although the binomial distribution can be used to estimate the confidence interval for acc, it is often approximated by a normal distribution when N is sufficiently large. Based on the normal distribution, the following confidence interval for acc can be derived: P − Zα/2 ≤ acc − p p(1 − p)/N ≤ Z1−α/2 = 1 − α, (4.12) where Zα/2 and Z1−α/2 are the upper and lower bounds obtained from a standard normal distribution at confidence level (1 − α). Since a standard normal distribution is symmetric around Z = 0, it follows that Zα/2 = Z1−α/2. Rearranging this inequality leads to the following confidence interval for p: 2 × N × acc + Z2 α/2 ± Zα/2 Z2 α/2 + 4N acc − 4N acc2 2(N + Z2 α/2) . (4.13) The following table shows the values of Zα/2 at different confidence levels: 1 − α 0.99 0.98 0.95 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.5 Zα/2 2.58 2.33 1.96 1.65 1.28 1.04 0.67 Example 4.4. Consider a model that has an accuracy of 80% when evaluated on 100 test records. What is the confidence interval for its true accuracy at a 95% confidence level? The confidence level of 95% corresponds to Zα/2 = 1.96 according to the table given above. Inserting this term into Equation 4.13 yields a confidence interval between 71.1% and 86.7%. The following table shows the confidence interval when the number of records, N, increases: N 20 50 100 500 1000 5000 Confidence 0.584 0.670 0.711 0.763 0.774 0.789 Interval − 0.919 − 0.888 − 0.867 − 0.833 − 0.824 − 0.811 Note that the confidence interval becomes tighter when N increases. 4.6 Methods for Comparing Classifiers 191 4.6.2 Comparing the Performance of Two Models Consider a pair of models, M1 and M2, that are evaluated on two independent test sets, D1 and D2. Let n1 denote the number of records in D1 and n2 denote the number of records in D2. In addition, suppose the error rate for M1 on D1 is e1 and the error rate for M2 on D2 is e2. Our goal is to test whether the observed difference between e1 and e2 is statistically significant. Assuming that n1 and n2 are sufficiently large, the error rates e1 and e2 can be approximated using normal distributions. If the observed difference in the error rate is denoted as d = e1 − e2, then d is also normally distributed with mean dt, its true difference, and variance, σ2 d. The variance of d can be computed as follows: σ2 d σ 2 d = e1(1 − e1) n1 + e2(1 − e2) n2 , (4.14) where e1(1 − e1)/n1 and e2(1 − e2)/n2 are the variances of the error rates. Finally, at the (1 − α)% confidence level, it can be shown that the confidence interval for the true difference dt is given by the following equation: dt = d ± zα/2σ d. (4.15) Example 4.5. Consider the problem described at the beginning of this section. Model MA has an error rate of e1 = 0.15 when applied to N1 = 30 test records, while model MB has an error rate of e2 = 0.25 when applied to N2 = 5000 test records. The observed difference in their error rates is d = |0.15 − 0.25| = 0.1. In this example, we are performing a two-sided test to check whether dt = 0 or dt = 0. The estimated variance of the observed difference in error rates can be computed as follows: σ 2 d = 0.15(1 − 0.15) 30 + 0.25(1 − 0.25) 5000 = 0.0043 or σ d = 0.0655. Inserting this value into Equation 4.15, we obtain the following confidence interval for dt at 95% confidence level: dt = 0.1 ± 1.96 × 0.0655 = 0.1 ± 0.128. As the interval spans the value zero, we can conclude that the observed difference is not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. 192 Chapter 4 Classification At what confidence level can we reject the hypothesis that dt = 0? To do this, we need to determine the value of Zα/2 such that the confidence interval for dt does not span the value zero. We can reverse the preceding computation and look for the value Zα/2 such that d>Zα/2σ d. Replacing the values of d and σ d gives Zα/2 < 1.527. This value first occurs when (1 − α) 0.936 (for a two-sided test). The result suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected at confidence level of 93.6% or lower. 4.6.3 Comparing the Performance of Two Classifiers Suppose we want to compare the performance of two classifiers using the k-fold cross-validation approach. Initially, the data set D is divided into k equal-sized partitions. We then apply each classifier to construct a model from k − 1 of the partitions and test it on the remaining partition. This step is repeated k times, each time using a different partition as the test set. Let Mij denote the model induced by classification technique Li during the jth iteration. Note that each pair of models M1j and M2j are tested on the same partition j. Let e1j and e2j be their respective error rates. The difference between their error rates during the jth fold can be written as dj = e1j − e2j . If k is sufficiently large, then dj is normally distributed with mean dcv t , which is the true difference in their error rates, and variance σcv. Unlike the previous approach, the overall variance in the observed differences is estimated using the following formula: σ 2 dcv = k j=1(dj − d)2 k(k − 1) , (4.16) where d is the average difference. For this approach, we need to use a tdistribution to compute the confidence interval for dcv t : dcv t = d ± t(1−α),k−1σ dcv . The coefficient t(1−α),k−1 is obtained from a probability table with two input parameters, its confidence level (1 − α) and the number of degrees of freedom, k − 1. The probability table for the t-distribution is shown in Table 4.6. Example 4.6. Suppose the estimated difference in the accuracy of models generated by two classification techniques has a mean equal to 0.05 and a standard deviation equal to 0.002. If the accuracy is estimated using a 30-fold cross-validation approach, then at a 95% confidence level, the true accuracy difference is dcv t = 0.05 ± 2.04 × 0.002.

For example, the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress classification systems were designed to catalog and index the vast number of library books. The categories are typically identified in a manual fashion, with the help of domain experts. Automated classification has been a subject of intensive research for many years. The study of classification in classical statistics is sometimes known as discriminant analysis, where the objective is to predict the group membership of an object based on a set of predictor variables. A well-known classical method is Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis [117], which seeks to find a linear projection of the data that produces the greatest discrimination between objects that belong to different classes. Many pattern recognition problems also require the discrimination of objects from different classes. Examples include speech recognition, handwritten character identification, and image classification. Readers who are interested in the application of classification techniques for pattern recognition can refer to the survey articles by Jain et al. [122] and Kulkarni et al. [128] or classic pattern recognition books by Bishop [107], Duda et al. [114], and Fukunaga [118]. The subject of classification is also a major research topic in the fields of neural networks, statistical learning, and machine learning. An in-depth treat- 194 Chapter 4 Classification ment of various classification techniques is given in the books by Cherkassky and Mulier [112], Hastie et al. [120], Michie et al. [133], and Mitchell [136]. An overview of decision tree induction algorithms can be found in the survey articles by Buntine [110], Moret [137], Murthy [138], and Safavian et al. [147]. Examples of some well-known decision tree algorithms include CART [108], ID3 [143], C4.5 [145], and CHAID [125]. Both ID3 and C4.5 employ the entropy measure as their splitting function. An in-depth discussion of the C4.5 decision tree algorithm is given by Quinlan [145]. Besides explaining the methodology for decision tree growing and tree pruning, Quinlan [145] also described how the algorithm can be modified to handle data sets with missing values. The CART algorithm was developed by Breiman et al. [108] and uses the Gini index as its splitting function. CHAID [125] uses the statistical χ2 test to determine the best split during the tree-growing process. The decision tree algorithm presented in this chapter assumes that the splitting condition is specified one attribute at a time. An oblique decision tree can use multiple attributes to form the attribute test condition in the internal nodes [121, 152]. Breiman et al. [108] provide an option for using linear combinations of attributes in their CART implementation. Other approaches for inducing oblique decision trees were proposed by Heath et al. [121], Murthy et al. [139], Cant´u-Paz and Kamath [111], and Utgoff and Brodley [152]. Although oblique decision trees help to improve the expressiveness of a decision tree representation, learning the appropriate test condition at each node is computationally challenging. Another way to improve the expressiveness of a decision tree without using oblique decision trees is to apply a method known as constructive induction [132]. This method simplifies the task of learning complex splitting functions by creating compound features from the original attributes. Besides the top-down approach, other strategies for growing a decision tree include the bottom-up approach by Landeweerd et al. [130] and Pattipati and Alexandridis [142], as well as the bidirectional approach by Kim and Landgrebe [126]. Schuermann and Doster [150] and Wang and Suen [154] proposed using a soft splitting criterion to address the data fragmentation problem. In this approach, each record is assigned to different branches of the decision tree with different probabilities. Model overfitting is an important issue that must be addressed to ensure that a decision tree classifier performs equally well on previously unknown records. The model overfitting problem has been investigated by many authors including Breiman et al. [108], Schaffer [148], Mingers [135], and Jensen and Cohen [123]. While the presence of noise is often regarded as one of the Bibliography 195 primary reasons for overfitting [135, 140], Jensen and Cohen [123] argued that overfitting is the result of using incorrect hypothesis tests in a multiple comparison procedure. Schapire [149] defined generalization error as “the probability of misclassifying a new example” and test error as “the fraction of mistakes on a newly sampled test set.” Generalization error can therefore be considered as the expected test error of a classifier. Generalization error may sometimes refer to the true error [136] of a model, i.e., its expected error for randomly drawn data points from the same population distribution where the training set is sampled. These definitions are in fact equivalent if both the training and test sets are gathered from the same population distribution, which is often the case in many data mining and machine learning applications. The Occam’s razor principle is often attributed to the philosopher William of Occam. Domingos [113] cautioned against the pitfall of misinterpreting Occam’s razor as comparing models with similar training errors, instead of generalization errors. A survey on decision tree-pruning methods to avoid overfitting is given by Breslow and Aha [109] and Esposito et al. [116]. Some of the typical pruning methods include reduced error pruning [144], pessimistic error pruning [144], minimum error pruning [141], critical value pruning [134], cost-complexity pruning [108], and error-based pruning [145]. Quinlan and Rivest proposed using the minimum description length principle for decision tree pruning in [146]. Kohavi [127] had performed an extensive empirical study to compare the performance metrics obtained using different estimation methods such as random subsampling, bootstrapping, and k-fold cross-validation. Their results suggest that the best estimation method is based on the ten-fold stratified cross-validation. Efron and Tibshirani [115] provided a theoretical and empirical comparison between cross-validation and a bootstrap method known as the 632+ rule. Current techniques such as C4.5 require that the entire training data set fit into main memory. There has been considerable effort to develop parallel and scalable versions of decision tree induction algorithms. Some of the proposed algorithms include SLIQ by Mehta et al. [131], SPRINT by Shafer et al. [151], CMP by Wang and Zaniolo [153], CLOUDS by Alsabti et al. [106], RainForest by Gehrke et al. [119], and ScalParC by Joshi et al. [124]. A general survey of parallel algorithms for data mining is available in [129]. 196 Chapter 4 Classification Bibliography [106] K. Alsabti, S. Ranka, and V. Singh.

Decision trees for Exercise 9. 4.8 Exercises 203 Compute the total description length of each decision tree according to the minimum description length principle. • The total description length of a tree is given by: Cost(tree, data) = Cost(tree) + Cost(data|tree). • Each internal node of the tree is encoded by the ID of the splitting attribute. If there are m attributes, the cost of encoding each attribute is log2 m bits. • Each leaf is encoded using the ID of the class it is associated with. If there are k classes, the cost of encoding a class is log2 k bits. • Cost(tree) is the cost of encoding all the nodes in the tree. To simplify the computation, you can assume that the total cost of the tree is obtained by adding up the costs of encoding each internal node and each leaf node. • Cost(data|tree) is encoded using the classification errors the tree commits on the training set. Each error is encoded by log2 n bits, where n is the total number of training instances. Which decision tree is better, according to the MDL principle? 10. While the .632 bootstrap approach is useful for obtaining a reliable estimate of model accuracy, it has a known limitation [127]. Consider a two-class problem, where there are equal number of positive and negative examples in the data. Suppose the class labels for the examples are generated randomly. The classifier used is an unpruned decision tree (i.e., a perfect memorizer). Determine the accuracy of the classifier using each of the following methods. (a) The holdout method, where two-thirds of the data are used for training and the remaining one-third are used for testing. (b) Ten-fold cross-validation. (c) The .632 bootstrap method. (d) From the results in parts (a), (b), and (c), which method provides a more reliable evaluation of the classifier’s accuracy? 11. Consider the following approach for testing whether a classifier A beats another classifier B. Let N be the size of a given data set, pA be the accuracy of classifier A, pB be the accuracy of classifier B, and p = (pA + pB)/2 be the average accuracy for both classifiers. To test whether classifier A is significantly better than B, the following Z-statistic is used: Z = pA − pB 2p(1−p) N .

Throughout this lecture we assume a regression setting, i.e. . In this lecture we will decompose the generalization error of a classifier into three rather interpretable terms. Before we do that, let us consider that for any given input there might not exist a unique label . For example, if your vector describes features of house (e.g. #bedrooms, square footage, ...) and the label its price, you could imagine two houses with identical description selling for different prices. So for any given feature vector , there is a distribution over possible labels. We therefore define the following, which will come in useful later on: Expected Label (given ): The expected label denotes the label you would expect to obtain, given a feature vector . Alright, so we draw our training set , consisting of inputs, i.i.d. from the distribution . As a second step we typically call some machine learning algorithm on this data set to learn a hypothesis (aka classifier). Formally, we denote this process as . For a given , learned on data set with algorithm , we can compute the generalization error (as measured in squared loss) as follows: Expected Test Error (given ): Note that one can use other loss functions. We use squared loss because it has nice mathematical properties, and it is also the most common loss function. The previous statement is true for a given training set . However, remember that itself is drawn from , and is therefore a random variable. Further, is a function of , and is therefore also a random variable. And we can of course compute its expectation: Expected Classifier (given ): D = {(x1, y1),…,(xn, yn)} P(X, Y ) y ∈ R x y x y x x ∈ R d y¯(x) = E [Y ] = y Pr(y|x)∂y. y|x ∫ y x D n P A hD = A(D) hD D A hD E [ ] = Pr(x, y)∂y∂x.

We can also use the fact that is a random variable to compute the expected test error only given , taking the expectation also over . Expected Test Error (given ): To be clear, is our training points and the pairs are the test points. We are interested in exactly this expression, because it evaluates the quality of a machine learning algorithm with respect to a data distribution . In the following we will show that this expression decomposes into three meaningful terms. Decomposition of Expected Test Error The middle term of the above equation is as we show below Returning to the earlier expression, we're left with the variance and another term We can break down the second term in the above equation as follows: The third term in the equation above is , as we show below This gives us the decomposition of expected test error as follows Variance: Captures how much your classifier changes if you train on a different training set.

This is due to your classifier being \\"biased\\" to a particular kind of solution (e.g. linear classifier). In other words, bias is inherent to your model. Noise: How big is the data-intrinsic noise? This error measures ambiguity due to your data distribution and feature representation. You can never beat this, it is an aspect of the data. Fig 1: Graphical illustration of bias and variance. Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html Fig 2: The variation of Bias and Variance with the model complexity. This is similar to the concept of overfitting and underfitting. More complex models overfit while the simplest models underfit. Source: http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html Detecting High Bias and High Variance If a classifier is under-performing (e.g. if the test or training error is too high), there are several ways to improve performance. To find out which of these many techniques is the right one for the situation, the first step is to determine the root of the problem. Figure 3: Test and training error as the number of training instances increases. The graph above plots the training error and the test error and can be divided into two overarching regimes. In the first regime (on the left side of the graph), training error is below the desired error threshold (denoted by ), but test error is significantly higher. In the second regime (on the right side of the graph), test error is remarkably close to training error, but both are above the desired tolerance of . Regime 1 (High Variance) In the first regime, the cause of the poor performance is high variance. Symptoms: 1. Training error is much lower than test error 2. Training error is lower than 3. Test error is above Remedies: Add more training data Reduce model complexity -- complex models are prone to high variance Bagging (will be covered later in the course) Regime 2 (High Bias) Unlike the first regime, the second regime indicates high bias: the model being used is not robust enough to produce an accurate prediction. Symptoms: 1. Training error is higher than Remedies: Use more complex model (e.g. kernelize, use non-linear models) Add features Boosting (will be covered later in the course) ϵ ϵ ϵ ϵ ϵ Home Aarshay Jain — Updated On September 15th, 2023 Algorithm Data Science Intermediate Machine Learning Python Regression Statistics Structured Data Supervised Master the Art of Data Science: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming an Industry-Ready Data Scientist Download Roadmap × Last week, I saw a recorded talk at NYC Data Science Academy from Owen Zhang, Chief Product Officer at DataRobot. He said, ‘if you are using regression without regularization, you have to be very special!’. I hope you get what a person of his stature referred to. I understood it very well and decided to explore regularization techniques in detail. In this article, I have explained the complex science behind ‘Ridge Regression‘ and ‘Lasso Regression, ‘ which are the most fundamental regularization techniques used in data science, sadly still not used by many.

Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time. A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials, which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand. Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks — and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors. In this challenge, get a taste of the demand forecasting challenge using a real dataset. Practice Now What Are Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression? When we talk about regression, we often end up discussing Linear and Logistic Regression, as they are the most popular of the 7 types of regressions. In this article, we’ll focus on Ridge and Lasso regression, which are powerful techniques generally used for creating parsimonious models in the presence of a ‘large’ number of features. Here ‘large’ can typically mean either of two things: 1. Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting) 2. Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in the case of millions or billions of features. Though Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. If you’ve heard of them before, you must know that they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features and minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called ‘regularization’ techniques. Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models (i.e. models with fewer parameters). Regularization Techniques The key difference is in how they assign penalties to the coefficients: 1. Ridge Regression: 1. Performs L2 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of square of coefficients) 2. Lasso Regression: 1. Performs L1 regularization, i.e., adds penalty equivalent to the absolute value ofthe magnitude of coefficients 2. Minimization objective = LS Obj + α * (sum of the absolute value of coefficients) Here, LS Obj refers to the ‘least squares objective,’ i.e., the linear regression objective without regularization. If terms like ‘penalty’ and ‘regularization’ seem very unfamiliar to you, don’t worry; we’ll discuss these in more detail throughout this article. Before digging further into how they work, let’s try to understand why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should work in the first place. Why Penalize the Magnitude of Coefficients? Let’s try to understand the impact of model complexity on the magnitude of coefficients. As an example, I have simulated a sine curve (between 60° and 300°) and added some random noise using the following code: Python Code @shivanshkausha/Ridge_and_Lasso_Regression_jan-28-2016 A Nix repl by shivanshkausha Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 34 SH This resembles a sine curve but not exactly because of the noise. We’ll use this as an example to test different scenarios in this article. Let’s try to estimate the sine function using polynomial regression with powers of x from 1 to 15. Let’s add a column for each power upto 15 in our dataframe. This can be accomplished using the following code: Add a Column for Each Power upto 15 for i in range(2,16): #power of 1 is already there colname = 'x_%d'%i #new var will be x_power data[colname] = data['x']**i print(data.head())add a column for each power upto 15 The dataframe looks like this: Making 15 Different Linear Regression Models Now that we have all the 15 powers, let’s make 15 different linear regression models, with each model containing variables with powers of x from 1 to the particular model number. For example, the feature set of model 8 will be – {x, x_2, x_3, …, x_8}. First, we’ll define a generic function that takes in the required maximum power of x as an input and returns a list containing – [ model RSS, intercept, coef_x, coef_x2, … upto entered power ]. Here RSS refers to the ‘Residual Sum of Squares,’ which is nothing but the sum of squares of errors between the predicted and actual values in the training data set and is known as the cost function or the loss function. The python code defining the function is: #Import Linear Regression model from scikit-learn. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression def linear_regression(data, power, models_to_plot): #initialize predictors: predictors=['x'] if power>=2: predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,power+1)]) #Fit the model linreg = LinearRegression(normalize=True) linreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = linreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered power if power in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[power]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for power: %d'%power) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([linreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(linreg.coef_) return ret Note that this function will not plot the model fit for all the powers but will return the RSS and coefficient values for all the models. I’ll skip the details of the code for now to maintain brevity. I’ll be happy to discuss the same through the comments below if required. Store allthe Results in Pandas Dataframe Now, we can make all 15 models and compare the results. For ease of analysis, we’ll store all the results in a Pandas dataframe and plot 6 models to get an idea of the trend. Consider the following code: #Initialize a dataframe to store the results: col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['model_pow_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] coef_matrix_simple = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the powers for which a plot is required: models_to_plot = {1:231,3:232,6:233,9:234,12:235,15:236} #Iterate through all powers and assimilate results for i in range(1,16): coef_matrix_simple.iloc[i-1,0:i+2] = linear_regression(data, power=i, models_to_plot=models_to_plot) We would expect the models with increasing complexity to better fit the data and result in lower RSS values. This can be verified by looking at the plots generated for 6 models: This clearly aligns with our initial understanding. As the model complexity increases, the models tend to fit even smaller deviations in the training data set. Though this leads to overfitting, let’s keep this issue aside for some time and come to our main objective, i.e., the impact on the magnitude of coefficients. This can be analyzed by looking at the data frame created above. Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_simple The output looks like this: It is clearly evident that the size of coefficients increases exponentially with an increase in model complexity. I hope this gives some intuition into why putting a constraint on the magnitude of coefficients can be a good idea to reduce model complexity. Let’s try to understand this even better. What does a large coefficient signify? It means that we’re putting a lot of emphasis on that feature, i.e., the particular feature is a good predictor for the outcome. When it becomes too large, the algorithm starts modeling intricate relations to estimate the output and ends up overfitting the particular training data. I hope the concept is clear. Now, let’s understand ridge and lasso regression in detail and see how well they work for the same problem. How Does Ridge Regression Work? As mentioned before, ridge regression performs ‘L2 regularization‘, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of squares of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, ridge regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe square of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) is the parameter that balances the amount of emphasis given to minimizing RSS vs minimizing the sum of squares of coefficients. α can take various values: 1. α = 0: 1. The objective becomes the same as simple linear regression. 2. We’ll get the same coefficients as simple linear regression. 2. α = ∞: 1. The coefficients will be zero. Why? Because of infinite weightage on the square of coefficients, anything less than zero will make the objective infinite. 3. 0 < α < ∞: 1. The magnitude of α will decide the weightage given to different parts of the objective. 2. The coefficients will be somewhere between 0 and ones for simple linear regression. I hope this gives some sense of how α would impact the magnitude of coefficients. One thing is for sure – any non-zero value would give values less than that of simple linear regression. By how much? We’ll find out soon. Leaving the mathematical details for later, let’s see ridge regression in action on the same problem as above. Function for Ridge Regression First, let’s define a generic function for ridge regression similar to the one defined for simple linear regression. The Python code is: from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge def ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model ridgereg = Ridge(alpha=alpha,normalize=True) ridgereg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = ridgereg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([ridgereg.intercept_]) ret.extend(ridgereg.coef_) return ret Note the ‘Ridge’ function used here. It takes ‘alpha’ as a parameter on initialization. Also, keep in mind that normalizing the inputs is generally a good idea in every type of regression and should be used in the case of ridge regression as well. Now, let’s analyze the result of Ridge regression for 10 different values of α ranging from 1e-15 to 20. These values have been chosen so that we can easily analyze the trend with changes in values of α. These would, however, differ from case to case. Note that each of these 10 models will contain all the 15 variables, and only the value of alpha would differ. This differs from the simple linear regression case, where each model had a subset of features. Python Code #Initialize predictors to be set of 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Set the different values of alpha to be tested alpha_ridge = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10, 20] #Initialize the dataframe for storing coefficients. col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_ridge[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_ridge = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) models_to_plot = {1e-15:231, 1e-10:232, 1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 5:236} for i in range(10): coef_matrix_ridge.iloc[i,] = ridge_regression(data, predictors, alpha_ridge[i], models_to_plot) This would generate the following plot: Here we can clearly observe that as the value of alpha increases, the model complexity reduces. Though higher values of alpha reduce overfitting, significantly high values can cause underfitting as well (e.g., alpha = 5). Thus alpha should be chosen wisely. A widely accepted technique is cross-validation, i.e., the value of alpha is iterated over a range of values, and the one giving a higher cross-validation score is chosen. Let’s have a look at the value of coefficients in the above models: Python Code #Set the display format to be scientific for ease of analysis pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2g}'.format coef_matrix_ridge The table looks like: This straight away gives us the following inferences: 1. The RSS increases with an increase in alpha. 2. An alpha value as small as 1e-15 gives us a significant reduction in the magnitude of coefficients. How? Compare the coefficients in the first row of this table to the last row of the simple linear regression table. 3. High alpha values can lead to significant underfitting. Note the rapid increase in RSS for values of alpha greater than 1 4. Though the coefficients are really small, they are NOT zero. The first 3 are very intuitive. But #4 is also a crucial observation. Let’s reconfirm the same by determining the number of zeros in each row of the coefficients data set: Python Code coef_matrix_ridge.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: This confirms that all 15 coefficients are greater than zero in magnitude (can be +ve or -ve). Remember this observation and have a look again until it’s clear. This will play an important role later while comparing ridge with lasso regression. How Does Lasso Regression Work? LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I know it doesn’t give much of an idea, but there are 2 keywords here – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection. ‘ Let’s consider the former first and worry about the latter later. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization, i.e., it adds a factor of the sum of the absolute value of coefficients in the optimization objective. Thus, lasso regression optimizes the following: Objective = RSS + α * (sum ofthe absolute value of coefficients) Here, α (alpha) works similar to that of the ridge and provides a trade-off between balancing RSS and the magnitude of coefficients. Like that of the ridge, α can take various values. Let’s iterate it here briefly: 1. α = 0: Same coefficients as simple linear regression 2. α = ∞: All coefficients zero (same logic as before) 3. 0 < α < ∞: coefficients between 0 and that of simple linear regression Defining Generic Function Yes, its appearing to be very similar to Ridge till now. But hang on with me, and you’ll know the difference by the time we finish. Like before, let’s run lasso regression on the same problem as above. First, we’ll define a generic function: from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso def lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha, models_to_plot={}): #Fit the model lassoreg = Lasso(alpha=alpha,normalize=True, max_iter=1e5) lassoreg.fit(data[predictors],data['y']) y_pred = lassoreg.predict(data[predictors]) #Check if a plot is to be made for the entered alpha if alpha in models_to_plot: plt.subplot(models_to_plot[alpha]) plt.tight_layout() plt.plot(data['x'],y_pred) plt.plot(data['x'],data['y'],'.') plt.title('Plot for alpha: %.3g'%alpha) #Return the result in pre-defined format rss = sum((y_pred-data['y'])**2) ret = [rss] ret.extend([lassoreg.intercept_]) ret.extend(lassoreg.coef_) return ret Notice the additional parameters defined in the Lasso function – ‘max_iter. ‘ This is the maximum number of iterations for which we want the model to run if it doesn’t converge before. This exists for Ridge as well, but setting this to a higher than default value was required in this case. Why?I’ll come to this in the next section. Different Values of Alpha Let’s check the output for 10 different values of alpha using the following code: #Initialize predictors to all 15 powers of x predictors=['x'] predictors.extend(['x_%d'%i for i in range(2,16)]) #Define the alpha values to test alpha_lasso = [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-8, 1e-5,1e-4, 1e-3,1e-2, 1, 5, 10] #Initialize the dataframe to store coefficients col = ['rss','intercept'] + ['coef_x_%d'%i for i in range(1,16)] ind = ['alpha_%.2g'%alpha_lasso[i] for i in range(0,10)] coef_matrix_lasso = pd.DataFrame(index=ind, columns=col) #Define the models to plot models_to_plot = {1e-10:231, 1e-5:232,1e-4:233, 1e-3:234, 1e-2:235, 1:236} #Iterate over the 10 alpha values: for i in range(10): coef_matrix_lasso.iloc[i,] = lasso_regression(data, predictors, alpha_lasso[i], models_to_plot) This gives us the following plots: This again tells us that the model complexity decreases with an increase in the values of alpha. But notice the straight line at alpha=1. Appears a bit strange to me. Let’s explore this further by looking at the coefficients: Apart from the expected inference of higher RSS for higher alphas, we can see the following: 1. For the same values of alpha, the coefficients of lasso regression are much smaller than that of ridge regression (compare row 1 of the 2 tables). 2. For the same alpha, lasso has higher RSS (poorer fit) as compared to ridge regression. 3. Many of the coefficients are zero, even for very small values of alpha. Inferences #1 and 2 might not always generalize but will hold for many cases. The real difference from the ridge is coming out in the last inference. Let’s check the number of coefficients that are zero in each model using the following code: coef_matrix_lasso.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values==0),axis=1) Output: We can observe that even for a small value of alpha, a significant number of coefficients are zero. This also explains the horizontal line fit for alpha=1 in the lasso plots; it’s just a baseline model! This phenomenon of most of the coefficients being zero is called ‘sparsity. ‘ Although lasso performs feature selection, this level of sparsity is achieved in special cases only, which we’ll discuss towards the end. This has some really interesting implications on the use cases of lasso regression as compared to that of ridge regression. But before coming to the final comparison, let’s take a bird’s eye view of the mathematics behind why coefficients are zero in the case of lasso but not ridge.

If you wish to get into the details, I recommend taking a good statistics textbook, like Elements of Statistical Learning. Let’s start by reviewing the basic structure of data in a regression problem. In this infographic, you can see there are 4 data elements: 1. X: the matrix of input features (nrow: N, ncol: M+1) 2. Y: the actual outcome variable (length:N) 3. Yhat: these are predicted values of Y (length:N) 4. W: the weights or the coefficients (length: M+1) Here, N is the total number of data points available, and M is the total number of features. X has M+1 columns because of M features and 1 intercept. The predicted outcome for any data point i is: It is simply the weighted sum of each data point with coefficients as the weights. This prediction is achieved by finding the optimum value of weights based on certain criteria, which depends on the type of regression algorithm being used. Let’s consider all 3 cases: Simple Linear Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is just the RSS (Residual Sum of Squares), i.e., the sum of squared errors of the predicted outcome as compared to the actual outcome. This can be depicted mathematically as: In order to minimize this cost, we generally use a ‘gradient descent’ algorithm. The overall algorithm works like this: 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 determine the gradient 2.1.2 update the jth weight by subtracting learning rate times the gradient w(t+1) = w(t) - learning rate * gradient Here the important step is #2.1.1, where we compute the gradient. A gradient is nothing but a partial differential of the cost with respect to a particular weight (denoted as wj). The gradient for the jth weight will be: This is formed from 2 parts: 1. 2*{..}: This is formed because we’ve differentiated the square of the term in {..} 2. -wj: This is the differentiation of the part in {..} wrt wj. Since it’s a summation, all others would become 0, and only wj would remain. Step #2.1.2 involves updating the weights using the gradient. This updating step for simple linear regression looks like this: Note the +ve sign in the RHS is formed after the multiplication of 2 -ve signs. I would like to explain point #2 of the gradient descent algorithm mentioned above, ‘iterate till not converged.‘ Here convergence refers to attaining the optimum solution within the pre-defined limit. It is checked using the value of the gradient. If the gradient is small enough, it means we are very close to the optimum, and further iterations won’t substantially impact the coefficients. The lower limit on the gradient can be changed using the ‘tol‘ parameter. Let’s consider the case of ridge regression now. Ridge Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of squares of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient would be: Again in the regularization part of a gradient, only w remains, and all others would become zero. The corresponding update rule is: j Here we can see that the second part of the RHS is the same as that of simple linear regression. Thus, ridge regression is equivalent to reducing the weight by a factor of (1-2λη) first and then applying the same update rule as simple linear regression. I hope this explains why the coefficients get reduced to small numbers but never become zero. Note that the criteria for convergence, in this case, remains similar to simple linear regression, i.e., checking the value of gradients. Let’s discuss Lasso regression now. Lasso Regression The objective function (also called the cost) to be minimized is the RSS plus the sum of the absolute value of the magnitude of weights. This can be depicted mathematically as: In this case, the gradient is not defined as the absolute function is not differentiable at x=0. This can be illustrated as: We can see that the parts on the left and right sides of 0 are straight lines with defined derivates, but the function can’t be differentiated at x=0. In this case, we have to use a different technique called coordinate descent, which is based on the concept of sub-gradients. One of the coordinate descent follows the following algorithms (this is also the default in sklearn): 1. initialize weights (say w=0) 2. iterate till not converged 2.1 iterate over all features (j=0,1...M) 2.1.1 update the jth weight with a value which minimizes the cost #2.1.1 might look too generalized. But I’m intentionally leaving the details and jumping to the update rule: Difference Between Actual and Predicted Outcome Here g(w-j) represents (but not exactly) the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome considering all EXCEPT the jth variable. If this value is small, it means that the algorithm is able to predict the outcome fairly well even without the jth variable, and thus it can be removed from the equation by setting a zero coefficient. This gives us some intuition into why the coefficients become zero in the case of lasso regression. In coordinate descent, checking convergence is another issue. Since gradients are not defined, we need an alternate method. Many alternatives exist, but the simplest one is to check the step size of the algorithm. We can check the maximum difference in weights in any particular cycle overall feature weights (#2.1 of the algorithm above). If this is lower than the specified ‘tol,’ the algorithm will stop. The convergence is not as fast as the gradient descent. If a warning appears saying that the algorithm stopped before convergence, we might have to set the ‘max_iter’ parameter. This is why I specified this parameter in the Lasso generic function. Let’s summarize our understanding by comparing the coefficients in all the three cases using the following visual, which shows how the ridge and lasso coefficients behave in comparison to the simple linear regression case. Reinforced Facts Apologies for the lack of visual appeal. But I think it is good enough to re-inforced the following facts: 1. The ridge coefficients are a reduced factor of the simple linear regression coefficients and thus never attain zero values but very small values. 2. The lasso coefficients become zero in a certain range and are reduced by a constant factor, which explains their low magnitude in comparison to the ridge. Before going further, one important issue in the case of both ridge and lasso regression is intercept handling. Generally, regularizing the intercept is not a good idea and should be left out of regularization. This requires slight changes in the implementation, which I’ll leave you to explore. Comparison Between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression Now that we have a fair idea of how ridge and lasso regression work, let’s try to consolidate our understanding by comparing them and appreciating their specific use cases. I will also compare them with some alternate approaches. Let’s analyze these under three buckets: Key Difference Ridge: It includes all (or none) of the features in the model. Thus, the major advantage of ridge regression is coefficient shrinkage and reducing model complexity. Lasso: Along with shrinking coefficients, the lasso also performs feature selection. (Remember the ‘selection‘ in the lasso full-form?) As we observed earlier, some of the coefficients become exactly zero, which is equivalent to the particular feature being excluded from the model. Traditionally, techniques like stepwise regression were used to perform feature selection and make parsimonious models. But with advancements in Machine-Learning, ridge and lasso regressions provide very good alternatives as they give much better output, require fewer tuning parameters, and can be automated to a large extent. Typical Use Cases Ridge: It is majorly used to prevent overfitting. Since it includes all the features, it is not very useful in the case of exorbitantly high #features, say in millions, as it will pose computational challenges. Lasso: Since it provides sparse solutions, it is generally the model of choice (or some variant of this concept) for modeling cases where the #features are in millions or more. In such a case, getting a sparse solution is of great computational advantage as the features with zero coefficients can be ignored. It’s not hard to see why the stepwise selection techniques become practically cumbersome to implement in highdimensionality cases. Thus, the lasso provides a significant advantage. Presence of Highly Correlated Features Ridge: It generally works well even in the presence of highly correlated features, as it will include all of them in the model. Still, the coefficients will be distributed among them depending on the correlation. Lasso: It arbitrarily selects any feature among the highly correlated ones and reduces the coefficients of the rest to zero. Also, the chosen variable changes randomly with changes in model parameters. This generally doesn’t work that well as compared to ridge regression. This disadvantage of the lasso can be observed in the example we discussed above. Since we used a polynomial regression, the variables were highly correlated. (Not sure why? Check the output of data.corr() ). Thus, we saw that even small values of alpha were giving significant sparsity (i.e., high #coefficients as zero). Along with Ridge and Lasso, Elastic Net is another useful technique that combines both L1 and L2 regularization. It can be used to balance out the pros and cons of ridge and lasso regression. I encourage you to explore it further. Conclusion In this article, we got an overview of regularization using ridge and lasso regression. We then found out why penalizing the magnitude of coefficients should give us parsimonious models. Next, we went into details of ridge and lasso regression and saw their advantages over simple linear regression. We also understood how and why they should work. We also peeked into the mathematical part of the regressions. Regularization techniques are really useful, and I encourage you to implement them. If you’re ready to take the challenge, you must try them on the BigMart Sales Prediction problem discussed at the beginning of this article. Key Takeaways Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In Python, scikit-learn provides easy-to-use functions for implementing Ridge and Lasso regression with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity in the input data by reducing the impact of correlated features on the coefficients, while Lasso regression automatically selects the most important features for prediction. Frequently Asked Questions Q1. Whatis ridge and lasso regression? A. Ridge and Lasso Regression are regularization techniques in machine learning. Ridge adds L2 regularization, and Lasso adds L1 to linear regression models, preventing overfitting. Q2. When to use ridge regression and when to use lasso regression? A.

The objective of ridge regression is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals (RSS) plus a term proportional to the square of the coefficient magnitudes (the L2 norm of the coefficients). Mathematically, the ridge regression objective is: [ text{Objective} = text{RSS} + alpha times text{L2 norm of coefficients} ] where RSS is the residual sum of squares, given by the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values, and α is the regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between fitting the data and keeping the model weights small. # Lasso Regression: Lasso regression, or L1 regularization, adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients. This approach not only helps in reducing overfitting but can also help in feature selection since some coefficients can become exactly zero when the penalty is applied. The objective of lasso regression is defined as: [ text{Objective} = text{RSS} + alpha times text{L1 norm of coefficients} ] Lasso regression tends to produce sparse models, which may be advantageous in scenarios with high dimensionality. # Key Differences: 1. **Penalty Term**: Ridge regression adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients, while lasso regression adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. 2. **Feature Selection**: Ridge regression includes all features in the final model, though the coefficients might be shrunk towards zero. Lasso regression, on the other hand, can zero out some of the coefficients, effectively performing feature selection and providing a sparse solution. 3. **Usage Scenarios**: - Ridge regression is typically used to prevent overfitting in models where the number of features is less than the number of observations or when there is multicollinearity among the features. - Lasso regression is used when a more parsimonious model is desired, i.e., a simpler model with fewer coefficients. It is particularly useful when the number of features is very high or greater than the number of observations. 4. **Computational Complexity**: Ridge regression can be computationally more efficient due to the square term in the loss function, which makes it differentiable and solvable via gradient-based optimization methods. Lasso regression, due to the absolute value in the penalty, may require more sophisticated optimization techniques like coordinate descent. # Implementation in Python: In Python, both ridge and lasso regression can be implemented using the \`sklearn.linear_model\` module, which contains the \`Ridge\` and \`Lasso\` classes, respectively. These implementations allow for easy tuning of the regularization parameter, as well as the use of cross-validation to find an optimal value for the regularization parameter."},{"instruction":"Alma heeft een lang leven gehad. Ze werd geboren op 18 mei van het jaar 1926. Ze is zo lang mogelijk thuis kunnen blijven. Na een verblijf van 2 weken in het ziekenhuis werd ze opgenomen in Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel. Ze is er een maand geweest. 30 jaar geleden stierf haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger. Drie kinderen zijn reeds overleden. Ze had vrede met het Woonzorgcentrum. Het eten was er goed. Schrijf een inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie. Hier is een voorbeeld van een andere uitvaart: Op de scharniermomenten van het leven zoeken en vinden mensen elkaar terug. Ook op een dag als vandaag, omwille van dit afscheid. Wat zover af leek, is nu plotseling heel dichtbij. Elke mens heeft zijn eigen verhaal elke mens heeft zijn eigen manier van rouwen en elke mens sterft zijn eigen dood. Leven, sterven, afscheid nemen, alles loslaten we doen het op onze eigen unieke manier het is een zeer eenzame bezigheid. Rond Jeanne zijn we hier samen om haar met eerbied te omringen, om dankbaar te gedenken wie zij was. Enerzijds kennen wij gevoelens van droefheid en verdriet omwille van Jeanne die ons ontvallen is, maar anderzijds is er ook dat gevoel van dankbaarheid om wat zij voor ons betekend heeft en wie zij voor ons is geweest. Jeanne heeft heel veel voor deze parochiegemeenschap gedaan. Ze was steeds bereid om anderen te helpen. Jeanne had een sterke persoonlijkheid en kon heel goed organiseren. Ze heeft steeds haar talenten ten volle benut. Om de naam van Jeanne als onvervangbaar in onze herinnering te bewaren, om de hoop die zij gekoesterd heeft als een fakkel door te geven, om de levenswijsheid van Jeanne aan mekaar door te geven. Wij vragen om vergeving. Schrijf ook een homilie. Dit is het evangelie:","output":"Aangezien je geen specifiek evangelie hebt opgegeven, zal ik accepteren dat je een algemene homilie wilt die bij elke lezing zou kunnen passen.

Zoals de seizoenen elkaar opvolgen, zo markeren gebeurtenissen onze reis door de tijd. Vandaag hebben wij ons verzameld rond Alma, onze geliefde moeder, grootmoeder, en vriendin, om haar te herdenken en haar leven te vieren. Geboren in een wereld die heel anders was dan de onze vandaag, op 18 mei 1926, heeft Alma een rijk en vol leven geleid, waarin haar liefde, kracht en zorgzaamheid ons allen hebben aangeraakt. Zij bleef standvastig, zelfs na het verlies van haar dierbare echtgenoot Gaby, dertig jaar geleden, en het ontzettend verdrietige afscheid van drie van haar kinderen. Alma's veerkracht bleef echter ongebroken, getuige van een onuitputtelijke innerlijke kracht. Met sereniteit heeft zij de wisseling van haar thuis naar Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel aanvaard, waar haar laatste dagen werden gekenmerkt door rust en goede zorg. Zij vond vrede in de schoot van een nieuwe gemeenschap, omgeven door de warmte van de mensen daar. Vandaag komen we samen om ons niet alleen te verenigen in ons verdriet, maar ook om onze dankbaarheid te delen voor de tijd die we met Alma hebben doorgebracht. Met respect gedenken we haar leven, haar liefde en haar nalatenschap. Laat ons nu in stilte en gemeenschap gedenken wat ze ons geleerd en gegeven heeft. Homilie: Lieve aanwezigen, Het afscheid van een geliefde brengt ons vaak samen in een ruimte waar woorden tekortschieten en waar onze emoties de diepte van onze ziel beroeren. Toch zijn we vandaag hier, verenigd aan de voeten van het altaar, om troost te vinden in de woorden van ons geloof en de belofte van eeuwig leven. De heilige schrift spreekt vaak over de vruchten die een leven goed geleefd kan voortbrengen. In het evangelie leren we over liefde, compassie, zorg voor de anderen, en een onwankelbare hoop in de aanwezigheid van God, zelfs in tijden van verlies en verdriet. Alma's leven vertegenwoordigt deze evangelische waarden. Haar bestaan was doordrenkt met de liefde die zij schonk aan haar familie, met de zorg waarmee zij haar kinderen en kleinkinderen omarmde, en met de vriendelijkheid en genegenheid die ze deelde met iedereen die haar kende. We kunnen niet spreken over Alma zonder het licht aan te raken dat zij uitstraalde ondanks de duisternis die haar soms omhulde. Zij wist als geen ander het beste van elke situatie te maken, zoals blijkt uit haar aanvaarding en tevredenheid binnen de muren van Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel. Hoewel wij vandaag misschien worstelen met vragen waarom en tranen die onze wang strelen, herinnert het evangelie ons ook aan de hoop die we mogen koesteren. Er is geen afscheid dat eeuwig duurt, geen scheiding die niet, op een dag, door de warmte van herinneringen en de zekerheid van wederzien, geheeld zal worden. Dus terwijl we vandaag Alma's leven gedenken, laten we niet vergeten wat zij ons heeft geleerd: om elke dag met moed en gratie aan te gaan, om de zorgen en liefde te delen die we in onze harten dragen, en om altijd te blijven zoeken naar de vrede die zij nu gevonden heeft in de armen van onze Schepper. Moge Alma rusten in vrede en moge wij troost vinden in de gedachte dat haar geest en liefde altijd bij ons zullen blijven. Amen."},{"instruction":"Alma heeft een lang leven gehad. Ze werd geboren op 18 mei van het jaar 1926. Ze is zo lang mogelijk thuis kunnen blijven. Na een verblijf van 2 weken in het ziekenhuis werd ze opgenomen in Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel. Ze is er een maand geweest. 30 jaar geleden stierf haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger. Drie kinderen zijn reeds overleden. Ze had vrede met het Woonzorgcentrum. Het eten was er goed. Schrijf een inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie. Hier is een voorbeeld van een andere uitvaart: Op de scharniermomenten van het leven zoeken en vinden mensen elkaar terug. Ook op een dag als vandaag, omwille van dit afscheid. Wat zover af leek, is nu plotseling heel dichtbij. Elke mens heeft zijn eigen verhaal elke mens heeft zijn eigen manier van rouwen en elke mens sterft zijn eigen dood. Leven, sterven, afscheid nemen, alles loslaten we doen het op onze eigen unieke manier het is een zeer eenzame bezigheid. Rond Jeanne zijn we hier samen om haar met eerbied te omringen, om dankbaar te gedenken wie zij was. Enerzijds kennen wij gevoelens van droefheid en verdriet omwille van Jeanne die ons ontvallen is, maar anderzijds is er ook dat gevoel van dankbaarheid om wat zij voor ons betekend heeft en wie zij voor ons is geweest. Jeanne heeft heel veel voor deze parochiegemeenschap gedaan. Ze was steeds bereid om anderen te helpen. Jeanne had een sterke persoonlijkheid en kon heel goed organiseren. Ze heeft steeds haar talenten ten volle benut. Om de naam van Jeanne als onvervangbaar in onze herinnering te bewaren, om de hoop die zij gekoesterd heeft als een fakkel door te geven, om de levenswijsheid van Jeanne aan mekaar door te geven. Wij vragen om vergeving. Schrijf ook een homilie. Dit is het evangelie: (Matteüs 11, 25-30) “In die tijd zei Jezus: “Ik loof U, Vader, Heer van hemel en aarde, omdat U deze dingen voor wijzen en verstandigen verborgen hebt gehouden, maar ze aan eenvoudige mensen hebt onthuld. Ja, Vader, zo hebt U het gewild. Alles is Mij toevertrouwd door mijn Vader, en niemand dan de Vader weet wie de Zoon is, en wie de Vader is, dat weet alleen de Zoon, en iedereen aan wie de Zoon het wil openbaren. Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven. Neem mijn juk op je en leer van Mij, want ik ben zachtmoedig en nederig van hart. Dan zullen jullie werkelijk rust vinden, want mijn juk is zacht en mijn last is licht.” Dit is een voorbeeld van een homilie van een andere uitvaart: Iemand ontvalt ons... Dit zijn de ogenblikken dat we samen zitten als verslagen kinderen. Ontredderd, ontheemd, sprakeloos en kwetsbaar. Het is moeilijk om te begrijpen wat de dood is. Niet alleen als je klein bent, ook als je groot bent. Ooit zal een mens stoppen met leven. Soms merk je dat iemand niet lang meer zal leven. De dood kan snel komen. De ene dag is de mens er nog. De andere dag is hij weg. Door het overlijden van Paula er is wezenlijk iets veranderd. Bij het sterven van iemand gebeurt er iets essentieel. Paula Boomans werd geboren te Neder-Over-Heembeek op 2 februari van het jaar 1945. Als jong volwassen vrouw werd zij geconfronteerd met het overlijden van ouders en van haar broer. Tijdens die periode leerde ze Gilbert Willems, haar toekomstige echtgenoot kennen. Ze kregen twee fantastische kinderen: Karen en Peter. Paula heeft tot in het jaar 1978 in La Grande Ferme, haar ouderlijk huis in de Ransbeekstraat gewoond. Haar moeder hield er het café open en haar vader had er een houtzagerij en een transportbedrijf. Daarna verhuisde ze naar de Trassersweg. Paula werkte bij een farmaceutisch bedrijf dat gesloten werd. Daardoor werd Paula op vijftigjarige leeftijd verplicht op pensioen gesteld. Paula was een stille vrouw. Ze heeft haar echtgenoot steeds terzijde gestaan in de uitoefening van verschillende hobby’s. Zo waren er de activiteiten van het Davidsfonds, de volksdansgroep Lendrik en de muziekgroep Faro. Er was Blackstar. Paula ging mee naar de rolschaats activiteiten van haar dochter. Ze was een goede gastvrouw. Er waren ook de mooie momenten aan zee. Ze hield van haar kinderen en kleinkinderen. Ook de hond Bo nam een centrale plaats in het gezin in. Paula vierde de belangrijke momenten van haar jaar samen met familie. Ze gaf teveel snoepjes aan de kleinkinkinderen. Wat Paula ons gegeven heeft, blijft kostbaar en onuitwisbaar. Niemand neemt het van ons af. Zo heeft ooit een vertwijfeld volk - generaties lang - mensen die zich verloren voelden, die geen vrede vonden met wat ze om zich heen zagen gebeuren, tot God geroepen. En in dat dieptepunt werd hun een heel andere toekomst toegezegd: \\"Klamp je niet vast aan wat vroeger is gebeurd. Staar je niet blind op wat voorafging. Zie, iets nieuws ga Ik maken. Het is al aan het kiemen, weet jij dat niet? Ja, een weg zal Ik leggen door de woestijn... Ik geef water waar geen water is... Er gebeurt iets nieuws, het was al aan het kiemen, wij wisten het niet...” Maar niet dat verdriet zal onze herinnering onherroepelijk overschaduwen maar de herinnering aan de mens die zij is geweest. Alles wat zij gedaan heeft. Wie zij voor ons is geweest. In het bijbelfragment uit het Evangelie richt Jezus zich tot de vermoeide levenden. De kerngedachte luidt: 'Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal Ik jullie rust geven.' \\"Mijn juk is zacht ; zegt Jezus, \\"en mijn last is licht\\" Jezus neemt de lasten niet weg in een handomdraai. Let wel: het juk blijft en de lasten blijven eveneens. Ze worden draaglijk. Er valt mee te leven. De laatste veertien dagen stond de wereld van het gezin Willems-Bomans op zijn kop. Paula vernam dat zij een agressieve kanker had waar niets meer aan te doen was. Haar levensperspectief werd zeer kort. Omringd door haar dierbaren is Paula van ons heengegaan. Bedankt Paula voor alles wat je gedaan hebt, voor de mens die jij geweest bent, voor je onverwoestbare kern.","output":"Inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie van Alma: In het stille licht van deze dag zijn we hier samen gekomen, aan de drempel van de eeuwigheid, om afscheid te nemen van Alma, onze geliefde moeder, grootmoeder, en trouwe vriendin. Geboren op 18 mei 1926, wandelde Alma door verschillende tijden en zag de wereld veranderen. Zij heeft een lang en waardevol leven geleid en tot het laatst heeft ze geprobeerd om in de warmte van haar eigen thuis te blijven. Haar veerkracht werd op de proef gesteld na het overlijden van haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger, nu dertig jaar geleden, en met het verdriet van het verlies van drie van haar kinderen. Toch heeft Alma de kracht gevonden om verder te gaan, zich aan te passen aan een nieuw hoofdstuk in Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel, waar ze vrede en zorgzaamheid heeft ervaren. Vandaag herdenken wij op diezelfde wijze de volheid van Alma's leven; de momenten van liefde en verlies, van vasthoudendheid en aanvaarding. De herinneringen aan Alma zijn als een mozaïek van ervaringen die samenkomen in onze gedachten. We voelen het gemis, maar ook een diepe dankbaarheid voor alle liefde die ze ons heeft gegeven. Met respect en eerbied omringen we Alma nu met ons gebed en onze gedachten. We vieren het leven van een vrouw die ons heeft geleerd wat het betekent om veerkrachtig en waardig te zijn, zelfs wanneer de dagen uitdagend werden. Alma heeft ons getoond hoe je met gratie kunt verouderen en in harmonie kunt leven met de onvermijdbare veranderingen van het leven. Laten we in deze uren van afscheid Alma eren door het goede te herinneren, de kracht die ze ons heeft getoond, en de liefde die ze onbeperkt deelde. Haar verhaal, haar weg, haar herinnering leven voort in ons allen. Homilie gebaseerd op Matteüs 11, 25-30: Broeders en zusters in verdriet en hoop, In het hart van ons geloof staan woorden van troost die vandaag, hier, bij het afscheid van Alma, bijzonder resoneren. De woorden van Jezus uit Matteüs' evangelie, \\"Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven,\\" weerklinken als een belofte van vrede voor onze geliefde die van ons is heengegaan. Alma heeft haar lasten gedragen doorheen haar leven, zoals wij allen doen. Ze heeft liefgehad, verlies geleden, en vond vreugde in de kleine dingen - zoals het goede eten in haar laatste thuis, Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel. Omringd door de mensen en een gemeenschap die haar verzorgden, vond ze een plek van rust. Deze woorden van het evangelie herinneren ons eraan dat, ongeacht hoe zwaar de last lijkt, we niet alleen zijn in onze vermoeidheid en strijd. Alma heeft, net zoals wij, het leven ervaren als een reis met hoogtepunten en dalen. Zij heeft de uitnodiging van Jezus omarmd om rust te vinden in haar hart en ziel. In Alma’s leven zien we de belichaming van zachtmoedigheid en nederigheid, zoals Jezus ons leert. Haar aanvaarding en tevredenheid met het leven, ondanks de verliezen die ze heeft geleden, spreken tot ons van een innerlijke vrede en een vertrouwen in iets groter dan wijzelf. Vandaag, als we afscheid nemen van Alma, vragen we ook om dezelfde rust en vrede voor haar. Mogen we troost vinden in de gedachte dat haar zachtmoedige en nederige hart nu volledige rust heeft gevonden bij onze Vader in de hemel. Laten we ons eigen juk dragen met de kracht en waardigheid die Alma ons heeft voorgeleefd, en laten we haar nalatenschap van liefde en veerkracht voortzetten. En moge dit evangelie ons herinneren aan de rust die beschikbaar is voor een ieder van ons - een rust die Alma nu volledig kent. Moge Alma's ziel rusten in de vredige armen van onze Heer en moge onze herinneringen aan haar een constante bron van troost en inspiratie zijn. Amen."},{"instruction":"what are all topics in this content: Logis&c( Regression( Classifica&on( Machine(Learning( Andrew(Ng( Classifica(on+ Email:(Spam(/(Not(Spam?( Online(Transac&ons:(Fraudulent((Yes(/(No)?( Tumor:(Malignant(/(Benign(?( 0:(“Nega&ve(Class”((e.g.,(benign(tumor)( 1:(“Posi&ve(Class”((e.g.,(malignant(tumor)( Andrew(Ng( Tumor(Size( Threshold(classifier(output(((((((((((((at(0.5:( If((((((((((((((((((((((((,(predict(“y(=(1”( If((((((((((((((((((((((((,(predict(“y(=(0”( Tumor(Size( Malignant(?( (Yes)(1( (No)(0( Andrew(Ng( Classifica&on:((((y(((=(((0(((or(((1( can(be(>(1(or(<(0( Logis&c(Regression:( Logis&c( Regression( Hypothesis( Representa&on( Machine(Learning( Andrew(Ng( Sigmoid(func&on( Logis&c(func&on( Logis(c+Regression+Model+ Want( 1( 0.5( 0( Andrew(Ng( Interpreta(on+of+Hypothesis+Output+ =(es&mated(probability(that(y(=(1(on(input(x(( Tell(pa&ent(that(70%(chance(of(tumor(being(malignant(( Example:((If(( “probability(that(y(=(1,(given(x,( ((parameterized(by((((”( Logis&c( Regression( Decision(boundary( Machine(Learning( Andrew(Ng( Logis(c+regression+ ((Suppose(predict(“((((((((((“(if( ((((predict(“((((((((((“((if( z 1 Andrew(Ng( x1( x2( Decision+Boundary+ 1 2 3 1 2 3 Predict(“((((((((((“(if(( Andrew(Ng( Non?linear+decision+boundaries+ x1( x2( Predict(“((((((((((“(if(( x1( x2( \`1 1 \`1 1 Logis&c( Regression( Cost(func&on( Machine(Learning( Andrew(Ng( Training( set:( How(to(choose(parameters((((?( m(examples( Andrew(Ng( Cost+func(on+ Linear(regression:( “non\`convex”( “convex”( Andrew(Ng( Logis(c+regression+cost+func(on+ If(y(=(1( 0( 1( Andrew(Ng( Logis(c+regression+cost+func(on+ If(y(=(0( 0( 1( Logis&c( Regression( Simplified(cost(func&on( and(gradient(descent( Machine(Learning( Andrew(Ng( Logis(c+regression+cost+func(on+ Andrew(Ng( Output(( Logis(c+regression+cost+func(on+ To(fit(parameters((((:(( To(make(a(predic&on(given(new(((:( Andrew(Ng( Gradient+Descent+ Want((((((((((((((((((((:( Repeat (simultaneously(update(all((((()( Andrew(Ng( Gradient+Descent+ Want((((((((((((((((((((:( (simultaneously(update(all((((()( Repeat Algorithm(looks(iden&cal(to(linear(regression!( Logis&c( Regression( Advanced(( op&miza&on( Machine(Learning( Andrew(Ng( Op(miza(on+algorithm+ Cost(func&on(((((((((.(Want((((((((((((((((((((.( Given((((,(we(have(code(that(can(compute( \` (( \` (( (for((((((((((((((((((((((((((((()( Repeat Gradient(descent:( Andrew(Ng( Op(miza(on+algorithm+ Given((((,(we(have(code(that(can(compute( \` (( \` (( (for((((((((((((((((((((((((((((()( Op&miza&on(algorithms:( \` Gradient(descent( \` Conjugate(gradient( \` BFGS( \` L\`BFGS( Advantages:( \` No(need(to(manually(pick(( \` Oeen(faster(than(gradient( descent.( Disadvantages:( \` More(complex( Andrew(Ng( Example:( function [jVal, gradient] = costFunction(theta) jVal = (theta(1)-5)^2 + ...

Linear Least Squares Regression Modeling Workhorse Linear least squares regression is by far the most widely used modeling method. It is what most people mean when they say they have used \\"regression\\", \\"linear regression\\" or \\"least squares\\" to fit a model to their data. Not only is linear least squares regression the most widely used modeling method, but it has been adapted to a broad range of situations that are outside its direct scope. It plays a strong underlying role in many other modeling methods, including the other methods discussed in this section: nonlinear least squares regression, weighted least squares regression and LOESS. Definition of a Linear Least Squares Model Used directly, with an appropriate data set, linear least squares regression can be used to fit the data with any function of the form in which 1. each explanatory variable in the function is multiplied by an unknown parameter, 2. there is at most one unknown parameter with no corresponding explanatory variable, and 3. all of the individual terms are summed to produce the final function value. In statistical terms, any function that meets these criteria would be called a \\"linear function\\". The term \\"linear\\" is used, even though the function may not be a straight line, because if the unknown parameters are considered to be variables and the explanatory variables are considered to be known coefficients corresponding to those \\"variables\\", then the problem becomes a system (usually overdetermined) of linear equations that can be solved for the values of the unknown parameters. To differentiate the various meanings of the word \\"linear\\", the linear models being discussed here are often said to be \\"linear in the parameters\\" or \\"statistically linear\\". Why \\"Least Squares\\"? Linear least squares regression also gets its name from the way the estimates of the unknown parameters are computed. The \\"method of least squares\\" that is used to f(x;⃗ β) ⃗ = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + … obtain parameter estimates was independently developed in the late 1700's and the early 1800's by the mathematicians Karl Friedrich Gauss, Adrien Marie Legendre and (possibly) Robert Adrain [Stigler (1978)] [Harter (1983)] [Stigler (1986)] working in Germany, France and America, respectively. In the least squares method the unknown parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared deviations between the data and the model. The minimization process reduces the overdetermined system of equations formed by the data to a sensible system of , (where is the number of parameters in the functional part of the model) equations in unknowns. This new system of equations is then solved to obtain the parameter estimates. To learn more about how the method of least squares is used to estimate the parameters, see Section 4.4.3.1. Examples of Linear Functions As just mentioned above, linear models are not limited to being straight lines or planes, but include a fairly wide range of shapes. For example, a simple quadratic curve, is linear in the statistical sense. A straight-line model in , or a polynomial in , is also linear in the statistical sense because they are linear in the parameters, though not with respect to the observed explanatory variable, . Nonlinear Model Example Just as models that are linear in the statistical sense do not have to be linear with respect to the explanatory variables, nonlinear models can be linear with respect to the explanatory variables, but not with respect to the parameters. For example, is linear in , but it cannot be written in the general form of a linear model presented above. This is because the slope of this line is expressed as the product of two parameters. As a result, nonlinear least squares regression could be used to fit this model, but linear least squares cannot be used. For further examples and discussion of nonlinear models see the next section, Section 4.1.4.2. Advantages of Linear Least Squares Linear least squares regression has earned its place as the primary tool for process modeling because of its effectiveness and completeness. p p p f(x; β) = + x + , ⃗ β0 β1 β11x 2 log(x) f(x; β) = + ln(x), ⃗ β0 β1 sin(x) f(x; β) = + sin(x) + sin(2x) + sin(3x), ⃗ β0 β1 β2 β3 x f(x; β) = + x ⃗ β0 β0β1 x Though there are types of data that are better described by functions that are nonlinear in the parameters, many processes in science and engineering are well-described by linear models. This is because either the processes are inherently linear or because, over short ranges, any process can be well-approximated by a linear model. The estimates of the unknown parameters obtained from linear least squares regression are the optimal estimates from a broad class of possible parameter estimates under the usual assumptions used for process modeling. Practically speaking, linear least squares regression makes very efficient use of the data. Good results can be obtained with relatively small data sets. Finally, the theory associated with linear regression is wellunderstood and allows for construction of different types of easily-interpretable statistical intervals for predictions, calibrations, and optimizations. These statistical intervals can then be used to give clear answers to scientific and engineering questions. Disadvantages of Linear Least Squares The main disadvantages of linear least squares are limitations in the shapes that linear models can assume over long ranges, possibly poor extrapolation properties, and sensitivity to outliers. Linear models with nonlinear terms in the predictor variables curve relatively slowly, so for inherently nonlinear processes it becomes increasingly difficult to find a linear model that fits the data well as the range of the data increases. As the explanatory variables become extreme, the output of the linear model will also always more extreme. This means that linear models may not be effective for extrapolating the results of a process for which data cannot be collected in the region of interest. Of course extrapolation is potentially dangerous regardless of the model type. Finally, while the method of least squares often gives optimal estimates of the unknown parameters, it is very sensitive to the presence of unusual data points in the data used to fit a model. One or two outliers can sometimes seriously skew the results of a least squares analysis. This makes model validation, especially with respect to outliers, critical to obtaining sound answers to the questions motivating the construction of the model. 4. Process Modeling 4.1. Introduction to Process Modeling 4.1.4. What are some of the different statistical methods for model building? 4.1.4.2. Nonlinear Least Squares Regression Extension of Linear Least Squares Regression Nonlinear least squares regression extends linear least squares regression for use with a much larger and more general class of functions. Almost any function that can be written in closed form can be incorporated in a nonlinear regression model. Unlike linear regression, there are very few limitations on the way parameters can be used in the functional part of a nonlinear regression model. The way in which the unknown parameters in the function are estimated, however, is conceptually the same as it is in linear least squares regression. Definition of a Nonlinear Regression Model As the name suggests, a nonlinear model is any model of the basic form, in which 1. the functional part of the model is not linear with respect to the unknown parameters, , and 2. the method of least squares is used to estimate the values of the unknown parameters. Due to the way in which the unknown parameters of the function are usually estimated, however, it is often much easier to work with models that meet two additional criteria: 3. the function is smooth with respect to the unknown parameters, and 4. the least squares criterion that is used to obtain the parameter estimates has a unique solution. These last two criteria are not essential parts of the definition of a nonlinear least squares model, but are of practical importance. Examples of Nonlinear Models Some examples of nonlinear models include: y = f(x;⃗ β) + ε , ⃗ β0, β1, … f(x; β) ⃗ = β0 + β1x 1 + β2x Advantages of Nonlinear Least Squares The biggest advantage of nonlinear least squares regression over many other techniques is the broad range of functions that can be fit. Although many scientific and engineering processes can be described well using linear models, or other relatively simple types of models, there are many other processes that are inherently nonlinear. For example, the strengthening of concrete as it cures is a nonlinear process. Research on concrete strength shows that the strength increases quickly at first and then levels off, or approaches an asymptote in mathematical terms, over time. Linear models do not describe processes that asymptote very well because for all linear functions the function value can't increase or decrease at a declining rate as the explanatory variables go to the extremes. There are many types of nonlinear models, on the other hand, that describe the asymptotic behavior of a process well. Like the asymptotic behavior of some processes, other features of physical processes can often be expressed more easily using nonlinear models than with simpler model types. Being a \\"least squares\\" procedure, nonlinear least squares has some of the same advantages (and disadvantages) that linear least squares regression has over other methods. One common advantage is efficient use of data. Nonlinear regression can produce good estimates of the unknown parameters in the model with relatively small data sets. Another advantage that nonlinear least squares shares with linear least squares is a fairly well-developed theory for computing confidence, prediction and calibration intervals to answer scientific and engineering questions. In most cases the probabilistic interpretation of the intervals produced by nonlinear regression are only approximately correct, but these intervals still work very well in practice. Disadvantages of Nonlinear Least Squares The major cost of moving to nonlinear least squares regression from simpler modeling techniques like linear least squares is the need to use iterative optimization procedures to compute the parameter estimates. With functions that are linear in the parameters, the least squares estimates of the parameters can always be obtained analytically, while that is generally not the case with nonlinear models. The use of iterative procedures requires the user to provide starting values for the unknown parameters before the software can begin the optimization. The starting values must be reasonably close to the as yet unknown parameter estimates or the optimization procedure may not converge. Bad starting values can also cause the f(x; β) ⃗ = β1x β2 f(x; β) = + exp(− x) ⃗ β0 β1 β2 f(x;⃗ β) = sin( + ) + cos( + ) ⃗ β1 β2 β3x1 β4 β5 β6x2 software to converge to a local minimum rather than the global minimum that defines the least squares estimates. Disadvantages shared with the linear least squares procedure includes a strong sensitivity to outliers. Just as in a linear least squares analysis, the presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously affect the results of a nonlinear analysis. In addition there are unfortunately fewer model validation tools for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than there are for linear regression. Home Aniruddha Bhandari — Updated On October 27th, 2023 Beginner Data Engineering Python Regression Structured Data Technique Master the Art of Data Science: A Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming an Industry-Ready Data Scientist Download Roadmap × Feature engineering is a critical step in building accurate and effective machine learning models. One key aspect of feature engineering is scaling, normalization, and standardization, which involves transforming the data to make it more suitable for modeling. These techniques can help to improve model performance, reduce the impact of outliers, and ensure that the data is on the same scale. In this article, we will explore the concepts of scaling, normalization, and standardization, including why they are important and how to apply them to different types of data. By the end of this article, you’ll have a thorough understanding of these essential feature engineering techniques and be able to apply them to your own machine learning projects. Table of contents What is Feature Scaling? Why Should we Use Feature Scaling? What is Normalization? What is Standardization? The Big Question – Normalize or Standardize? Implementing Feature Scaling in Python Comparing Unscaled, Normalized, and Standardized Data Applying Scaling to Machine Learning Algorithms Frequently Asked Questions What is Feature Scaling? Feature scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to transform the values of features or variables in a dataset to a similar scale. The purpose is to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model and to avoid the domination of features with larger values. Feature scaling becomes necessary when dealing with datasets containing features that have different ranges, units of measurement, or orders of magnitude. In such cases, the variation in feature values can lead to biased model performance or difficulties during the learning process. There are several common techniques for feature scaling, including standardization, normalization, and min-max scaling. These methods adjust the feature values while preserving their relative relationships and distributions. By applying feature scaling, the dataset’s features can be transformed to a more consistent scale, making it easier to build accurate and effective machine learning models. Scaling facilitates meaningful comparisons between features, improves model convergence, and prevents certain features from overshadowing others based solely on their magnitude. Why Should we Use Feature Scaling? Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling, while others are virtually invariant. Let’s explore these in more depth: 1. Gradient Descent Based Algorithms Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, PCA (principal component analysis), etc., that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. Take a look at the formula for gradient descent below: The presence of feature value X in the formula will affect the step size of the gradient descent. The difference in the ranges of features will cause different step sizes for each feature. To ensure that the gradient descent moves smoothly towards the minima and that the steps for gradient descent are updated at the same rate for all the features, we scale the data before feeding it to the model. 2. Distance-Based Algorithms Distance algorithms like KNN, K-means clustering, and SVM(support vector machines) are most affected by the range of features. This is because, behind the scenes, they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity. For example, let’s say we have data containing high school CGPA scores of students (ranging from 0 to 5) and their future incomes (in thousands Rupees): Since both the features have different scales, there is a chance that higher weightage is given to features with higher magnitudes. This will impact the performance of the machine learning algorithm; obviously, we do not want our algorithm to be biased towards one feature. “ Having features on a similar scale can help the gradient descent converge more quickly towards the minima. ‘ Therefore, we scale our data before employing a distance based algorithm so that all the features contribute equally to the result. The effect of scaling is conspicuous when we compare the Euclidean distance between data points for students A and B, and between B and C, before and after scaling, as shown below: Distance AB before scaling => Distance BC before scaling => Distance AB after scaling => Distance BC after scaling => 3. Tree-Based Algorithms Tree-based algorithms, on the other hand, are fairly insensitive to the scale of the features. Think about it, a decision tree only splits a node based on a single feature. The decision tree splits a node on a feature that increases the homogeneity of the node. Other features do not influence this split on a feature. So, the remaining features have virtually no effect on the split. This is what makes them invariant to the scale of the features! What is Normalization? Normalization is a data preprocessing technique used to adjust the values of features in a dataset to a common scale. This is done to facilitate data analysis and modeling, and to reduce the impact of different scales on the accuracy of machine learning models. Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. Itis also known as Min-Max scaling. Here’s the formula for normalization: Here, Xmax and Xmin are the maximum and the minimum values of the feature, respectively. When the value of X is the minimum value in the column, the numerator will be 0, and hence X’ is 0 On the other hand, when the value of X is the maximum value in the column, the numerator is equal to the denominator, and thus the value of X’ is 1 If the value of X is between the minimum and the maximum value, then the value of X’ is between 0 and 1 What is Standardization? Standardization is another scaling method where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero, and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation. Here’s the formula for standardization: is the mean of the feature values and is the standard deviation of the feature values. Note that, in this case, the values are not restricted to a particular range. Now, the big question in your mind must be when should we use normalization and when should we use standardization? Let’s find out! The Big Question – Normalize or Standardize? Normalization Standardization Rescales values to a range between 0 and 1 Centers data around the mean and scales to a standard deviation of 1 Useful when the distribution of the data is unknown or not Gaussian Useful when the distribution of the data is Gaussian or unknown Sensitive to outliers Less sensitive to outliers Retains the shape of the original distribution Changes the shape of the original distribution May not preserve the relationships between the data points Preserves the relationships between the data points Equation: (x – min)/(max – min) Equation: (x – mean)/standard deviation However, at the end of the day, the choice of using normalization or standardization will depend on your problem and the machine learning algorithm you are using. There is no hard and fast rule to tell you when to normalize or standardize your data. You can always start by fitting your model to raw, normalized, and standardized data and comparing the performance for the best results. It is a good practice to fit the scaler on the training data and then use it to transform the testing data. This would avoid any data leakage during the model testing process. Also, the scaling of target values is generally not required. Implementing Feature Scaling in Python Now comes the fun part – putting what we have learned into practice. I will be applying feature scaling to a few machine-learning algorithms on the Big Mart dataset. I’ve taken on the DataHack platform. I will skip the preprocessing steps since they are out of the scope of this tutorial. But you can find them neatly explained in this article. Those steps will enable you to reach the top 20 percentile on the hackathon leaderboard, so that’s worth checking out! view raw So, let’s first split our data into training and testing sets: Python Code: @ShilpiMazumdar1/feature_scaling A Nix repl by ShilpiMazumdar1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 42 SH Before moving to the feature scaling part, let’s glance at the details of our data using the pd.describe() method: We can see that there is a huge difference in the range of values present in our numerical features: Item_Visibility, Item_Weight, Item_MRP, and Outlet_Establishment_Year. Let’s try and fix that using feature scaling! Note: You will notice negative values in the Item_Visibility feature because I have taken log-transformation to deal with the skewness in the feature. Normalization Using sklearn (scikit-learn) To normalize your data, you need to import the MinMaxScaler from the sklearn library and apply it to our dataset. So, let’s do that! NormalizationVsStandarization_2.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Let’s see how normalization has affected our dataset: 1 # data normalization with sklearn 2 from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler 3 4 # fit scaler on training data 5 norm = MinMaxScaler().fit(X_train) 6 7 # transform training data 8 X_train_norm = norm.transform(X_train) 9 10 # transform testing dataabs 11 X_test_norm = norm.transform(X_test) view raw All the features now have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. Perfect! Try out the above code in the live coding window below!! @LakshayArora1/FeatureScaling A Python repl by LakshayArora1 Open on Replit Show code 0 Run 22 LA Next, let’s try to standardize our data. Standardization Using sklearn To standardize your data, you need to import the StandardScaler from the sklearn library and apply it to our dataset. Here’s how you can do it: NormalizationVsStandarization_3.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 1 # data standardization with sklearn 2 from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler 3 4 # copy of datasets 5 X_train_stand = X_train.copy() 6 X_test_stand = X_test.copy() 7 8 # numerical features 9 num_cols = ['Item_Weight','Item_Visibility','Item_MRP','Outlet_Establishment_Year'] 10 11 # apply standardization on numerical features 12 for i in num_cols: 13 14 # fit on training data column 15 scale = StandardScaler().fit(X_train_stand[[i]]) 16 17 # transform the training data column 18 X_train_stand[i] = scale.transform(X_train_stand[[i]]) 19 20 # transform the testing data column 21 X_test_stand[i] = scale.transform(X_test_stand[[i]]) You would have noticed that I only applied standardization to my numerical columns, not the other One-Hot Encoded features. Standardizing the One-Hot encoded features would mean assigning a distribution to categorical features. You don’t want to do that! But why did I not do the same while normalizing the data? Because One-Hot encoded features are already in the range between 0 to 1. So, normalization would not affect their value. Right, let’s have a look at how standardization has transformed our data: The numerical features are now centered on the mean with a unit standard deviation. Awesome! Comparing Unscaled, Normalized, and Standardized Data It is always great to visualize your data to understand the distribution present. We can see the comparison between our unscaled and scaled data using boxplots. You can learn more about data visualization here. You can notice how scaling the features brings everything into perspective. The features are now more comparable and will have a similar effect on the learning models. Applying Scaling to Machine Learning Algorithms It’s now time to train some machine learning algorithms on our data to compare the effects of different scaling techniques on the algorithm’s performance. I want to see the effect of scaling on three algorithms in particular: KNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regressor, and Decision Tree. K-Nearest Neighbors As we saw before, KNN is a distance-based algorithm that is affected by the range of features. Let’s see how it performs on our data before and after scaling: NormalizationVsStandarization_4.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub view raw You can see that scaling the features has brought down the RMSE score of our KNN model. Specifically, the normalized data performs a tad bit better than the standardized data. Note: I am measuring the RMSE here because this competition evaluates the RMSE. Support Vector Regressor SVR is another distance-based algorithm. So let’s check out whether it works better with normalization or standardization: 1 # training a KNN model 2 from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # knn 7 knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=7) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train, X_train_norm, X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test, X_test_norm, X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 knn.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict 21 pred = knn.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_knn = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_knn 1 # training an SVR model 2 from sklearn.svm import SVR 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # SVR 7 svr = SVR(kernel='rbf',C=5) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train, X_train_norm, X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test, X_test_norm, X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 svr.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict view raw view raw NormalizationVsStandarization_5.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub We can see that scaling the features does bring down the RMSE score. And the standardized data has performed better than the normalized data. Why do you think that’s the case? The sklearn documentation states that SVM, with RBF kernel, assumes that all the features are centered around zero and variance is of the same order. This is because a feature with a variance greater than that of others prevents the estimator from learning from all the features. Great! Decision Tree We already know that a Decision tree is invariant to feature scaling. But I wanted to show a practical example of how it performs on the data: NormalizationVsStandarization_6.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 21 pred = svr.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_svr = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_svr 1 # training a Decision Tree model 2 from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor 3 # measuring RMSE score 4 from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error 5 6 # Decision tree 7 dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=10,random_state=27) 8 9 rmse = [] 10 11 # raw, normalized and standardized training and testing data 12 trainX = [X_train,X_train_norm,X_train_stand] 13 testX = [X_test,X_test_norm,X_test_stand] 14 15 # model fitting and measuring RMSE 16 for i in range(len(trainX)): 17 18 # fit 19 dt.fit(trainX[i],y_train) 20 # predict 21 pred = dt.predict(testX[i]) 22 # RMSE 23 rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred))) 24 25 # visualizing the result 26 df_dt = pd.DataFrame({'RMSE':rmse},index=['Original','Normalized','Standardized']) 27 df_dt You can see that the RMSE score has not moved an inch on scaling the features. So rest assured when you are using tree-based algorithms on your data!

Frequently Asked Questions Q1. How is Standardization differentfrom Normalization feature scaling? A. Standardization centers data around a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, while normalization scales data to a set range, often [0, 1], by using the minimum and maximum values. Q2. Why is Standardization used in machine learning? A. Standardization ensures algorithmic stability and prevents sensitivity to the scale of input features, improves optimization algorithms’ convergence and search efficiency, and enhances the performance of certain machine learning algorithms. Q3. Why is Normalization used in machine learning? A. Normalization helps in scaling the input features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1], to ensure that no single feature disproportionately impacts the results. It preserves the relationship between the minimum and maximum values of each feature, which can be important for some algorithms. It also improves the convergence and stability of some machine learning algorithms, particularly those that use gradient-based optimization. Q4. Why do we normalize values? A. We normalize values to bring them into a common scale, making it easier to compare and analyze data. Normalization also helps to reduce the impact of outliers and improve the accuracy and stability of statistical models. Q5. How do you normalize a set of values? A. To normalize a set of values, we first calculate the mean and standard deviation of the data. Then, we subtract the mean from each value and divide by the standard deviation to obtain standardized values with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Alternatively, we can use other normalization techniques such as min-max normalization, where we scale the values to a range of 0 to 1, or unit vector normalization, where we scale the values to have a length of 1. Feature scaling feature scaling machine learning feature scaling python live coding normalizaiton vs. standardization normalization standardization “Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.” — Dr. Jason Brownlee This gives us an idea about feature engineering being the process of transforming data into features to act as inputs for machine learning models such that good quality features help in improving the overall model performance. Features are also very much dependent on the underlying problem. Thus, even though the machine learning task might be same in different scenarios, like classification of emails into spam and non-spam or classifying handwritten digits, the features extracted in each scenario will be very different from the other. Prof. Pedro Domingos from the University of Washington, in his paper titled, “A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning” tells us the following. “At the end of the day, some machine learning projects succeed and some fail. What makes the dif erence? Easily the most important factor is the features used.” — Prof. Pedro Domingos The final quote which should motivate you about feature engineering is from renowned Kaggler, Xavier Conort. Most of you already know that tough real-world machine learning problems are often posted on Kaggle regularly which is usually open to everyone. “The algorithms we used are very standard for Kagglers. …We spent most of our ef orts in feature engineering. … We were also very careful to discard features likely to expose us to the risk of over-fitting our model.” — Xavier Conort Understanding Features A feature is typically a specific representation on top of raw data, which is an individual, measurable attribute, typically depicted by a column in a dataset. Considering a generic two-dimensional dataset, each observation is depicted by a row and each feature by a column, which will have a specific value for an observation. A generic dataset snapshot Thus like in the example in the figure above, each row typically indicates a feature vector and the entire set of features across all the observations forms a two-dimensional feature matrix also known as a feature-set. This is akin to data frames or spreadsheets representing two-dimensional data. Typically machine learning algorithms work with these numeric matrices or tensors and hence most feature engineering techniques deal with converting raw data into some numeric representations which can be easily understood by these algorithms. Features can be of two major types based on the dataset. Inherent raw features are obtained directly from the dataset with no extra data manipulation or engineering. Derived features are usually obtained from feature engineering, where we extract features from existing data attributes. A simple example would be creating a new feature “Age” from an employee dataset containing “Birthdate” by just subtracting their birth date from the current date. There are diverse types and formats of data including structured and unstructured data. In this article, we will discuss various feature engineering strategies for dealing with structured continuous numeric data. All these examples are a part of one of my recent books ‘Practical Machine Learning with Python’ and you can access relevant datasets and code used in this article on GitHub. A big shout out also goes to Gabriel Moreira who helped me by providing some excellent pointers on feature engineering techniques. Feature Engineering on Numeric Data Numeric data typically represents data in the form of scalar values depicting observations, recordings or measurements. Here, by numeric data, we mean continuous data and not discrete data which is typically represented as categorical data. Numeric data can also be represented as a vector of values where each value or entity in the vector can represent a specific feature. Integers and floats are the most common and widely used numeric data types for continuous numeric data. Even though numeric data can be directly fed into machine learning models, you would still need to engineer features which are relevant to the scenario, problem and domain before building a model. Hence the need for feature engineering still remains. Let’s leverage python and look at some strategies for feature engineering on numeric data. We load up the following necessary dependencies first (typically in a Jupyter notebook). import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import scipy.stats as spstats %matplotlib inline Raw Measures Like we mentioned earlier, raw numeric data can often be fed directly to machine learning models based on the context and data format. Raw measures are typically indicated using numeric variables directly as features without any form of transformation or engineering. Typically these features can indicate values or counts. Let’s load up one of our datasets, the Pokémon dataset also available on Kaggle. poke_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/Pokemon.csv', encoding='utf-8') poke_df.head() Snapshot of our Pokemon dataset Pokémon is a huge media franchise surrounding fictional characters called Pokémon which stands for pocket monsters. In short, you can think of them as fictional animals with superpowers! This dataset consists of these characters with various statistics for each character. Values If you closely observe the data frame snapshot in the above figure, you can see that several attributes represent numeric raw values which can be used directly. The following snippet depicts some of these features with more emphasis. poke_df[['HP', 'Attack', 'Defense']].head() Features with (continuous) numeric data Thus, you can directly use these attributes as features which are depicted in the above data frame. These include each Pokémon’s HP (Hit Points), Attack and Defense stats. In fact, we can also compute some basic statistical measures on these fields. poke_df[['HP', 'Attack', 'Defense']].describe() Basic descriptive statistics on numeric features With this you can get a good idea about statistical measures in these features like count, average, standard deviation and quartiles. Counts Another form of raw measures include features which represent frequencies, counts or occurrences of specific attributes. Let’s look at a sample of data from the millionsong dataset which depicts counts or frequencies of songs which have been heard by various users. popsong_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/song_views.csv', encoding='utf-8') popsong_df.head(10) Song listen counts as a numeric feature It is quite evident from the above snapshot that the listen_count field can be used directly as a frequencycount based numeric feature. Binarization Often raw frequencies or counts may not be relevant for building a model based on the problem which is being solved. For instance if I’m building a recommendation system for song recommendations, I would just want to know if a person is interested or has listened to a particular song. This doesn’t require the number of times a song has been listened to since I am more concerned about the various songs heshe has listened to. In this case, a binary feature is preferred as opposed to a count based feature. We can binarize our listen_count field as follows. watched = np.array(popsong_df['listen_count']) watched[watched >= 1] = 1 popsong_df['watched'] = watched You can also use scikit-learn's Binarizer class here from its preprocessing module to perform the same task instead of numpy arrays. from sklearn.preprocessing import Binarizer bn = Binarizer(threshold=0.9) pd_watched = bn.transform([popsong_df['listen_count']])[0] popsong_df['pd_watched'] = pd_watched popsong_df.head(11) Binarizing song counts You can clearly see from the above snapshot that both the methods have produced the same result. Thus we get a binarized feature indicating if the song was listened to or not by each user which can be then further used in a relevant model. Rounding Often when dealing with continuous numeric attributes like proportions or percentages, we may not need the raw values having a high amount of precision. Hence it often makes sense to round off these high precision percentages into numeric integers. These integers can then be directly used as raw values or even as categorical (discrete-class based) features. Let’s try applying this concept in a dummy dataset depicting store items and their popularity percentages. items_popularity = pd.read_csv('datasets/item_popularity.csv', encoding='utf-8') items_popularity['popularity_scale_10'] = np.array( np.round((items_popularity['pop_percent'] * 10)), dtype='int') items_popularity['popularity_scale_100'] = np.array( np.round((items_popularity['pop_percent'] * 100)), dtype='int') items_popularity Rounding popularity to different scales Based on the above ouputs, you can guess that we tried two forms of rounding. The features depict the item popularities now both on a scale of 1–10 and on a scale of 1–100. You can use these values both as numerical or categorical features based on the scenario and problem. Interactions Supervised machine learning models usually try to model the output responses (discrete classes or continuous values) as a function of the input feature variables. For example, a simple linear regression equation can be depicted as where the input features are depicted by variables having weights or coefficients denoted by respectively and the goal is to predict the response y. In this case, this simple linear model depicts the relationship between the output and inputs, purely based on the individual, separate input features. However, often in several real-world scenarios, it makes sense to also try and capture the interactions between these feature variables as a part of the input feature set. A simple depiction of the extension of the above linear regression formulation with interaction features would be where the features represented by denote the interaction features. Let’s try engineering some interaction features on our Pokémon dataset now. atk_def = poke_df[['Attack', 'Defense']] atk_def.head() From the output data frame, we can see that we have two numeric (continuous) features, Attack and Defence . We will now build features up to the 2nd degree by leveraging scikit-learn . from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures pf = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, interaction_only=False, include_bias=False) res = pf.fit_transform(atk_def) res Output ------ array([[ 49., 49., 2401., 2401., 2401.], [ 62., 63., 3844., 3906., 3969.], [ 82., 83., 6724., 6806., 6889.], ..., [ 110., 60., 12100., 6600., 3600.], [ 160., 60., 25600., 9600., 3600.], [ 110., 120., 12100., 13200., 14400.]]) The above feature matrix depicts a total of five features including the new interaction features. We can see the degree of each feature in the above matrix as follows. pd.DataFrame(pf.powers_, columns=['Attack_degree', 'Defense_degree']) Looking at this output, we now know what each feature actually represents from the degrees depicted here. Armed with this knowledge, we can assign a name to each feature now as follows. This is just for ease of understanding and you should name your features with better, easy to access and simple names. intr_features = pd.DataFrame(res, columns=['Attack', 'Defense', 'Attack^2', 'Attack x Defense', 'Defense^2']) intr_features.head(5) Numeric features with their interactions Thus the above data frame represents our original features along with their interaction features. Binning The problem of working with raw, continuous numeric features is that often the distribution of values in these features will be skewed. This signifies that some values will occur quite frequently while some will be quite rare. Besides this, there is also another problem of the varying range of values in any of these features. For instance view counts of specific music videos could be abnormally large (Despacito we’re looking at you!) and some could be really small. Directly using these features can cause a lot of issues and adversely affect the model. Hence there are strategies to deal with this, which include binning and transformations. Binning, also known as quantization is used for transforming continuous numeric features into discrete ones (categories). These discrete values or numbers can be thought of as categories or bins into which the raw, continuous numeric values are binned or grouped into. Each bin represents a specific degree of intensity and hence a specific range of continuous numeric values fall into it. Specific strategies of binning data include fixed-width and adaptive binning. Let’s use a subset of data from a dataset extracted from the 2016 FreeCodeCamp DeveloperCoder survey which talks about various attributes pertaining to coders and software developers. fcc_survey_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/fcc_2016_coder_survey_subset.csv', encoding='utf-8') fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'EmploymentField', 'Age', 'Income']].head() Sample attributes from the FCC coder survey dataset The ID.x variable is basically a unique identifier for each coderdeveloper who took the survey and the other fields are pretty self-explanatory. Fixed-Width Binning Just like the name indicates, in fixed-width binning, we have specific fixed widths for each of the bins which are usually pre-defined by the user analyzing the data. Each bin has a pre-fixed range of values which should be assigned to that bin on the basis of some domain knowledge, rules or constraints. Binning based on rounding is one of the ways, where you can use the rounding operation which we discussed earlier to bin raw values. Let’s now consider the Age feature from the coder survey dataset and look at its distribution. fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Age'].hist(color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) ax.set_title('Developer Age Histogram', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Age', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer age distribution The above histogram depicting developer ages is slightly right skewed as expected (lesser aged developers). We will now assign these raw age values into specific bins based on the following scheme Age Range: Bin --------------- 0 - 9 : 0 10 - 19 : 1 20 - 29 : 2 30 - 39 : 3 40 - 49 : 4 50 - 59 : 5 60 - 69 : 6 ... and so on We can easily do this using what we learnt in the Rounding section earlier where we round off these raw age values by taking the floor value after dividing it by 10. fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_round'] = np.array(np.floor( np.array(fcc_survey_df['Age']) / 10.)) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Age_bin_round']].iloc[1071:1076] Binning by rounding You can see the corresponding bins for each age have been assigned based on rounding. But what if we need more flexibility? What if we want to decide and fix the bin widths based on our own ruleslogic? Binning based on custom ranges will help us achieve this. Let’s define some custom age ranges for binning developer ages using the following scheme. Age Range : Bin --------------- 0 - 15 : 1 16 - 30 : 2 31 - 45 : 3 46 - 60 : 4 61 - 75 : 5 75 - 100 : 6 Based on this custom binning scheme, we will now label the bins for each developer age value and we will store both the bin range as well as the corresponding label. bin_ranges = [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 100] bin_names = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_custom_range'] = pd.cut( np.array( fcc_survey_df['Age']), bins=bin_ranges) fcc_survey_df['Age_bin_custom_label'] = pd.cut( np.array( fcc_survey_df['Age']), bins=bin_ranges, labels=bin_names) # view the binned features fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Age_bin_round', 'Age_bin_custom_range', 'Age_bin_custom_label']].iloc[10a71:1076] Custom binning scheme for developer ages Adaptive Binning The drawback in using fixed-width binning is that due to us manually deciding the bin ranges, we can end up with irregular bins which are not uniform based on the number of data points or values which fall in each bin. Some of the bins might be densely populated and some of them might be sparsely populated or even empty! Adaptive binning is a safer strategy in these scenarios where we let the data speak for itself! That’s right, we use the data distribution itself to decide our bin ranges. Quantile based binning is a good strategy to use for adaptive binning. Quantiles are specific values or cut-points which help in partitioning the continuous valued distribution of a specific numeric field into discrete contiguous bins or intervals. Thus, q-Quantiles help in partitioning a numeric attribute into q equal partitions. Popular examples of quantiles include the 2-Quantile known as the median which divides the data distribution into two equal bins, 4-Quantiles known as the quartiles which divide the data into 4 equal bins and 10-Quantiles also known as the deciles which create 10 equal width bins. Let’s now look at the data distribution for the developer Income field. fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer income distribution The above distribution depicts a right skew in the income with lesser developers earning more money and vice versa. Let’s take a 4-Quantile or a quartile based adaptive binning scheme. We can obtain the quartiles easily as follows. quantile_list = [0, .25, .5, .75, 1.] quantiles = fcc_survey_df['Income'].quantile(quantile_list) quantiles Output ------ 0.00 6000.0 0.25 20000.0 0.50 37000.0 0.75 60000.0 1.00 200000.0 Name: Income, dtype: float64 Let’s now visualize these quantiles in the original distribution histogram! fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) for quantile in quantiles: qvl = plt.axvline(quantile, color='r') ax.legend([qvl], ['Quantiles'], fontsize=10) ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram with Quantiles', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) Histogram depicting developer income distribution with quartile values The red lines in the distribution above depict the quartile values and our potential bins. Let’s now leverage this knowledge to build our quartile based binning scheme. quantile_labels = ['0-25Q', '25-50Q', '50-75Q', '75-100Q'] fcc_survey_df['Income_quantile_range'] = pd.qcut( fcc_survey_df['Income'], q=quantile_list) fcc_survey_df['Income_quantile_label'] = pd.qcut( fcc_survey_df['Income'], q=quantile_list, labels=quantile_labels) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_quantile_range', 'Income_quantile_label']].iloc[4:9] Quantile based bin ranges and labels for developer incomes This should give you a good idea of how quantile based adaptive binning works. An important point to remember here is that the resultant outcome of binning leads to discrete valued categorical features and you might need an additional step of feature engineering on the categorical data before using it in any model. We will cover feature engineering strategies for categorical data shortly in the next part! Statistical Transformations We talked about the adverse effects of skewed data distributions briefly earlier. Let’s look at a different strategy of feature engineering now by making use of statistical or mathematical transformations.We will look at the Log transform as well as the Box-Cox transform. Both of these transform functions belong to the Power Transform family of functions, typically used to create monotonic data transformations. Their main significance is that they help in stabilizing variance, adhering closely to the normal distribution and making the data independent of the mean based on its distribution Log Transform The log transform belongs to the power transform family of functions. This function can be mathematically represented as which reads as log of x to the base b is equal to y. This can then be translated into which indicates as to what power must the base b be raised to in order to get x. The natural logarithm uses b=e where e = 2.71828 popularly known as Euler’s number. You can also use base b=10 used popularly in the decimal system. Log transforms are useful when applied to skewed distributions as they tend to expand the values which fall in the range of lower magnitudes and tend to compress or reduce the values which fall in the range of higher magnitudes. This tends to make the skewed distribution as normal-like as possible. Let’s use log transform on our developer Income feature which we used earlier. fcc_survey_df['Income_log'] = np.log((1+ fcc_survey_df['Income'])) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_log']].iloc[4:9] Log transform on developer income The Income_log field depicts the transformed feature after log transformation. Let’s look at the data distribution on this transformed field now. income_log_mean = np.round(np.mean(fcc_survey_df['Income_log']), 2) fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income_log'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) plt.axvline(income_log_mean, color='r') ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram after Log Transform', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income (log scale)', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) ax.text(11.5, 450, r'mu='+str(income_log_mean), fontsize=10) Histogram depicting developer income distribution after log transform Based on the above plot, we can clearly see that the distribution is more normal-like or gaussian as compared to the skewed distribution on the original data. Box-Cox Transform The Box-Cox transform is another popular function belonging to the power transform family of functions. This function has a pre-requisite that the numeric values to be transformed must be positive (similar to what log transform expects). In case they are negative, shifting using a constant value helps. Mathematically, the Box-Cox transform function can be denoted as follows. Such that the resulted transformed output y is a function of input x and the transformation parameter λ such that when λ = 0, the resultant transform is the natural log transform which we discussed earlier. The optimal value of λ is usually determined using a maximum likelihood or loglikelihood estimation. Let’s now apply the Box-Cox transform on our developer income feature. First we get the optimal lambda value from the data distribution by removing the non-null values as follows. income = np.array(fcc_survey_df['Income']) income_clean = income[~np.isnan(income)] l, opt_lambda = spstats.boxcox(income_clean) print('Optimal lambda value:', opt_lambda) Output ------ Optimal lambda value: 0.117991239456 Now that we have obtained the optimal λ value, let us use the Box-Cox transform for two values of λ such that λ = 0 and λ = λ(optimal) and transform the developer Income feature. fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_0'] = spstats.boxcox( (1+fcc_survey_df['Income']), lmbda=0) fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt'] = spstats.boxcox( fcc_survey_df['Income'], lmbda=opt_lambda) fcc_survey_df[['ID.x', 'Age', 'Income', 'Income_log', 'Income_boxcox_lambda_0', 'Income_boxcox_lambda_opt']].iloc[4:9] Developer income distribution after Box-Cox transform The transformed features are depicted in the above data frame. Just like we expected, Income_log and Income_boxcox_lamba_0 have the same values. Let’s look at the distribution of the transformed Income feature after transforming with the optimal λ. income_boxcox_mean = np.round( np.mean( fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt']),2) fig, ax = plt.subplots() fcc_survey_df['Income_boxcox_lambda_opt'].hist(bins=30, color='#A9C5D3', edgecolor='black', grid=False) plt.axvline(income_boxcox_mean, color='r') ax.set_title('Developer Income Histogram after Box–Cox Transform', fontsize=12) ax.set_xlabel('Developer Income (Box–Cox transform)', fontsize=12) ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12) ax.text(24, 450, r'mu='+str(income_boxcox_mean), fontsize=10) Histogram depicting developer income distribution after Box-Cox transform The distribution looks more normal-like similar to what we obtained after the log transform. Conclusion Feature engineering is a very important aspect of machine learning and data science and should never be ignored. While we have automated feature engineering methodologies like deep learning as well as automated machine learning frameworks like AutoML (which still stresses that it requires good features to work well!). Feature engineering is here to stay and even some of these automated methodologies often require specific engineered features based on the data type, domain and the problem to be solved. We looked at popular strategies for feature engineering on continuous numeric data in this article. In the next part, we will look at popular strategies for dealing with discrete, categorical data and then move on to unstructured data types in future articles. Stay tuned!

In this article, we will look at another type of structured data, which is discrete in nature and is popularly termed as categorical data. Dealing with numeric data is often easier than categorical data given that we do not have to deal with additional complexities of the semantics pertaining to each category value in any data attribute which is of a categorical type. We will use a hands-on approach to discuss several encoding Get unlimited access to the best of Medium for less than 1/week. Become a member schemes for dealing with categorical data and also a couple of popular techniques for dealing with large scale feature explosion, often known as the “curse of dimensionality”. Motivation I’m sure by now you must realize the motivation and the importance of feature engineering, we do stress on the same in detail in ‘Part 1’ of this series. Do check it out for a quick refresher if necessary. In short, machine learning algorithms cannot work directly with categorical data and you do need to do some amount of engineering and transformations on this data before you can start modeling on your data. Understanding Categorical Data Let’s get an idea about categorical data representations before diving into feature engineering strategies. Typically, any data attribute which is categorical in nature represents discrete values which belong to a specific finite set of categories or classes. These are also often known as classes or labels in the context of attributes or variables which are to be predicted by a model (popularly known as response variables). These discrete values can be text or numeric in nature (or even unstructured data like images!). There are two major classes of categorical data, nominal and ordinal. In any nominal categorical data attribute, there is no concept of ordering amongst the values of that attribute. Consider a simple example of weather categories, as depicted in the following figure. We can see that we have six major classes or categories in this particular scenario without any concept or notion of order (windy doesn’t always occur before sunny nor is it smaller or bigger than sunny). Weather as a categorical attribute Similarly movie, music and video game genres, country names, food and cuisine types are other examples of nominal categorical attributes. Ordinal categorical attributes have some sense or notion of order amongst its values. For instance look at the following figure for shirt sizes. It is quite evident that order or in this case ‘size’ matters when thinking about shirts (S is smaller than M which is smaller than L and so on). Shirt size as an ordinal categorical attribute Shoe sizes, education level and employment roles are some other examples of ordinal categorical attributes. Having a decent idea about categorical data, let’s now look at some feature engineering strategies. Feature Engineering on Categorical Data While a lot of advancements have been made in various machine learning frameworks to accept complex categorical data types like text labels. Typically any standard workflow in feature engineering involves some form of transformation of these categorical values into numeric labels and then applying some encoding scheme on these values. We load up the necessary essentials before getting started. import pandas as pd import numpy as np Transforming Nominal Attributes Nominal attributes consist of discrete categorical values with no notion or sense of order amongst them. The idea here is to transform these attributes into a more representative numerical format which can be easily understood by downstream code and pipelines. Let’s look at a new dataset pertaining to video game sales. This dataset is also available on Kaggle as well as in my GitHub repository. vg_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/vgsales.csv', encoding='utf-8') vg_df[['Name', 'Platform', 'Year', 'Genre', 'Publisher']].iloc[1:7] Dataset for video game sales Let’s focus on the video game Genre attribute as depicted in the above data frame. It is quite evident that this is a nominal categorical attribute just like Publisher and Platform . We can easily get the list of unique video game genres as follows. genres = np.unique(vg_df['Genre']) genres Output ------ array(['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fighting', 'Misc', 'Platform', 'Puzzle', 'Racing', 'Role-Playing', 'Shooter', 'Simulation', 'Sports', 'Strategy'], dtype=object) This tells us that we have 12 distinct video game genres. We can now generate a label encoding scheme for mapping each category to a numeric value by leveraging scikit-learn . from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder gle = LabelEncoder() genre_labels = gle.fit_transform(vg_df['Genre']) genre_mappings = {index: label for index, label in enumerate(gle.classes_)} genre_mappings Output ------ {0: 'Action', 1: 'Adventure', 2: 'Fighting', 3: 'Misc', 4: 'Platform', 5: 'Puzzle', 6: 'Racing', 7: 'Role-Playing', 8: 'Shooter', 9: 'Simulation', 10: 'Sports', 11: 'Strategy'} Thus a mapping scheme has been generated where each genre value is mapped to a number with the help of the LabelEncoder object gle . The transformed labels are stored in the genre_labels value which we can write back to our data frame. vg_df['GenreLabel'] = genre_labels vg_df[['Name', 'Platform', 'Year', 'Genre', 'GenreLabel']].iloc[1:7] Video game genres with their encoded labels These labels can be used directly often especially with frameworks like scikitlearn if you plan to use them as response variables for prediction, however as discussed earlier, we will need an additional step of encoding on these before we can use them as features. Transforming Ordinal Attributes Ordinal attributes are categorical attributes with a sense of order amongst the values. Let’s consider our Pokémon dataset which we used in Part 1 of this series. Let’s focus more specifically on the Generation attribute. poke_df = pd.read_csv('datasets/Pokemon.csv', encoding='utf-8') poke_df = poke_df.sample(random_state=1, frac=1).reset_index(drop=True) np.unique(poke_df['Generation']) Output ------ array(['Gen 1', 'Gen 2', 'Gen 3', 'Gen 4', 'Gen 5', 'Gen 6'], dtype=object) Based on the above output, we can see there are a total of 6 generations and each Pokémon typically belongs to a specific generation based on the video games (when they were released) and also the television series follows a similar timeline. This attribute is typically ordinal (domain knowledge is necessary here) because most Pokémon belonging to Generation 1 were introduced earlier in the video games and the television shows than Generation 2 as so on. Fans can check out the following figure to remember some of the popular Pokémon of each generation (views may differ among fans!). Popular Pokémon based on generation and type (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2s2upx/heres_my_favorite_pokemon_by_type_and_gen_chart) Hence they have a sense of order amongst them. In general, there is no generic module or function to map and transform these features into numeric representations based on order automatically. Hence we can use a custom encodingmapping scheme. gen_ord_map = {'Gen 1': 1, 'Gen 2': 2, 'Gen 3': 3, 'Gen 4': 4, 'Gen 5': 5, 'Gen 6': 6} poke_df['GenerationLabel'] = poke_df['Generation'].map(gen_ord_map) poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'GenerationLabel']].iloc[4:10] Pokémon generation encoding It is quite evident from the above code that the map(…) function from pandas is quite helpful in transforming this ordinal feature. Encoding Categorical Attributes If you remember what we mentioned earlier, typically feature engineering on categorical data involves a transformation process which we depicted in the previous section and a compulsory encoding process where we apply specific encoding schemes to create dummy variables or features for each categoryvalue in a specific categorical attribute. You might be wondering, we just converted categories to numerical labels in the previous section, why on earth do we need this now? The reason is quite simple. Considering video game genres, if we directly fed the GenreLabel attribute as a feature in a machine learning model, it would consider it to be a continuous numeric feature thinking value 10 (Sports) is greater than 6 (Racing) but that is meaningless because the Sports genre is certainly not bigger or smaller than Racing, these are essentially different values or categories which cannot be compared directly. Hence we need an additional layer of encoding schemes where dummy features are created for each unique value or category out of all the distinct categories per attribute. One-hot Encoding Scheme Considering we have the numeric representation of any categorical attribute with m labels (after transformation), the one-hot encoding scheme, encodes or transforms the attribute into m binary features which can only contain a value of 1 or 0. Each observation in the categorical feature is thus converted into a vector of size m with only one of the values as 1 (indicating it as active). Let’s take a subset of our Pokémon dataset depicting two attributes of interest. poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Legendary']].iloc[4:10] Subset of our Pokémon dataset The attributes of interest are Pokémon Generation and their Legendary status. The first step is to transform these attributes into numeric representations based on what we learnt earlier. from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder # transform and map pokemon generations gen_le = LabelEncoder() gen_labels = gen_le.fit_transform(poke_df['Generation']) poke_df['Gen_Label'] = gen_labels # transform and map pokemon legendary status leg_le = LabelEncoder() leg_labels = leg_le.fit_transform(poke_df['Legendary']) poke_df['Lgnd_Label'] = leg_labels poke_df_sub = poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label', 'Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label']] poke_df_sub.iloc[4:10] Attributes with transformed (numeric) labels The features Gen_Label and Lgnd_Label now depict the numeric representations of our categorical features. Let’s now apply the one-hot encoding scheme on these features. # encode generation labels using one-hot encoding scheme gen_ohe = OneHotEncoder() gen_feature_arr = gen_ohe.fit_transform( poke_df[['Gen_Label']]).toarray() gen_feature_labels = list(gen_le.classes_) gen_features = pd.DataFrame(gen_feature_arr, columns=gen_feature_labels) # encode legendary status labels using one-hot encoding scheme leg_ohe = OneHotEncoder() leg_feature_arr = leg_ohe.fit_transform( poke_df[['Lgnd_Label']]).toarray() leg_feature_labels = ['Legendary_'+str(cls_label) for cls_label in leg_le.classes_] leg_features = pd.DataFrame(leg_feature_arr, columns=leg_feature_labels) In general, you can always encode both the features together using the fit_transform(…) function by passing it a two dimensional array of the two features together (Check out the documentation!). But we encode each feature separately, to make things easier to understand. Besides this, we can also create separate data frames and label them accordingly. Let’s now concatenate these feature frames and see the final result. poke_df_ohe = pd.concat([poke_df_sub, gen_features, leg_features], axis=1) columns = sum([['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label'], gen_feature_labels, ['Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label'], leg_feature_labels], []) poke_df_ohe[columns].iloc[4:10] One-hot encoded features for Pokémon generation and legendary status Thus you can see that 6 dummy variables or binary features have been created for Generation and 2 for Legendary since those are the total number of distinct categories in each of these attributes respectively. Active state of a category is indicated by the 1 value in one of these dummy variables which is quite evident from the above data frame. Consider you built this encoding scheme on your training data and built some model and now you have some new data which has to be engineered for features before predictions as follows. new_poke_df = pd.DataFrame([['PikaZoom', 'Gen 3', True], ['CharMyToast', 'Gen 4', False]], columns=['Name', 'Generation', 'Legendary']) new_poke_df Sample new data You can leverage scikit-learn’s excellent API here by calling the transform(…) function of the previously build LabeLEncoder and OneHotEncoder objects on the new data. Remember our workflow, first we do the transformation. new_gen_labels = gen_le.transform(new_poke_df['Generation']) new_poke_df['Gen_Label'] = new_gen_labels new_leg_labels = leg_le.transform(new_poke_df['Legendary']) new_poke_df['Lgnd_Label'] = new_leg_labels new_poke_df[['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label', 'Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label']] Categorical attributes after transformation Once we have numerical labels, let’s apply the encoding scheme now! new_gen_feature_arr = gen_ohe.transform(new_poke_df[['Gen_Label']]).toarray() new_gen_features = pd.DataFrame(new_gen_feature_arr, columns=gen_feature_labels) new_leg_feature_arr = leg_ohe.transform(new_poke_df[['Lgnd_Label']]).toarray() new_leg_features = pd.DataFrame(new_leg_feature_arr, columns=leg_feature_labels) new_poke_ohe = pd.concat([new_poke_df, new_gen_features, new_leg_features], axis=1) columns = sum([['Name', 'Generation', 'Gen_Label'], gen_feature_labels, ['Legendary', 'Lgnd_Label'], leg_feature_labels], []) new_poke_ohe[columns] Categorical attributes after one-hot encoding Thus you can see it’s quite easy to apply this scheme on new data easily by leveraging scikit-learn’s powerful API. You can also apply the one-hot encoding scheme easily by leveraging the to_dummies(…) function from pandas . gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_onehot_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] One-hot encoded features by leveraging pandas The above data frame depicts the one-hot encoding scheme applied on the Generation attribute and the results are same as compared to the earlier results as expected. Dummy Coding Scheme The dummy coding scheme is similar to the one-hot encoding scheme, except in the case of dummy coding scheme, when applied on a categorical feature with m distinct labels, we get m - 1 binary features. Thus each value of the categorical variable gets converted into a vector of size m - 1. The extra feature is completely disregarded and thus if the category values range from {0, 1, …, m-1} the 0th or the m - 1th feature column is dropped and corresponding category values are usually represented by a vector of all zeros (0). Let’s try applying dummy coding scheme on Pokémon Generation by dropping the first level binary encoded feature ( Gen 1 ). gen_dummy_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation'], drop_first=True) pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_dummy_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Dummy coded features for Pokémon g eneration If you want, you can also choose to drop the last level binary encoded feature ( Gen 6 ) as follows. gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) gen_dummy_features = gen_onehot_features.iloc[:,:-1] pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_dummy_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Dummy coded features for Pokémon g eneration Open in app Search Based on the above depictions, it is quite clear that categories belonging to the dropped feature are represented as a vector of zeros (0) like we discussed earlier. Effect Coding Scheme The effect coding scheme is actually very similar to the dummy coding scheme, except during the encoding process, the encoded features or feature vector, for the category values which represent all 0 in the dummy coding scheme, is replaced by -1 in the effect coding scheme. This will become clearer with the following example. gen_onehot_features = pd.get_dummies(poke_df['Generation']) gen_effect_features = gen_onehot_features.iloc[:,:-1] gen_effect_features.loc[np.all(gen_effect_features == 0, axis=1)] = -1. pd.concat([poke_df[['Name', 'Generation']], gen_effect_features], axis=1).iloc[4:10] Effect coded features for Pokémon g eneration The above output clearly shows that the Pokémon belonging to Generation 6 are now represented by a vector of -1 values as compared to zeros in dummy coding. Bin-counting Scheme The encoding schemes we discussed so far, work quite well on categorical data in general, but they start causing problems when the number of distinct categories in any feature becomes very large. Essential for any categorical feature of m distinct labels, you get m separate features. This can easily increase the size of the feature set causing problems like storage issues, model training problems with regard to time, space and memory. Besides this, we also have to deal with what is popularly known as the ‘curse of dimensionality’ where basically with an enormous number of features and not enough representative samples, model performance starts getting affected often leading to overfitting. Hence we need to look towards other categorical data feature engineering schemes for features having a large number of possible categories (like IP addresses). The bin-counting scheme is a useful scheme for dealing with categorical variables having many categories. In this scheme, instead of using the actual label values for encoding, we use probability based statistical information about the value and the actual target or response value which we aim to predict in our modeling efforts. A simple example would be based on past historical data for IP addresses and the ones which were used in DDOS attacks; we can build probability values for a DDOS attack being caused by any of the IP addresses. Using this information, we can encode an input feature which depicts that if the same IP address comes in the future, what is the probability value of a DDOS attack being caused. This scheme needs historical data as a pre-requisite and is an elaborate one. Depicting this with a complete example would be currently difficult here but there are several resources online which you can refer to for the same. Feature Hashing Scheme The feature hashing scheme is another useful feature engineering scheme for dealing with large scale categorical features. In this scheme, a hash function is typically used with the number of encoded features pre-set (as a vector of predefined length) such that the hashed values of the features are used as indices in this pre-defined vector and values are updated accordingly. Since a hash function maps a large number of values into a small finite set of values, multiple different values might create the same hash which is termed as collisions. Typically, a signed hash function is used so that the sign of the value obtained from the hash is used as the sign of the value which is stored in the final feature vector at the appropriate index. This should ensure lesser collisions and lesser accumulation of error due to collisions. Hashing schemes work on strings, numbers and other structures like vectors. You can think of hashed outputs as a finite set of b bins such that when hash function is applied on the same valuescategories, they get assigned to the same bin (or subset of bins) out of the b bins based on the hash value. We can pre-define the value of b which becomes the final size of the encoded feature vector for each categorical attribute that we encode using the feature hashing scheme. Thus even if we have over 1000 distinct categories in a feature and we set b=10 as the final feature vector size, the output feature set will still have only 10 features as compared to 1000 binary features if we used a one-hot encoding scheme. Let’s consider the Genre attribute in our video game dataset. unique_genres = np.unique(vg_df[['Genre']]) print(\\"Total game genres:\\", len(unique_genres)) print(unique_genres) Output ------ Total game genres: 12 ['Action' 'Adventure' 'Fighting' 'Misc' 'Platform' 'Puzzle' 'Racing' 'Role-Playing' 'Shooter' 'Simulation' 'Sports' 'Strategy'] We can see that there are a total of 12 genres of video games. If we used a one-hot encoding scheme on the Genre feature, we would end up having 12 binary features. Instead, we will now use a feature hashing scheme by leveraging scikit-learn’s FeatureHasher class, which uses a signed 32-bit version of the Murmurhash3 hash function. We will pre-define the final feature vector size to be 6 in this case. from sklearn.feature_extraction import FeatureHasher fh = FeatureHasher(n_features=6, input_type='string') hashed_features = fh.fit_transform(vg_df['Genre']) hashed_features = hashed_features.toarray() pd.concat([vg_df[['Name', 'Genre']], pd.DataFrame(hashed_features)], axis=1).iloc[1:7] Feature Hashing on the Genre attribute Based on the above output, the Genre categorical attribute has been encoded using the hashing scheme into 6 features instead of 12. We can also see that rows 1 and 6 denote the same genre of games, Platform which have been rightly encoded into the same feature vector. Conclusion These examples should give you a good idea about popular strategies for feature engineering on discrete, categorical data. If you read Part 1 of this series, you would have seen that it is slightly challenging to work with categorical data as compared to continuous, numeric data but definitely interesting! We also talked about some ways to handle large feature spaces using feature engineering but you should also remember that there are other techniques including feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods to handle large feature spaces. We will cover some of these methods in a later article. Next up will be feature engineering strategies for unstructured text data. Stay tuned! To read about feature engineering strategies for continuous numeric data, check out Part 1 of this series! All the code and datasets used in this article can be accessed from my GitHub The code is also available as a Jupyter notebook Machine Learning Data Science Feature Engineering Programming Tds Feature Engineering In this article, we will look at various feature engineering techniques for extracting useful information using the datetime column. And if you’re new to time series, I encourage you to check out the below free course: Creating Time Series Forecast using Python Table of contents Overview Introduction Quick Introduction to Time Series Setting up the Problem Statement for Time Series Data Feature Engineering for Time Series #1: Date-Related Features Feature Engineering for Time Series #2: Time-Based Features Feature Engineering for Time Series #3: Lag Features Feature Engineering for Time Series #4: Rolling Window Feature Feature Engineering for Time Series #5: Expanding Window Feature Feature Engineering for Time Series #6: Domain-Specific Features Validation Technique for Time Series Frequently Asked Questions End Notes Quick Introduction to Time Series Before we look at the feature engineering techniques, let’s brush over some basic time series concepts. We’ll be using them throughout the article so it’s best to be acquainted with them here. So, what makes time series projects different from the traditional machine learning problems? Let’s take a simple example to understand this. If we want to predict today’s stock price for a certain company, it would be helpful to have information about yesterday’s closing price, right? Similarly, predicting the traffic on a website would be a lot easier if we have data about the last few months or years. There’s another thing we need to consider – time series data may also have certain trends or seasonality. Take a look at the plot shown below about the number of tickets booked for an airline over the years: “ In a time series, the data is captured at equal intervals and each successive data point in the series depends on its past values. view raw view raw We can clearly see an increasing trend. Such information can be useful for making more accurate predictions. Now, let’s take a dataset with date-time variables and start learning about feature engineering! Setting up the Problem Statement for Time Series Data We’ll be working on a fascinating problem to learn feature engineering techniques for time series. We have the historical data for ‘JetRail’, a form of public rail transport, that uses advanced technology to run rails at a high speed. JetRail’s usage has increased recently and we have to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months based on past data. Let’s see how we can help JetRail’s management team solve this problem. You can go through the detailed problem statement and download the dataset from here. Let’s load the dataset in our notebook: loading_data.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub We have two columns here – so it’s clearly a univariate time series. Also, the data type of the date variable is taken as an object, i.e. it is being treated as a categorical variable. Hence, we will need to convert this into a DateTime variable. We can do this using the appropriately titled datetime function in Pandas: changing_dtype.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Now that we have the data ready, let’s look at the different features we can engineer from this variable. Along with each of these feature engineering techniques, we will discuss different scenarios where that particular technique can be useful. NOTE: I have taken a simple time series problem to demonstrate the different feature engineering techniques in this article. You can use them on a dataset of your choice as long as the date-time column is present. Feature Engineering for Time Series #1: Date-Related Features Have you ever worked in a product company? You’ll be intimately familiar with the task of forecasting the sales for a particular product. We can find out the sales pattern for weekdays and weekends based on historical data. Thus, having information about the day, month, year, etc. can be useful for forecasting the values. Let’s get back to our JetRail project. We have to forecast the count of people who will take the JetRail on an hourly basis for the next 7 months. This number could be higher for weekdays and lower for weekends or during the festive seasons. Hence, the day of the week (weekday or weekend) or month will be an important factor. Extracting these features is really easy in Python: 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data.dtypes 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 data.dtypes 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') view raw view raw date_features.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Feature Engineering for Time Series #2: Time-Based Features We can similarly extract more granular features if we have the time stamp. For instance, we can determine the hour or minute of the day when the data was recorded and compare the trends between the business hours and non-business hours. If we are able to extract the ‘hour’ feature from the time stamp, we can make more insightful conclusions about the data. We could find out if the traffic on JetRail is higher during the morning, afternoon or evening time. Or we could use the value to determine the average hourly traffic throughout the week, i.e. the number of people who used JetRail between 9-10 am, 10-11 am, and so on (throughout the week). Extracting time-based features is very similar to what we did above when extracting date-related features. We start by converting the column to DateTime format and use the .dt accessor. Here’s how to do it in Python: time_features.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Similarly, we can extract a number of features from the date column. Here’s a complete list of features that we can generate: 4 5 data['year']=data['Datetime'].dt.year 6 data['month']=data['Datetime'].dt.month 7 data['day']=data['Datetime'].dt.day 8 9 data['dayofweek_num']=data['Datetime'].dt.dayofweek 10 data['dayofweek_name']=data['Datetime'].dt.weekday_name 11 12 data.head() 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['Hour'] = data['Datetime'].dt.hour 6 data['minute'] = data['Datetime'].dt.minute 7 8 data.head() Run the code below to generate the date and hour features for the given data. You can select any of the above functions and run the following code to generate a new feature for the same! @ L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 / Time B a s e d F e a t u r e s A P y t h o n r e p l b y L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 O p e n o n R e p lit S h o w c o d e 0 R u n L A view raw view raw Feature Engineering for Time Series #3: Lag Features Here’s something most aspiring data scientists don’t think about when working on a time series problem – we can also use the target variable for feature engineering! Consider this – you are predicting the stock price for a company. So, the previous day’s stock price is important to make a prediction, right? In other words, the value at time t is greatly affected by the value at time t-1. The past values are known as lags, so t-1 is lag 1, t-2 is lag 2, and so on. lag_feature.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Here, we were able to generate lag one feature for our series. But why lag one? Why not five or seven? That’s a good question. If the series has a weekly trend, which means the value last Monday can be used to predict the value for this Monday, you should create lag features for seven days. Getting the drift? We can create multiple lag features as well! Let’s say we want lag 1 to lag 7 – we can let the model decide which is the most valuable one. So, if we train a linear regression model, it will assign appropriate weights (or coefficients) to the lag features: lag_seven.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['lag_1'] = data['Count'].shift(1) 6 data = data[['Datetime', 'lag_1', 'Count']] 7 data.head() ‘ The lag value we choose will depend on the correlation of individual values with its past values. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['lag_1'] = data['Count'].shift(1) 6 data['lag_2'] = data['Count'].shift(2) 7 data['lag_3'] = data['Count'].shift(3) 8 data['lag_4'] = data['Count'].shift(4) 9 data['lag_5'] = data['Count'].shift(5) 10 data['lag_6'] = data['Count'].shift(6) 11 data['lag_7'] = data['Count'].shift(7) 12 13 data = data[['Datetime', 'lag_1', 'lag_2', 'lag_3', 'lag_4', 'lag_5', 'lag_6', 'lag_7', 'Count']] 14 data.head(10) There is more than one way of determining the lag at which the correlation is significant. For instance, we can use the ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) plots. ACF: The ACF plot is a measure of the correlation between the time series and the lagged version of itself PACF: The PACF plot is a measure of the correlation between the time series with a lagged version of itself but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons For our particular example, here are the ACF and PACF plots: from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf plot_acf(data['Count'], lags=10) plot_pacf(data['Count'], lags=10) An important point to note – the number of times you shift, the same number of values will be reduced from the data. You would see some rows with NaNs at the start. That’s because the first observation has no lag. You’ll need to discard these rows from the training data. Feature Engineering for Time Series #4: Rolling Window Feature In the last section, we looked at how we can use the previous values as features. Here’s an awesome gif that explains this idea in a wonderfully intuitive way: ‘ The partial autocorrelation function shows a high correlation with the first lag and lesser correlation with the second and third lag. The autocorrelation function shows a slow decay, which means that the future values have a very high correlation with its past values. ‘ How about calculating some statistical values based on past values? This method is called the rolling window method because the window would be different for every data point. view raw Since this looks like a window that is sliding with every next point, the features generated using this method are called the ‘rolling window’ features. Now the question we need to address – how are we going to perform feature engineering here? Let’s start simple. We will select a window size, take the average of the values in the window, and use it as a feature. Let’s implement it in Python: rolling_mean.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Similarly, you can consider the sum, min, max value, etc. (for the selected window) as a feature and try it out on your own machine. Thus, we can use a weighted average, such that higher weights are given to the most recent observations. Mathematically, weighted average at time t for the past 7 values would be: w_avg = w1*(t-1) + w2*(t-2) + . . . . + w7*(t-7) where, w1>w2>w3> . . . . >w7. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['rolling_mean'] = data['Count'].rolling(window=7).mean() 6 data = data[['Datetime', 'rolling_mean', 'Count']] 7 data.head(10) ‘ Recency in an important factor in a time series. Values closer to the current date would hold more information. view raw Feature Engineering for Time Series #5: Expanding Window Feature This is simply an advanced version of the rolling window technique. In the case of a rolling window, the size of the window is constant while the window slides as we move forward in time. Hence, we consider only the most recent values and ignore the past values. Here’s a gif that explains how our expanding window function works: As you can see, with every step, the size of the window increases by one as it takes into account every new value in the series. This can be implemented easily in Python by using the expanding() function. Let’s code this using the same data: expanding_window.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub Here is a live coding window that generates the expanding window feature for the given data. Feel free to change the starting window size and print the results: ‘ The idea behind the expanding window feature is that it takes all the past values into account. 1 import pandas as pd 2 data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') 3 data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') 4 5 data['expanding_mean'] = data['Count'].expanding(2).mean() 6 data = data[['Datetime','Count', 'expanding_mean']] 7 data.head(10) @ L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 / E x p a n din g Win d o w F e a t u r e A P y t h o n r e p l b y L a k s h a y A r o r a 1 O p e n o n R e p lit S h o w c o d e 0 R u n 1 3 L A Feature Engineering for Time Series #6: Domain-Specific Features This is the essence of feature engineering! Want to dive into this more? Let’s take an example. Below is the data provided by a retailer for a number of stores and products. Our task is to forecast the future demands for the products. We can come up with various features, like taking a lag or averaging the past values, among other things. But hold on. Let me ask you a question – would it be the right way to build lag features from lag(1) to lag(7) throughout the data? Certainly not! There are different stores and products, and the demand for each store and product would be significantly different. In this case, we can create lag features considering the store-product combination. Moreover, if we have knowledge about the products and the trends in the market, we would be able to generate more accurate (and fewer) features. Not only this, having a good understanding about the domain and data would help us in selecting the lag value and the window size. Additionally, based on your domain knowledge, you would be able to pull external data that adds more value to the model. Here’s what I mean – are the sales affected by the weather on the day? Will the sales increase/decrease on a national holiday?If yes, then you can use external datasets and include the list of holidays as a feature. Validation Technique for Time Series All the feature engineering techniques we have discussed can be used to convert a time series problem into a supervised machine learning problem. Once we have that, we can easily go ahead with machine learning algorithms like linear regression and random forest. But there is one important step that you should know before you jump to the model building process – creating a validation setfor time series. For the traditional machine learning problems, we randomly select subsets of data for the validation and test sets. But in these cases, each data point is dependent on its past values. If we randomly shuffle the data, we might be training on future data and predicting the past values! ‘ Having a good understanding of the problem statement, clarity of the end objective and knowledge of the available data is essential to engineer domain-specific features for the model. Let’s create a validation set for our problem. But first, we must check the duration for which we have the data: import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv('Train_SU63ISt.csv') data['Datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Datetime'],format='%d-%m-%Y %H:%M') data['Datetime'].min(), data['Datetime'].max(), (data['Datetime'].max() -data['Datetime'].min()) (Timestamp('2012-08-25 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2014-09-25 23:00:00'), Timedelta('761 days 23:00:00')) We have data for almost 25 months. Let’s save three months for validation and use the remaining for training: data.index = data.Datetime Train=data.loc['2012-08-25':'2014-06-24'] valid=data.loc['2014-06-25':'2014-09-25'] Train.shape, valid.shape ((16056, 3), (2232, 3)) Great! We have the train and validation sets ready. You can now use these feature engineering techniques and build machine learning models on this data! Frequently Asked Questions Q1. What are the features oftime series? A. The features of a time series are the characteristics and patterns observed within the data over time. Some of the key features include: 1. Trend: The long-term movement or direction in the data, indicating overall growth or decline. 2. Seasonality: Regular and predictable patterns that repeat at fixed intervals. 3. Cyclic Patterns: Longer-term oscillations with varying periods, not necessarily repeating at fixed intervals. 4. Noise: Random fluctuations or irregularities in the data that do not follow any specific pattern. 5. Autocorrelation: The correlation of a time series with its own past values at different lags. 6. Level: The baseline or starting point of the time series data. Understanding these features is essential for time series analysis and forecasting. Q2. Whatis time series feature extraction method? A. Time series feature extraction methods involve transforming raw time series data into a set of relevant and informative features. Techniques like moving averages, exponential smoothing, Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and statistical measures (mean, variance, etc.) are used to extract characteristics such as trend, seasonality, periodicity, and statistical properties. These features are then used for time series analysis, classification, and forecasting tasks. End Notes Time Series is often considered a difficult topic to master. That’s understandable because there are a lot of moving parts when we’re working with the date and time components. But once you have a hang of the basic concepts and are able to perform feature engineering, you’ll be gliding through your projects in no time. In this article, we discussed some simple techniques that you can use to work with time series data. Using these feature engineering techniques, we can convert any time series problem into a supervised learning problem and build regression models. ‘ It is important that we carefully build a validation set when working on a time series problem, without destroying the sequential order within the data.  NNaavviiggaattiioonn Click to Take the FREE Probability Crash-Course Search...   228 How to Use ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves for Classification in Python by Jason Brownlee on October 11, 2023 in Probability It can be more flexible to predict probabilities of an observation belonging to each class in a classification problem rather than predicting classes directly. This flexibility comes from the way that probabilities may be interpreted using different thresholds that allow the operator of the model to trade-off concerns in the errors made by the model, such as the number of false positives compared to the number of false negatives. This is required when using models where the cost of one error outweighs the cost of other types of errors. Two diagnostic tools that help in the interpretation of probabilistic forecast for binary (two-class) classification predictive modeling problems are ROC Curves and Precision-Recall curves. In this tutorial, you will discover ROC Curves, Precision-Recall Curves, and when to use each to interpret the prediction of probabilities for binary classification problems. After completing this tutorial, you will know: ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Kick-start your project with my new book Probability for Machine Learning, including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples. Let’s get started.

Update Oct/2023: Minor update on code to make it more Pythonic How and When to Use ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves for Classification in Python Photo by Giuseppe Milo, some rights reserved. Tutorial Overview This tutorial is divided into 6 parts; they are: 1. Predicting Probabilities 2. What Are ROC Curves? 3. ROC Curves and AUC in Python 4. What Are Precision-Recall Curves? 5. Precision-Recall Curves and AUC in Python 6. When to Use ROC vs. Precision-Recall Curves? Predicting Probabilities In a classification problem, we may decide to predict the class values directly. Alternately, it can be more flexible to predict the probabilities for each class instead. The reason for this is to provide the capability to choose and even calibrate the threshold for how to interpret the predicted probabilities. For example, a default might be to use a threshold of 0.5, meaning that a probability in [0.0, 0.49] is a negative outcome (0) and a probability in [0.5, 1.0] is a positive outcome (1). This threshold can be adjusted to tune the behavior of the model for a specific problem. An example would be to reduce more of one or another type of error. When making a prediction for a binary or two-class classification problem, there are two types of errors that we could make. False Positive. Predict an event when there was no event. False Negative. Predict no event when in fact there was an event. By predicting probabilities and calibrating a threshold, a balance of these two concerns can be chosen by the operator of the model. For example, in a smog prediction system, we may be far more concerned with having low false negatives than low false positives. A false negative would mean not warning about a smog day when in fact it is a high smog day, leading to health issues in the public that are unable to take precautions. A false positive means the public would take precautionary measures when they didn’t need to. A common way to compare models that predict probabilities for two-class problems is to use a ROC curve. What Are ROC Curves? A useful tool when predicting the probability of a binary outcome is the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, or ROC curve. It is a plot of the false positive rate (x-axis) versus the true positive rate (y-axis) for a number of different candidate threshold values between 0.0 and 1.0. Put another way, it plots the false alarm rate versus the hit rate. The true positive rate is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false negatives. It describes how good the model is at predicting the positive class when the actual outcome is positive. The true positive rate is also referred to as sensitivity. The false positive rate is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the sum of the number of false positives and the number of true negatives. It is also called the false alarm rate as it summarizes how often a positive class is predicted when the actual outcome is negative. 1 True Positive Rate = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 False Positive Rate = False Positives / (False Positives + True Negatives) The false positive rate is also referred to as the inverted specificity where specificity is the total number of true negatives divided by the sum of the number of true negatives and false positives. Where: The ROC curve is a useful tool for a few reasons: The curves of different models can be compared directly in general or for different thresholds. The area under the curve (AUC) can be used as a summary of the model skill. The shape of the curve contains a lot of information, including what we might care about most for a problem, the expected false positive rate, and the false negative rate. To make this clear: Smaller values on the x-axis of the plot indicate lower false positives and higher true negatives. Larger values on the y-axis of the plot indicate higher true positives and lower false negatives. If you are confused, remember, when we predict a binary outcome, it is either a correct prediction (true positive) or not (false positive). There is a tension between these options, the same with true negative and false negative. A skilful model will assign a higher probability to a randomly chosen real positive occurrence than a negative occurrence on average. This is what we mean when we say that the model has skill. Generally, skilful models are represented by curves that bow up to the top left of the plot. A no-skill classifier is one that cannot discriminate between the classes and would predict a random class or a constant class in all cases. A model with no skill is represented at the point (0.5, 0.5). A model with no skill at each threshold is represented by a diagonal line from the bottom left of the plot to the top right and has an AUC of 0.5. A model with perfect skill is represented at a point (0,1). A model with perfect skill is represented by a line that travels from the bottom left of the plot to the top left and then across the top to the top right. An operator may plot the ROC curve for the final model and choose a threshold that gives a desirable balance between the false positives and false negatives.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course 1 Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives) 1 False Positive Rate = 1 - Specificity ROC Curves and AUC in Python We can plot a ROC curve for a model in Python using the roc_curve() scikit-learn function. The function takes both the true outcomes (0,1) from the test set and the predicted probabilities for the 1 class. The function returns the false positive rates for each threshold, true positive rates for each threshold and thresholds. The AUC for the ROC can be calculated using the roc_auc_score() function. Like the roc_curve() function, the AUC function takes both the true outcomes (0,1) from the test set and the predicted probabilities for the 1 class. It returns the AUC score between 0.0 and 1.0 for no skill and perfect skill respectively. A complete example of calculating the ROC curve and ROC AUC for a Logistic Regression model on a small test problem is listed below. 1 2 3 ... # calculate roc curve fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y, probs) 1 2 3 4 ... # calculate AUC auc = roc_auc_score(y, probs) print('AUC: %.3f' % auc) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # roc curve and auc from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # generate a no skill prediction (majority class) ns_probs = [0 for _ in range(len(testy))] # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # calculate scores ns_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, ns_probs) lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs) # summarize scores print('No Skill: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (ns_auc)) print('Logistic: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (lr_auc)) # calculate roc curves ns_fpr, ns_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, ns_probs) lr_fpr, lr_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, lr_probs) # plot the roc curve for the model plt.plot(ns_fpr, ns_tpr, linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_fpr, lr_tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels Running the example prints the ROC AUC for the logistic regression model and the no skill classifier that only predicts 0 for all examples. A plot of the ROC curve for the model is also created showing that the model has skill. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. ROC Curve Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model What Are Precision-Recall Curves? There are many ways to evaluate the skill of a prediction model. An approach in the related field of information retrieval (finding documents based on queries) measures precision and recall. 35 36 37 38 39 40 plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 2 No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 Logistic: ROC AUC=0.903 These measures are also useful in applied machine learning for evaluating binary classification models. Precision is a ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and false positives. It describes how good a model is at predicting the positive class. Precision is referred to as the positive predictive value. or Recall is calculated as the ratio of the number of true positives divided by the sum of the true positives and the false negatives. Recall is the same as sensitivity. or Reviewing both precision and recall is useful in cases where there is an imbalance in the observations between the two classes. Specifically, there are many examples of no event (class 0) and only a few examples of an event (class 1). The reason for this is that typically the large number of class 0 examples means we are less interested in the skill of the model at predicting class 0 correctly, e.g. high true negatives. Key to the calculation of precision and recall is that the calculations do not make use of the true negatives. It is only concerned with the correct prediction of the minority class, class 1. A precision-recall curve is a plot of the precision (y-axis) and the recall (x-axis) for different thresholds, much like the ROC curve. A no-skill classifier is one that cannot discriminate between the classes and would predict a random class or a constant class in all cases. The no-skill line changes based on the distribution of the positive to negative classes. It is a horizontal line with the value of the ratio of positive cases in the dataset. For a balanced dataset, this is 0.5. — The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets, 2015. A model with perfect skill is depicted as a point at (1,1). A skilful model is represented by a curve that bows towards (1,1) above the flat line of no skill. While the baseline is fixed with ROC, the baseline of [precision-recall curve] is determined by the ratio of positives (P) and negatives (N) as y = P / (P + N). For instance, we have y = 0.5 for a balanced class distribution …  1 Positive Predictive Power = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) 1 Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) 1 Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) 1 Recall == Sensitivity There are also composite scores that attempt to summarize the precision and recall; two examples include: F-Measure or F1 score: that calculates the harmonic mean of the precision and recall (harmonic mean because the precision and recall are rates). Area Under Curve: like the AUC, summarizes the integral or an approximation of the area under the precision-recall curve. In terms of model selection, F-Measure summarizes model skill for a specific probability threshold (e.g. 0.5), whereas the area under curve summarize the skill of a model across thresholds, like ROC AUC. This makes precision-recall and a plot of precision vs. recall and summary measures useful tools for binary classification problems that have an imbalance in the observations for each class. Precision-Recall Curves in Python Precision and recall can be calculated in scikit-learn. The precision and recall can be calculated for thresholds using the precision_recall_curve() function that takes the true output values and the probabilities for the positive class as input and returns the precision, recall and threshold values. The F-Measure can be calculated by calling the f1_score() function that takes the true class values and the predicted class values as arguments. The area under the precision-recall curve can be approximated by calling the auc() function and passing it the recall (x) and precision (y) values calculated for each threshold. When plotting precision and recall for each threshold as a curve, it is important that recall is provided as the x-axis and precision is provided as the y-axis. The complete example of calculating precision-recall curves for a Logistic Regression model is listed below. 1 2 3 ... # calculate precision-recall curve precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(testy, probs) 1 2 3 ... # calculate F1 score f1 = f1_score(testy, yhat) 1 2 3 ... # calculate precision-recall AUC auc = auc(recall, precision) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # precision-recall curve and f1 from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve from sklearn.metrics import f1_score from sklearn.metrics import auc Running the example first prints the F1, area under curve (AUC) for the logistic regression model. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. The precision-recall curve plot is then created showing the precision/recall for each threshold for a logistic regression model (orange) compared to a no skill model (blue). 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # predict class values yhat = model.predict(testX) lr_precision, lr_recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(testy, lr_probs) lr_f1, lr_auc = f1_score(testy, yhat), auc(lr_recall, lr_precision) # summarize scores print('Logistic: f1=%.3f auc=%.3f' % (lr_f1, lr_auc)) # plot the precision-recall curves no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) plt.plot([0, 1], [no_skill, no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_recall, lr_precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('Recall') plt.ylabel('Precision') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 Logistic: f1=0.841 auc=0.898 Precision-Recall Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model When to Use ROC vs. Precision-Recall Curves? Generally, the use of ROC curves and precision-recall curves are as follows: ROC curves should be used when there are roughly equal numbers of observations for each class. Precision-Recall curves should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance. The reason for this recommendation is that ROC curves present an optimistic picture of the model on datasets with a class imbalance. — The Relationship Between Precision-Recall and ROC Curves, 2006. Some go further and suggest that using a ROC curve with an imbalanced dataset might be deceptive and lead to incorrect interpretations of the model skill. However, ROC curves can present an overly optimistic view of an algorithm’s performance if there is a large skew in the class distribution. […] Precision-Recall (PR) curves, often used in Information Retrieval , have been cited as an alternative to ROC curves for tasks with a large skew in the class distribution.  — The Precision-Recall Plot Is More Informative than the ROC Plot When Evaluating Binary Classifiers on Imbalanced Datasets, 2015. The main reason for this optimistic picture is because of the use of true negatives in the False Positive Rate in the ROC Curve and the careful avoidance of this rate in the Precision-Recall curve. — ROC Graphs: Notes and Practical Considerations for Data Mining Researchers, 2003. We can make this concrete with a short example. Below is the same ROC Curve example with a modified problem where there is a ratio of about 100:1 ratio of class=0 to class=1 observations (specifically Class0=985, Class1=15). […] the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. [Precision-recall curve] plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions  If the proportion of positive to negative instances changes in a test set, the ROC curves will not change. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, lift and F scores use values from both columns of the confusion matrix. As a class distribution changes these measures will change as well, even if the fundamental classifier performance does not. ROC graphs are based upon TP rate and FP rate, in which each dimension is a strict columnar ratio, so do not depend on class distributions.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # roc curve and auc on an imbalanced dataset from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score # generate 2 class dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_classes=2, weights=[0.99,0.01], random_state=1) # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2) # generate a no skill prediction (majority class) ns_probs = [0 for _ in range(len(testy))] # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] # calculate scores ns_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, ns_probs) lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs) # summarize scores print('No Skill: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (ns_auc)) print('Logistic: ROC AUC=%.3f' % (lr_auc)) # calculate roc curves Running the example suggests that the model has skill. Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. Indeed, it has skill, but all of that skill is measured as making correct true negative predictions and there are a lot of negative predictions to make. If you review the predictions, you will see that the model predicts the majority class (class 0) in all cases on the test set. The score is very misleading. A plot of the ROC Curve confirms the AUC interpretation of a skilful model for most probability thresholds. 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 ns_fpr, ns_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, ns_probs) lr_fpr, lr_tpr, _ = roc_curve(testy, lr_probs) # plot the roc curve for the model plt.plot(ns_fpr, ns_tpr, linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_fpr, lr_tpr, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate') plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 2 No Skill: ROC AUC=0.500 Logistic: ROC AUC=0.716 ROC Curve Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model for an Imbalanced Dataset We can also repeat the test of the same model on the same dataset and calculate a precision-recall curve and statistics instead.

Note: Your results may vary given the stochastic nature of the algorithm or evaluation procedure, or differences in numerical precision. Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. We can see that the model is penalized for predicting the majority class in all cases. The scores show that the model that looked good according to the ROC Curve is in fact barely skillful when considered using using precision and recall that focus on the positive class. The plot of the precision-recall curve highlights that the model is just barely above the no skill line for most thresholds. This is possible because the model predicts probabilities and is uncertain about some cases. These get exposed through the different thresholds evaluated in the construction of the curve, flipping some class 0 to class 1, offering some precision but very low recall. 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 lr_f1, lr_auc = f1_score(testy, yhat), auc(lr_recall, lr_precision) # summarize scores print('Logistic: f1=%.3f auc=%.3f' % (lr_f1, lr_auc)) # plot the precision-recall curves no_skill = len(testy[testy==1]) / len(testy) plt.plot([0, 1], [no_skill, no_skill], linestyle='--', label='No Skill') plt.plot(lr_recall, lr_precision, marker='.', label='Logistic') # axis labels plt.xlabel('Recall') plt.ylabel('Precision') # show the legend plt.legend() # show the plot plt.show() 1 Logistic: f1=0.000 auc=0.054 Precision-Recall Plot for a No Skill Classifier and a Logistic Regression Model for am Imbalanced Dataset Further Reading This section provides more resources on the topic if you are looking to go deeper.

Summary In this tutorial, you discovered ROC Curves, Precision-Recall Curves, and when to use each to interpret the prediction of probabilities for binary classification problems. Specifically, you learned: ROC Curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. Precision-Recall curves summarize the trade-off between the true positive rate and the positive predictive value for a predictive model using different probability thresholds. ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets. Do you have any questions?

Nevertheless, many machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting a probability or scoring of class membership, and this must be interpreted before it can be mapped to a crisp class label. This is achieved by using a threshold, such as 0.5, where all values equal or greater than the threshold are mapped to one class and all other values are mapped to another class. For those classification problems that have a severe class imbalance, the default threshold can result in poor performance. As such, a simple and straightforward approach to improving the performance of a classifier that predicts probabilities on an imbalanced classification problem is to tune the threshold used to map probabilities to class labels. In some cases, such as when using ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves, the best or optimal threshold for the classifier can be calculated directly. In other cases, it is possible to use a grid search to tune the threshold and locate the optimal value. In this tutorial, you will discover how to tune the optimal threshold when converting probabilities to crisp class labels for imbalanced classification. After completing this tutorial, you will know: The default threshold for interpreting probabilities to class labels is 0.5, and tuning this hyperparameter is called threshold moving. How to calculate the optimal threshold for the ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve directly. How to manually search threshold values for a chosen model and model evaluation metric.

Converting Probabilities to Class Labels 2. Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification 3. Optimal Threshold for ROC Curve 4. Optimal Threshold for Precision-Recall Curve 5. Optimal Threshold Tuning Converting Probabilities to Class Labels × Many machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting a probability or a scoring of class membership. This is useful generally as it provides a measure of the certainty or uncertainty of a prediction. It also provides additional granularity over just predicting the class label that can be interpreted. Some classification tasks require a crisp class label prediction. This means that even though a probability or scoring of class membership is predicted, it must be converted into a crisp class label. The decision for converting a predicted probability or scoring into a class label is governed by a parameter referred to as the “decision threshold,” “discrimination threshold,” or simply the “threshold.” The default value for the threshold is 0.5 for normalized predicted probabilities or scores in the range between 0 or 1. For example, on a binary classification problem with class labels 0 and 1, normalized predicted probabilities and a threshold of 0.5, then values less than the threshold of 0.5 are assigned to class 0 and values greater than or equal to 0.5 are assigned to class 1. Prediction < 0.5 = Class 0 Prediction >= 0.5 = Class 1 The problem is that the default threshold may not represent an optimal interpretation of the predicted probabilities. This might be the case for a number of reasons, such as: The predicted probabilities are not calibrated, e.g. those predicted by an SVM or decision tree. The metric used to train the model is different from the metric used to evaluate a final model. The class distribution is severely skewed. The cost of one type of misclassification is more important than another type of misclassification. Worse still, some or all of these reasons may occur at the same time, such as the use of a neural network model with uncalibrated predicted probabilities on an imbalanced classification problem. As such, there is often the need to change the default decision threshold when interpreting the predictions of a model. — Page 53, Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets, 2018.

Download Your FREE Mini-Course Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification There are many techniques that may be used to address an imbalanced classification problem, such as resampling the training dataset and developing customized version of machine learning algorithms. Nevertheless, perhaps the simplest approach to handle a severe class imbalance is to change the decision threshold. Although simple and very effective, this technique is often overlooked by practitioners and research academics alike as was noted by Foster Provost in his 2000 article titled “Machine Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets.” — Machine Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets 101, 2000. There are many reasons to choose an alternative to the default decision threshold. For example, you may use ROC curves to analyze the predicted probabilities of a model and ROC AUC scores to compare and select a model, although you require crisp class labels from your model. How do you choose the threshold on the ROC Curve that results in the best balance between the true positive rate and the false positive rate? Alternately, you may use precision-recall curves to analyze the predicted probabilities of a model, precision-recall AUC to compare and select models, and require crisp class labels as predictions. How do you choose the threshold on the Precision-Recall Curve that results in the best balance between precision and recall? You may use a probability-based metric to train, evaluate, and compare models like log loss (crossentropy) but require crisp class labels to be predicted. How do you choose the optimal threshold from predicted probabilities more generally? Finally, you may have different costs associated with false positive and false negative misclassification, a so-called cost matrix, but wish to use and evaluate cost-insensitive models and later evaluate their predictions use a cost-sensitive measure. How do you choose a threshold that finds the best trade-off for predictions using the cost matrix? The bottom line is that when studying problems with imbalanced data, using the classifiers produced by standard machine learning algorithms without adjusting the output threshold may well be a critical mistake.  × — Page 67, Learning from Imbalanced Data Sets, 2018. The answer to these questions is to search a range of threshold values in order to find the best threshold. In some cases, the optimal threshold can be calculated directly. Tuning or shifting the decision threshold in order to accommodate the broader requirements of the classification problem is generally referred to as “threshold-moving,” “threshold-tuning,” or simply “thresholding.” — Pages 72, Imbalanced Learning: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications, 2013. The process involves first fitting the model on a training dataset and making predictions on a test dataset. The predictions are in the form of normalized probabilities or scores that are transformed into normalized probabilities. Different threshold values are then tried and the resulting crisp labels are evaluated using a chosen evaluation metric. The threshold that achieves the best evaluation metric is then adopted for the model when making predictions on new data in the future. We can summarize this procedure below. 1. Fit Model on the Training Dataset. 2. Predict Probabilities on the Test Dataset. 3. For each threshold in Thresholds: 3a. Convert probabilities to Class Labels using the threshold. 3b. Evaluate Class Labels. 3c. If Score is Better than Best Score. 3ci. Adopt Threshold. 4. Use Adopted Threshold When Making Class Predictions on New Data. Although simple, there are a few different approaches to implementing threshold-moving depending on your circumstance. We will take a look at some of the most common examples in the following sections. Popular way of training a cost-sensitive classifier without a known cost matrix is to put emphasis on modifying the classification outputs when predictions are being made on new data. This is usually done by setting a threshold on the positive class, below which the negative one is being predicted. The value of this threshold is optimized using a validation set and thus the cost matrix can be learned from training data.  It has been stated that trying other methods, such as sampling, without trying by simply setting the threshold may be misleading. The threshold-moving method uses the original training set to train [a model] and then moves the decision threshold such that the minority class examples are easier to be predicted correctly.  × Optimal Threshold for ROC Curve A ROC curve is a diagnostic plot that evaluates a set of probability predictions made by a model on a test dataset. A set of different thresholds are used to interpret the true positive rate and the false positive rate of the predictions on the positive (minority) class, and the scores are plotted in a line of increasing thresholds to create a curve. The false-positive rate is plotted on the x-axis and the true positive rate is plotted on the y-axis and the plot is referred to as the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, or ROC curve. A diagonal line on the plot from the bottom-left to top-right indicates the “curve” for a no-skill classifier (predicts the majority class in all cases), and a point in the top left of the plot indicates a model with perfect skill. The curve is useful to understand the trade-off in the true-positive rate and false-positive rate for different thresholds. The area under the ROC Curve, so-called ROC AUC, provides a single number to summarize the performance of a model in terms of its ROC Curve with a value between 0.5 (no-skill) and 1.0 (perfect skill). The ROC Curve is a useful diagnostic tool for understanding the trade-off for different thresholds and the ROC AUC provides a useful number for comparing models based on their general capabilities. If crisp class labels are required from a model under such an analysis, then an optimal threshold is required. This would be a threshold on the curve that is closest to the top-left of the plot. Thankfully, there are principled ways of locating this point. First, let’s fit a model and calculate a ROC Curve. We can use the make_classification() function to create a synthetic binary classification problem with 10,000 examples (rows), 99 percent of which belong to the majority class and 1 percent belong to the minority class. We can then split the dataset using the train_test_split() function and use half for the training set and half for the test set. We can then fit a LogisticRegression model and use it to make probability predictions on the test set and keep only the probability predictions for the minority class. 1 2 3 4 ... # generate dataset X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.99], flip_y=0, random_state=4) 1 2 3 ... # split into train/test sets trainX, testX, trainy, testy = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=2, stratify 1 2 3 4 ... # fit a model model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs') model.fit(trainX, trainy) × We can then use the roc_auc_score() function to calculate the true-positive rate and false-positive rate for the predictions using a set of thresholds that can then be used to create a ROC Curve plot. We can tie this all together, defining the dataset, fitting the model, and creating the ROC Curve plot. The complete example is listed below. Running the example fits a logistic regression model on the training dataset then evaluates it using a range of thresholds on the test set, creating the ROC Curve We can see that there are a number of points or thresholds close to the top-left of the plot. Which is the threshold that is optimal? 5 6 7 8 # predict probabilities lr_probs = model.predict_proba(testX) # keep probabilities for the positive outcome only lr_probs = lr_probs[:, 1] 1 2 3 ... # calculate scores lr_auc = roc_auc_score(testy, lr_probs)","output":"The optimal threshold for the ROC Curve is the point on the curve that is closest to the top-left corner, representing a good balance between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR). This point maximizes the TPR while minimizing the FPR. To find this optimal threshold, you can take the following steps: 1. Calculate the distances from each point on the ROC curve to the top-left corner (point (0,1)). 2. Identify the point on the curve with the minimum distance to the top-left corner. 3. The corresponding threshold for this point would be considered the optimal threshold. In Python, you can use the \`roc_curve\` function from scikit-learn's \`metrics\` module to calculate the TPRs and FPRs for different thresholds, and then use a custom function to find the optimal threshold based on the shortest distance to the top-left corner. Here's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to find the optimal threshold for the ROC Curve: \`\`\`python from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve import numpy as np # Assume \`testy\` contains the true class labels and \`lr_probs\` contains the predicted probabilities fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(testy, lr_probs) # Calculate the G-mean for each threshold gmeans = np.sqrt(tpr * (1 - fpr)) # Find the index of the maximum G-mean ix = np.argmax(gmeans) # Find the optimal threshold optimal_threshold = thresholds[ix] print('Optimal Threshold=%f' % (optimal_threshold)) \`\`\` The code calculates the geometric mean (G-mean) for each threshold, which balances both the TPR and the 1-FPR (specificity), and finds the threshold with the highest G-mean as the optimal threshold for the ROC Curve. This method is effective when the goal is to balance sensitivity and specificity. Keep in mind that the definition of \\"optimal\\" depends on the specific context and requirements of your classification task. You might prioritize different performance metrics (such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc.) based on the domain and the implications of false positives and false negatives in your application."},{"instruction":"Alma heeft een lang leven gehad. Ze werd geboren op 18 mei van het jaar 1926. Ze is zo lang mogelijk thuis kunnen blijven. Na een verblijf van 2 weken in het ziekenhuis werd ze opgenomen in Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel. Ze is er een maand geweest. 30 jaar geleden stierf haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger. Drie kinderen zijn reeds overleden. Ze had vrede met het Woonzorgcentrum. Het eten was er goed. Schrijf een inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie. Hier is een voorbeeld van een andere uitvaart: Op de scharniermomenten van het leven zoeken en vinden mensen elkaar terug. Ook op een dag als vandaag, omwille van dit afscheid. Wat zover af leek, is nu plotseling heel dichtbij. Elke mens heeft zijn eigen verhaal elke mens heeft zijn eigen manier van rouwen en elke mens sterft zijn eigen dood. Leven, sterven, afscheid nemen, alles loslaten we doen het op onze eigen unieke manier het is een zeer eenzame bezigheid. Rond Jeanne zijn we hier samen om haar met eerbied te omringen, om dankbaar te gedenken wie zij was. Enerzijds kennen wij gevoelens van droefheid en verdriet omwille van Jeanne die ons ontvallen is, maar anderzijds is er ook dat gevoel van dankbaarheid om wat zij voor ons betekend heeft en wie zij voor ons is geweest. Jeanne heeft heel veel voor deze parochiegemeenschap gedaan. Ze was steeds bereid om anderen te helpen. Jeanne had een sterke persoonlijkheid en kon heel goed organiseren. Ze heeft steeds haar talenten ten volle benut. Om de naam van Jeanne als onvervangbaar in onze herinnering te bewaren, om de hoop die zij gekoesterd heeft als een fakkel door te geven, om de levenswijsheid van Jeanne aan mekaar door te geven. Wij vragen om vergeving. Schrijf ook een homilie. Dit is het evangelie: (Matteüs 11, 25-30) “In die tijd zei Jezus: “Ik loof U, Vader, Heer van hemel en aarde, omdat U deze dingen voor wijzen en verstandigen verborgen hebt gehouden, maar ze aan eenvoudige mensen hebt onthuld. Ja, Vader, zo hebt U het gewild. Alles is Mij toevertrouwd door mijn Vader, en niemand dan de Vader weet wie de Zoon is, en wie de Vader is, dat weet alleen de Zoon, en iedereen aan wie de Zoon het wil openbaren. Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal ik jullie rust geven. Neem mijn juk op je en leer van Mij, want ik ben zachtmoedig en nederig van hart. Dan zullen jullie werkelijk rust vinden, want mijn juk is zacht en mijn last is licht.” Dit een voorbeeld van een homilie van een andere uitvaart: Iemand ontvalt ons... Dit zijn de ogenblikken dat we samen zitten als verslagen kinderen. Ontredderd, ontheemd, sprakeloos en kwetsbaar. Het is moeilijk om te begrijpen wat de dood is. Niet alleen als je klein bent, ook als je groot bent. Ooit zal een mens stoppen met leven. Soms merk je dat iemand niet lang meer zal leven. De dood kan snel komen. De ene dag is de mens er nog. De andere dag is hij weg. Door het overlijden van Paula er is wezenlijk iets veranderd. Bij het sterven van iemand gebeurt er iets essentieel. Paula Boomans werd geboren te Neder-Over-Heembeek op 2 februari van het jaar 1945. Als jong volwassen vrouw werd zij geconfronteerd met het overlijden van ouders en van haar broer. Tijdens die periode leerde ze Gilbert Willems, haar toekomstige echtgenoot kennen. Ze kregen twee fantastische kinderen: Karen en Peter. Paula heeft tot in het jaar 1978 in La Grande Ferme, haar ouderlijk huis in de Ransbeekstraat gewoond. Haar moeder hield er het café open en haar vader had er een houtzagerij en een transportbedrijf. Daarna verhuisde ze naar de Trassersweg. Paula werkte bij een farmaceutisch bedrijf dat gesloten werd. Daardoor werd Paula op vijftigjarige leeftijd verplicht op pensioen gesteld. Paula was een stille vrouw. Ze heeft haar echtgenoot steeds terzijde gestaan in de uitoefening van verschillende hobby’s. Zo waren er de activiteiten van het Davidsfonds, de volksdansgroep Lendrik en de muziekgroep Faro. Er was Blackstar. Paula ging mee naar de rolschaats activiteiten van haar dochter. Ze was een goede gastvrouw. Er waren ook de mooie momenten aan zee. Ze hield van haar kinderen en kleinkinderen. Ook de hond Bo nam een centrale plaats in het gezin in. Paula vierde de belangrijke momenten van haar jaar samen met familie. Ze gaf teveel snoepjes aan de kleinkinkinderen. Wat Paula ons gegeven heeft, blijft kostbaar en onuitwisbaar. Niemand neemt het van ons af. Zo heeft ooit een vertwijfeld volk - generaties lang - mensen die zich verloren voelden, die geen vrede vonden met wat ze om zich heen zagen gebeuren, tot God geroepen. En in dat dieptepunt werd hun een heel andere toekomst toegezegd: \\"Klamp je niet vast aan wat vroeger is gebeurd. Staar je niet blind op wat voorafging. Zie, iets nieuws ga Ik maken. Het is al aan het kiemen, weet jij dat niet? Ja, een weg zal Ik leggen door de woestijn... Ik geef water waar geen water is... Er gebeurt iets nieuws, het was al aan het kiemen, wij wisten het niet...” Maar niet dat verdriet zal onze herinnering onherroepelijk overschaduwen maar de herinnering aan de mens die zij is geweest. Alles wat zij gedaan heeft. Wie zij voor ons is geweest. In het bijbelfragment uit het Evangelie richt Jezus zich tot de vermoeide levenden. De kerngedachte luidt: 'Kom naar Mij, jullie die vermoeid zijn en onder lasten gebukt gaan, dan zal Ik jullie rust geven.' \\"Mijn juk is zacht ; zegt Jezus, \\"en mijn last is licht\\" Jezus neemt de lasten niet weg in een handomdraai. Let wel: het juk blijft en de lasten blijven eveneens. Ze worden draaglijk. Er valt mee te leven. De laatste veertien dagen stond de wereld van het gezin Willems-Bomans op zijn kop. Paula vernam dat zij een agressieve kanker had waar niets meer aan te doen was. Haar levensperspectief werd zeer kort. Omringd door haar dierbaren is Paula van ons heengegaan. Bedankt Paula voor alles wat je gedaan hebt, voor de mens die jij geweest bent, voor je onverwoestbare kern.","output":"Inleiding voor de uitvaartliturgie van Alma: In de gewijde stilte van deze samenkomst, zijn we bijeengekomen om in liefde en respect afscheid te nemen van Alma, een vrouw van standvastige vastberadenheid en een hart gevuld met liefde en zorgzaamheid. Een moeder, een oma, een vriendin, een vertrouwde aanwezigheid die enkele bladzijden van haar levensverhaal bij ons achterlaat. Alma's reis begon op 18 mei van het jaar 1926, een eeuw van verandering waarin zij standhield als een baken van licht voor velen. Ze deelde lief en leed en bewaarde met zorg de herinneringen aan haar echtgenoot Gaby De Saeger, die haar dertig jaar terug voorging, en aan de drie kinderen die zij heeft moeten laten gaan. Haar laatste dagen bracht Alma door in de liefdevolle omarming van Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel, een plaats van rust die haar gemoed vredig stemde en waar ze gelukkig was met de kleine dingen, zoals het dagelijkse eten. Vandaag hier samen, leggen we de schakels van ons eigen leven even stil, om ons te verenigen in herinnering aan haar. Alma's leven was een stille les in veerkracht en vergiffenis, in het houden van vrede met de wereld en zichzelf. Haar nalatenschap is er een van standvastige liefde en onuitwisbare voetsporen in de harten van hen die haar kenden. Laten we nu, met een mengeling van verdriet om haar gemis en dankbaarheid voor haar aanwezigheid, Alma herdenken. Voor de kracht die zij ons gaf, voor de wijze lessen en voor de onvoorwaardelijke liefde die ze verspreidde waar ze ook ging. In haar nagedachtenis zullen we streven naar een vrede en rust die zij nu heeft gevonden. Homilie: Geliefden, we zijn hier vandaag verzameld in de schaduw van zowel verlies als licht. We staan stil, hart na hart, bij het heengaan van een dierbare ziel - onze Alma, die door de tijden heen gestaag haar weg heeft gebaand door het leven. Alma's bestaan heeft de getijden van een volledige eeuw doorstaan, haar verhalen zijn zo onmiskenbaar als de veranderingen die ze heeft gezien en gevoeld. Zoals zij heeft gewandeld met moed en mededogen, herinneren we ons haar als een pilaar van steun, een toeverlaat in roerige tijden. Wanneer we naar het Evangelie van Matteüs kijken, zien we de woorden van Jezus, een uitnodiging van troost voor hen die beladen zijn met lasten. Deze woorden vatten op een bijzondere manier het leven samen dat Alma leidde en de rust die zij ons nu vanuit een andere plaats biedt. Zij wist wat lasten waren; ze droeg ze met een nederig hart en bood altijd een zacht juk aan hen in haar omgeving. Alma’s verhaal, geworteld in de eenvoud van het zijn en de diepe zin voor liefde, weerkaatst Jezus’ boodschap en nodigt ons uit om rust te vinden in de zware tijden. Haar levensloop, die eindigde in het Woonzorgcentrum De Stichel, was er een met een accent van dankbaarheid en aanvaarding - karaktereigenschappen die Jezus zo hoog achtte. In onze herinnering aan Alma zijn we geroepen om de lasten te dragen met dezelfde zachtmoedigheid en nederigheid die zij uitstraalde. Terwijl wij rouwen en zoeken naar betekenis, laten we de schoonheid van haar leven erkennen en een bron van licht laten zijn op ons pad. Zo zeggen we vandaag niet alleen vaarwel tegen Alma, maar ook een welgemeend dank u aan haar onvergetelijke geest, haar onwankelbare liefde en voor de vrede die zij ons nu vanuit haar hemelse rustplaats toewenst. Laat ons in gebed en meditatie haar leven eren en ons hart openstellen voor de rust die zij, en Jezus ons belooft. Amen."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Main execution block (\`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\`): Orchestrates the flow of operations based on user input. From the current state of the script, it seems that there might be an overlap or duplication in functionality. For example, \`process_video_files\` does similar steps as part of the main execution block but isn't used. The \`video_durations\` dictionary is re-defined and re-populated within \`process_video_files\`, although it was already assembled in the preceding lines. Also, the implementation of \`store_segment_info\` isn't complete, as there's no invocation of this function. Here's a rough flow of the script's execution based on user input: 1. It asks the user whether to include subfolders in the video search. 2. It retrieves video durations using \`get_video_durations\`. 3. The user is prompted to enter the segment duration and the number of moments to extract. 4. It asks the user their preference for sorting the extracted video segments. 5. For each video file found, it performs the following actions: - Converts the video's audio track into a WAV file. - Identifies the loudest moments using \`find_loudest_moments\`. - Sorts these moments if needed by the preference indicated by the user through \`ask_sorting_preference\`. - Extracts the segments from the video around these moments using \`extract_segments\`. The script is meant to handle errors such as missing video files or issues during processing without stopping the overall processing of available video files. Additionally, the script uses the \`moviepy\` library to work with video files, \`scipy.io.wavfile\` to read WAV files, \`numpy\` for numerical computations, and \`ffmpeg\` for video and audio processing. It utilizes a temporary audio file to store audio extracted from video files, which it disposes of at the end of processing each video. Finally, there are some unfinalized or unused parts in this script, such as the \`temporary_audio_files\` list and the \`store_segment_info\` function, which indicate the script may be a work-in-progress or that some refactoring may be necessary to improve efficiency and clarity."},{"instruction":"Modifie ce script.

Below is an outline of the steps you would generally follow to create such an app using Java or Kotlin in Android Studio, which is the official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android development. 1. **Set Up Your Development Environment:** - Install Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio. - Create a new Android project and choose a template that fits your design, such as an Empty Activity. 2. **Define the User Interface:** - Edit the \`activity_main.xml\` file to define the layout. You might want to include: - An \`EditText\` field for the user to input the function. - A \`Button\` to plot the function. - A custom view or a library component to display the graph. 3. **Create a Graph View:** - You can create a custom View by extending the \`View\` class. Override the \`onDraw\` method to enable custom drawing. - Alternatively, you can use a graph plotting library such as MPAndroidChart, GraphView, or AndroidPlot which will simplify the drawing process. 4. **Function Parsing:** - For the app to understand the function inputted by the user, you'll need a way to parse it. You could write your own parser, but it's usually better to use a library such as mXparser or exp4j. These libraries allow you to evaluate strings as mathematical expressions. 5. **Plotting the Function:** - Depending on your choice in Step 3, you'll either be drawing directly on the Canvas or setting data on the graph library object. - In either case, you need to generate a set of points from the function to be plotted. This usually involves evaluating the function at regular intervals for a range of x-values. 6. **Respond to User Input:** - Implement an event listener for the button click. - When the button is clicked, get the input from the \`EditText\`, parse the function, and then initiate plotting by updating the graph view or library component. 7. **Permissions and Features:** - Ensure your app has the appropriate permissions in the \`AndroidManifest.xml\`. For a graph plotting app, you typically don't need any special permissions unless you're saving or sharing images of the graphs. 8. **Debugging and Testing:** - Test the application on different devices and screen sizes to ensure the graph is drawn correctly. - Debug any issues that arise during testing. 9. **Optional Features:** - Implement additional features such as pinch-to-zoom, scrollable graph view, saving plots, exporting images, etc. 10. **Build, Test, and Iterate:** - Use the built-in emulator or a physical Android device to build and test your app. - As you develop your app, iterate over each feature and make improvements. 11. **Optimize Performance:** - Ensure the app runs smoothly by profiling and optimizing performance, especially when plotting complex functions. 12. **Finalize and Publish:** - Once your app works well and is free of bugs, prepare it for release. - Follow the Android launch checklist to ensure you've met all guidelines: https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch. This is a high-level overview, and each step involves more detailed work, but it should give you a roadmap to follow as you embark on developing your math function plotting app. Always remember to take advantage of the vast amount of resources available for Android development, such as documentation, tutorials, and forums. Good luck with your Android development project!"},{"instruction":"I want to develop it in python","output":"To develop an Android app in Python that visualizes and plots mathematical functions, you can use a framework like Kivy which is designed for creating cross-platform applications. Kivy is an open-source Python library that provides a natural user interface (NUI) and can be used to deploy on Android through the Buildozer or Pyjnius toolchain. Here is a high-level guide to create a basic function plotting app using Kivy: 1. **Install Kivy:** First, make sure Python is installed on your computer. Then, install Kivy by running: \`\`\` python -m pip install kivy \`\`\` 2. **Create a New Kivy Project:** - Create a new directory for your project and a main Python file, for instance, \`main.py\`. - Define the basic structure of your app by subclassing from \`kivy.app.App\`. 3. **Design the User Interface:** - Use Kivy's \`.kv\` language or Python code to create the UI. You might want to add: - An \`TextInput\` widget for entering the function. - A \`Button\` widget to trigger the plot action. - A \`Graph\` widget to display the plotted function. 4. **Install Additional Libraries for Function Parsing and Plotting:** - For parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, you can use a library like \`SymPy\`. Install it using: \`\`\` python -m pip install sympy \`\`\` - For plotting, you may use \`matplotlib\` which integrates with Kivy through the Garden Matplotlib project. \`\`\` python -m pip install matplotlib python -m pip install kivy-garden garden install matplotlib \`\`\` 5. **Graph Widget:** - \`Matplotlib\` can be used with Kivy by creating a FigureCanvasKivyAgg widget and attaching it to your app. - Integrate the \`Graph\` widget into your UI. 6. **Function Parsing and Plotting:** - Use \`SymPy\` or another equivalent library to parse the function input from the user. - Evaluate the function across a range of x-values to get the points to plot. - Use \`matplotlib\` to plot these points on the graph. 7. **Set Up Buildozer for Android Deployment:** - Install Buildozer with \`pip\` to prepare and build your application for Android: \`\`\` python -m pip install buildozer \`\`\` - Initialize a buildozer.spec file in your project directory: \`\`\` buildozer init \`\`\` - Edit the \`buildozer.spec\` file to specify your application requirements, such as package name, version, and any Python dependencies like \`matplotlib\` and \`SymPy\`. 8. **Build and Run on Android:** - Connect an Android device or start an emulator. - Run Buildozer to compile, deploy, and run your app on Android: \`\`\` buildozer -v android debug deploy run \`\`\` - Your Android device may need to be in developer mode with USB debugging enabled. 9. **Test and Debug:** - Test your application to make sure the plots function correctly and the UI is responsive. - To debug, check the Buildozer logs and address any issues that arise. This guide provides a basic framework to get started, but the complexity of your app (such as adding more interactive elements or complex plotting capabilities) will dictate additional work and potential troubleshooting. Kivy has detailed documentation, and its community can be an invaluable resource as you develop your app. There are also numerous Kivy-compatible libraries to help you add more functionality and features to your application."},{"instruction":"Give me code for that","output":"Certainly! Below is a simple example of how to create an Android app in Python using the Kivy library to plot mathematical functions. This example assumes that you have already installed Kivy, Kivy Garden, Matplotlib, and SymPy as described in the previous steps. It demonstrates plotting a single-variable function entered by the user. We can't directly compile or run this code here, but you can try it on your development machine. First, let's write the Python script (\`main.py\`) that sets up the UI and handles the plotting: \`\`\`python from kivy.app import App from kivy.uix.boxlayout import BoxLayout from kivy.uix.textinput import TextInput from kivy.uix.button import Button from kivy.garden.matplotlib.backend_kivyagg import FigureCanvasKivyAgg import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from sympy import symbols, lambdify, sympify class PlotterApp(App): def build(self): self.box = BoxLayout(orientation='vertical') # User input for function self.input_function = TextInput(hint_text='Enter function (e.g., \\"sin(x)\\")', multiline=False) self.box.add_widget(self.input_function) # Plot button self.plot_button = Button(text='Plot', size_hint=(1, 0.1)) self.plot_button.bind(on_release=self.plot_graph) self.box.add_widget(self.plot_button) # Graph placeholder self.figure, self.ax = plt.subplots() self.canvas = FigureCanvasKivyAgg(self.figure) self.box.add_widget(self.canvas) return self.box def plot_graph(self, instance): function_input = self.input_function.text.strip() # Handle invalid input if not function_input: return x = symbols('x') try: # Parse input into a usable function parsed_function = sympify(function_input) # Create Numpy lambda function f = lambdify(x, parsed_function, 'numpy') # Generate data for plotting x_vals = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000) y_vals = f(x_vals) # Clear current plot self.ax.clear() # Plot new function self.ax.plot(x_vals, y_vals) # Draw the updated plot self.canvas.draw_idle() except Exception as e: print(f\\"Error parsing function: {e}\\") if __name__ == '__main__': PlotterApp().run() \`\`\` After you have written the script, you need to initialize Buildozer and configure the \`buildozer.spec\` file. Run the following from the terminal in your project directory: \`\`\` buildozer init \`\`\` Now configure your \`buildozer.spec\` file, setting the \`requirements\` line to include our dependencies: \`\`\` requirements = python3,kivy,sympy,numpy,matplotlib \`\`\` Make sure you have the following line in your \`buildozer.spec\` file to enable permissions for your app to access external storage, which may be needed for matplotlib: \`\`\` android.permissions = INTERNET,WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE \`\`\` It's also good practice to add \`matplotlib\` to the garden requirements: \`\`\` garden_requirements = matplotlib \`\`\` Once you've set up your \`buildozer.spec\`, run the following in the terminal to build, deploy, and run your application: \`\`\` buildozer -v android debug deploy run \`\`\` This script provides a starting point and there's a lot more to do to make your application production ready. You'll need to handle incorrect input more gracefully, potentially add more complex plotting features, and generally test thoroughly on different Android devices."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Se for esse o caso, \\"temperatura\\" refere-se a um parâmetro utilizado em modelos de linguagem para controlar a aleatoriedade das respostas geradas. No contexto de um modelo de linguagem, a temperatura é uma configuração que influencia a distribuição de probabilidade quando o modelo está escolhendo a próxima palavra ou token durante a geração de texto. Uma baixa temperatura faz com que o modelo favoreça as palavras ou tokens de alta probabilidade, resultando em respostas mais previsíveis e determinísticas. Em contraste, uma temperatura mais alta permite que o modelo dê mais peso a tokens com menor probabilidade, o que pode resultar em respostas mais variadas e às vezes mais criativas ou imprevisíveis. Portanto, podemos interpretar \\"precisão\\" de diferentes maneiras, dependendo do contexto: 1. Consistência e Cohesão: Com uma temperatura baixa, o modelo produzirá textos mais consistentes e coesos, o que pode ser interpretado como mais \\"precisos\\" em termos de seguir expectativas comuns sobre o que uma resposta tipicamente \\"correta\\" ou \\"coerente\\" compreenderia. 2. Variedade e Criatividade: Com uma temperatura alta, o modelo pode ser mais propenso a gerar textos originais e menos óbvios, o que pode parecer menos \\"preciso\\" se você está procurando respostas mais convencionais, mas mais \\"preciso\\" se o objetivo for gerar conteúdo criativo ou fora do comum. 3. Confiabilidade de Informação: Independente da temperatura, é importante lembrar que modelos de linguagem, como o GPT, não são infalíveis e devem ser considerados ferramentas que auxiliam na geração de contéudo, que necessitam de verificação e senso crítico do humano para garantir a precisão factual de qualquer informação fornecida. Se você estava se referindo a um contexto diferente onde a temperatura controla a precisão, por favor, forneça mais informações para que eu possa abordá-lo adequadamente."},{"instruction":"Em Death Note Special ONE Short: qual é o plano de Minoru Tanaka Para Não Ser Pego","output":"Em \\"Death Note: Special One-Shot\\", que é uma continuação do mangá original \\"Death Note\\" criado por Tsugumi Ohba e Takeshi Obata, o personagem Minoru Tanaka cria um plano engenhoso para usar o Death Note sem ser pego. Aqui está um resumo do plano de Minoru: 1. **Venda do Death Note**: Em vez de usar o Death Note para matar, Minoru decide vender o caderno. Ele acredita que, ao não escrever nenhum nome, ele pode evitar a atenção do Shinigami Ryuk e das autoridades. 2. **Leilão Anônimo**: Minoru organiza um leilão público transmitido mundialmente através da Kira's Network, onde nações do mundo inteiro podem fazer lances para adquirir o Death Note. Para manter seu anonimato, ele usa a transmissão para se comunicar, nunca revelando sua identidade. 3. **Transferência de Propriedade**: Ao invés de entregar o Death Note diretamente ao comprador, Minoru faz um acordo com Ryuk para entregar o caderno ao líder do país que oferecer o maior lance. 4. **Pagamento Indireto**: Minoru instrui o país vencedor do leilão a depositar o pagamento em contas bancárias de todas as pessoas com uma conta de poupança no Japão com idade entre 60 meses e 24 anos, dividindo o montante igualmente. Isso torna praticamente impossível rastrear o dinheiro de volta a ele. 5. **Esquecimento Estratégico**: Após a conclusão do leilão e a confirmação do pagamento, Minoru toca no Death Note para perder todas as memórias relacionadas a ele, garantindo que, mesmo sob interrogatório, ele não teria informações para dar às autoridades. 6. **Resultado Inesperado**: Apesar do plano cuidadoso de Minoru para evitar detecção e punição, há um desfecho inesperado. O novo Rei Shinigami, que assumiu após a morte do antigo Rei Shinigami, adiciona uma nova regra ao Death Note: qualquer humano que compre ou venda o Death Note terá seu nome escrito no caderno pelo Shinigami que possui o Death Note. Isso leva à morte de Minoru Tanaka, que morre pacificamente sem saber o motivo, já que ele havia perdido todas as memórias relacionadas ao Death Note. O plano de Minoru é inteligente porque ele reconhece as limitações e perigos associados ao uso direto do Death Note e tenta capitalizar sobre o caderno de uma maneira que minimiza o risco pessoal. No entanto, ele não poderia prever a adição de uma nova regra pelos Shinigamis, o que resulta em sua morte."},{"instruction":"O que é a neuroplasticidade : e como ela implica no aprendizado ou na adaptabilidade intelectual,física, e emocional","output":"A neuroplasticidade, também conhecida como plasticidade neural ou cerebral, refere-se à capacidade do cérebro de se reorganizar estrutural e funcionalmente em resposta a experiências e aprendizagem. Esta propriedade do cérebro é fundamental para o desenvolvimento durante a infância, para a aprendizagem em qualquer idade e para a recuperação após lesões cerebrais. Existem dois tipos principais de neuroplasticidade: 1. **Plasticidade Sináptica**: Refere-se à capacidade das sinapses (conexões entre neurônios) de se fortalecerem ou enfraquecerem ao longo do tempo, com base na quantidade de atividade elétrica que passa por elas. Isso é muitas vezes resumido pela frase \\"neurônios que disparam juntos, se conectam\\", indicando que padrões de atividade neural que ocorrem juntos podem levar a uma conexão mais forte entre esses neurônios. 2. **Plasticidade Estrutural**: Envolve mudanças na organização física do cérebro, como a formação de novos neurônios (neurogênese), o crescimento de novos dendritos e axônios, ou a formação de novas sinapses. A neuroplasticidade implica no aprendizado e na adaptabilidade de várias maneiras: **Aprendizado e Memória**: Quando aprendemos algo novo, nossos cérebros mudam fisicamente. As sinapses podem se fortalecer, e novas conexões podem ser formadas ou reforçadas. Isso é parte do motivo pelo qual a prática repetida de uma habilidade pode levar a melhorias significativas – o cérebro está se ajustando para otimizar essa habilidade. **Adaptabilidade Intelectual**: A neuroplasticidade permite que o cérebro se adapte a novos desafios intelectuais e resolva problemas. Quando enfrentamos tarefas complexas ou aprendemos novos conceitos, o cérebro pode reorganizar suas redes para acomodar e integrar essas informações. **Recuperação de Lesões**: Após uma lesão cerebral, como um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC), a neuroplasticidade pode permitir que áreas do cérebro assumam as funções de áreas danificadas, o que é a base para muitas formas de reabilitação. **Adaptabilidade Física**: A neuroplasticidade também desempenha um papel na reabilitação física. Por exemplo, após uma lesão que afeta o movimento, como uma lesão na medula espinhal, o treino e a terapia podem ajudar a reconfigurar o cérebro para recuperar algumas funções ou aprender novas maneiras de realizar tarefas. **Adaptabilidade Emocional**: A capacidade do cérebro de se adaptar não se limita ao intelecto e ao físico; também se aplica à nossa saúde emocional. Terapias como a terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC) podem levar a mudanças na maneira como o cérebro processa informações emocionais, ajudando as pessoas a superar padrões de pensamento negativos e a desenvolver resiliência emocional. A neuroplasticidade é uma área de intenso estudo na neurociência, pois oferece esperança para o desenvolvimento de novos tratamentos para condições neurológicas e psiquiátricas e para a melhoria da aprendizagem e da função cognitiva em geral. É uma demonstração da incrível adaptabilidade do cérebro humano e de sua capacidade contínua de mudança e crescimento ao longo da vida."},{"instruction":"Como Utilizar a neuroplasticidade a nosso favor","output":"Utilizar a neuroplasticidade a nosso favor envolve adotar práticas e hábitos que estimulem o cérebro a se reorganizar e se fortalecer de maneiras que promovam a aprendizagem, a memória, a recuperação de lesões e a saúde mental e emocional. Aqui estão algumas estratégias para aproveitar a neuroplasticidade: 1. **Aprendizado Contínuo**: Engaje-se em atividades de aprendizado ao longo de toda a vida, como aprender um novo idioma, instrumento musical, ou qualquer outra habilidade. Isso desafia o cérebro e promove a formação de novas conexões neurais. 2. **Repetição e Prática**: A prática repetida de habilidades pode fortalecer as conexões sinápticas e melhorar a eficiência neural. Isso é especialmente verdadeiro para o desenvolvimento de habilidades motoras e cognitivas. 3. **Desafie-se**: Sair da zona de conforto e enfrentar desafios intelectuais pode estimular o cérebro a crescer e mudar. Quebra-cabeças, jogos de estratégia e tarefas complexas podem ser úteis. 4. **Atividade Física**: O exercício regular, especialmente o aeróbico, aumenta o fluxo sanguíneo para o cérebro e pode promover a neurogênese, especialmente no hipocampo, uma área chave para a memória. 5. **Meditação e Mindfulness**: Práticas que envolvem atenção plena e meditação têm sido associadas a mudanças positivas na estrutura e função do cérebro e podem melhorar a regulação emocional e reduzir o estresse. 6. **Nutrição**: Uma dieta balanceada rica em nutrientes como ômega-3, antioxidantes, vitaminas e minerais pode apoiar a saúde do cérebro e potencializar a neuroplasticidade. 7. **Sono de Qualidade**: O sono é essencial para a consolidação da memória e para o funcionamento geral do cérebro. Durante o sono, o cérebro reorganiza e reforça o que aprendemos durante o dia. 8. **Socialização**: Interações sociais e relacionamentos significativos podem estimular o cérebro e promover a neuroplasticidade. Conversar, compartilhar experiências e aprender com os outros são todas atividades que podem beneficiar o cérebro. 9. **Redução do Estresse**: O estresse crônico pode ser prejudicial para o cérebro, portanto, encontrar maneiras eficazes de gerenciar o estresse é importante para manter a neuroplasticidade. 10. **Terapias Cognitivas**: Para aqueles que buscam superar padrões de pensamento negativos ou lidar com questões de saúde mental, terapias baseadas na neuroplasticidade, como a terapia cognitivo-comportamental, podem ser eficazes. 11. **Recuperação de Lesões**: Em caso de lesão cerebral, trabalhar com profissionais de saúde para desenvolver um plano de reabilitação que inclua terapia física, ocupacional e/ou fonoaudiológica pode ajudar a aproveitar a neuroplasticidade para a recuperação. Ao incorporar essas práticas em sua vida, você pode ajudar a manter seu cérebro flexível e resiliente, potencializando sua capacidade de aprender e se adaptar a novas situações e desafios."},{"instruction":"Fatos Que Provém que Ayanokoji Kiyotaka Não é um Estouco","output":"Ayanokoji Kiyotaka é o protagonista da série de light novels \\"Classroom of the Elite\\" (também conhecida como \\"Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e\\"), escrita por Shogo Kinugasa e ilustrada por Shunsaku Tomose.

Sua criação e treinamento na \\"White Room\\" o moldaram de uma certa maneira, mas ao longo da série, ele começa a explorar quem ele é fora desse contexto, indicando uma profundidade emocional e pessoal. 7. **Relações Complexas**: As interações e relações de Ayanokoji com outros personagens, como Horikita Suzune e Kushida Kikyou, são complexas e multifacetadas. Ele se envolve com eles de maneiras que vão além da simples manipulação, mostrando que ele é capaz de formar laços genuínos. Esses pontos destacam que Ayanokoji Kiyotaka não é um estúpido, mas sim um personagem deliberadamente reservado e controlado, cujas ações e comportamentos são muitas vezes mal interpretados devido à sua natureza enigmática e à sua tendência a esconder suas verdadeiras intenções e sentimentos."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Composition: The composition of Martian samples, such as meteorites found on Earth and the data gathered by Mars rovers, align with the known characteristics of Mars. These samples have revealed the presence of minerals like basalt and olivine, which are consistent with the volcanic nature of Mars. 2. Atmosphere: The atmospheric composition of Mars, as determined by samples and observations, matches the characteristics of the planet. The Martian atmosphere is primarily made up of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen, argon, and other gases. Samples have confirmed these findings, demonstrating that the atmospheric composition aligns with expectations. 3. Water History: The presence of water on Mars, both in the past and currently trapped in the form of ice, aligns with the characteristics of the planet. Martian samples have shown evidence of water-related minerals, such as hydrated salts and clay-like materials, indicating that Mars likely had liquid water on its surface at some point in its history. 4. Geological Features: The geological features observed on Mars, such as impact craters, volcanoes, and ancient riverbeds, are consistent with the characteristics of the planet. Samples, especially those examined by rovers, have revealed the presence of geological materials that match the types of features seen on the Martian surface. Overall, the characteristics of Mars align with the samples collected from the planet, providing a more detailed understanding of its composition, atmosphere, water history, and geological features."},{"instruction":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

If no keypress occurs during that time frame, the \`load_image_delayed\` method is called to load the image. If a keypress occurs, the scheduled loading is canceled."},{"instruction":"so what would the full next_image looks like","output":"Here's how your full \`next_image\` method would look like, modified to cancel the scheduled image loading if any keypress happens during the 500ms delay: \`\`\`python def next_image(self, event=None): if self.timer is not None: # Cancel the scheduled image loading if the timer is set self.root.after_cancel(self.timer) self.timer = None if self.image_folder != \\"\\": if self.random_next_image_var.get(): # Check if random next image is selected self.current_image_index = random.randint(0, len(self.image_files) - 1) # Randomly select the next image index else: self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index + 1) % len(self.image_files) # Linearly select the next image index # Display the image (or its name tag if switching quickly) self.display_image() # Reset the timer interval to the stored set timer interval self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval \`\`\` This method now considers that if there is an active timer for delayed image loading, it gets canceled if the user navigates to the next image. This prevents the loading of the previous image that was scheduled to load after the delay in case of quick switching between images. After canceling the timer (if it was set), the method proceeds to either randomly select the next image index or increment it linearly, then calls \`display_image\`, which will handle showing the image or the placeholder text as required, and resets the timer interval."},{"instruction":"that works but when the timer run and i press next image or previous the timer stops. how can i make it so that every other functionality is the same, but the timer doesn't stop when changing image but only reset on a new image","output":"To ensure the timer continues running but resets whenever a new image is selected (either next or previous), you can modify the \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` methods to simply reset the \`timer_interval\` instead of canceling the timer. Also, inside the \`start_pause_slideshow\` method, always start the timer when an image change occurs (even if not paused).

Make sure your \`start_timer\` and \`update_timer\` methods support restarting the timer like this. The \`update_timer\` method should continue updating the countdown, and when it reaches 0, display the next image and reset the timer interval. The \`start_timer\` method should create a new timer only if \`self.is_paused\` is \`False\`."},{"instruction":"but i don't want it to always start the timer when image change occurs, especially when paused or not started","output":"Understood. If you want the timer to only reset when changing the image and to not interrupt the paused or not-started state, you can modify the image navigation methods to reset the timer without affecting the paused state. Here's how you would modify your \`ImageViewer\` class functions to keep these specifications in mind: \`\`\`python def next_image(self, event=None): if self.image_folder != \\"\\": if self.random_next_image_var.get(): # Randomly select the next image index self.current_image_index = random.randint(0, len(self.image_files) - 1) else: # Linearly select the next image index self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index + 1) % len(self.image_files) self.display_image() # Reset the timer interval if the slideshow is running if not self.is_paused: self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval def previous_image(self, event=None): if self.image_folder != \\"\\": if self.random_next_image_var.get(): # Randomly select the previous image index self.current_image_index = random.randint(0, len(self.image_files) - 1) else: # Linearly select the previous image index self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index - 1) % len(self.image_files) self.display_image() # Reset the timer interval if the slideshow is running if not self.is_paused: self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval \`\`\` Given your requirements, both \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` will reset the timer interval only if the slideshow is not paused (i.e., when \`self.is_paused\` is \`False\`). If the slideshow is paused, image navigation will not impact the timer, keeping the slideshow in the paused state. The \`start_pause_slideshow\` function will remain as in your original code, interacting with the timer only when explicitly started or paused by the user. With these changes, the timer will continue counting down after an image change, unless the slideshow is paused, in which case it will not start counting down again until unpaused. When the timer reaches zero, it will automatically call \`next_image\` to update the image, resetting the timer in the process unless the slideshow is paused."},{"instruction":"name all key documents used in Order to cash business process. this time don't miss anything, verify all information before making the flow.","output":"In an Order to Cash (OTC) business process, several key documents are typically used.
