This movie serves as the official finale to the series even though it was aired months before the last eight episodes of the fourth season.The omnitrix is a very complex weapon and this episode is a very good explanation and overlook of it. The omnitrix creator is called Asmath. He is of the race of Aliens that Ben can turn into called Grey Matter. While Ben was fighting Dr. Animo with Eyeguy.....he antecedently activates the DNA bomb which enables the Omnitrix in SDM (Self-Destruct-Mode). As Tetrax gets the readings from the Omnitrix he comes straight away. He tells Ben the he must find the creator fast because if he doesn't he will also be destroyed with the Omnitrix. As they land on an alien station or something, they disguise themselves but Ben saw Vilgax there. He planned to defeat Vilgax once and for all.

He applies a new alien Way Big, this time Vlgax was out for good. As they go back... Answer:","output":"In the movie Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix, which serves as the official finale to Ben 10, season 4, we get an in-depth look at the complex weapon that is the Omnitrix. As Ben fights Dr. Animo with the alien Eyeguy, he accidentally activates the DNA bomb, putting the Omnitrix in Self-Destruct Mode (SDM). Upon receiving the readings from the Omnitrix, Tetrax immediately comes to help, warning Ben that they must find its creator, Asmath, in order to prevent its destruction along with Ben. As Ben, Gwen, and Tetrax go to an alien station to search for the creator, they disguise themselves to avoid drawing attention. There, Ben encounters someone he believes to be Vilgax, the primary antagonist of the series, but it turns out to be a female of Vilgax's species named Myaxx. She claims to be the creator of the Omnitrix, but later it is discovered that she was not the actual creator. Meanwhile, the mysterious alien attacks the group, with everyone on the station being terrified since Ben is wearing the Omnitrix. In a chaotic battle, Stinkfly goes out of control, and Tetrax, after fighting with the villain Sixsix, saves Ben from danger. During the journey, Tetrax's driver, Pludo, a slimy alien, sacrifices himself to save Gwen. The team eventually ends up in a place where they are attacked by wild vines, and Gwen is captured by one of them. This enrages Ben, who transforms into Fourarms, but it only causes the Omnitrix's self-destruct countdown to accelerate. Cannonbolt then steps in to help break the door to the creator's location, who turns out to be a Grey Matter alien. As Vilgax attacks the group once more, Ben is surprised and relieved to find out that Gwen is, in fact, alive. The creator of the Omnitrix manages to disable it, fix it, and reactivate it just in time. He also adds a new alien, Way Big, which helps Ben defeat Vilgax once and for all. In conclusion, the movie Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix serves as an action-packed and informative finale to the series, providing a deeper understanding of the Omnitrix's capabilities and origin. The characters face numerous challenges and twists, ultimately leading to Ben's final showdown with Vilgax and the salvation of the Omnitrix, ending the story on a triumphant note."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Louis XIV (5 September 16381 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (') or the Sun King ('), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715. His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history. In this age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Prince of Orange is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title \\"Prince of Orange\\" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. The title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. The title descends via absolute primogeniture since 1983, meaning that its holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war.  - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - Frederick William I (14 August 1688  31 May 1740), known as the 'Soldier King,' was the King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death, as well as the father of Frederick the Great. He was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel.  - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - Francesco Guerini ( fl . 1740 -- 1770 ) was a Neapolitan violinist and composer whose works were published throughout Europe in the mid 18th century . While his birthdate is unknown , Guerini worked in The Hague for the Prince of Orange from 1740 until 1760 , at which time he moved to London , where he was active until 1770 . Most of Guerini 's published compositions were sonatas for one or two violins and continuo , but he also wrote keyboard works as well as Six Sonates / A deux Flûtes , ou deux Violons ... Ouevre III ( with no continuo ) , Paris , ca . 1750 , or Six Solos for a Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord , Opus 9 , first published in London in 1765 .  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.  - William III (4 November 1650  8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\".  - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Frederick I (11 July 1657  25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (16881713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (17011713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He was also the paternal grandfather of Frederick the Great.  - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon.   - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'date of birth' with '1701'.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who was dismissed by Earland? is inside the article: By the end of the 1960s, Ornette Coleman had become one of the most influential musicians in jazz after pioneering its most controversial subgenre, free jazz, which jazz critics and musicians initially derided for its deviation from conventional structures of harmony and tonality. In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a..., can you guess it ? A:","output":"The last name of the person who was dismissed by Earland is Tacuma.

Would \\"Some integrated circuits (ICs) can contain multiple CPUs on a single chip; those ICs are called multi-core processors .\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"Yes, your statement is partially accurate in addressing the alternative name for a CPU. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is also commonly referred to as a microprocessor, processor, or simply a chip. It is the primary component responsible for executing instructions and processing data for computers and other electronic devices.  The statement you provided, \\"Some integrated circuits (ICs) can contain multiple CPUs on a single chip; those ICs are called multi-core processors,\\" essentially explains the concept of multi-core processors, which is an evolution in processor technology, but not exactly an alternative name for a CPU. A multi-core processor is a single IC or chip that comprises two or more independent CPUs or processing units, which are called cores. These cores work simultaneously and enable better performance and efficiency by processing multiple instructions and tasks concurrently. The cores inside the multi-core processor can be considered as individual CPUs, but they function together as a single chip to provide improved computing power. In summary, while a CPU can be referred to as a microprocessor, processor, or chip, the statement you provided explains the concept of multi-core processors. When considering a CPU's alternative name, it is more accurate to focus on terms like microprocessor or processor, as they directly represent the essence of a CPU and its function in computing devices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term.

The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate.  - Podgorica (; Montenegrin Cyrillic:  lit. \\"[area] under the small hill\\") is the capital and largest city of Montenegro.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last names of the two individuals who were convinced to purchase Spring Ice? ?  In March 1916, Thomson exhibited four canvases with the OSA: In the Northland (at that time titled The Birches), Spring Ice, Moonlight and October (then titled The Hardwoods), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase Spring Ice instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\" A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His Moonlight, Spring Ice and The Birches are among his best. In The Canadian Courier, painter Estelle Kerr also spoke positively, describing Thomson as \\"one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects\\".In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the many snow studies he produced at this time.

Answer:","output":"- The last step of the process would likely involve exhaling the carbon dioxide. Here's why: After the transfer of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the air sacs in the lungs, the body needs a way to dispose of it. Exhalation usually accomplishes this. In more detail, the process is as follows: - The carbon dioxide, now in the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, is pushed out of the body when we exhale. - The diaphragm (the muscle under your lungs that assists in breathing) and the intercostal muscles (muscles that are in between your ribs that also play a part in breathing) contract and expand, pushing air out of the lungs and making space for fresh, oxygenated air. This gets rid of the carbon dioxide gathered within the lungs. - The process begins again when we breathe in oxygen. To summarize, the cycle of respiration includes inhaling (intaking oxygen), exchanging gases (oxygen in the bloodstream, carbon dioxide out), and exhaling (releasing carbon dioxide). So, to complete the process described, the likely last step is exhaling the carbon dioxide out of the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.

The Japanese Army was a large and influential component of Japan's military forces during World War II, and they played a significant role in shaping the country's military strategies. In this case, the sentence suggests that the Japanese Army disagreed with the idea of invading Australia directly. Instead, they favored an alternative plan that involved isolating Australia from one of its key allies, the United States, by establishing a blockade and advancing through the South Pacific. This strategy was aimed at weakening Australia's position and potentially making it more susceptible to a future invasion or surrender. The fact that the sentence mentions that the invasion plan was \\"rejected\\" indicates that the Japanese Army's opposition carried substantial weight in shaping Japan's overall strategic approach in the region. As such, the sentence provides a clear and valid answer to the question, identifying the Japanese Army as the group that opposed an invasion of Australia. In summary, the provided sentence offers a valid answer to the question about which Japanese group opposed an invasion of Australia, clearly pointing to the Japanese Army as the group responsible for the opposition. Their preference for an alternative strategy, involving the isolation of Australia through a blockade and advances in the South Pacific, highlights the complexity of military decision-making and the different strategic preferences held by various components of a nation's armed forces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: One way or another, this Kobe Bryant ranking will probably upset you Updated Oct 8, 2015 at 8:12a ET Ranking all of the NBA's players is an annual rite of fall. As another season of professional basketball starts, it's always fun to take stock of just who the best players in the league are. And no player raises more ire every year with his ranking than Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant. With so many diehard fans of Bryant and the Lakers on one side and so many people who view Bryant as overrated on the other, there's little middle ground to be found. So you're going to have a visceral reaction when you read the following: According to ESPN.com's NBA Rank exercise, Bryant comes in at No. 93 in the league: The three players behind Bryant at 94-96 are Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson and Nene Hilario. Ahead of him: Brandon Knight and Luol Deng. The rest of the rankings have yet to be released.

Hypothesis: We didn't believe in religion. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis The premise states that \\"We stayed in the word of God\\", which implies that one is engaged with religious teachings or scriptures of some sort. The hypothesis is \\"We didn't believe in religion\\", suggesting a lack of belief in religious ideas or principles. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to check whether the hypothesis must be true given that the premise is true. Step 3: Check for entailment If \\"We stayed in the word of God,\\" it means that we were involved with religious teachings or scriptures, which implies at least some level of belief or engagement with religion. This step seems to contradict the hypothesis that \\"We didn't believe in religion\\", which suggests disbelief in religious ideas or principles. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise suggests involvement with religious teachings or scriptures, while the hypothesis suggests a lack of belief in religious principles.

Q:Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road. Mail truck. Must be time for breakfast. About time I ate something. Question: Why was Justin's face like leather? Options:  A. he was sick  B.

Afterwards, Carlos the Jackal (Aidan Quinn) kills a spider in its web with his cigarette and evicts the woman (Lucie Laurier) from his room because he claims he has work to do. He is seen donning a disguise, and he walks to a cafe where CIA officer Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) is sitting at a table outdoors. He recognizes Shaw and asks for a light. Shaw does not recognize Carlos, because of his disguise, but he turns to watch Carlos enter the cafe. He watches as Carlos detonates a grenade, killing dozens of people. The film shows an event of attacking the OPEC meeting by the Jackal and his followers in 1975. In 1986 a man, looking like Carlos, is apprehended in an open air market and brutally interrogated by a Mossad commander named Amos (Ben Kingsley). The man claims to actually be a US Naval officer named Annibal Ramirez whose identification was lost in the chaos of his arrest. Amos confirms his identity and lets him go, stunned that Ramirez looks exactly like Carlos. Back at home, Ramirez is visited by Shaw who tries to recruit him to impersonate the terrorist leader. Ramirez, however, is deeply embittered by his rough treatment at Amos' hands, and threatens to sue. Shaw persists, confronting Ramirez with the human cost of Carlos' terrorism. He finally convinces Ramirez by showing him a photograph of child who is a victim of one of Carlos' bombings. Amos and Shaw train Ramirez at a former prison in Canada.

How do you buy a used Mercedes when the owner has a loan through MBFS?","output":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They address different aspects of purchasing a Mercedes car, and each question requires a separate, detailed answer. 1. What is the best Mercedes AMG to buy? This question seeks to find the best Mercedes AMG model available in the market, considering factors such as performance, comfort, features, and price. Mercedes AMG is the high-performance division of Mercedes-Benz and offers a variety of models across different segments.

How do you buy a used Mercedes when the owner has a loan through MBFS? This question pertains to the process of purchasing a used Mercedes when the seller still has a loan or lien on the car through Mercedes-Benz Financial Services (MBFS). Here are the steps involved in buying a used Mercedes with an existing loan: 1. Obtain a vehicle history report: Before proceeding, it is crucial to verify the car's history through a service like Carfax or AutoCheck. This will provide information on any past accidents, ownership history, and outstanding liens. 2. Confirm the loan details: Ask the seller for the loan account number and contact MBFS to verify the remaining balance and loan terms. This is essential to ensure you know the exact amount still owing on the car. 3. Secure financing if necessary: If you need financing to purchase the car, shop around for the best interest rates and loan terms. Inform the lender that the vehicle has an existing lien through MBFS, as this may affect the approval process. 4. Coordinate with the seller and MBFS: Set up the payment process to ensure the outstanding loan balance gets paid off directly to MBFS. This can typically be done through a cashier's check, wire transfer, or direct payment from your lender to MBFS. 5. Get a release of lien: Once the loan balance is paid off, the seller should receive a \\"release of lien\\" document from MBFS. This paperwork certifies that the lien has been removed, allowing the title to be transferred to your name. 6. Complete the title transfer: With the release of lien in hand, the seller should be able to provide you with the car's title. You and the seller must complete the necessary paperwork to transfer the title and register the vehicle in your name. 7. Pay the applicable taxes and fees: Be prepared to pay any taxes and fees associated with the purchase, including sales tax, registration fees, and title transfer fees. In summary, while these two questions involve purchasing a Mercedes vehicle, they address entirely different topics. The first question seeks to identify the best Mercedes AMG model to buy based on an individual's preferences and needs, while the second focuses on the process of purchasing a used Mercedes when the seller has an outstanding loan through MBFS."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

She was always stressed from her studies, pressure and job, so she would go out, most oftenly with me, to places and times we shouldn’t have been. She would just decide, in the middle of the night, even as early as 2 in the morning that we should just race the city, see places… She always had those cravings to do stuff at strange times, getting to sport events with me at the other bit of the country… This crazy kind of life got us in a big lot of troubles. People trying rape her, attack us and much many more. it was happening too often and I often had to be quite violent to these people so she stays in one piece. I had to fix a lot of crap in order for her to live fully her fantasy. But I was more worried for her than me and I wanted us settle down, calm and have children we could raise peacefully. There was that one night where, we both came back very late from a sport competition, we had to travel dangerous roads very late at night sometimes by bus, foot and other times subway. At one point that night, two drug addicts tried to rape her, so I did what I had to do, but still I didn’t kill them. Then I shoved her and I really mean shove, inside a taxi, got in there too and asked it back home. When I arrived, she was denying the danger, denying anything wrong with her way to behave.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Salts Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next. A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.

In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.  and the situation: Two friends studied permaculture together. Bill studied about mycorrhiza, while Red studied about hugel kultur.  Answer the following question: Which friend learned more about symbiotic associations? The answer is:","output":"Bill learned more about symbiotic associations. This is because he studied mycorrhiza, which is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In this partnership, the fungus gets access to glucose produced by the plant, while the plant benefits from the increased surface area of its root system provided by the fungal mycelia, leading to better absorption of water and nutrients from the soil.

Ask a question about Muammar Gaddafi.","output":"What was Muammar Gaddafi's role in the international community, and how did it change over his four-decade rule in Libya? Muammar Gaddafi, born in 1942 in Sirte, Libya, was an influential and controversial figure in international politics. He ruled Libya from 1969, when he came to power in a military coup, until his death in 2011 during the Libyan Civil War. Throughout his reign, his relationship with the international community evolved drastically, as his actions and policies often shifted between isolation, diplomatic engagement, and sponsorship of global terrorism. In the early years of his rule, Gaddafi established himself as an adamant anti-imperialist, rejecting foreign influences and promoting his vision of Arab nationalism by merging Arab socialism with Islamic philosophy. This doctrine, known as the Third International Theory, was meant to be an alternative to capitalist and communist systems. Gaddafi laid out his philosophy in his famous Green Book, which became the guiding framework for his rule and ideology. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Gaddafi's role in the international community was primarily marked by his support for various militant and revolutionary groups around the world. Libya provided financial backing, weapons, and training to the Irish Republican Army, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and other radical organizations. At this time, Gaddafi was labeled as a sponsor of terrorism by the United States and Western European countries. Moreover, his government was accused of being behind several high-profile terrorist attacks, including the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The tensions between Libya and the West further escalated when, in 1986, the United States claimed that Libya was involved in a Berlin nightclub bombing that killed an American soldier. In retaliation, US military forces conducted airstrikes in Libya, purportedly killing Gaddafi's adopted daughter and further aggravating the already strained relations between the countries. The 1990s saw a shift in Libyan policy under Gaddafi. The collapse of his key ally, the Soviet Union, as well as the economic challenges faced by the country, led to him pursuing improved relations with the international community. Gaddafi turned inwards and began focusing on domestic development, including an ambitious infrastructure project known as the Great Man-Made River. In 1999, Libya handed over the suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, and UN sanctions that had been imposed on the nation were gradually lifted. In the 2000s, Gaddafi continued his efforts to normalize Libya's relations with the West. He abandoned the country's weapons of mass destruction program in 2003, which led to the lifting of most remaining international sanctions. Gaddafi's reintegration into the international community went as far as hosting world leaders, including then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair and then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Libya even held a seat on the UN Security Council. However, Gaddafi's efforts to maintain power in Libya during the Arab Spring in 2011 led to his downfall. Popular uprisings and civil war in the country prompted a NATO-led intervention, which ultimately resulted in Gaddafi's capture and death. The end of his rule marked a catastrophic collapse of the Libyan state that continues to face conflict and chaos today. In conclusion, Muammar Gaddafi's role in the international community experienced multiple transitions over his four-decade rule. He moved from being an ardent anti-imperialist to a state sponsor of terrorism, then from an international pariah to a cooperating partner, before ultimately collapsing as the Arab Spring and international intervention brought an end to his regime. His controversial and tumultuous reign has undoubtedly left a lasting impact on the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East and North Africa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (often referred to as the Milwaukee Road) , was a Class I railroad that operated in the Midwest and Northwest of the United States from 1847 until 1980, when its Pacific Extension (Montana, Idaho, and Washington) was abandoned following a bankruptcy. The eastern half of the system merged into the Soo Line Railroad on January 1, 1986. The company went through several official names and faced bankruptcy several times in that period. The railroad no longer exists as a separate entity, but much of its trackage continues to be used by its successor and other roads, and is commemorated in buildings like the historic Milwaukee Road Depot in Minneapolis, Minnesota and in railroad hardware still maintained by railfans, such as the Milwaukee Road 261 steam locomotive.  - Wisconsin Central Ltd. is a railroad subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway. At one time, its parent Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation owned or operated railroads in the United States, Canada (Algoma Central Railway), the United Kingdom (English Welsh & Scottish), New Zealand (Tranz Rail), and Australia (Australian Transport Network).  - The Soo Line Railroad is the primary United States railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), controlled through the Soo Line Corporation, and one of seven U.S. Class I railroads. Although it is named for the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (MStP&SSM), which was commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of that company with two other CP subsidiaries, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railroad and Wisconsin Central Railroad. It is also the successor to other Class I railroads, including the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway (acquired 1982) and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road, acquired at bankruptcy in 1985). On the other hand, a large amount of mileage was spun off in 1987 to Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of the Canadian National Railway. The Soo Line and the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the CP's other major subsidiary (before the 2008 DM&E acquisition), presently do business as the Canadian Pacific Railway, and most equipment has been repainted into the CP's scheme, but the U.S. Surface Transportation Board groups all CP's U.S. subsidiaries under the Soo Line name for reporting purposes.  - Thep Delaware and Hudson Railway is a railroad that operates in the northeastern United States that has been since 1991 owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway under the rail subsidiary Soo Line Corporation also controls the Soo Line Railroad, Canadian Pacific Railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.  - Cisco is a place name for the remnants of a former unincorporated community located along the Soo Line Railroad and US 59 in the NW 1/4 of Section 11 of Badger Township , 149 North , Range 42 West , in Polk County , United States , approximately four miles north of the city of Erskine , and about the same distance south of the city of Brooks . Cisco was still in use as a place name by local people as late as 1990 , but now is but a dim memory among some of the old - timers .  - The Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad was a Class I railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the Midwest United States. Commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was merged with several other major CP subsidiaries on January 1, 1961 to form the Soo Line Railroad. As time passes, more and more Soo Line equipment is being repainted into the Canadian Pacific's current paint scheme, slowly erasing the Soo's identity as a subsidiary railroad.  - The Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States is a bipartisan, decisionally-independent adjudicatory body organizationally housed within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The STB was established in 1996 to assume some of the regulatory functions that had been administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission when the ICC was abolished. Other ICC regulatory functions were either eliminated or transferred to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics within DOT.  - The Canadian National Railway Company is a Canadian Class I railway headquartered in Montreal, Quebec that serves Canada and the Midwestern and Southern United States.

Samuel, who was a few years older, had already published several successful stories and was known for his ability to connect with readers on a deep, emotional level. The story Jason was crafting focused on a young woman named Emma, who struggled with her self-identity and the expectations society placed on her. Emma felt trapped in a life she didn't choose, and the story followed her journey to self-discovery and liberation. Jason wrote a detailed outline and the first few chapters, but he felt like something wasn't clicking. His characters felt two-dimensional, and he worried that the story wouldn't resonate with readers. He hoped that Samuel would be able to help him identify the problem and find a solution. When Jason met up with Samuel at their usual cafe, he felt butterflies in his stomach. He knew it could be intimidating to share one's work, but he hoped the benefits of Samuel's insight would be worth it. After small talk and a sip of coffee, Jason hesitantly handed over his manuscript. As Samuel read through the pages, Jason observed the subtle changes in his expressions. Was he intrigued? Engrossed? Disappointed? It was difficult to tell. Finally, Samuel looked up and with a thoughtful expression, said, \\"You've got something great going on here, Jason, but it needs some work. Don't worry, though. We'll figure it out.\\" Over the next few weeks, Jason and Samuel met several times to discuss the short story in detail. Samuel provided advice on character development, pacing, narrative structure, and more. With each piece of advice, Jason grew more confident in his story and his ability to write it. One particularly significant suggestion Samuel made was to delve deeper into Emma's past. By exploring her upbringing, family life, and significant events that occurred during her childhood, they would be able to provide a fuller and richer understanding of her character. This, in turn, would help the readers connect with her on a more profound level. Additionally, Samuel encouraged Jason to incorporate more sensory details and explore the inner thoughts of his characters. By doing this, he would create a more immersive experience for the readers, allowing them to feel as if they were walking alongside Emma on her journey. As weeks turned into months, Jason continued to revise and improve his story. He began sharing the updated drafts with a few trusted friends and writing peers, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Emma's journey resonated with them, and they felt Jason's storytelling skill had grown immensely. Finally, it was time to submit the story to literary publications. With each acceptance or rejection, Jason felt a mixture of pride and anxiety. It took a few tries, but eventually, the story found a home in a highly-regarded literary magazine. Jason knew he had Samuel to thank for his advice and guidance. While Samuel always shrugged off the praise, insisting it was all Jason's talent, they both knew their collaboration had taken Jason's writing to new heights. The success of the short story only solidified their bond, as they continued to help each other navigate the winding path of the literary world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Steven Gerrard was confirmed as an LA Galaxy player on Wednesday, but supporters of the MLS club will have to wait until July to see him with the shirt. LA Galaxy announced the signing of the former England international before Gerrard gave an interview to Galaxy TV where he insisted he wasn't joining the California-based club for a holiday. ‘Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,’ said Gerrard. ‘I’m not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. 'I’m going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable. Sportsmail’s mock-up of how Steven Gerrard could look in the colours of LA Galaxy. Gerrard discusses his future move in a video interview with LA Galaxy. The Liverpool captain insists he has not moved to the MLS for a 'holiday' but to continue winning medals. MLS Cup Winners (5): 2002, 2005, 2011, 2012, 2014. MLS Supporters' Shield Winners (4): 1998, 2002, 2010, 2011. MLS Western Conference Winners (Playoffs) (9): 1996, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014. Winners (Regular Season) (8): 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2011. What Gerrard could look like for LA Galaxy in MLS in our mocked-up picture. ‘I still feel like a player. I still feel like I can perform for a number of years, so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality — a team that is used to winning but also a team that’s got people that want to win in the future. ‘Having spoken to the manager Bruce Arena and also the people above him, they’re very aggressive and they want success. ‘That’s what I want. That’s how I want to finish my career, so they are the reasons I chose LA Galaxy. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. They basically told me what I wanted to hear. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.’ Gerrard remain a Liverpool player for the next six months and the midfielder stopped short of posing for photos holding Galaxy's shirt, presumably out of respect for the Reds supporters. Galaxy fans will have to wait until Gerrard makes the move to Los Angeles in the summer to see their new hero donning the white strip, where he will undoubtedly be officially presented to supporters amid much fanfare. The Reds icon admitted that he was a 'Scouser through and through' and would have to adapt to new lifestyle. Gerrard has guaranteed LA Galaxy supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment. Gerrard assured Liverpool fans that his departure will not spell the end of his relationship with the club. My next team is going to be La Galaxy. I'm really excited for a new challenge in my life - that's the team I will join at the end of the season. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. The talks Ive had with them are very positive, they basically told me what I wanted to hear. They told me about the winning mentality of the club, their aims and what their goals are for the future and it basically suits me at this stage of my career so I will be hopefully going over there to win some medals and finish my career over there. There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are locateed as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different. It's really exciting both on and off the pitch but the most important thing is that I go there and it's a success on the pitch and then hopefully I can enjoy it off the pitch as well. The big challenge is going to be settling in, I've lived in Liverpool all my life. I'm a Scouser through and through. I love my City. I love my roots. But, you only get one life, it's important to try different things and experiences and it's also a big thing for my children too - to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well. It's perfect timing for this new challenge. I'm really excited and looking forward to it, but I've still got a few things that I've got to try and achieve before I go so my focus is on that. There will be plenty of time to get excited at the end of the season about the new move. It's the right time for a new challenge, a fresh challenge at this point of my life and an exciting one too. I'm going to be moving to the most successful team in the US. I've watched a lot of their games and I also know a few of the players that have been there and sampled it and I've heard great things about it so for this stage of my career I believe the timing is right to move on. I still feel like a player, I still feel like I can perform for a number of years so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality - a team that is used to winning but also a team that's got people within there that want to win in the future. I know the players have got a winning mentality, they've proved it over a number of years. Having spoken to the manager, Bruce Arena, and also the people above him - they're very aggressive and they want success and that's what I want. That's how I want to finish my career so they are the reasons that I chose LA Galaxy. I'd like to think I've got the same attitude as the people that have tried to make this signing happen - the manager, the CEO and the owner - they all seem to me to be like winners and that is how I see myself. I'm very professional and go about my work to a good standard on a daily basis. I like to try and find consistency. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team. What I can guarantee is that I will go there and work hard and I will make sacrifices and be dedicated to perform at a consistent level and hopefully play my part in success for this team. Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years. I'm not going over here for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I am going over here to win and if I win and play well then my life becomes more enjoyable. My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. It's been a privilege to play for them and represent them for all these years and I will continue to do that until the end of the season and I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season. And hopefully come back - that's the message, my relationship with Liverpool doesn't end in the summer. In fact it will never end. For the new team I am going to, I will come over there with the same attitude which 110 per cent every day - be professional, makes sacrifices and try and contribute.

Please answer the following question: Background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.  Paragraph: Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next.

Information:  - Hun Sen (born 5 August 1952) is the Prime Minister of Cambodia, President of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), and Member of Parliament (MP) for Kandal. He has served as Prime Minister since 1985, making him the longest serving head of government of Cambodia, and one of the longest serving leaders in the world. From 1979 to 1986 and again from 1987 to 1990, Hun Sen served as Cambodia's foreign minister. His full honorary title is Samdech Akeak Moha Sena Padey Techo Hun Sen (meaning \\"Lord Prime Minister, Supreme Military Commander Hun Sen\\"). Born Hun Bunal, he changed his name to Hun Sen in 1972 two years after joining the Khmer Rouge.  - FUNCINPEC is a royalist political party in Cambodia. Founded in 1981 by Norodom Sihanouk, it started off as a resistance movement against the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government. In 1982, it formed a resistance pact, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), together with the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) and the Khmer Rouge. It was one of the signatory parties of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, which paved the way for the formation of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). In 1992, FUNCINPEC became a political party and participated in the 1993 general elections organised by UNTAC. It won the elections, and formed a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), with which it jointly headed. Norodom Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son who had succeeded him as the party president, became First Prime Minister while Hun Sen, who was from the CPP, became Second Prime Minister.  - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004.  - The incumbent is the current holder of a political office. This term is usually used in reference to elections, in which races can often be defined as being between an incumbent and non-incumbent(s). For example, in the 2012 United States presidential election, Barack Obama was the incumbent, because he had been the president in the previous term while the election sought to determine the president for the current term. A race without an incumbent is referred to as an open seat.  - Norodom Ranariddh (born 2 January 1944) is a Cambodian prince, politician and law academic. He is the second son of Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia and a half-brother of the current king, Norodom Sihamoni. Ranariddh is the president of FUNCINPEC, a Cambodian royalist party. He was also the First Prime Minister of Cambodia, serving between 1993 and 1997, and subsequently as the President of the National Assembly between 1998 and 2006.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - General elections were held in Cambodia on 27 July 2003 to elect members of the National Assembly . The election was won by the incumbent Prime Minister Hun Sen 's Cambodian People 's Party , who claimed a majority of 73 seats in the 123 - seat parliament . However , due to the requirement for a two - thirds majority to elect a Prime Minister , a new government was not formed until July 2004 when a deal was reached with the Funcinpec party .  - A prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system. In many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems of government, a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state. In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system, the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch. In such systems, the head of state or the head of state's official representative (i.e. the monarch, president, or governor-general) usually holds a largely ceremonial position, although often with reserve powers.  - The Prime Minister of Cambodia is the head of government of Cambodia. The prime minister is also the chairman of the Cabinet and leads the executive branch of the Royal Cambodian Government. The prime minister is required to be a member of parliament, and is appointed by the monarch for a term of five years. Since 1945, there have been 36 prime ministers.  - Norodom Sihanouk (31 October 192215 October 2012) was the King of Cambodia from 1941 to 1955 and again from 1993 to 2004. Affectionately known to the Cambodian people as Samdech Euv (father prince), Sihanouk became king in 1941. After the Second World War, he campaigned for Cambodia's independence from French rule, which took place in 1953. In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated the throne in favour of his father Norodom Suramarit, and went on to form the political organisation Sangkum. Sihanouk led the Sangkum to victory in the 1955 general elections, and became the Prime Minister of Cambodia. After his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk introduced a constitutional amendment which made him the Head of State of Cambodia, a position which he held until 1970. Between 1955 and 1970, Sihanouk governed Cambodia under one-party rule, and cracked down on political dissent from the Democrat party and Pracheachon. While he was officially neutral in foreign relations, in practice he was friendlier toward communist countries, particularly China, than to the United States and its anti-Communist allies.

The UN Command retreated; the U.S. Eighth Army's retreat (the longest in US Army history) was made possible because of the Turkish Brigade's successful, but very costly, rear-guard delaying action near Kunuri that slowed the PVA attack for two days (27–29 November). On 27 November at the Korean eastern front, a U.S. 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team (3,000 soldiers) and the U.S. 1st Marine Division (12,000–15,000 marines) were unprepared for the PVA 9th Army Group's three-pronged encirclement tactics at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, but they managed to escape under Air Force and X Corps support fire—albeit with some 15,000 collective casualties. Answer:","output":"The U.S. 1st Marine Division had the most soldiers in the eastern front battle, with 12,000-15,000 marines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is a question about this article? If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Evolution had less obvious applications to anatomy and morphology, and at first had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies. What did Huxley's 1860 article in the Westminster Review promote?","output":"What did Huxley's 1860 article in the Westminster Review promote?

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Translation: Support for exception handling when working with Interbase and Firebird through ADODB. In the context of working with Interbase and Firebird databases through ActiveX Data Objects DataBase (ADODB) in software development, it is crucial to ensure a robust exception handling mechanism. This will allow the application to manage errors effectively and provide a smooth user experience. Interbase and Firebird are relational databases that provide advanced features such as support for transactions, stored procedures, and triggers, which helps developers create reliable and scalable applications. ADODB is an interface that allows a client to manipulate and retrieve data from databases like Interbase and Firebird. Exception handling plays a crucial role in facilitating fault-tolerant applications, as it ensures that errors are caught and dealt with appropriately, rather than leading to program crashes or incorrect output. To implement exception handling when working with Interbase and Firebird through ADODB, the following key aspects should be considered: 1. Wrapping code blocks in Try-Catch-Finally statements: Protect critical sections of your code that interact with ADODB using try-catch-finally statements. This will allow the application to catch database-related errors and handle them gracefully without crashing. 2. Inspecting and logging errors: When an exception is caught in a catch block, it's essential to inspect the error object and log relevant information. This information can be used for debugging and support purposes. 3. Managing transactions: Since Interbase and Firebird support transactions, it is necessary to handle exceptions within transactions appropriately. If an error occurs, the transaction should be rolled back to the previous state, and an error message should be displayed to the user. 4. Implementing custom error handling: Once exceptions have been caught and logged, you could choose to display a user-friendly error message or perform an action (such as retrying the operation). This helps maintain a positive user experience throughout the interaction with the application. 5. Monitoring resource usage: Ensure that all database resources like connections and command objects are properly closed and disposed of after use to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion. When using ADODB to interact with Interbase or Firebird databases, follow the mentioned best practices to make your application robust and responsive in the face of possible errors and provide a better experience to your users."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The East Asia/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by China, the region’s most populous country. China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002. China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence. This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts. However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases. Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs. Singapore has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides Iceland, in the world, at 3%. Cambodia has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000. Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume iodized salt. Answer this question based on the article: What percentage is the highest in China: Cambodian breastfed babies or households consume iodized salt","output":"Based on the article, the highest percentage in China is for households that consume iodized salt, with 14 percent of households consuming it.

In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, adopted the Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality regulation still in use in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man that resupplied the depot that was reached on February 23rd by the group that aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days?  The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut...

Washington (CNN) -- The Pacific island nation of Palau has agreed to take in 17 Chinese Muslims held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the country's ambassador to the United States said Wednesday. The map shows the Pacific island nation of Palau in relation to China. Details of the transfer are still being worked out, Ambassador Hersey Kyota told CNN. But Kyota said his country, a former U.S. Pacific trust territory, has agreed to take in the ethnic Uighur detainees \\"for humanitarian reasons\\" and because of the \\"special relationship\\" between Palau and the United States. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly would not comment on the announcement, telling reporters, \\"We're still involved in ongoing discussions.\\" The agreement includes some U.S. aid for Palau, Kyota said, but he said those details remained to be worked out as well. The country, with a population of about 20,000, is about 1,000 miles southeast of Manila, Philippines, and about 4,600 miles west of Hawaii. Palau has received nearly 900 million in U.S. aid since independence in 1994, according to congressional auditors, and depends on Washington for defense. The \\"Compact of Free Association\\" between Palau and the United States is up for review, but Kelly said any additional aid offer \\"is not linked to any other discussions we may be having with the government of Palau.\\" The Uighurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan.

Question: I can use this background: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  Now, I have a new situation: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Answer this question please: In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four? Answer:","output":"In this situation, based on the background information provided, Group A would have more openings in their nest thatch on battle day four. The reason being that Acromyrmex heyeri ants are known to create more openings in their nest thatch when the internal nest temperature goes up (between 20-30°C) and close the openings when the air humidity decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.  On battle day three, Group A's territory had low air humidity, which would prompt the ants to close the openings in their nest thatch to conserve water. On battle day four, however, Group A's territory had high air humidity which means there would be no need to close the openings to preserve water. Furthermore, considering the high air humidity, battle day two had a 22°C temperature, which falls within the range that could lead ants to create more openings for temperature regulation. Consequently, battle day four would have more openings in the nest thatch than battle day three."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are willing to put their body and minds through all sorts of punishment to do this . 2. Athletes dedicate their lives to their sport and becoming the worlds best at what they do . 3. If theyre told that starvation makes them more likely to win gold then their intense desire for Olympic glory often clouds their judgment and ability to make rational choices for themselves . 4.

What factor has the power to transform individual lives, communities, nations and the world? The answer to this complex question is a simple one: education. While it is widely accepted that there is no one solution to lift the millions across our globe out of poverty, it is also equally accepted that a key cornerstone of addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges is through providing a quality education to all children, especially girls. Despite increasing numbers attending school in recent years, 126 million children remain out of primary school and lower secondary school around the world. Some 65 million of these children are girls. The highest rate of girls not in school is across the African continent, where in sub-Saharan Africa nearly four out of five poor rural girls are not completing primary school. There are an estimated 250 million children worldwide of primary school age who can't read, write or do basic math -- more than half of whom have completed four years of schooling. It is unacceptable that in 2014 -- less than a year away from the deadline the international community agreed to get all children into school -- that 30 million girls in Africa are denied their basic human right to a quality education. Ensuring that every child goes to school, stays in school and learns something of value while there will require firm commitments and action by governments to invest in education and prioritize the education of its girls. Africa's economy has grown at more than 5% annually over the past decade -- some of the highest economic growth in the world -- leading many to use the phrase of \\"Africa Rising\\" when describing its countries. However, a country's economic growth does not always lead to development or improvement for its poorest citizens. To truly rise as a nation by building an equitable, sustainable and peaceful society, governments must ensure that spending on education is prioritized and used well. According to recent research, the estimated economic gain from achieving universal primary education exceeds the estimated increase in public spending required to achieve it. One extra year of schooling can increase an individual's earnings by 10%. Girls who complete a primary education are likely to increase their earnings by 5 to 15% over their lifetimes. Each additional year of schooling could raise average annual gross domestic product growth by 0.37%. If all women had a primary education, child marriages and child mortality could fall by a sixth, and maternal deaths by two-thirds. Investing in girls' education could boost sub-Saharan Africa's agricultural output by up to 25%. Some countries lose more than 1 billion a year by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys. Without education, how can a country's future citizens take part in growing their economy and reap benefits? Without education how can a country grow? More from African Voices. It is however, not good enough to only increase the number of children receiving education. Children and young people must learn basic knowledge, skills and competencies, such as reading, writing, critical thinking, problem solving and math, that are needed to live healthy, safe and productive lives. In Liberia, across the African continent and, indeed, around the world, it is becoming increasingly apparent that going to school is not the same as learning. This is of grave concern given that many of the social and economic returns from an education are found to come from learning outcomes rather than number of years in school. To accomplish this, more financial resources that are better spent are needed to build a strong education system capable of improving both access and learning for all. But making informed decisions about those resources requires good data. Information on teachers, how to best support them to do their jobs, and information on how students are learning are crucial for knowing what policies and programs will be effective. By using our resources more effectively and focusing them on those children that are currently left behind, we can have some of the best educated citizens in the world -- citizens who will be responsible for building a peaceful and prosperous future. At current rates, the poorest girls in sub-Saharan Africa will only achieve universal primary completion in 2086. To not invest in and prioritize girls' education, we as African leaders are telling our women that we do not care about you and your child's future. As one of those women, I will not accept this and I urge all our leaders to invest in our children's future. Investing in girls' education is not only a moral imperative, it is a smart investment. On the 16th of June, the Day of the African Child, young people from across Africa will stand at the African Union Headquarters in Addis Abba, Ethiopia, and across Africa, to call on their governments to dedicate more resources -- the recommended 20% of national budgets -- to education and develop strong and transparent monitoring systems to track effectiveness and impact. Better information on learning outcomes and public spending is key to achieving our goals. These young people want a brighter reality and they demand that their governments stand up to meet their responsibilities and commitments, in order to build a future for their children, a future for their country. When nearly 60 developing countries come together in Brussels at the end of June, as part of the Global Partnership for Education, they will be asked to commit to increase education spending. If they do, we will know if they have listened to these young people, and then the phrase, \\"Africa Rising,\\" can be used in all truthfulness. Plan International's Because I Am A Girl campaign announces its #10DaysToAct initiative, beginning on June 16 at the African Union meeting in Addis Ababa. Read this: Africa is rising, but for whom?

Given the question \\"What does Casey need to do before this?\\", is \\"register themselves at the new school\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"register themselves at the new school\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What does Casey need to do before this?\\" Before attending a new school and meeting new friends, there are several steps and procedures that Casey must go through. Registering at the new school is an essential part of this process, as it establishes their official status as a student and allows them to fully participate in school activities, classes, and social life. Registering at the new school can involve a variety of tasks, some of which may include the following: 1. Gathering documentation: To register at a new school, Casey will likely need to provide certain documents, such as their birth certificate, proof of residence, and previous school records or transcripts. This information is necessary to demonstrate their eligibility to attend the school and to ensure that they are placed in the appropriate grade level and classes. 2. Filling out registration forms: These forms will typically require Casey to provide personal information, such as their name, date of birth, address, contact information, and any relevant medical or special needs information. Additionally, parents or guardians may need to sign consent forms or waivers related to activities, school policies, and other aspects of school life. 3. Meeting with school staff: In some cases, an interview or meeting with school staff, such as a guidance counselor or admissions officer, may be required as part of the registration process. This meeting can help identify any additional academic or support services that Casey may need or be eligible for, and provide an opportunity for Casey and their family to ask questions or address concerns about the new school. 4. Paying any applicable fees: Some schools may require payment of registration or enrollment fees, tuition, or other costs associated with attending the school. These fees may need to be paid upfront or be arranged through a payment plan or financial assistance program. 5. Becoming familiar with school policies and procedures: As part of the registration process, Casey should be provided with information regarding the school's policies, procedures, and expectations for student behavior. This may include information on rules and guidelines for dress code, attendance, academic integrity, and other aspects of school life. 6. Selecting classes and creating a schedule: Depending on the grade level and structure of the new school, Casey may need to choose specific classes or electives in order to create their class schedule. This may involve working with a guidance counselor or academic advisor to ensure that all required courses are taken and that any prerequisites or special needs are met. 7. Participating in orientation or school events: Prior to the first day of classes, many schools offer orientation events or activities to help incoming students become acclimated to the school environment, meet their teachers, and familiarize themselves with the school layout and resources. By completing these steps and ensuring that they are registered at their new school, Casey will be able to fully participate in school activities, attend classes, and ultimately meet new friends and establish a sense of belonging within their new school community."},{"instruction":"Q:You are considering whether to buy a product.

Ludwig Ruckdeschel (15 March 1907 – 8 November 1986) was the Nazi \\"Gauleiter\\" of Bayreuth during final month of the \\"Gau's\\" existence before the collapse of Nazi Germany in 1945. Before this, from 1933 to 1941, he served as the deputy of Gauleiter Fritz Wächtler, whom he had executed on orders by Martin Bormann. From 1933 to 1945 he was also a member of the German Parliament, the Reichstag. Can we draw the following conclusion? Nazi Germany broke down in 1945. Available options: [I] Yes.

The statement mentions that Ludwig Ruckdeschel was the Nazi \\"Gauleiter\\" of Bayreuth during the final month of the \\"Gau's\\" existence before the collapse of Nazi Germany in 1945. This suggests that the year 1945 was significant as it marked the end of Nazi Germany's regime. In a broader historical context, Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, indeed fell in 1945. The country was embroiled in World War II from September 1, 1939, until the surrender of German forces on May 7, 1945. World War II itself lasted until September 2, 1945, with the official surrender of Japan. Throughout the war, Nazi Germany had caused the deaths and suffering of millions of people, including the Holocaust - in which six million Jews were systematically murdered. In addition, other groups, such as Poles, Romani people, and Soviet POWs, were executed, enslaved, or otherwise persecuted under the Nazi regime. During the war's final stages, Allied forces closed in on Germany from both the East and the West. Soviet forces reached Berlin in late April 1945, and Hitler committed suicide in his underground bunker on April 30, 1945. Following his death, Admiral Karl Dönitz became President of the Reich and head of state, effectively serving as Hitler's successor. Dönitz authorized the surrender, and on May 7, 1945, Germany's unconditional surrender was signed. The official surrender took effect on May 8, 1945, now known as Victory in Europe (VE) Day, marking the end of World War II in Europe and the end of Nazi Germany as a regime.

Given the available choices you've provided, it appears that the state trooper has been hired to maintain order and security. Let's analyze each choice and explore how the state trooper might be involved to fulfill their role. 1) To conduct the demonstration: In this scenario, the state trooper may act as a supervisor or facilitator during the demonstration, ensuring that the event proceeds safely and according to established protocols. They might provide instructions to participants, monitor their actions, and intervene if necessary to prevent any undesirable situations or disputes from escalating. 2) To program the monitors: If the state trooper is involved in programming the monitors, they could be responsible for setting up surveillance equipment or other monitoring devices to maintain the security of the location. Their presence ensures that monitoring systems are functioning effectively and that individuals or groups attempting to cause disruption are promptly dealt with. 3) To keep problems from starting: The primary role of a state trooper in this context is to maintain peace and order at the site or during the event. By being present and visible, they act as a deterrent to potential troublemakers, helping to prevent conflicts or other issues from arising in the first place. Law enforcement officers like state troopers are trained to de-escalate and mediate disputes, ensuring that the situation remains under control and doesn't harm others. 4) To find the girls: If the state trooper is tasked with locating specific individuals, such as the girls you've mentioned, they would use their law enforcement training and resources to carry out an investigation and track them down. This might involve questioning witnesses, reviewing surveillance footage, or collaborating with other law enforcement agencies. In conclusion, the primary reason for a state trooper's presence in this scenario is likely to maintain order and security, ensuring that the ongoing event or situation proceeds without any unwanted disturbances.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The nucleus of MOST atoms consists of Select from: (A). neutrons only (B). protons and neutrons (C). protons and electrons (D). neutrons and electrons","output":"The correct answer is (B). The nucleus of most atoms consists of protons and neutrons. The structure of an atom can be divided into two primary components: the nucleus, located at its center, and the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus. The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, whereas the electrons occupy the spatial region surrounding it. Protons are positively charged particles, and neutrons are neutral particles with no charge. The mass of these particles is almost equal, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. The atomic number (Z) of an element represents the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. The presence of a specific number of protons determines the identity of an element. For example, an atom with one proton is hydrogen, while an atom with six protons is carbon. Neutrons, being neutral, contribute to the mass of an atom but do not affect its chemical properties. The number of neutrons in an atom can vary, resulting in different isotopes of the same element. Isotopes of an element have the same atomic number but different mass numbers since their neutron count differs. The mass number (A) of an element refers to the sum of the total protons and neutrons within an atom's nucleus. Electrons, on the other hand, are negatively charged particles that occupy the space around the nucleus in what is referred to as electron clouds or orbitals. These electrons are responsible for determining an atom's overall chemical properties and play a vital role in chemical bonding. Electrons have a much smaller mass compared to protons and neutrons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, thus balancing the overall charge of the atom. In summary, the nucleus of most atoms consists of protons and neutrons (option B), while the electrons surround the nucleus, determining the atom's chemical properties and behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

High tides are the highest level (peak) that water reaches as the tide rises, while spring tides are the tides with the largest difference between high and low tide levels. Spring tides occur when the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun combine to create a more pronounced tidal effect on Earth's oceans. This happens when the moon is either at its full or new phase, as the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned during these times, which leads to higher high tides and lower low tides, generating the larger tidal range known as spring tides."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(b). yes.","output":"To determine whether \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" is a hymn, we will consider the characteristics of a hymn and examine the content and purpose of the song. Step 1: Define a hymn A hymn is typically defined as a song of praise to God, often sung by a congregation in a religious setting. Step 2: Examine the content of \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" The song \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" is a traditional British Christmas carol featuring various symbols and images associated with the season. While it does have some religious context as many Christmas carols do, its primary focus is on these traditional symbols rather than direct praise to God. Step 3: Consider the song's purpose and context Given that \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" is a folk Christmas carol, it is likely that it was sung for celebratory purposes during the Christmas holiday, rather than as part of a religious service or for the purpose of praising God. Conclusion: Based on the content and purpose of \\"The Holly and the Ivy,\\" it does not fit the typical definition of a hymn.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: Found in the body what substance is cerumen?","output":"Cerumen, commonly known as earwax, is a naturally occurring substance found in the human body, specifically in the ear canal. It serves as a protective barrier and has various functions, including moisturizing the ear canal, trapping and preventing the entry of dust, bacteria, and foreign particles, and assisting in cleaning and lubrication. Cerumen is produced by ceruminous and sebaceous glands, which are specialized glands located in the skin of the outer portion of the ear canal. Cerumen is composed of a complex mixture of substances, such as: 1. Fatty acids: These are the primary components of cerumen, providing lubrication and a waterproof barrier in the ear canal. They include both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, with the most common ones being oleic, lauric, and palmitic acids. 2. Cholesterol: This is an essential component of all human cell membranes and has numerous biological functions. In cerumen, cholesterol helps maintain the overall structure and stability of the earwax. 3. Triglycerides: These are another primary component of cerumen, providing energy reserves for the ceruminous and sebaceous glands. Triglycerides account for roughly one-third of the composition of cerumen. 4. Keratin: This is a structural protein found in our hair, nails, and skin, forming a protective layer to shield our body from external threats. In cerumen, keratin comes from dead skin cells shed from the outer layer of the ear canal lining, which mix with other components to form the earwax. 5. Squalene: This is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon compound present in the sebum, the oily substance secreted by sebaceous glands. In cerumen, squalene acts as an oily barrier, helping to maintain adequate moisture levels in the ear canal. 6. Peptides and enzymes: These protect the ear from bacterial and fungal infections. Some of these enzymes include lysozyme, which breaks down bacterial cell walls, and lactoferrin, which prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi by sequestering iron, an essential element for their growth. 7. Glycerol: This helps in maintaining the consistency and viscosity of earwax, enabling it to trap particles, foreign bodies, and microorganisms effectively. 8. Other minor components: These include toxins, heavy metals, pigments, and other trace elements that can be found in cerumen. Cerumen comes in two major types: wet and dry. While the wet type is brown and sticky in texture, the dry type is gray and flaky. These two types are primarily determined by the individual's genetics. In summary, cerumen, or earwax, is a natural substance found in the ear canal, playing an essential role in maintaining the health and cleanliness of the ear. Composed of various substances like fatty acids, cholesterol, triglycerides, keratin, squalene, peptides, enzymes, and other minor components, cerumen serves as a protective, moisturizing, and antimicrobial barrier for the ear."},{"instruction":"So long as teachers fail to distinguish between teaching and learning, they will continue to undertake to do for children what only children can do for themselves. Teaching children to read is not passing reading on to them. It is certainly not endless hours spent in activities about reading. Douglas insists that \\"reading cannot be taught directly and schools should stop trying to do the impossible.\\"      Teaching and learning are two entirely different processes. They differ in kind and function. The function of teaching is to create the conditions and the climate that will make it possible for children to devise the most efficient system for teaching themselves to read. Teaching is also a public activity. It can be seen and observed.      Learning to read involves all that each individual does to make sense of the world of printed language. Almost all of it is private, for learning is an occupation of the mind, and that process is not open to public scrutiny.      If teacher and learner roles are not interchangeable, what then can be done through teaching that will aid the child in the quest   for knowledge? Smith has one principal rule for all teaching instructions. \\"Make learning to read easy, which means making reading a meaningful, enjoyable and frequent experience for children.\\"      When the roles of teacher and learner are seen for what they are, and when both teachers and learners fulfill them appropriately, then much of the pressure and feeling of failure for both is eliminated.

When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, \\"The Haunting\\", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects. But, deep down, I had faith.

Well, subtlety, where are you now!!?? My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us.

As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly. And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that.

He moved from the town after he witnessed his brother, Wayne, murdered by a gang of greasers in 1963. The murderers themselves were killed shortly afterward by an oncoming train, having parked on the tracks. Jim has nightmares about his brother's murder as he starts teaching in the town. Students that are close to him start to be involved in various accidents that look like suicides. One by one, students are slain so the greasers, disguised as living teens, can return to class. The greasers plan to kill Jim the same way they murdered Wayne to keep themselves out of Hell. They intend to have a child witness the event, leading them to try to kidnap Jim's son Scott. Jim finds out that there is a way to let his own brother return. The gang also needs the remaining living member of their gang, Carl Mueller, who left before the train struck. Jim finds Carl, who panics, thinking Jim wants revenge. He runs back to town, fulfilling the gang's plan for a reunion. The gang harasses Jim's family to ensure Jim's compliance in reenacting the murder. After the gang releases the family, Jim hides them inside a church, which the demonic gang cannot enter. Jim tries to bring his brother back in the church's graveyard as the gang lures his wife and son outside and hold them hostage. Jim finds that something is blocking Wayne's return, and must cooperate with the thugs in reenacting the murder. It also reveals that when Jim was a boy, Jim took the murderers' car keys that lead to their deaths. Jim recovered the keys. He returns to the train tunnel in which the first murder took place, though both he and Carl change their dialogue and actions from those taken 27 years before. Frustrated, the gang leader stabs Carl, which allows Wayne to come back. Wayne distracts the gang while Jim gets his family out of the gang's car. Jim gave the gang back their car keys.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Terror by Night Movie plot: An off-screen narrator tells of the deadly curse carried by the fabulous \\"Star of Rhodesia\\" diamond, then takes us to a London coffin-maker's, where Vivian Vedder (Renee Godfrey) arranges a special coffin for her late mother. She'll be taking it on the 7 PM train to Edinburgh. At Euston Station, Roland Carstairs (Geoffrey Steele) meets Holmes (Basil Rathbone), whom he has hired to guard his mother Lady Margaret (Mary Forbes), who has already boarded the train back home to Scotland. Actually, he's there to guard the Star of Rhodesia, which she has owned for many years, but was the object of an attempted theft when Lady Margaret wore it at a royal function. Holmes is certain the thieves will try again. Apparently, Scotland Yard agrees, as Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) is also taking the trip. The train begins to pull out, and Watson (Nigel Bruce) and his old army friend Major Duncan-Bleek (Alan Mowbray) barely manage to board. They had bumped into each other, and forgotten the time as they reminisced. Carstairs brings Holmes to his compartment, where his mother is skeptical about the aid of a \\"policeman\\", but she lets Holmes examine the Star.While Holmes, Watson, Duncan-Bleek, and Lady Margaret are in the dining car, Carstairs falls onto the floor of his compartment. Lestrade hears the thud, but finds the door to the Carstairs compartment locked. Holmes arrives and has the attendant (Billy Bevan) open it. They find Carstairs dead and the box that had contained the Star empty. The body shows no wounds aside from a tiny spot of blood, but Holmes declares it's murder, since a thief arriving right after Carstairs died of natural causes is too improbable. Watson, unimpressed with Lestrade's plodding, decides to try questioning suspects himself. (Thus suspects are those who occupy compartments in the same car, as the attendant was at the door to the leading car, and the trailing car is the locked luggage van.)

Then, as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time, I watched again, and found it absolutely hilarious. Based on the stage play by Neil Simon, it has not been 'opened out' much for the big screen, and that's one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the supporting cast are wonderful, particularly John Fielder as 'Vinnie'. Even now, certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar cracking up and chasing Felix around the apartment, the giggling 'Pigeon Sisters' brought low by Felix's sob stories, and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene ( later ripped off by Nora Ephron's 'When Harry Met Sally' ).

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to smooth top of metal tiki holder.","output":"To determine the better solution for smoothing the top of a metal tiki holder, let's analyze two possible solutions: Solution 1: Using a file or sandpaper Step 1: Select the appropriate file or sandpaper grit for the metal tiki holder. A rough file or coarse sandpaper (about 80-120 grit) would be suitable to start with. Step 2: Secure the metal tiki holder in a vice or with clamps to keep it stable during the process. Step 3: Begin filing or sanding the top of the metal tiki holder in a consistent motion. Apply even pressure to prevent any gouges or uneven surfaces. Step 4: Once the top is roughly smoothed, switch to a finer file or sandpaper (about 240 grit) to refine the surface. Step 5: Continue to smooth the top until the desired finish is achieved. Optionally, you can use progressively finer grits for an even smoother finish. Solution 2: Using a rotary tool with a grinding or polishing attachment Step 1: Choose a suitable grinding or polishing bit for the rotary tool according to the metal type and the desired level of smoothness. Step 2: Secure the metal tiki holder in a vice or with clamps to keep it stable during the process. Step 3: Adjust the rotary tool to an appropriate speed. Start at a lower speed and gradually increase as needed. Step 4: Hold the rotary tool steadily and carefully apply the grinding or polishing bit to the top of the metal tiki holder. Ensure even contact to avoid gouges or uneven surfaces. Step 5: Continue to smooth the top until the desired finish is achieved. Optionally, you can use progressively finer attachments for an even smoother finish. Comparison: Solution 1 (using a file or sandpaper) is more manual and requires more physical effort to achieve the desired smoothness. It may also be more time-consuming and may not achieve as even a surface as a rotary tool. Solution 2 (using a rotary tool) is more precise, efficient, and requires less physical effort. It also provides better control over desired finishing levels and can achieve a smoother surface in a shorter time. Based on the analysis above, Solution 2 (using a rotary tool with a grinding or polishing attachment) is the better solution for smoothing the top of a metal tiki holder. It offers greater precision, efficiency, and control compared to Solution 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

No; If I tell you that Weathering grinds rocks down, and ask you the question \\"what grinds rocks over time?\\", is the correct answer \\"deltas\\"? Answer:","output":"The correct answer is not \\"deltas.\\" Weathering is indeed a process that grinds down rocks over time, but it consists of various mechanisms that contribute to breaking down and altering rocks at or near Earth's surface. This process is essential to the natural shaping of our landscape and formation of soils. Let's dive deeper into the topic of weathering to provide a clearer understanding. Weathering can be categorized into two primary forms: physical (mechanical) weathering and chemical weathering. 1. Physical (mechanical) weathering: This process occurs when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces without changing their chemical composition. This can happen due to numerous factors, such as:    a) Freeze-thaw cycles: Water seeps into cracks in rocks, and when temperatures drop, it freezes and expands, causing the cracks to widen and ultimately break the rock apart.    b) Thermal expansion: Fluctuations in temperature result in the expansion and contraction of rocks, causing them to weaken and ultimately fracture.    c) Biological activity: Plant roots and burrowing animals can also contribute to breaking down rocks. 2. Chemical weathering: In this process, rocks are decomposed and their minerals are altered through chemical reactions. Factors contributing to chemical weathering include:    a) Water: Rainwater can be slightly acidic due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and when it reacts with minerals in rocks, it dissolves and alters their composition.    b) Oxidation: Oxygen in the atmosphere can react with certain minerals, causing them to change chemically and form new substances. Now, let's address \\"deltas.\\" A delta is a landform that forms when sediment carried by a river is deposited as it enters slower-moving or standing water, such as an ocean, a lake, or a reservoir. Deltas eventually grow in size due to the continuous accumulation of sediment. They are not a source of weathering or a process that grinds rocks over time; rather, they are a consequence of the erosion processes mentioned above. In conclusion, if asked, \\"What grinds rocks over time?\\", it's better to say that weathering, which can be either physical (mechanical) or chemical, is responsible for breaking down and altering rocks on Earth's surface. Deltas, on the other hand, are landforms that result from the deposition of eroded sediments and do not directly contribute to the weathering of rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solar energy Commercial CSP plants were first developed in the 1980s.

Other large CSP plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world’s largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5 kW, which are grid connected using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff. In 2013 solar generated less than 1% of the worlds total grid electricity. Q: Less than 1% of the world's total grid electricity was generated by solar energy in what year?","output":"In 2013, less than 1% of the world's total grid electricity was generated by solar energy. Since then, solar energy has been growing rapidly, with increasing numbers of installations and improvements in technology at both utility-scale and small-scale levels. Solar energy is a renewable and clean energy source harnessed from the sun using various technologies. Two main types of solar energy technologies include photovoltaic (PV) systems and concentrating solar power (CSP) systems.  Photovoltaic systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using solar panels, which are typically composed of silicon cells. These systems have become more efficient and affordable over time, making them an attractive option for homes, businesses, and large-scale installations. Small rooftop arrays of less than 5 kW are commonly grid-connected using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff, which allows the surplus energy generated to be fed back into the grid or sold to the utility company. CSP systems, on the other hand, use mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a small area, generating heat which is used to produce steam driving a turbine connected to an electrical generator.

Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: In which region do you need to take religion classes? Context: Most of the Alsatian population is Roman Catholic, but, largely because of the region's German heritage, a significant Protestant community also exists: today, the EPCAAL (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union (UEPAL) with the much smaller Calvinist EPRAL. Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace-Moselle still provides for to the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine). Controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of this legal disposition, as well as on the exclusion of other religions from this arrangement. The answer is:","output":"In the Alsace-Moselle region, you need to take religion classes in one of the following faiths: Roman Catholic, Lutheran, or Calvinist, as it is compulsory in public schools there. This is due to the local law in Alsace-Moselle providing for the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which offer public subsidies to these faiths and Jewish synagogues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apple made phones, computers, and other cool gadgets that a lot of people liked. Another man named Mark Zuckerberg created a website called Facebook, where people could talk to their friends and family, share pictures, and tell everyone about things they liked. Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg were kind of like playground buddies, but sometimes they became competitors because their companies wanted to make better things than each other. But now, Steve Jobs isn't running Apple anymore because he passed away. So, Mark Zuckerberg thinks it's a good time to show how much he likes Steve Jobs. One day, Mark Zuckerberg was hanging out on Facebook and he decided to show he liked Steve Jobs by clicking the \\"Like\\" button on Steve Jobs' Facebook page. That's kind of like giving someone a gold star for being really good at something. This tells everyone that Mark Zuckerberg really likes Steve Jobs and wants to be his friend. To understand how much Mark Zuckerberg likes Steve Jobs, think about it like this: there is a restaurant called In-N-Out Burger that makes delicious hamburgers, and Mark Zuckerberg likes it very much. He likes Steve Jobs just as much as he likes In-N-Out Burger, which must mean he really, really likes him! When Mark Zuckerberg likes Steve Jobs, he is also joining a big club. That's because there are about 200,000 other people who have already liked the Steve Jobs Facebook page, and now they all belong to the Facebook group that likes him too.

The original statement is a quote from a character or person stating, \\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\\" which suggests that the person is disagreeing or arguing with someone named Mr. Inglethorp. Without further context, we can deduce that the person believes that Mr. Inglethorp's views, actions, or words are unreasonable or nonsensical. The question that follows asks whether the phrase \\"That makes no sense.\\" is a suitable alternative to the original statement. We are provided with three options: [I] yes, [II] it is not possible to tell, and [III] no. To evaluate these options, let's explore their meanings: [I] Yes: This answer implies that \\"That makes no sense.\\" conveys the same meaning as the original statement and can be used interchangeably. [II] It is not possible to tell: This answer suggests that, without additional context, we cannot determine if these two statements are equivalent or if there's a subtle difference in meaning or intent. [III] No: This response indicates that \\"That makes no sense.\\" is not an appropriate alternative, and there's a significant discrepancy between the two statements. Upon examining the phrases, it becomes apparent that both \\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp\\" and \\"That makes no sense\\" express disagreement and suggest that something is irrational or illogical. Both statements convey similar sentiments, which denote a sense of confusion or disbelief. In \\"That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp\\", the use of the word \\"absurd\\" emphasizes the intensity of the disagreement, while using \\"That makes no sense\\" is a more neutral way to express the same thought. Additionally, the original statement specifically addresses Mr. Inglethorp, which gives the context of a conversation or debate. However, the alternative statement omits this direct address. Given this analysis, one could argue that the two phrases are not entirely equivalent, due to the difference in intensity and directness. However, they do share a similar underlying meaning. Considering these points, the most suitable response would be [II] it is not possible to tell. While both phrases convey a sense of disagreement and confusion, the original statement has a stronger and more pointed tone than the alternative provided. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if the alternative would carry the exact same meaning or impact in the specific situation where the original statement was used."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.

Goal: How to make a fruit smoothie Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"Making a fruit smoothie is an easy, delicious, and healthy way to consume fruits, providing essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to your body. Here, I'll describe a simple step-by-step method for making a fruit smoothie, including ingredients and proper blending technique to achieve a smooth and creamy texture. Ingredients: - 2 cups of your choice of fresh or frozen fruits (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, mangoes, bananas, peaches, etc.) - 1 cup of liquid (e.g., milk, yogurt, almond milk, coconut milk, or fruit juice) - 1/2 cup of ice (optional, especially if using frozen fruits) - Sweetener (optional, e.g., honey, maple syrup, or a splash of vanilla extract) - Optional add-ins (e.g., spinach, kale, chia seeds, flaxseeds, or protein powder) Equipment: - A blender - A measuring cup Step 1: Prepare the ingredients Wash and chop the fruits of your choice. If using larger fruits like mangoes or peaches, remove the pits and skin. Smaller fruits such as berries can be used whole. If using frozen fruits, you may want to allow them to thaw slightly before blending. Step 2: Add fruits to the blender Place the chopped or whole fruits into the blender. Try to pack them evenly to ensure they blend smoothly and uniformly. Step 3: Add the liquid Pour your choice of liquid (milk, yogurt, or a dairy-free alternative) into the blender. The amount of liquid needed may vary based on the type and freshness of the fruits. If you prefer a thinner smoothie, you can add more liquid. Consider the sweetness of your chosen liquid and adjust the amount of sweetener accordingly. Step 4: Add ice and sweetener (optional) If you prefer a thicker, more refreshing smoothie, you can add ice to the blender. If using frozen fruits, you may not need ice. Taste your fruit and liquid mixture, and if necessary, add a sweetener such as honey or maple syrup to reach your desired level of sweetness. Remember that some fruits are naturally sweeter than others, so adjust accordingly. Step 5: Optional add-ins For added nutritional value, consider incorporating leafy greens (spinach or kale), seeds (chia or flaxseeds), or a scoop of protein powder. These extras will not only boost the health benefits of your smoothie but may also provide additional flavor and texture. Step 6: Blend the smoothie With all of your ingredients in the blender, blend the mixture on high speed until fully combined and smooth. This may take a few minutes, depending on your blender's power and the combination of ingredients. Scrape down the sides of the blender if necessary and continue blending until all ingredients are fully combined and no chunky pieces remain. Step 7: Taste and adjust After blending, taste your smoothie to see if it needs any adjustments. You may want to add more sweetener, liquid, or other ingredients to achieve the desired flavor and texture. Blend again to incorporate any additional elements. Step 8: Serve and enjoy Once you're satisfied with the taste and consistency of the smoothie, pour it into a glass and enjoy your delicious and nutritious fruit smoothie. You can garnish with additional fruits, seeds, or a dollop of yogurt if desired. In conclusion, making a fruit smoothie is a quick and straightforward process requiring a few key ingredients and a blender. By following these steps, you can easily customize your smoothie for taste preferences and dietary requirements while reaping the health benefits of a wide variety of fruits."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

If the perspective could possibly convince someone with different view, it is supporting, otherwise it is undermining. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: claim: The world should go vegan.  perspective: Vegetarians die at the same rate as meat eaters. Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. First, let's break it down step by step. 1. Read and understand the claim: \\"The world should go vegan.\\" 2. Read and understand the perspective: \\"Vegetarians die at the same rate as meat eaters.\\" 3. Determine if the perspective supports or undermines the claim. Now let's apply these steps to the claim and perspective. 1. The claim states that the world should adopt a vegan lifestyle, meaning no consumption of animal products. 2. The perspective presents an argument that vegetarians have the same mortality rate as those who eat meat. To determine if the perspective supports or undermines the claim, we need to analyze the perspective. The perspective does not address the ethical, environmental, or health concerns usually associated with the vegan argument. It only focuses on the mortality rate of vegetarians, which is not directly related to veganism. The perspective neither supports nor undermines the claim since it does not directly address the reasons why someone might argue for or against veganism. Instead, it offers an unrelated point, which does not provide strong evidence to convince someone with a different view."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: For a man who has lived the Olympic ideal of faster, higher, stronger, they are strange words to attach to Usain Bolt. On Tuesday, at the front of a glitzy news conference, the media circus was called to attention, with the eight-time Olympic champion pulling his 'to the world' pose under a shower of ticker tape. Above him shone the slogan 'forever fastest'. It was a subtle, but telling, change to his sponsor's usual 'forever faster' tagline. For Bolt is now pushing boundaries through sheer weight of gold-medal metal rather than an ever-lighter imprint on the clock. His fastest 100m time so far this year is 9.95 seconds. At the same stage last year - in the build-up to the Rio Olympics - he had run 9.88. Before the World Championships in Beijing in 2015, he had clocked 9.87. Heading into Moscow 2013, his best was 9.85. Before London 2012, it was 9.76. Each time, he improved to win gold, but in progressively slower times as the years advanced. That 9.58-second scorched-earth world record from Berlin 2009 belongs to the same man, but a different, irrevocable era. Bolt, now 30, comes into this London edition of the World Championships, not as a sensation heralding a revolution, but instead hanging onto his empire against the challenge of Father Time and young pretenders. With three rounds of the 100m, roughly 30 seconds of action, left of his career, could Bolt, weighed down with 19 World and Olympic gold medals, possibly bow out in defeat? Bolt may never have been slower before a major championship, but the threats to him have rarely been less clear. The fastest man this year is Christian Coleman. The American's best of 9.82 seconds was one of six occasions on which he dipped under 10 seconds this season. Just 21, Coleman's expanding portfolio of performances attracted a seven-figure sponsorship deal from Nike as the sportswear giant made him their bet as Bolt's long-term successor. Coleman has a marked lack of major championship experience however. He told the Daily Telegraph that he was \\"pretty much a deer in the highlights\\" at the Rio Olympics where he appeared in the heats of the 4x100m relay. The final of the United States trials - the biggest race of his season - delivered only his fifth-fastest time of the year and second place. Bolt's old sparring partner Justin Gatlin was the man who beat Coleman. The 35-year-old claims he feels back to his 100m heyday when he won Olympic and world titles in 2004 and 2005, a time predating both Bolt's emergence and his own two doping bans. He will need to be. He has only beaten Bolt once in his long career  - at a Diamond League meeting in Rome in 2013. By contrast in major finals in 2012, 2013, 2016 and most notably at the world championships in Beijing 2015 when Gatlin came into the final faster and favoured, he was left in the Jamaican great's wake. If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote. Yohan Blake is the second fastest man in the world this year - and of all time, behind Bolt. He profited when Bolt fouled out of the 2011 World Championships and did the 100m-200m double in his compatriot's absence in the Jamaican trials this year. But the 27-year-old has been hindered by a run of injuries in recent seasons and pulled out of the Diamond League meeting in Rabat in mid-July with a groin problem. If Nike plumped for Coleman, Puma - Usain Bolt's own shoe sponsor - signed up Andre de Grasse in a multi-year, multi-million deal in 2015 as their pick for the next 100m superstar. It seemed a good choice when the Canadian won bronze in Rio last summer. Less so this season however. Having struggled for form - he is only the 23rd fastest in the world - he has now pulled out of London 2017 with a hamstring tear. Media playback is not supported on this device Former 1500m world champion and BBC Sport commentator Steve Cram Usain Bolt would not have given this field a second thought two or three years ago. He is not as good as he was. But he doesn't have to be. Whatever we have seen so far, he will be better in London. And what we have seen so far, in my opinion, is not that bad. In Monaco, where he ran his season's best of 9.95 seconds a fortnight ago, I thought he looked pretty good. Media playback is not supported on this device I don't think he has been pushing harder than he has to to win so far this season - he has been steady out of the blocks, getting up to speed, pulling clear and then throttling off. He has managed to adapt the demands he makes on himself pretty well in the last few years. You also have to look around. Bolt is not as fast as he was, but where is the threat coming from? Coleman is a bit of a raw talent without the experience that counts for so much in major finals. Blake has had a couple of injuries, and then you come back to the same-old in Justin Gatlin. South Africa's Akani Simbine has been under 10 seconds eight times this season, but has tended to run his fast times early in the season at home and then has not reproduced in major finals. There would be a lot of people very surprised if he stepped up to that level. I would always rather be in Usain Bolt's camp than anyone else's. Maybe London 2017 doesn't really matter anyway. Less than victory would end Bolt's gold run in the blue riband event, but it would be a blemish to bother only the most particular completists. The specifics of Saturday's night final at London Stadium will slowly fade to footnotes on Bolt's career. It won't be the heap of titles or spreadsheets seconds, but yawning winning margins as wide as Bolt's grin that define his legacy. Before Bolt arrived, sprinting was a serious, testosterone-soaked business. The likes of Linford Christie, Leroy Burrell, Maurice Greene and Donavon Bailey snarled and strutted on the start-line, as quick to take offence as they were over the ground. Bolt ushered in an era of slacker-chic. He shunned the twitchy thousand-yard stare and instead clowned his way to greatness. And his rivals have, for the most part, aped his example. He has rewritten not just record books, but sprinting etiquette, transforming the culture of the sport's headline event. Crucially Bolt's performances have been as natural as his act. After former relay team-mate Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance in January, only nine of the 33 fastest 100m times in history remain untainted by drugs bans. All were run by Bolt. Media playback is not supported on this device On Tuesday, he warned that if doping continued it could undermine the public's faith so fatally that athletics as a whole could die off. Whether fellow athletes heed that call to save the golden goose or instead cheat their way towards the vacuum he leaves behind, only time will tell.","output":"Usain Bolt, the eight-time Olympic champion, is pushing boundaries by the sheer weight of his gold-medal haul rather than on speed alone.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Elliptic geometry, a special case of Riemannian geometry, is a non-Euclidean geometry, in which, given a line \\"L\\" and a point \\"p\\" outside \\"L\\", there exists no line parallel to \\"L\\" passing through \\"p\\", as all lines in elliptic geometry intersect. Elliptic geometry has a variety of properties that differ from those of classical Euclidean plane geometry. For example, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always greater than 180°.  - Ezra Cornell (January 11, 1807  December 9, 1874) was an American businessman, politician, philanthropist and educational administrator. He was the founder of Western Union and a co-founder of Cornell University. He also served as President of the New York Agriculture Society and as a New York state Senator.  - In mathematics, particularly in the theories of Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, a homogeneous space for a group \\"G\\" is a non-empty manifold or topological space \\"X\\" on which \\"G\\" acts transitively. The elements of \\"G\\" are called the symmetries of \\"X\\". A special case of this is when the group \\"G\\" in question is the automorphism group of the space \\"X\\"  here \\"automorphism group\\" can mean isometry group, diffeomorphism group, or homeomorphism group. In this case \\"X\\" is homogeneous if intuitively \\"X\\" looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism (differential geometry), or homeomorphism (topology). Some authors insist that the action of \\"G\\" be faithful (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a group action of \\"G\\" on \\"X\\" which can be thought of as preserving some \\"geometric structure\\" on \\"X\\", and making \\"X\\" into a single \\"G\\"-orbit.  - In Riemannian geometry, the sectional curvature is one of the ways to describe the curvature of Riemannian manifolds. The sectional curvature \\"K\\"() depends on a two-dimensional plane  in the tangent space at a point \\"p\\" of the manifold. It is the Gaussian curvature of the surface which has the plane  as a tangent plane at \\"p\\", obtained from geodesics which start at \\"p\\" in the directions of  (in other words, the image of  under the exponential map at \\"p\\"). The sectional curvature is a smooth real-valued function on the 2-Grassmannian bundle over the manifold.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Andrew Dickson White (November 7, 1832  November 4, 1918) was an American historian and educator, who was the cofounder of Cornell University and served as its first president for nearly two decades. He was known for expanding the scope of college curriculae. A politician, he had served as state senator in New York. He was later appointed as a US diplomat to Germany and Russia, among other responsibilities.  - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox.  - In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called BolyaiLobachevskian geometry or Lobachevskian geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry. In hyperbolic geometry the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced with:  - Cornell University is an American private Ivy League and federal land-grant doctoral university located in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledgefrom the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \\"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\\"  - Euclidean geometry is a mathematical system attributed to the Alexandrian Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry: the \\"Elements\\". Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms, and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system. The \\"Elements\\" begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of formal proof. It goes on to the solid geometry of three dimensions. Much of the \\"Elements\\" states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in geometrical language.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - Daina Taimina ( Latvian : Taimia ; born August 19 , 1954 ) is a Latvian mathematician , currently Adjunct Associate Professor at Cornell University , known for crocheting objects to illustrate hyperbolic space .  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics.  - In mathematics, hyperbolic space is a homogeneous space that has a constant negative curvature, where in this case the curvature is the sectional curvature. It is hyperbolic geometry in more than 2 dimensions, and is distinguished from Euclidean spaces with zero curvature that define the Euclidean geometry, and elliptic geometry that have a constant positive curvature.  - Classics or classical studies is the study of classical antiquity. This covers the ancient Mediterranean world, particularly ancient Greece and Rome. It encompasses the study of ancient languages, literature, philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the West, the study of the Greek and Roman classics was considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities and a necessary part of a rounded education. Since the 20th century, however, Classics is no longer a part of a typical elite education.  - In geometry, Euclidean space encompasses the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, and certain other spaces. It is named after the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria. The term \\"Euclidean\\" distinguishes these spaces from other types of spaces considered in modern geometry. Euclidean spaces also generalize to higher dimensions.  - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context. The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term \\"Ivy League\\" has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.    What is the relationship between 'daina taimina' and 'topology'? Answer:","output":"Daina Taimina is a Latvian mathematician currently serving as an Adjunct Associate Professor at Cornell University. She has made significant contributions to the field of topology, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, and bending. Taimina's work specifically focuses on the relationship between topology and hyperbolic geometry, a type of non-Euclidean geometry that has a constant negative curvature, as opposed to the Euclidean geometry we are more familiar with in everyday life. She has developed an innovative method for illustrating hyperbolic space by using crochet. Her crocheted models provide a tangible and visual representation of hyperbolic space, allowing for a better understanding of the unique properties and structures found in hyperbolic geometry. These models have proven to be valuable educational tools in the study of topology, as they offer a hands-on approach to exploring and grasping complex mathematical concepts. Through her groundbreaking work in using crochet to model hyperbolic space, Daina Taimina has established a strong connection between her research and the field of topology. By creating these physical representations of abstract mathematical ideas, she has expanded our understanding of hyperbolic geometry and its applications and offered new insights into the broader area of topology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University and was the author of many works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, in which he laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, among other ideas. He was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation and as \\"one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. In addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960, Fodor's work has had a significant impact on the development of the cognitive sciences.\\" Jerry Fodor was born in New York City on April 22, 1935, and was of Jewish descent. He received his A.B. degree (summa cum laude) from Columbia University in 1956, where he studied with Sydney Morgenbesser, and a PhD in philosophy from Princeton University in 1960, under the direction of Hilary Putnam. From 1959 to 1986 Fodor was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1986 to 1988 he was a full professor at the City University of New York (CUNY). From 1988 until his retirement in 2016 he was State of New Jersey Professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, where he was emeritus. Besides his interest in philosophy, Fodor passionately followed opera and regularly wrote popular columns for the London Review of Books on that and other topics.  Philosopher Colin McGinn, who taught with Fodor at Rutgers, described him in these words:  Fodor (who is a close friend) is a gentle man inside a burly body, and prone to an even burlier style of arguing. He is shy and voluble at the same time ... a formidable polemicist burdened with a sensitive soul.... Disagreeing with Jerry on a philosophical issue, especially one dear to his heart, can be a chastening experience.... His quickness of mind, inventiveness, and sharp wit are not to be tangled with before your first cup of coffee in the morning. Adding Jerry Fodor to the faculty at Rutgers [University] instantly put it on the map, Fodor being by common consent the leading philosopher of mind in the world today. I had met him in England in the seventies and ... found him to be the genuine article, intellectually speaking (though we do not always see eye to eye).  Fodor was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received numerous awards and honors: New York State Regent's Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship (Princeton University), Chancellor Greene Fellow (Princeton University), Fulbright Fellowship (University of Oxford), Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He won the first Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind and cognitive philosophy in 1993. His lecture series for the Prize, later published as a book by MIT Press in 1995, was titled The Elm and the Expert: Mentalese and Its Semantics.

West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Cape Verde or Cabo Verde ,, officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an island country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central Atlantic Ocean. Located off the coast of West Africa, the islands cover a combined area of slightly over .  - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - Cova Figueira is a city in the southeastern part of the island of Fogo, Cape Verde. It is situated 22 km east of the island capital São Filipe. Since 2005, it serves as the seat of Santa Catarina do Fogo Municipality. Its elevation is 480 meters above sea level.

The previous stadium that the team played in was called Estadio Olimpico do Fogo and could hold about 2789 to 3890 people .  - The Fogo Island League is a regional championship played in Fogo Island, Cape Verde. The winner of the championship plays in the Cape Verdean football Championships of each season. Its current president is Pedro Fernandes Pires since September 2015.  - Pico do Fogo is the highest peak of Cape Verde, rising to above sea level. It is an active stratovolcano lying on the island of Fogo. The main cone last erupted in 1675, causing mass emigration from the island. A subsidiary vent erupted in 1995. The only deadly eruption was in 1847 when earthquakes killed several people.  - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands.

Translate to Finnish: Given the need for food and energy security, we must develop alternative energy supply sources and minimise food waste both at EU and national levels.","output":"Ottaen huomioon elintarvike- ja energiaturvallisuuden tarpeen, meidän on kehitettävä vaihtoehtoisia energianlähteitä ja vähennettävä ruokahävikkiä sekä EU:n että kansallisella tasolla. Koska elintarviketurva ja energiaturva ovat keskeisiä kysymyksiä kaikille Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioille, on tärkeää, että etsimme keinoja näiden tavoitteiden saavuttamiseksi. Tämä sisältää sekä uusien energiamuotojen kehittämisen että toimintatapojen parantamisen, jotta vähennämme hukkaan heitettyä ruokaa. Yksi tärkeä strategia tämän tavoitteen saavuttamiseksi on vaihtoehtoisten energianlähteiden kehittäminen ja toiminta. Tämä voi sisältää muun muassa uusiutuvien energialähteiden, kuten aurinko-, tuuli- ja vesivoiman, lisäämisen sekä vähemmän tunnettujen teknologisten ratkaisujen tutkimuksen, kuten biomassan jalostamisen tai geotermisen energian käytön. Näiden energiamuotojen kehittäminen ei ainoastaan auta vähentämään riippuvuutta fossiilisista polttoaineista, vaan myös vähentää kasvihuonekaasupäästöjä ja taistelee ilmastonmuutosta vastaan. Toinen välttämätön osa elintarvike- ja energiaturvallisuuden tavoitteen saavuttamista on ruokahävikin vähentäminen. Ruokahävikki on valtava ongelma niin Euroopan unionissa kuin maailmanlaajuisestikin. Euroopassa arvioidaan, että noin kolmannes kaikista tuotetuista tai jalostetuista elintarvikkeista päätyy jätteeksi. Tämä tarkoittaa resurssien, kuten energian, veden ja viljelysmaan, epäasianmukaista käyttöä. Ruokahävikin vähentämiseksi on tärkeää puuttua ongelmaan sekä EU:n laajuisella tasolla että kansallisella tasolla. EU voi esimerkiksi edistää tutkimusta, julkista tietoisuutta ja mahdollisia säädöksiä, joiden avulla jäsenvaltiot voivat puuttua ruokahävikin ongelmaan tehokkaammin. Kansallisella tasolla valtiot voivat toteuttaa omia toimia, joihin voi sisältyä esimerkiksi tiettyjen hävikkiä aiheuttavien käytänteiden kieltäminen, kansalaisten valistaminen ruokahävikin vähentämisen tavoista sekä taloudellisten kannustimien kehittäminen elintarvikeketjun toimijoille, jotta ne voisivat toimia paremmin ja vastuullisemmin. Yhteenvetona, elintarvike- ja energiaturvallisuuden varmistaminen edellyttää sellaisten vaihtoehtoisten energianlähteiden kehittämistä, jotka vähentävät riippuvuuttamme fossiilisista polttoaineista ja vastaavat samalla ilmastonmuutoksen haasteisiin. Samalla on tärkeää vähentää ruokahävikkiä ja parantaa ruokateollisuuden tehokkuutta sekä Euroopan unionin että kansallisella tasolla."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On rare occasions, the GPC opposed Gaddafi's suggestions, sometimes successfully; notably, when Gaddafi called on primary schools to be abolished, believing that home schooling was healthier for children, the GPC rejected the idea. In other instances, Gaddafi pushed through laws without the GPC's support, such as when he desired to allow women into the armed forces.

The question asks about a specific state of meat when it is cooked, with the center being cool and red in color, but not raw and cooked on the outside. This is known as \\"rare\\" cooking. In the context provided, the debate within the GPC (General People's Committee) was limited and mostly served as a rubber stamp for Gaddafi's policies in Libya. The text discusses the instances where the GPC rejected or disagreed with Gaddafi's suggestions, which showcases that there were indeed rare occasions when dissent emerged. Connecting the answer to the context, these instances of the GPC opposing Gaddafi's decisions can be seen as \\"rare\\" instances, much like the rare state of cooked meat. The term \\"rare\\" serves a dual purpose in this context, referring both to the specific way meat is cooked and to the infrequent occasions when the GPC would oppose Gaddafi's policies.

Here is a goal: To get a suntanned look without damaging your skin, Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of getting a suntanned look without damaging your skin, I'd recommend using a self-tanning product or going for a professional spray tan. Here's a step-by-step approach and justification for this recommendation: Step 1: Choose a self-tanning product or a professional spray tan service. - Justification: Both methods are designed to give a suntanned appearance without exposing your skin to harmful UV rays, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer. Step 2: Perform a patch test. - Justification: It's essential to test the product on a small area of your skin first to check for any allergies or irritation before applying it to larger areas. Step 3: Exfoliate your skin. - Justification: Removing dead skin cells through exfoliation will allow the self-tanner or spray tan solution to penetrate evenly, resulting in a more natural-looking tan. Step 4: Apply the self-tanning product evenly or get a professional spray tan. - Justification: Follow the instructions provided with the self-tanner or book an appointment for a professional spray tan to ensure an even, streak-free application. Step 5: Allow the product to dry completely. - Justification: Allowing the product to dry fully before putting on clothes will prevent any staining or transfer and make the tan last longer. Step 6: Maintain your tan. - Justification: Using a good moisturizer and following proper aftercare can help prolong the life of your sunless tan. Avoid excessive scrubbing or exfoliating during this time. By following these steps, you can achieve a suntanned look without damaging your skin by avoiding direct exposure to UV rays from the sun or tanning beds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let's analyze the premise. When it is stated that a child jumps off of a swing while it is in motion, we can understand that the child's action involves leaving the swing deliberately, prior to the swing coming to a stop. The swing is moving, and the child chooses to exit the swing by jumping off of it. Next, let's examine the hypothesis. When we say a child dismounts a swing, it essentially refers to the action of the child getting off or leaving the swing. Dismount signifies the act of getting off a mode of transport, in this case, a swing. Now, let's compare the premise and the hypothesis. Both the premise and hypothesis describe the action of a child leaving the swing. The premise goes further by providing details about the manner and timing of leaving the swing (jumping off while it is in motion). Given that, here's the connection between the premise and hypothesis: Premise: The child is on the swing while it is in motion, and they jump off, exiting the swing. Hypothesis: The child exits the swing (dismounts) As we can see, both the premise and hypothesis involve the action of a child leaving a swing. While the premise offers more specifics, the core action (leaving or dismounting the swing) is present in both statements. Therefore, we can conclude that given the premise, \\"a child jumps off of a swing while it is in motion,\\" it supports the hypothesis that \\"a child dismounts a swing.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: To get “equal pay”, would the US women’s soccer team give up its salaries? It’s a strange question, but it illustrates the complexity of comparing deals that were negotiated at different times with different goals. The US women’s soccer team, for better or for worse, consists mostly of salaried employees. The men’s team, whose players usually draw the bulk of their income from professional clubs, gets mostly bonus money. Related: US Soccer's wage gap is America's shame | Les Carpenter So in this high-stakes game of poker, “equal pay for equal work” is a bluff that doesn’t always stand up to closer scrutiny in the literal sense. “Equal work” isn’t necessarily accurate if you acknowledge that the US men face greater competition to make the roster and greater competition to win games, and they draw higher ratings, higher attendance and more revenue over a four-year cycle. (The fiscal year 2017 projections trumpeted by the players’ side includes the Olympics and a full 10-game Victory Tour, which is predicated on a US gold medal.) And “equal pay,” taken in the literal sense, could be a gamble as well. Does that mean women would be willing to give up steady paychecks for a stagnant player pool in order to get bigger bonuses for wins? Those bonuses could be impossible to even out – in the unlikely event the men win the World Cup, they would share a 9.375m bonus compared with the women’s 75,000 per player (less than 2m for the team). The Fifa payout to the 2015 women’s winner was 2m while the men’s winner in 2014 got 35m. Related: Women's World Cup: bigger, better – but still treated as the poor relation So a 9.5m bonus for the women, who are much more likely to claim such bonuses, would leave US Soccer 7.5m in the hole. Is that what the women’s players want? The lawyers for the women’s side, Jeffrey Kessler and players’ union general counsel Rich Nichols, aren’t saying. They’ve declined to share the players’ collective bargaining demands. “We are not going to comment on bargaining except to say that the women are demanding and proposing equal pay for equal work, which is what the law requires,” Kessler told the Guardian. So we don’t know everything on the table. But we know the players and their lawyers are taking a shrewd gamble that may force US Soccer to show all its cards. That could demonstrate several ways in which the women deserve better treatment, not just better pay. Filing an action with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by itself will not get the women’s team all it wants. That action addresses only compensation, not other issues such as travel and turf, and Nichols agrees it’s not likely to be resolved while the clock ticks toward the 2016 Olympics. The well-publicized PR blitz around that filing, though, has stirred up a media frenzy. Some reports have made comparisons between the men’s and women’s teams, but have picked out only selected figures such as Women’s World Cup final ratings or even saying “the men” failed to make the Olympics, not clarifying that the team in question wasn’t the full national team. Yet the scrutiny also has kicked up several interesting facts and questions: 1. Why are existing ‘equal pay’ clauses not being enforced? ESPN’s Julie Foudy, a former women’s national team captain, dug up such a clause from the 2005 collective bargaining agreement: If in any calendar year, the ratio of aggregate compensation of women’s national team players to the aggregate revenue from all women’s national team games (including all games in US Soccer promoted women’s tournaments) is less than the ratio of the aggregate compensation of the men’s national team players compensation to the aggregate revenue from all men’s national team games (including all games in US Soccer promoted men’s tournaments), then US Soccer will make a lump sum payment to the women’s national team player pool to make the ratios equal. Foudy brought that clause to the attention of the players and their lawyers. They were not aware. US Soccer confirmed that the clause is still valid. The agreement doesn’t specify how “compensation” and “revenue” are calculated. In some years, it wouldn’t help the women make a case for greater pay. In a Women’s World Cup or Olympic year, it surely would. A related, much simpler clause: the men and women currently get different per diem rates for food and expenses when they’re with their national teams, according to women’s team lawyers. The last agreement says that shouldn’t be the case: “These per diem payments shall be the greater of (a) the per diem amount paid by the federation to players on the men’s national team at that time or (b) the following amounts.” Another difference – men receive 1.50 per ticket sold to home friendlies, while women get only 1.20. The women’s Memorandum of Understanding (from 2013, see below) indicates that 1.20 matched what the men received at the time, but the men have since negotiated a new deal. 2. How much do the US women benefit or lose from the bundling of TV rights for their games, men’s national team games and Major League Soccer games through Soccer United Marketing, the entity MLS created to save itself from extinction in 2002? “What numbers [US Soccer] does release are hard to get a real grip on,” women’s player Megan Rapinoe told Foudy. “Where is the money, where is it going and what does it look like – SUM included? Let’s find out.” 3. How will the women’s demands affect the fledgling National Women’s Soccer League, which provides employment beyond the handful of players in the national team mix? The NWSL has benefited from closer ties with MLS clubs. The Portland Thorns, the league’s runaway attendance leaders, are affiliated with the MLS Portland Timbers. Houston also has a combined MLS/NWSL operation, and NWSL expansion team Orlando is gunning for the league’s attendance record on the back of a successful launch in MLS. Those ties also ensure that a couple of NWSL owners have a foot in the door at SUM. And US Soccer directly subsidizes the league, paying office staff and the salaries of its national-team players. (Canada’s federation also picks up the salaries for some of its players allocated to NWSL teams.) NWSL clubs are only responsible for their local operating costs and the pay of non-national team players, which range from a modest 39,700 to a paltry 7,200 for a six-month season. In fact, the Memorandum of Understanding explicitly states: “The parties will work in good faith … so that no non-WNT player receives compensation (salary plus housing) greater than a WNT player.” The EEOC action does not address the NWSL. The players’ press release does not mention the NWSL, nor does an attachment detailing the players’ discrimination claim or an exhibit comparing men’s and women’s compensation. (That exhibit also does not mention the players’ base salaries.) But again, the EEOC action is only part of the larger battle here. “I don’t think (the EEOC action) impacts the NWSL at all,” Nichols said. “If it does, it’ll be favorable. Let’s be clear – the players on the women’s national team are fully supportive of the players in the NWSL.” 4. Why has it taken so long to get a new deal? The last full-fledged CBA was negotiated at a low point for US women’s soccer. Stars like Foudy, Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain were out of the picture after claiming one last Olympic gold in 2004. The first pro league, the WUSA, had collapsed. That deal ran through 2012 and was extended under a “memorandum of understanding” that is now being disputed in a separate court action in which US Soccer is seeking to have the court validate it as a deal that still binds players to a no-strike clause. Related: Explained: why US Soccer is suing its own World Cup winners The memorandum, Exhibit D in US Soccer’s lawsuit, was written to account for the launch of the NWSL. “There will be one contract for WNT players covering both the WNT and the NWSL so that WNT players will not need to enter into a contract with the NWSL,” the MOU states. The deal carries forward salaries: 72,000 for tier I players (minimum number: 18), then 51,000 and 36,000 for tiers II and III. It also includes a “salary if there is no league” clause, which boosts player salaries to 101,000, 72,000 and 43,000. That doesn’t mean players make more money without a league – a separate section of the deal lists salaries and housing allowances for NWSL play, ranging from 46,000 to 56,000 in 2016. In late 2014, the players replaced longtime lawyer John Langel with Nichols, who has represented high-profile female athletes such as Marion Jones and was the general counsel for the American Basketball League, a late-90s women’s basketball league that paid higher wages than the WNBA. A year later, Nichols explicitly challenged the nature of the MOU – the USSF lawsuit has an email of 6 January 2016, in which Nichols says, “it is the position of the (players) that the CBA no longer exists, and further, that the MOU is terminable at will.” To escalate the situation even further, the women have called in Jeffrey Kessler, who has taken on the NFL in everything from antitrust cases to Deflategate, and has women’s sports experience getting a better deal for WTA tennis players and helping South African runner Caster Semenya return to competition after her gender was called into question. In soccer, though, Kessler suffered a setback when he represented Major League Soccer players in an antitrust action against the league. The ill-fated suit dragged on for years before the league prevailed. Kessler in particular struggled in his examination of former MLS executive Sunil Gulati, who happens to be the president of the US Soccer Federation today, harping on the names of England’s top two divisions – which player witnesses had implied were both “first division” leagues despite promotion and relegation between them. “Jeff Kessler is the best in the business,” Nichols said. “Period, end of story. And he’s been the best for more than 20 years. As with any true champion, you lose a few battles along the way, but you win the war. He always wins the war.” Kessler plays down such history and offers some reassurance for men’s soccer fans and players. “My work for the MLS players’ union was 16 years ago,” Kessler said. “I am proud of the effort we made on behalf of those players, even though we did not achieve the results we all hoped for. I have nothing but the greatest respect for the men’s players in the United States and my work for the women today has nothing to do with that prior work, except as a reflection of my dedication to trying to help players in general.” 5. Will we see drastic changes in the US women’s player pool when all this is done? The women’s CBA really reads more like a club team’s contract than a national team deal. It guarantees salaries for 20-24 players. It even limited the national team’s capacity to bring in “Floater players” who were not on salary. Players who lost their places in the salaried tiers of players were guaranteed severance pay. Such stability is good for a handful of players but bad for the talent pool. A typical national team tries new players all the time. The US women generally field the same players, game after game, with the players and the federation grimly meeting their contractual obligations. Related: The USWNT is a soccer team, not a traveling circus. It's time for a fix The stagnant player pool nearly came back to haunt the US women in the 2015 World Cup. The team drew with Sweden and labored past a couple of overmatched opponents before switching players and tactics for the last two games – a breathtaking win over favorite Germany and a rout of previous world champion Japan. How will this player pool look in 2017? That brings us back to whether players are willing to give up steady salaries. Will they accept greater risk and more competition for places on the national team? That may depend on whether this charge by the women’s team attracts not just sympathy but also sponsorship dollars. While the NWSL struggles to attract big money, poorly attended European women’s teams are able to pay players through cooperation with men’s clubs and sponsors. So if this wave of publicity entices sponsors to step forward to build the NWSL so that it’s paying steady salaries, the game of poker becomes easier to finish.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"While the suggested answer does provide a brief introduction to Dadaism, it does not directly address the specific question of what Dada artists thought of art in past museums. In order to provide a comprehensive and relevant answer, I will expand upon the history, goals, and attitudes of Dada artists concerning traditional art in museums. Dadaism emerged as a reaction against the norms and conventions of art and society during World War I when many artists became disillusioned with the state of culture and society. Its origins can be traced back to Zurich, Switzerland, where poets, painters, and performers came together and expressed their dissatisfaction with the prevailing aesthetics, politics, and values of the time. Key figures like Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, and Hans Arp sought to disrupt conventional artistic and intellectual practices in order to provoke a reevaluation of the established order. Dada artists saw traditional art housed in museums as having failed in both its aesthetic and social functions. They perceived the art in museums as an aloof and elitist endeavor that perpetuated the societal divisions, grandiosity, and self-indulgence they opposed. One of the primary arguments of Dada artists was that these past works of art celebrated and reinforced the ideologies and structures that had led to the widespread violence, destruction, and human suffering witnessed during the First World War. As a result, Dada artists sought to challenge and subvert prevailing artistic conventions and institutions. They embraced chance, spontaneity, and the absurd as essential artistic strategies, often utilizing materials and techniques considered unconventional in the artistic process. Collage, photomontage, assemblage, and readymade objects became powerful tools through which they could defy traditional definitions of art and test the boundaries of what could be considered an art object. Furthermore, Dada performances, known as Soirees, combined music, poetry, and visual art in an intense and participative atmosphere that vastly differed from the quiet contemplation often associated with visiting an art museum. The Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich and the Dada Fair in Berlin were examples of platforms that brought together diverse practices to ignite a revolutionary spirit in art. By mocking artistic masters, conflating artistic genres, and rejecting the accepted norms of composition, Dada artists sought to undermine the very idea of what art should be. Their works, such as Marcel Duchamp's \\"Fountain,\\" a urinal signed as a piece of art, exemplified the Dadaists' aim to reject those works that were celebrated as high culture and displayed in museums. In summary, Dada artists had a fundamentally critical perspective on art in past museums. They viewed traditional art as perpetuating the social and political ills of their time and sought to disrupt the idea of the elite, untouchable status of those art pieces. By undermining and deconstructing artistic conventions and questioning the very definition of art, Dada artists epitomized a distinctive and radical period within the history of modern art. As such, the suggested answer does not fully address the question and should not be validated without the inclusion of the broader context, ideas, and practices at the core of Dadaism and its relation to art in past museums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their conversation is interrupted by Beshraavi. David keeps hidden until Sloane brings it to Beshraavi's attention that David and the cipher are missing. Overhearing the conversation, David wraps the cipher in a candy in his pocket, among others, a red one with the number \\"9\\". As Beshraavi's men search for David, Beshraavi demonstrates to one of Yasmin's employees, Hemsley, that he can buy people for their loyalty or else exact extreme revenge.  Forced to show himself, David seemingly abducts Yasmin. They flee from one of Beshraavi's henchmen, Mustapha. In the course of the chase, Mustapha and David struggle at the zoological gardens, when another man intervenes and kills Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster with CID.

Goal: Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD. Performance: Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee  Dec 11. The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on  earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over  the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to. Also, a  template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes  in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure  prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging  activity resulting from this effort. Goal: Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES. Performance: Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across  EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results  presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place  which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has  agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit  control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made  against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with  outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have  highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best  employed. Goal: Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London. Performance: Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC  which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking  place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base  system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these  offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to. Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really  understand where we have risks.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who threw the longest touchdown?","output":"Title: Who Threw the Longest Touchdown Pass in NFL History? Introduction The history of the National Football League (NFL) is filled with legendary moments, from jaw-dropping catches to unforgettable comebacks. Throughout its century-long existence, the NFL has been a stage for showcasing the incredible talent of its athletes – and one area where this talent truly shines is in the iconic touchdown pass. Among these memorable moments, fans often wonder: who threw the longest touchdown pass ever recorded? In this article, we will delve into the record books and reveal the quarterback who achieved this remarkable feat. Patrick Mahomes: The Record Holder The record for the longest touchdown pass belongs to none other than Patrick Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback who has quickly ascended to superstar status in just a few short years. It was during a game against the Baltimore Ravens on September 8, 2020, that Mahomes cemented his name in the history books. The Epic Play: A Step-by-Step Breakdown Step 1: The Formation As Mahomes lined up behind his offensive line, his teammates set up in a standard shotgun formation. The Chiefs had a 1st and 10 at their own 25-yard line, and Mahomes was prepared to target his favorite receiver, Tyreek Hill. Step 2: The Snap The center snapped the ball to Mahomes, who swiftly dropped back into the pocket. The offensive line formed a firm barrier around him, providing ample protection from the oncoming Ravens pass rush. Step 3: The Read and Recognition As the play developed, Mahomes scanned the field, looking for an open receiver. In doing so, he noticed Tyreek Hill had managed to slip past the defense and was now streaking downfield with only open space in front of him. Step 4: The Throw With a clear target in sight, Mahomes launched the ball with tremendous power and precision. The football soared through the air, covering a staggering distance of 83 yards before connecting with Hill's outstretched hands. Step 5: The Catch and Touchdown As the ball fell into Hill's grasp, he swiftly secured his grip on it and sprinted towards the end zone, leaving the stunned Ravens defenders in his wake. Untouched, Hill crossed into the end zone, completing the historic 75-yard touchdown play. Conclusion Patrick Mahomes' 83-yard throw, which resulted in a spectacular 75-yard touchdown for Tyreek Hill, firmly places him in the annals of NFL history. His extraordinary accomplishment showcases the tremendous skill required to be a top-tier quarterback and has earned him a well-deserved place among the league's greatest players. As Mahomes continues to dominate the NFL, fans eagerly await his next record-breaking performance on the field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made. Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face. The main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the LAPD refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment. The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint \\"Precinct 707\\" on a cardboard wall. Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental. More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated. The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway. At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty. Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, I mean, as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes, a golden shower it is. I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

Ask a friend to cover for you so you can go out on a date. Coordinate your dates through private apps to keep them secret. Stay out of public places where you might see people you know.\\"","output":"Title: Navigating the Dating World While Staying True to Your Parent's Rules Introduction Dating can be a thrilling experience for young people, but it can also pose challenges, especially if your parents have set strict rules for dating. Whether it's due to cultural or personal reasons, these stipulations might limit your exploration in the realm of relationships. However, there are ways to navigate the dating world while still technically abiding by your parent's regulations. 1. Present Your Significant Other as a Friend Introduce your partner to your parents as a friend. By doing so, you can continue spending time with your significant other while not breaking your parent's rules. Explain the nature of your relationship as platonic, ensuring that your parents don't object to the time you spend together. This approach allows you to keep the lines of communication open without veering too far from the truth. 2. Group Hangouts: A Safe and Fun Alternative Involve your partner in group activities, gatherings, or outings to make your interactions more casual and innocent. In doing so, you still adhere to your parent's dating rules as you are not going out exclusively with your partner. This method also provides the opportunity to see how your significant other interacts with different types of people and integrates into your social group 3. Enlist a Friend's Help to Cover for You Sometimes, the urge to venture out on a one-on-one date with your partner may be too strong. In this case, consider asking a trusted friend to provide an alibi for your whereabouts. Having someone vouch for you can facilitate these dates without causing unease for your parents. Ensure the friend you enlist is reliable and understanding of your situation to maintain trust and secrecy. 4. Use Private Apps to Coordinate Your Dates To keep your dating life discreet, use private messaging apps to communicate with your significant other. Platforms like WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram provide end-to-end encryption and password protection to ensure that your conversations remain private. This step gives you the freedom to coordinate dates and share intimate moments without the fear of your communication being discovered. 5. Choose Less Public Places for Date Venues When planning a date, opt for less visible locations or activities that lower the risk of running into someone you know. This way, you avoid attracting unwanted attention from known acquaintances who might disclose your engagement in a romantic relationship. Think of unconventional date ideas, such as hiking in remote areas, visiting an obscure art gallery, or attending a niche event in another town. Conclusion While honesty is the best policy, sometimes young people find themselves in a position where they need to bend the truth to experience the world of dating. By employing these tactics, you can respect your parent's rules while still exploring the realm of romantic relationships. Remember, though, it is essential to communicate openly with both your parents and your potential partner and work toward a long-term understanding that benefits everyone involved."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: How did Brian die? there is no Brian in the story The answer is:","output":"Title: Unraveling Brian Genre: Mystery/Drama Plot: Act 1: In the quiet, picturesque town of Willowcrest, a tight-knit community is shocked to find graffiti on a local landmark. The graffiti reads, \\"How did Brian die?\\" The confusion and curiosity spread like wildfire since nobody in the town knows anyone named Brian, and there have been no recent deaths reported. Sarah, a journalist for the Willowcrest Tribune, catches wind of the bizarre message and decides to investigate the cryptic question. She researches past obituaries and old news articles, but finds no mention of anyone named Brian. Undeterred, Sarah convinces her editor to let her publish a story covering the strange graffiti and asking the residents for potential clues. Act 2: As Sarah's article gains traction in the town, several seemingly unrelated residents begin to share their own unusual experiences involving a mysterious man named Brian. A local teacher, Mr. Thompson, reveals that he found an old letter behind his classroom's chalkboard, addressed to someone named Brian. Miss Evelyn, the town's elderly librarian, claims she's been haunted by a recurring dream about a young man named Brian. And an introverted artist, Mark, unveils a series of paintings all depicting a man he believes to be Brian, even though Mark has never met him. Sarah gathers these various accounts and notices that they all describe the same person: a man in his 30s with a distinctive tattoo on his wrist. As the momentum around the story grows, Sarah interviews more witnesses and pieces together Brian's life, as well as his untimely and unknown demise. Act 3: Feeling a strong connection to Brian, Sarah becomes determined to find the truth. She partners up with an amateur town detective, Gerald, who helps her link together the information she has gathered. Gerald discovers that Brian was a Willowcrest resident who disappeared over 50 years ago after an alleged scandal. According to limited records, he was supposedly last seen on the night of a huge fire that destroyed a historic building, which many believe Brian started himself. As they dig deeper, Sarah and Gerald find evidence that exonerates Brian and points to a cover-up within the town. The two unmask the real culprit behind not only the fire but also Brian's murder – a respected figure in the community who wanted to bury the truth about their own misdeeds. In a climactic sequence, the antagonist is exposed on a public platform during the town's annual festival, and soon after, they are arrested by the local authorities. Epilogue: With the truth finally out, the once secret life of Brian is revealed to the town, and his tarnished reputation is restored. Sarah's investigation leads to an emotional connection to Brian's surviving family members, and she pens a heartfelt, in-depth article about Brian's life. The story brings closure to Willowcrest, helping the town to express their overdue grief for Brian while also reigniting a sense of community within its residents. While they can't bring Brian back, they've ensured that his story will never be forgotten."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To coat rice krispie treats in chocolate, you can OPT:  + Use a toe to apply the chocolate to the treats.  + Use a finger to apply the chocolate to the treats.","output":"In order to effectively coat rice krispie treats in chocolate, it is important to consider hygiene, ease of application, and the evenness of the chocolate coating. Two options have been presented: using a toe to apply the chocolate, and using a finger to apply the chocolate. The better solution for this goal is using a finger to apply the chocolate to the treats, and I will elaborate on the factors contributing to this decision. 1. Hygiene: Utilizing a finger to apply the chocolate is more hygienic than using a toe. Our hands and fingers are regularly washed in daily activities, whereas our feet and toes are often enclosed in shoes and might not be as clean. Furthermore, hands are generally less susceptible to bacteria and fungi that thrive in the warm and moist environment created by feet in closed shoes. In the context of food preparation, hygiene is paramount, and using a finger will lead to a cleaner, more sanitary end result. 2. Ease of application: Using your finger to apply the chocolate offers better precision, control, and accessibility. Our fingers are more dexterous, allowing for easier manipulation of the chocolate coating and the treats. This increased dexterity will make applying the chocolate simpler and also allows potential for better presentation. On the other hand, using a toe would likely require considerable effort in maintaining balance and contorting one's body to apply the chocolate, which could result in discomfort and possible injury. 3. Consistency of the chocolate coating: To ensure that the chocolate coating is evenly applied to the rice krispie treats, a finger would be more suitable. Due to the intricate control and dexterity offered by fingers, you can easily spread the chocolate in a consistent and even layer. This would result in a more visually appealing and delicious treat. Using a toe would make it difficult to achieve a smooth and uniform layer as toes have limited flexibility and are not accustomed to such delicate tasks. In conclusion, using a finger to apply the chocolate coating to rice krispie treats is the better solution when considering hygiene, ease of application, and the consistency of the chocolate coating. It is important to remember to wash hands thoroughly before undertaking the task to ensure the treats remain clean and safe for consumption."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the grave robbery, the graverobbers remove the wolfsbane buried with him and he is awakened from death by the full moon shining down on his uncovered body, and kills one of them. Talbot is found by police in Cardiff and taken to hospital where he is treated by Dr. Mannering. During the full moon, Talbot transforms and kills a police constable. Dr. Mannering and Inspector Owen, not believing his story of being a werewolf, travel to the village of Llanwelly to investigate Talbot. While they're away, Talbot escapes from the hospital. Seeking a cure for the curse that causes him to transform into a werewolf with every full moon, Talbot leaves Britain and seeks the gypsy woman Maleva. Together, they travel to the remains of Frankenstein's castle in the village of Vasaria, where Talbot hopes to find the notes of Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein so he might learn how to permanently end his own life through scientific means. By chance, during his transformations into a werewolf, he falls into the castle's frozen catacombs. After wandering around, he discovers Frankenstein's monster (Bela Lugosi) who had been frozen in ice. Finding that the Monster is unable to locate the notes of the long-dead doctor, Talbot seeks out Baroness Elsa Frankenstein (Ilona Massey), hoping she knows their hiding place.

Summarize: Dr Rachel Herrmann from the University of Southampton has denounced the team, which rebranded as Chiefs in 1999, for its use of Native American imagery. She said it evoked \\"Britain's forgotten imperial American past\\". A spokesman for the club said they had no comment to make on the claims, nor the call to change its name. More on this story about the Exeter Chiefs, and others from Devon and Cornwall In the US, Native American campaigners have been calling on teams like the Washington Redskins to change its name, describing it as racist and offensive. Dr Herrmann said: \\"I think changing [Exeter's] name would be the ultimate step but I don't know whether that is likely to happen. \\"I would at least like to see an engaged discussion between the team and Native American groups that could better explain why the name might be offensive.\\" Dr Hermann criticised rugby fans who waved tomahawks, wore Native American headdress and war paint, and said it evoked a history of settler colonialism. The expert said it also ignores modern Native Americans who no longer dress in that way and the protests of those who have spoken out \\"against such cultural appropriation\\". Exeter Rugby Club rebranded as Exeter Chiefs in 1999 shortly after the team turned professional. Summary:","output":"A lady named Dr. Rachel Herrmann is unhappy with a team called Exeter Chiefs because they use pictures and things related to Native American people. She thinks it reminds people of a time when British people didn't treat Native Americans nicely. The team doesn't want to talk about it. In America, some Native Americans also want teams to change their names because they think it's not nice. Dr. Rachel would like the team to talk to Native American people to understand why it might not be a good idea to use their pictures and things. She also doesn't like it when fans pretend to be Native American at games. The team became the Exeter Chiefs in 1999 when they started playing their sport professionally."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.  But I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  What is an answer for this question: Which town had fewer cyclists riding in slippery conditions? A:","output":"Rob's town likely had fewer cyclists riding in slippery conditions. This is because it is situated in the valley, near parks which typically have less precipitation and less hilly terrains compared to Bob's hilly town filled with bike trails."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Exactly three weeks after the Nov. 1 shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, travelers who heard the loud boom of a car crash outside the airport thought they heard gunfire and evacuated the airport. At the same time in another terminal, police responded to anonymous call about a man with a gun, a report that turned out to be false. Airport operations slowly went back to normal after police cleared the terminals. Beverly White reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22, 2013. (Published Saturday, Nov. 23, 2013)      At the same time the sound of a car crash scared passengers into thinking shots were fired at Los Angeles International Airport Friday, travelers in another terminal were evacuated and thousands of flights were delayed after a false report of a man with a weapon, airport officials said.      Police received a call about 7:30 p.m. of possible shots fired, but upon investigation realized the loud noise of a multiple-car crash outside a parking structure between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 incited a panic, LAX Police Sgt. Ortiz told NBC4.      After hearing the crash, travelers began to evacuate the airport on their own, Ortiz said. No shots were fired at the airport, he said.      \\"Part of that (reaction), we believe, is some hypersensitivity to what occurred on Nov. 1, three weeks ago,\\" said LAX Police Chief Patrick Gannon during a news conference outside the airport.      He was referring to shooting in which a lone gunman opened fire near Terminal 3, killing a TSA officer and wounding four others.      Aerial video Friday showed officials investigating what appeared to be a wrecked SUV or van on the curb near a parking structure.      About 8:20 p.m., crowds could be seen gathered outside as police evacuated Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 after an anonymous caller reported a man with a weapon was at Gate 45, airport officials said.      At least 2,000 passengers either left the airport on their own or were evacuated by airport police, LAX officials said.      About 4,600 arriving and departing travelers were impacted by the incidents, officials said. Delta Airlines (Terminal 5) and American Airlines (Terminal 4) reported a total of 60 delayed flights but no cancellations.      Police found no weapon and cleared both terminals for people to return inside just before 9 p.m.      Flight operations in Terminal 4 were disrupted as police cleared the airport, and slowly resumed as passengers were screened by security and returned to their gates, officials said.      Ambulances could be seen lining the roadway in the pick-up and drop-off area of the airport. ||||| An apparent false alarm Friday evening caused panicked travelers and employees to flee at least one terminal at Los Angeles International Airport.      The incident occurred three weeks to the day after a gunman sprayed bullets across a crowded Terminal 3, killing a Transportation Security Administration officer.      Los Angeles World Airports spokeswoman Nancy Castles said that shortly before 7:30 p.m., airport police responded to a report of shots fired at Terminal 5. When they arrived, they found that a traffic accident outside the terminal had caused a loud noise, prompting travelers to evacuate onto the sidewalk.      At the same time, an anonymous caller reported seeing a man with a weapon at one of the gates in Terminal 4, Castles said. Police responded, evacuating and sweeping the terminal \\"out of an abundance of caution,\\" she said. No gunman was found.      Castles said Terminal 4 has been secured and cleared and that passengers are being allowed back in for rescreening.      TV news footage showed a minivan that had crashed into a stairwell of a parking structure across from Terminal 5. It was surrounded by fire and police personnel.      Witnesses described sheer panic unfolding as law enforcement tried to grasp what was happening.      Peter Ward, a 34-year-old IT consultant from Australia, said he was at the Oneworld Lounge on the second floor of Terminal 4 when he saw some commotion downstairs.      “People were diving behind counters at the restaurants. Then people ran and evacuated very quickly,” said Ward, who watched the drama unfold below from the lounge windows. He turned to see several officers running through the main entrance and into the terminal with guns drawn.      Many of them seemed to order passengers out of the terminal through the main entrance, he said.      At least two dozen more officers joined them, some with long rifles and others with bomb-sniffing dogs, Ward said. About 15 of them formed a “human barricade” near the security checkpoint, he said.      The rest of the officers continued to sweep the area downstairs, while Ward said he and other passengers in the lounge were told they were being kept on lockdown.      Several airport police sources reached by phone confirmed that it was a false alarm.      “There was no incident at Terminal 4,” said one officer, who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to comment. “Everybody’s out and they are sweeping the area. The situation is under control and contained.”      The officer said that a vehicle had been involved in a hit-and-run, that the driver had fled but was apprehended near Terminal 6. The noise of the accident, he said, may have prompted TSA employees to report hearing shots.      “I can understand why they’re gunshy,” he added.

Help as much as you can. Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature...  Two teams of researches studied Antarctica's climate. The team studied two different regions.

The Pharaohs suffered a shock 1-0 loss away to Chad in the first leg of their tie last week but will have home advantage on Tuesday to help them erase the deficit. Ezechiel Ndouassel scored Chad's winner, which also gave new coach Rigobert Song a brilliant start to his reign. While the odds are against Chad completing the job, former Cameroon midfielder Song will be hoping his side can produce another stunning upset. Ghana, Algeria and Nigeria also came away from road trips with surprise results as they were all held by opponents they had been expected to beat. The Black Stars' 0-0 draw with Comoros - the lowest ranked African side still in the qualifiers and 159 places below Ghana - was, perhaps, the most embarrassing result suffered by the continent's big names. Captain Asamoah Gyan is in determined mood to make amends. \\"We know we were not up to the task in the first game so we will make sure we turn things around, \\" he said. Algeria, who have only just lost their place as Africa's number one side, also need to put in a strong display with their tie with Tanzania level at 2-2. The two away goals give the Desert Foxes an advantage but they will have been disappointed that their defence was breached twice. Tanzania had taken a two-goal lead in the first match only for Islam Slimani to rescue Algeria with a brace. The striker will want to finish the job in Blida. While Nigeria did not concede in their first leg with Swaziland, the Super Eagles will be concerned by their lack of goals. Coach Sunday Oliseh was rocked by the retirement of striker Emmanuel Emenike last month and he must quickly find a forward line that will provide a cutting edge. Oliseh played with three strikers against Swaziland and he brought on Obafemi Martins and Kelechi Iheanacho in the second half. It will be interesting to see how he sets his team up for the game in Port Harcourt. Kenya have hurt their chances of protecting their 1-0 lead over Cape Verde after a row over payments delayed their departure. The Harambee Stars, who have a nine-hour flight, will arrive less than 24 hours before kick-off. Elsewhere, Mali face a shock elimination unless they can overturn a 2-1 deficit against Botswana. Mali have finished third in the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012 and 2013 and were heavy favourites to knock out the Zebras. Senegal should see off the challenge of Madagascar, who achieved a superb 2-2 draw in the first leg but are unlikely to be able to resist the Teranga Lions on their own ground. The 2002 World Cup quarter-finalists will look to their big names, such as first-leg scorers Mame Biram Diouf and Sadio Mane, to dominate the India Ocean island side. The 14 overall winners will join the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon,  Guinea, Morocco, Uganda and Zambia in the group stage, which kicks off next October.

Use immediately or store for later.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Art of Preparing Homemade Meat Stock: A Comprehensive Guide Preparing a savory homemade meat stock isn’t necessarily a complex task, but it is one that requires a careful balance of ingredients and time. The process can be boiled down (pun intended) to four basic steps—boiling water, adding meat, spicing the broth, and maintaining the boil. This article explores this process based on the directions: \\"Boil 6 cups (1400 mL) water. Add 1.5 lbs (750 g) meat of your choice. Add the stock spices. Boil on medium low for several hours, adding water when necessary and use immediately or store for later.\\" Step 1: Preparing the Water  Begin by boiling six cups, the equivalent of approximately 1400 milliliters, of water. This initial quantity of water serves as a good base for your stock, considering the meat and stock spices to be added. High-quality filtered or spring water could potentially enhance your stock's final flavor.   Step 2: Adding the Meat  Once the water starts boiling, it's time to add the star of the show—1.5 lbs (750g) of meat. The choice of meat is a variable left to personal preference or specific recipe requirements, be it chicken, beef, or pork. It's worth noting that every type of meat will impart a distinct flavor to your stock. For example, beef will yield a hearty and robust flavor, whereas chicken provides a more subtle, delicate taste. Step 3: Spicing up the Stock  Only water and meat would produce a rather bland broth. This is where stock spices enter the frame. The choice of spices significantly influences your stock's aroma and taste. Basic stock spices often include bay leaves, peppercorns, and aromatic vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions, with optional additions like garlic, herbs such as thyme or rosemary, depending on the desired flavor profile. Step 4: The Slow Boil  Post adding the spices, the flame should be reduced to medium-low, ensuring a gentle, steady boil. This process can take several hours, as extracting a deep and rich robust flavor from the meat and spices isn't a task that can be rushed. During this duration, it's important to observe the water level. If the water reduces significantly, add more to keep the ingredients submerged, facilitating uniform extraction of flavors. Lastly, after these simple yet artistic processes, your homemade meat stock is ready to be used immediately or stored for later use. When cooled, the stock can be portioned and frozen, thereby providing a flavorful base for soups, gravies, sauces, and stews in future culinary endeavors. To conclude, creating a homemade meat stock from scratch may seem cumbersome, but it's a labor of culinary love. Guided by patience and the bliss of slow cooking, creating a flavorful stock can upgrade simple meals to gourmet experiences right in your kitchen."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A military train carrying soldiers has derailed south of Egypt's capital Cairo, killing at least 19 people and injuring more than 100, officials say.

The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.

Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Overpriced Review: So why buy a printer for 90 then 200 on ink? Why not buy refilled ink for a fraction of the cost of the OEM stuff? If it breaks the printer (or clogs it) after the first time, who cares? You are still ahead of the game. Never buy OEM ink, huge waste of money. Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review can be characterized as negative with a hint of practicality. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the pricing of the printer and its ink while providing an alternative solution to the problem. Let's break down the review to understand the tone better. 1. Title: Overpriced - The title of the review clearly sets a negative tone as it implies that the product (printer and OEM ink) is not worth the price being charged. 2. Review Content: The reviewer questions the rationale behind buying a printer for 90 and then spending 200 on ink, emphasizing the disparity between the product and consumable costs. This highlights dissatisfaction with the pricing strategy, contributing to the negative tone of the review. 3. Alternative Suggestion - The reviewer then suggests a more practical and cost-effective solution of buying refilled ink rather than the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) ink. This recommendation is based on the premise that the potential risk of damaging the printer with non-OEM ink is outweighed by the savings achieved. This shows that the reviewer is offering a helpful and practical tip, which adds an element of practicality to the review. 4. Concluding Statement - The review ends with a strong statement, \\"Never buy OEM ink, a huge waste of money\\", which reiterates the negative tone and dissatisfaction with the product. In conclusion, the tone of this product review is primarily negative, as the reviewer criticizes the pricing of the printer and OEM ink and questions their value. However, the suggestion to use alternative, cheaper ink options adds a practical element to the review, making it not solely negative, but rather focused on problem-solving while expressing dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"Title: magnificent playing of magnificent music Review: What we have is three suites per DVD with Rostropovich giving short talks about the suite he is going to record next before it is presented.

The girls instantly forget about their earlier competitiveness and rush forward as a united group, each eager to grab some of the spilled treasures. Adults smile warmly, pleased with the success of the activity and the happiness it has brought to the children. Overall, this scene captures the essence of fun, bonding, and shared excitement at a festive gathering. Through the traditional game of breaking a pinata, friendships are strengthened and unforgettable memories are made.

Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away.  But I can use this background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy.  What is an answer for this question: Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","output":"Although both Tony and Greg are consuming snacks that may contribute to tooth decay, it is likely that Tony will experience more tooth decay than Greg. This assumption is based on the information provided in the background, which specifically mentions the process of lactic acid fermentation and its role in tooth decay. Lactic acid fermentation is a process carried out by some bacteria and fungi, as well as in our own muscles during strenuous exercise. Lactic acid, a waste product of this process, is responsible for causing tooth decay. Tooth decay occurs when bacteria use the sugars in our mouth for their energy needs, producing lactic acid as a byproduct which then breaks down the enamel of the teeth. In the situation described, Tony is eating a bowl of candy, which is likely high in sugars. The high sugar content provides an ample source of energy for the bacteria in Tony's mouth, leading to increased lactic acid production and subsequently, tooth decay. On the other hand, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which has a much lower sugar content. The lower sugar content in celery would result in a reduced amount of lactic acid production in Greg's mouth, which subsequently would lead to less tooth decay. Additionally, the snacks that the brothers are eating have different textures, which can also contribute to tooth decay. Candy, especially sticky and chewy types, can stay on the teeth for longer periods, providing more time for bacteria to produce lactic acid. In contrast, the fibrous texture of celery can help clean the teeth as it is being chewed, potentially reducing the accumulation of bacteria and lactic acid. In conclusion, based on the differences in sugar content and the texture of the snacks they are consuming, it is more likely that Tony will experience a greater amount of tooth decay than Greg. It is important to note that this analysis is based solely on the specific situation provided and does not take into account other factors that may contribute to tooth decay, such as oral hygiene practices, genetics, and overall diet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. Choose from: I. no II. yes Is this statement correct \\"are the medieval and middle ages the same\\"?","output":"II. yes The statement \\"are the medieval and middle ages the same?\\" is correct. The terms \\"Middle Ages\\" and \\"Medieval Period\\" are often used interchangeably to describe the same period in European history that lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. This era started with the decline and eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire and transitioned into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is considered as the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history, which are classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. To further examine the Middle Ages, historians subdivide it into three phases: the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. During the Early Middle Ages (approximately 5th-10th centuries), Europe witnessed a series of invasions and migrations by barbarian tribes, leading to the fragmentation of political power. This period also marked the spread of Christianity, which played a significant role in uniting disparate populations under a shared religious and cultural umbrella. The High Middle Ages (approximately 11th-13th centuries) were characterized by the development of feudalism, the revival of trade, the emergence of powerful kingdoms and nation-states, and the growth of the Catholic Church's influence. This period also saw the rise of Gothic architecture, the establishment of universities, the flowering of chivalry, and the beginnings of the Crusades. Lastly, the Late Middle Ages (approximately 14th-15th centuries) faced several crises, including the Great Famine, the Black Death, and the Hundred Years' War, which significantly curtailed Europe's population and economic growth. Despite these challenges, this period laid the groundwork for the Renaissance, as people began to question traditional authority and explore new ideas in various fields, such as art, literature, and science."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose smoke filled air happens, how will it affect more oxygen for blood vessels.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of smoke-filled air will have an effect, both direct and indirect, on the process of oxygen absorption and carbon dioxide exchange for blood vessels. A direct effect of smoke-filled air is that it has a higher concentration of particles, including harmful chemicals and gases like carbon monoxide, which can interfere with the normal functioning of the alveoli. When smoke is inhaled, this can reduce the overall oxygen concentration and potentially impair the ability of the alveoli to absorb oxygen effectively. Carbon monoxide, in particular, has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen, leading to a reduction in oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood vessels. An indirect effect of the smoke-filled air is that it can lead to inflammation, irritation, and damage to the respiratory system's tissues, including the bronchial tubes, bronchioles, and alveoli. Prolonged exposure to smoke can cause chronic respiratory problems and lead to diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer. This damage can further compromise the effectiveness of gas exchange in the lungs, affecting the bloodstream's oxygen levels.

Besides emptiness, Mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight (prajñāpāramitā) and Buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha). There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated).

Add approximately 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda per quart of water or use a ratio of about 1/2 teaspoon for four cups of water. Gently stir the water to dissolve the baking soda completely. 4. Add eggs: Carefully place the eggs into the pot, avoiding any breakages. Turn on the heat and bring the water to a rolling boil. 5. Cook eggs: Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Allow the eggs to cook for about 12-15 minutes, depending on your desired yolk consistency. While the eggs are boiling, prepare an ice bath in a large bowl by filling it with ice and cold water. This ice bath will halt the cooking process once the eggs are removed from the boiling water, preventing overcooking. 6. Remove eggs from heat: After the cooking time has elapsed, use a slotted spoon or tongs to carefully transfer the eggs from the boiling water to the ice bath. 7. Cool eggs: Let the eggs cool in the ice bath for at least 5 minutes or until they are cool enough to handle. 8. Gently crack the eggs: To peel the eggs, first gently tap the egg on a hard surface, such as a countertop, until you notice small cracks all over the shell. Alternatively, you can roll the egg gently between your hands, applying just enough pressure to crack the shell without damaging the egg. 9. Begin peeling: Start peeling the egg from the larger end, where the air pocket usually resides. This will make it easier to get started as there should be a slight gap between the shell and the egg white. 10. Use running water or the ice bath to assist peeling: If you're having difficulty peeling the egg, you can hold it under running water or submerge the peeled portion in the ice bath. The water will help to loosen the membrane under the shell, making it easier to peel the egg. Following these steps will result in hard-boiled eggs that peel more easily thanks to the added baking soda. This method is a simple and effective way to create a smoother and more enjoyable egg-peeling experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Don't Change the Subject Movie plot: The movie begins with frank, humorous interviews of two men who set out to kill themselves and then moves into a Day Of The Dead celebration where the guests celebrate the lives of those whom they have lost. Director Stutz questions his family about his mother's suicide in 1979 and how little they've actually discussed it, visiting his mother's grave site with his sister and listening to old tapes of their mother. He talks to several survivors and experts before commissioning several artists to come up with works about suicide: A band (The Bigfellas) agrees to make a song about suicide \\"that you can dance to\\"; an illustrator (Patrick Horvath) is to make short animated films (which run through the documentary as interstitials); a choreographer (Danielle Peig) chooses to create a dance piece based on two autopsy reports; and a standup comedian (Duncan Trussell) compiles material for his act about suicide with the help of several top comedy writers. Meanwhile, Stutz continues to interview and engage his family about his mother's death, eventually staging his mother's suicide (where he discovered her unconscious at the age of 12) on screen with members of the \\"avant-garde circus\\" troupe, The Lucent Dossier Experience. As some of the interviews take a turn from the dark to the more cathartic, the tone of the movie brightens at the end during the performances of the artistic material. The interview subjects give positive, inspiring messages to the audience about things they can actively do to help prevent suicides and connect more deeply with those they love.

The two Australians, jailed in Kerobokan Prison, applied for clemency from the country's former president two years ago but it was ignored. 'I will reject clemency request submitted by 64 death convicted of drugs cases,' Mr Joko said during a lecture at Gadjah Mada University on Tuesday. If Mr Joko's comments are taken at face value it means Chan and Sukumaran now have no hope for avoiding the death penalty. According to Indonesian news website Kompas.com, Mr Joko said most of the prisoners had 'destroyed the future of the nation'. Scroll down for video.

Sukumaran has turned to art during his time in the notorious prison and entered a self-portrait for consideration for the Archibald Prize this year. He said the rejection of clemency served as 'important shock therapy' for drug dealers, traffickers and users. Mr Joko also revealed during an appearance at a Yogyakarta State University for Human Rights Day that the requests for clemency had remain untouched for years under his predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. 'I'm asking now, what should I do? For years no decisions have been taken. I say now I will issue no pardon for drugs [criminals],' he clarified.

Chan was stopped at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali's capital Denpasar and Sukumaran was arrested in a room at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta with three others. According to court testimonies of convicted drug mules, Chan and Sukumaran were the co-ringleaders of a heroin smuggling operation from Indonesia to Australia. Police found 334 g (11.8 oz) of heroin in a suitcase in the room with Sukumaran which was allegedly going to be smuggled. After a criminal trial, on 14 February 2006 Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to execution by firing squad by the Denpasar District Court. The men's friends and family have been running an appeal, pleading for mercy, for years and say since they have been in prison they have admitted and apologised for their crimes. They both pleaded for clemency from former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before he left office. In June, Daily Mail Australia reported how Sukumaran had entered a self-portrait for consideration for the Archibald Prize from his jail cell in Bali - but his painting wasn't considered because he was locked up abroad.

Goodall spoke exclusively to CNN in a Panamanian rain forest where she is exploring a partnership on behalf of Roots & Shoots, her global youth education program. The interview comes as a new version of the song, first released on Jackson's 1991 \\"Dangerous\\" album, is being recorded by a collection of artists for release in late October. Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where \\"he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. ...

And I was wondering What will Robin want to do next? A:","output":"It's important to note that everyone's situation and response will be different, so these are just potential scenarios based on common patterns and behaviors. Having just gone through a divorce and deciding to keep the kids together, what Robin might want to do next can depend on several factors. Some possibilities could range from focusing on maintaining stability for her kids and establishing a new routine, managing financial affairs, pursuing personal and emotional growth, and seeking new opportunities in life. 1. Focusing on Family:  Robin's priority might be to ensure her kids are adjusting well to the changes. She'd likely concentrate on keeping them emotionally sound and comfortable by maintaining a stable routine. Open communication would be essential at this point, reassuring her kids that both parents still love them, and despite the shift in dynamics, they'll always be there for them.  2. Managing Financial Affairs: With the divorce finalized, Robin might need to reassess her financial situation. She might need to update or create a new financial plan, adjust her budget, or even seek professional financial advice. It might also mean finding a new home or adapting to living on a single income if she was not the primary earner before the divorce. 3. Emphasizing Emotional Health: Robin might also seek counseling or therapy to process any residual feelings from the divorce. Expect her to take time for her own emotional health because maintaining your inner wellness is an essential part of being a capable and loving parent. Engaging with support groups or informal networks of friends and family can also be an important step in her healing process. 4. Personal Growth and New Hobbies: This could be an opportunity for Robin to pursue interests or hobbies she may have placed on the back burner during her marriage. Developing new skills and engaging in activities she enjoys can provide a positive focus and a sense of achievement, along with acting as a great stress-reliever. This might include going back to school, learning a new language, joining a fitness club, or even starting a new business. 5. Exploring New Relationships: While it's usually recommended to take some time to adjust to single life post-divorce, when ready, Robin may choose to step back into the dating scene. She might want to build new friendships and relationships, which can be an essential step in rebuilding her social life and finding companionship, romance, or just expanding her social circle. 6. Prioritizing Professional Life: If Robin had been out of the workforce or part-time employed during her marriage, she might now need to or decide to pursue greater career opportunities. This could mean going back to school, acquiring additional certifications, seeking job promotions, or landing a new job to provide for her family.  Remember that everyone's journey is unique. Therefore, Robin's next steps would depend primarily on her specific circumstances, personal preferences, and the best interests of her family.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. NASA scientists have proposed a bold plan that could give Mars its atmosphere back and make the Red Planet habitable for future generations of human colonists.      By launching a giant magnetic shield into space to protect Mars from solar winds, the space agency says we could restore the Red Planet's atmosphere, and terraform the Martian environment so that liquid water flows on the surface once again.      Mars may seem like a cold, arid wasteland these days, but the Red Planet is thought to have once had a thick atmosphere that could have maintained deep oceans filled with liquid water, and a warmer, potentially habitable climate.      Scientists think Mars lost all of this when its protective magnetic field collapsed billions of years ago, and solar wind – high-energy particles projected from the Sun – has been stripping the Red Planet's atmosphere away ever since.      Now, new simulations by NASA suggest there could be a way to naturally give Mars its thick atmosphere back – and it doesn't require nuking the Red Planet into submission, as Elon Musk once proposed.      Instead, the space agency thinks a powerful-enough magnetic shield launched into space could serve as a replacement for Mars's own lost magnetosphere, giving the planet a chance to naturally restore its own atmosphere.      In new findings presented at the Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop last week, NASA's Planetary Science Division director, Jim Green, said launching an \\"artificial magnetosphere\\" into space between Mars and the Sun could hypothetically shield the Red Planet in the extended magnetotail that trails behind the protective field.      \\"This situation then eliminates many of the solar wind erosion processes that occur with the planet's ionosphere and upper atmosphere allowing the Martian atmosphere to grow in pressure and temperature over time,\\" the researchers explain in an accompanying paper.      While the team acknowledges that the concept might sound \\"fanciful\\", they point to existing miniature magnetosphere research being conducted to protect astronauts and spacecraft from cosmic radiation, and think that the same technology on a larger scale could be used to shield Mars.      \\"It may be feasible that we can get up to these higher field strengths that are necessary to provide that shielding,\\" Green said in his presentation.      \\"We need to be able then to also modify that direction of the magnetic field so that it always pushes the solar wind away.\\"      In the team's simulations, if the solar wind were counteracted by the magnetic shield, Mars's atmospheric losses would stop, and the atmosphere would regain as much as half the atmospheric pressure of Earth in a matter of years.      As the atmosphere becomes thicker, the team estimates Mars's climate would become around 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer, which would be enough to melt carbon dioxide ice over the Red Planet's northern polar cap.      If this happened, the carbon in the atmosphere would help to trap heat like it does on Earth, triggering a greenhouse effect that could melt Mars's water ice, giving the Red Planet back its liquid water in the form of flowing rivers and oceans.      If all of this were to occur as the team anticipates – and admittedly, that's a pretty fantastical if – it's possible that, within the space of a couple of generations, Mars could regain some of its lost Earth-like habitability.      \\"This is not terraforming as you may think of it where we actually artificially change the climate, but we let nature do it, and we do that based on the physics we know today,\\" Green said.      The team acknowledges that the plan is largely hypothetical at this point, but it's a pretty amazing vision for what might be possible in the years ahead. The researchers intend to keep studying the possibilities to get a more accurate estimate of how long the climate-altering effects would take.      If the concept does prove workable, there's no telling just how much it would alter the prospects of colonising Mars in the future.      \\"Much like Earth, an enhanced atmosphere would: allow larger landed mass of equipment to the surface, shield against most cosmic and solar particle radiation, extend the ability for oxygen extraction, and provide 'open air' green-houses to exist for plant production, just to name a few,\\" the researchers explain.      \\"If this can be achieved in a lifetime, the colonisation of Mars would not be far away.\\"      The findings were presented at the Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop. ||||| Artist's conception of a terraformed Mars. Credit: Ittiz/Wikimedia Commons NASA proposes a magnetic shield to protect Mars' atmosphere      This week, NASA's Planetary Science Division (PSD) hosted a community workshop at their headquarters in Washington, DC. Known as the \\"Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop\\", this event ran from February 27th to March 1st, and saw scientists and researchers from all over the world descend on the capitol to attend panel discussions, presentations, and talks about the future of space exploration.      One of the more intriguing presentations took place on Wednesday, March 1st, where the exploration of Mars by human astronauts was discussed. In the course of the talk, which was titled \\"A Future Mars Environment for Science and Exploration\\", Director Jim Green discussed how deploying a magnetic shield could enhance Mars' atmosphere and facilitate crewed missions there in the future.      The current scientific consensus is that, like Earth, Mars once had a magnetic field that protected its atmosphere. Roughly 4.2 billion years ago, this planet's magnetic field suddenly disappeared, which caused Mars' atmosphere to slowly be lost to space. Over the course of the next 500 million years, Mars went from being a warmer, wetter environment to the cold, uninhabitable place we know today.      Artist’s rendering of a solar storm hitting Mars and stripping ions from the planet’s upper atmosphere. Credits: NASA/GSFC      This theory has been confirmed in recent years by orbiters like the ESA's Mars Express and NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN), which have been studying the Martian atmosphere since 2004 and 2014, respectively. In addition to determining that solar wind was responsible for depleting Mars' atmosphere, these probes have also been measuring the rate at which it is still being lost today.      Without this atmosphere, Mars will continue to be a cold, dry place where life cannot flourish. In addition to that, future crewed mission – which NASA hopes to mount by the 2030s – will also have to deal with some severe hazards. Foremost among these will be exposure to radiation and the danger of asphyxiation, which will pose an even greater danger to colonists (should any attempts at colonization be made).      In answer to this challenge, Dr. Jim Green – the Director of NASA's Planetary Science Division – and a panel of researchers presented an ambitious idea. In essence, they suggested that by positioning a magnetic dipole shield at the Mars L1 Lagrange Point, an artificial magnetosphere could be formed that would encompass the entire planet, thus shielding it from solar wind and radiation.      Naturally, Green and his colleagues acknowledged that the idea might sounds a bit \\"fanciful\\". However, they were quick to emphasize how new research into miniature magnetospheres (for the sake of protecting crews and spacecraft) supports this concept:      The proposed method for creating an artificial magnetic dipole at Mars’ L1 Lagrange Point. Credit: NASA/J.Green \\"This new research is coming about due to the application of full plasma physics codes and laboratory experiments. In the future it is quite possible that an inflatable structure(s) can generate a magnetic dipole field at a level of perhaps 1 or 2 Tesla (or 10,000 to 20,000 Gauss) as an active shield against the solar wind.\\"      In addition, the positioning of this magnetic shield would ensure that the two regions where most of Mars' atmosphere is lost would be shielded. In the course of the presentation, Green and the panel indicated that these the major escape channels are located, \\"over the northern polar cap involving higher energy ionospheric material, and 2) in the equatorial zone involving a seasonal low energy component with as much as 0.1 kg/s escape of oxygen ions.\\"      To test this idea, the research team – which included scientists from Ames Research Center, the Goddard Space Flight Center, the University of Colorado, Princeton University, and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory – conducted a series of simulations using their proposed artificial magnetosphere. These were run at the Coordinated Community Modeling Center (CCMC), which specializes in space weather research, to see what the net effect would be.      What they found was that a dipole field positioned at Mars L1 Lagrange Point would be able to counteract solar wind, such that Mars' atmosphere would achieve a new balance. At present, atmospheric loss on Mars is balanced to some degree by volcanic outpassing from Mars interior and crust. This contributes to a surface atmosphere that is about 6 mbar in air pressure (less than 1% that at sea level on Earth).      At one time, Mars had a magnetic field similar to Earth, which prevented its atmosphere from being stripped away. Credit: NASA      As a result, Mars atmosphere would naturally thicken over time, which lead to many new possibilities for human exploration and colonization. According to Green and his colleagues, these would include an average increase of about 4 °C (~7 °F), which would be enough to melt the carbon dioxide ice in the northern polar ice cap. This would trigger a greenhouse effect, warming the atmosphere further and causing the water ice in the polar caps to melt.      By their calculations, Green and his colleagues estimated that this could lead to 1/7th of Mars' oceans – the ones that covered it billions of years ago – to be restored. If this is beginning to sound a bit like a lecture on how to terraform Mars, it is probably because these same ideas have been raised by people who advocating that very thing. But in the meantime, these changes would facilitate human exploration between now and mid-century.      \\"A greatly enhanced Martian atmosphere, in both pressure and temperature, that would be enough to allow significant surface liquid water would also have a number of benefits for science and human exploration in the 2040s and beyond,\\" said Green. \\"Much like Earth, an enhanced atmosphere would: allow larger landed mass of equipment to the surface, shield against most cosmic and solar particle radiation, extend the ability for oxygen extraction, and provide \\"open air\\" greenhouses to exist for plant production, just to name a few.\\"      These conditions, said Green and his colleagues, would also allow for human explorers to study the planet in much greater detail. It would also help them to determine the habitability of the planet, since many of the signs that pointed towards it being habitable in the past (i.e. liquid water) would slowly seep back into the landscape. And if this could be achieved within the space of few decades, it would certainly help pave the way for colonization.      In the meantime, Green and his colleagues plan to review the results of these simulations so they can produce a more accurate assessment of how long these projected changes would take. It also might not hurt to conduct some cost-assessments of this magnetic shield. While it might seem like something out of science fiction, it doesn't hurt to crunch the numbers!

There's already research into inflatable structures that would create the mini-magnetosphere you'd need for this to work. The biggest challenge, as with many things in space, is time. While a shield would have a relatively rapid effect on radiation, it's not certain how long it would take to thicken the atmosphere and increase temperatures. A magnetic shield would amount to a kind of terraforming, after all, and even a relatively quick change could take decades. NASA and SpaceX would still have to visit a hostile planet in the years ahead.      Still, the very fact that this is even on the table is noteworthy. It suggests that it would be realistic to preserve and even improve Mars' remaining atmosphere without the staggering effort that would be needed to directly alter the planet. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"NASA scientists have proposed a plan aimed at reintroducing Mars' atmosphere and making the planet habitable.

The word \\"amygdaloid\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"amygdale,\\" which means almond. The term is used to describe the characteristic oval or oblong shape of almond nuts, which are seeds enclosed within the hard-shell of an almond fruit. Almond trees are native to the Mediterranean region and Western Asia, and they belong to the Rosaceae family, which also includes other fruit trees such as cherries, plums, and peaches. Almonds have been a part of human diets for thousands of years. They are not only nutritious but also multipurpose as they can be consumed whole, sliced, or in the form of almond milk, oil, butter, and flour. The almond's oval or amygdaloid shape has a slightly pointy tip on one end and a rounded, wider base at the other end. The outer portion of the almond is protected by a thin, leathery skin that is either light brown or off-white in color, depending on the type of almond. Under the skin is the almond's nutritious and flavorful seed that is frequently used in cooking and baking. Moreover, the term \\"amygdaloid\\" is also used in neuroanatomy to describe the shape of the amygdala, a small almond-shaped structure located deep within the temporal lobes of the brain. The amygdala is an essential component of the limbic system and is associated with key emotional and cognitive functions, particularly those related to fear, anxiety, and emotional memory. In conclusion, amygdaloid refers to the distinctive and identifiable almond-like shape that is visually reminiscent of an almond nut. This term is not only commonly found in discussions about almonds and their role in human diets but also in fields such as neuroanatomy, where it is used to describe similarly shaped structures in the brain."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Use a hangar and nail to adhere your wreath to your door.. (II). Use a hot glue gun to glue each individual CD to your door..","output":"In order to adhere a Christmas CD wreath to your door, the two methods suggested are: (I). Use a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door. (II). Use a hot glue gun to glue each individual CD to your door. Considering these two options, I would recommend going with option (I) - using a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door. Here is a detailed explanation of each option and why option (I) makes more sense: Option (I) - Use a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door: This method involves using a wreath hanger - a simple, curved metal hook that can hang over the top of your door - and a nail, if necessary, to secure the hanger in place. This option allows for easy installation and removal of the wreath, and it also minimizes damage to your door. To use this method, follow these steps: 1. Purchase or create a wreath hanger. These can be found at most craft or home improvement stores, or you can easily make one by bending a wire coat hanger into the desired shape. 2. Slightly open your door and slide the wreath hanger over the top, ensuring that the hook faces outward. The flat part of the hanger should rest flush against the door. 3. If the wreath hanger is slightly loose on the door, use a small nail or a removable adhesive strip to hold the hanger in place. Take care not to damage your door when using a nail. 4. Attach your CD wreath to the hook by its ribbon or wire loop. Ensure that the weight is evenly distributed, and the wreath is securely in place. Option (II) - Use a hot glue gun to glue each individual CD to your door: This method involves applying hot glue directly to the back of each CD and then adhering it to your door, creating a wreath shape. While this may create a more secure bond between the CDs and the door, it has several downsides: 1. Hot glue can be challenging to remove, potentially leading to damage when trying to remove the CDs from the door in the future. 2. Gluing each CD individually is a more time-consuming and labor-intensive process. 3. The door's surface and material may not be compatible with hot glue, resulting in a weak bond or potential damage to the door's finish. In conclusion, option (I) - using a hanger and nail to adhere your wreath to your door - makes more sense for this goal as it is easier, less time-consuming, and less likely to cause damage to your door. Additionally, with this method, your Christmas CD wreath can be easily removed and stored, allowing you to reuse it in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a result of Comcast's withdrawal, Time Warner Cable eventually entered into an agreement to be acquired by Charter Communications, another independent company. Comcast and Time Warner Cable remain separate entities that provide cable television, broadband internet, and telephone services across different regions in the United States. Therefore, they operate as distinct companies with their own corporate structures, service offerings, and pricing strategies. It is important to note that while both Comcast and Time Warner Cable have been involved in mergers and acquisitions with other telecommunications companies over the years, their proposed merger did not materialize due to antitrust concerns. The U.S. Department of Justice determined that such a merger would have had negative consequences for both competition and consumers in the telecommunications industry. As a result, the two companies continued to operate independently and eventually pursued different paths for growth and expansion. In the end, Time Warner Cable was acquired by Charter Communications, which then rebranded its newly acquired operations as Spectrum. Comcast, on the other hand, has continued to operate under its own name and has expanded its footprint in various regions across the United States.

If one balloon is full and another is only half full does the full balloon have a higher or lower pressure?  Catherine is throwing her friend a birthday party and is starting to put up decorations. She has finished hanging streamers and now she has to fill the balloons. Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon.  Hint: All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire. The answer to this question is:","output":"The full balloon has a higher pressure. When the balloon is filled with more air (or helium, in this case), the particles are crowded together in a confined space. This causes them to continuously bump into each other and into the balloon walls, generating higher pressure. In comparison, the half-full balloon has fewer particles in the same confined space, leading to fewer collisions and thereby resulting in lower pressure. The particles in fluids, including gases, always tend to move from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure, which is why air quickly fills an enclosed space like a tire or a balloon when introduced."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \\"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\\" a neighbour said. \\"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \\"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\\". During that period, he considered suicide and \\"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \\"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\\". In July that year, he was declared \\"entirely healthy\\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \\"vision problems and sleep disorders\\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \\"psychosomatic disorder\\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \\"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \\"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\\" the report found. \\"This made him unfit to fly.\\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \\"ways to commit suicide\\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \\"cockpit doors and their security provisions\\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \\"personal life crisis\\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \\"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \\"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large. This allows them to warn third parties if they think it necessary. In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \\"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \\"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\\" But Mr Spohr also said: \\"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \\"uninterrupted autopilot system\\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \\"rule of two\\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \\"to require them to review all relevant procedures\\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \\"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \\"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \\"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\\".","output":"A man named Lubitz was flying a plane but he was very sad and not feeling well. He decided to crash the plane on purpose which was a very bad thing to do. Investigators found out that he had hidden his sickness from his friends and the people he worked with. Even though they now know more about Lubitz, there are still some questions that may never be answered. Now, airplane people are making some changes to make sure this doesn't happen again. But sometimes, bad things can still happen even when people try their best to be safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You have to answer the question based on the given passage. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Why did Hill challenge his sentence?, Context: Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What did Mozart hear in Mannheim? ?  During the 1750s  Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ. In 1789, Mozart was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der Associierten to re-orchestrate several... Answer:","output":"During his visit to Mannheim in 1777, Mozart heard a performance of Handel's work, \\"Messiah.\\" The composition, which had been gaining popularity in festivals, cathedrals, and concerts and had been incorporated into church services as anthems, motets, or concert pieces, left its mark on Mozart who encountered it for the first time in Mannheim. The \\"Messiah\\" was not performed in its original form but as a revised and re-orchestrated version to fit the prevalent tastes of the time. The performances that Handel himself oversaw, and those that occurred in the decades following his death, commonly involved large musical forces akin to what Burrows suggested as typical for the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754.  Beginning in 1784, a trend for larger scale performances developed. This was exemplified by the series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music in Westminster Abbey under King George III's patronage, where a monumental group of at least 525 performers participated.  In the rest of Continental Europe, a different form of departure from Handel's practice was noticeable, where original works were being significantly re-orchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. Hiller, for example, presented a revised and drastically re-orchestrated version of \\"Messiah\\" in Berlin Cathedral in 1786 and again in 1788, involving hundreds of performers.  This massive re-orchestration and the large-scale performances offer a clue to what Mozart might have heard in Mannheim: a version of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" performed by a sizeable ensemble in a modified arrangement reflecting the musical preferences of the time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was a dramatic win for Democrats, who entered the Tuesday morning vote pessimistic about their chances. They picked up support from six Republican senators. RELATED: SENATOR SUES TO STOP PAY FOR CONGRESS MEMBERS’ INSURANCE The 60-37 vote may set up passage of the measure later this week and Democrats hope it will put pressure on the Republican-run House. But GOP leaders there have said they will only back the three-month extension of the benefits if its 6.5 billion cost is offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. Shortly after the procedural vote, President Obama praised the Senate's move and urged Congress to follow suit. “Unemployment insurance has been a vital economic lifeline,” Obama said. “For a lot of people it’s the only source of income they have to support their families while they look for a job.” “These aren’t people who are just sitting back waiting for things to happen. They desperately want work,” he added. “There’s still a lot of people struggling out there ... Congress should make things right.” Democrats plan this year to push other bills they say aim to address inequality, including a proposed minimum wage hike. They hope to they will either force Republicans to accept Obama's agenda or face fallout in the 2014 midterm elections from an electorate that appears increasingly concerned about economic fairness.

And Until Obama offers such a plan, Boehner added, “the House is going to remain focused on growing the economy and giving America’s unemployed the independence that only comes from finding a good job.\\" More than 1.3 million Americans are losing federal unemployment aid they received after exhausting state jobless aid. Most states offer six months of unemployment insurance. The federal program expired on Dec. 28. It's the first time since Congress launched the emergency program in 2008 that federal unemployment benefits lapsed. RELATED: FLA. REP.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is eyeing a 2016 presidential bid, that extending unemployment benefits would be a \\"disservice\\" to jobless people because it would discourage them from seeking jobs. \\"You're causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy,\\" Paul said on Fox News Sunday, prompting a stern dismissal from Obama.

Given the below context:  Before settlers moved into the basin, it consisted mainly of upland and wetland forests in which Native Americans fished, hunted, and foraged. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascade Range as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, settlements in the Clackamas River basin, adjacent to the Johnson Creek watershed, had moved to the river's lower floodplain. The area was the home of the Clackamas Indians, a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River and reached into the foothills of the Cascades. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.By the middle of the 19th century, the European American newcomers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.

Plot title: The Perfect Man Movie plot: Single mother Jean (Heather Locklear) relocates every time she gets her heart broken by another guy, much to the dismay of her teenage daughter, Holly (Hilary Duff). Holly devises a plan to invent a secret admirer for her mother, so she'll be happy and not have to relocate anymore. Holly overhears her friend Amy's (Vanessa Lengies) uncle Ben (Chris Noth) ordering flowers for a woman, and decides to use his advice on women (which she acquires by telling him she needs help for a school project on romance). Following Ben's advice, she sends her mother orchids and other gifts and love notes, and is soon communicating with her mother as this fictitious admirer (who Holly names Ben) via the internet. As her mother becomes more interested, Holly has to find a photo of this admirer. She sends one of the real Ben, and then devises a reason why they can't meet in person, claiming he is working in China. While she is developing the online romance between her mother and fake Ben, and preventing her mother and the real Ben from meeting in person, she finds herself drawn to a cute, artistic boy in her class, Adam (Ben Feldman), but is unwilling to get close to anyone due to her history of being uprooted and having to say goodbye so often.

Unfortunately there is no way her mother can ever meet the real Ben without Holly's plan being exposed. Holly asks help from Adam to disguise as Ben in the telephone and break up with Jean. But he fails, as he is revealed to be harboring feelings for Holly as well, in effect telling Holly's mother the opposite of what is planned.

At the age of 16 he appeared in Boy and Bicycle, a short film marking the directorial debut of his 23-year-old brother Ridley. Scott studied art in Leeds after failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Art in London at his first attempt. On 19 August 2012, at approximately 12:30 pm. PDT, Scott killed himself by jumping off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in the San Pedro port district of Los Angeles. Investigators from the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division found contact information in a note left in his car, parked on the bridge, and a note at his office for his family. One witness said he did not hesitate before jumping, but another said he looked nervous before climbing a fence, hesitating for two seconds, and jumping into the water beside a tour boat. His body was recovered from the water by the Los Angeles Port Police. On 22 August, Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Ed Winters said the two notes Scott left behind made no mention of any health problems, but neither the police nor the family disclosed the content of those notes.

Kaki King (born Katherine Elizabeth King, August 24, 1979) is an American guitarist and composer. King is known for her percussive and jazz-tinged melodies, energetic live shows, use of multiple tunings on acoustic and lap steel guitar, and her diverse range in different genres. In February 2006, Rolling Stone released a list of \\"The New Guitar Gods\\", on which King was the sole woman and youngest artist (beating Derek Trucks in age by two months as the youngest on the list). In addition to a 10-year career that includes six LP and two EP albums, King has also scored music for television and film. At the end of her tour for Legs to Make Us Longer in 2005, King departed from her previous musical direction out of a desire to escape being pigeonholed as a solo instrumental artist. She amicably parted ways with major label Sony/Epic and returned to her original label, Velour, to begin work on her third album ...Until We Felt Red. Released August 8, 2006, on Velour Records, the album features production work by Tortoise's John McEntire. With the prominence of electric guitar shoegazing and effect boxes on the new record, and the addition of a full band, the music website, The A.V. Club, called the sound a \\"post-rock makeover.\\" She supported the album by going on tour with Sarah Bettens from K's Choice. In early 2007, Dave Grohl invited King to appear as a guitarist on the track \\"Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners\\", a song penned by Grohl for an upcoming studio album by the Foo Fighters. King agreed and is credited on the album, entitled Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, released on September 25, 2007. On November 18, 2007, she joined Dave Grohl on stage to perform the track at the O2 arena in London. Grohl highly praised King's performance:  \\"There are some guitar players that are good and there are some guitar players that are really fucking good. And then there's Kaki King.\\"  King toured with the Foo Fighters on the Australian leg of the Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace tour. While on tour, King finished recording what became the Day Sleeper (Australian tour EP). It was released in late 2007 after King had finished working on August Rush, and with Eddie Vedder and Sean Penn on Into The Wild.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? Options: - When they are fasting   - When they are traveling   - not enough information   - When they are eating a high protein meal === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"When they are traveling."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: St James Holdings Limited is a company set up by which English billionaire retail entrepreneur in the sporting goods market?

Options: - windows 95 - school - ammunition shop - office supply store - desk  The answer is \\"office supply store\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"Office supply store\\" because an office supply store specializes in providing various office-related items and equipment that are essential for the smooth functioning of day-to-day activities, be it for personal use, use in schools and colleges, or businesses. One of the common and most sought-after items in an office supply store is a clipboard, which is a significant accessory for maintaining documents in an organized manner. Firstly, let's take a look at the provided options and understand why the other options might not be suitable for Sam to get more clipboards: - Windows 95: Windows 95 is a long-outdated operating system software developed by Microsoft. It was released in 1995 as part of the Windows operating system family. It is unrelated to clipboards or any physical office supplies. Rather, it’s a software with no connection to the current hardware need. - School: While it's true that schools might have clipboards in their inventory, they are not the ideal place for Sam to acquire more clipboards. Schools are educational institutions meant for learning and not for retail sale of office supplies. Moreover, even if Sam is affiliated with a school, it would make more sense for him to buy clipboards from a dedicated store rather than sourcing it from within the school's inventory. - Ammunition shop: An ammunition shop primarily deals with the sale of firearms, ammunition, and other tactical gear. It is an unlikely place to find clipboards as their primary focus lies in catering to the needs of gun enthusiasts and law enforcement personnel, rather than providing office supplies. - Desk: A desk, be it at home or in the office, might have a couple of clipboards lying around, but this doesn't mean that it would have an adequate supply of clipboards if Sam were to run out of them. A desk is a piece of furniture that provides space for work and storage, but it is not a location where additional clipboards can be sourced if needed. Now, focusing on why the office supply store is the most appropriate option: - Office supply store: Office supply stores are dedicated to providing a wide range of office essentials, including stationery, furniture, storage solutions, and various office accessories. The primary reason Sam would choose an office supply store to get more clipboards is that such stores offer a variety of options in terms of size, material, and design. Sam can easily find a suitable clipboard that meets his requirements and preferences. Additionally, office supply stores often provide volume discounts and cater to bulk orders, which might be beneficial if Sam requires a large number of clipboards. In conclusion, an office supply store is the most logical and convenient place for Sam to obtain more clipboards as it focuses on offering diverse office related products, meeting a wide range of preferences and requirements. On the other hand, other options like Windows 95, school, ammunition shop, and desk either don't provide any connection to the hardware or serve a different purpose altogether, making them inappropriate choices for Sam's needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story.

Summarize this article in one sentence. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 42 had died in attacks on areas held by so-called Islamic State. Anti-IS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said 32 were killed in one district alone. There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is supporting Kurdish-led fighters seeking to capture Raqqa. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance launched a ground assault in early June and is now believed to hold more than half of the city, which is the de facto capital of the \\"caliphate\\" proclaimed by IS in 2014. The Syrian Observatory, a UK-based group that monitors the six-year-old civil war through a network of sources, said on Tuesday that 19 children and 12 women were among those killed in Monday's air raids on the Sukhani and Badu districts. The figures took to 167 the number of civilians killed in coalition strikes since 14 August, it said. \\"The tolls are high because the air strikes are hitting neighbourhoods in the city centre that are densely packed with civilians,\\" Syrian Observatory director Rami Abdul Rahman told AFP news agency. \\"There are buildings full of civilians that are trying to get away from the front lines.\\" The coalition has not yet responded to the report, but said it had conducted 20 air strikes in the Raqqa area on Monday, engaging 13 IS tactical units and destroying 24 fighting positions, a vehicle, a logistics node and communications infrastructure. At the start of June, the coalition said its 22,983 air strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014 had unintentionally killed at least 624 civilians. However, human rights groups believe the true figure is far higher. Airwars, an organisation that tracks allegations of civilian deaths, said that as of 8 August, coalition air strikes were likely to have killed at least 4,487 civilians in three years. On Monday, UN spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric told reporters that it was deeply concerned for the safety of up to 25,000 civilians trapped inside Raqqa, many of them women and children. Tens of thousands of people had fled the city, but those remaining faced severe restrictions of movement in and out of the city, which had dwindling food and water supplies, he said. \\"The UN stresses again that all parties to the fighting are obligated to protect civilians under international humanitarian law, as well as the need for sustained and unhindered access to those who need help,\\" Mr Dujarric added.","output":"At least 42 civilians were killed in Raqqa, Syria, in air strikes conducted by a US-led coalition on areas held by the Islamic State, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is the sentiment of the following tweet? Tweet:Boreddddd. got my Camera today","output":"Step 1: Identify the key terms in the tweet which can indicate sentiment. The key terms in the tweet are 'Boreddddd' and 'got my Camera today.' Step 2: Analyze each key term for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). 'Boreddddd' indicates a negative sentiment as it expresses the feeling of boredom. 'got my Camera today' indicates a positive sentiment as it expresses the satisfaction of acquiring a new item (a camera). Step 3: Combine the sentiments of each key term. In this step, we need to consider whether the sentiments expressed by the key terms are strong enough to impact the overall sentiment of the tweet or whether they are neutralized by each other. In this case, the negative sentiment of 'Boreddddd' is not strong enough to negate the positive sentiment of 'got my Camera today.' Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the tweet. As the positive sentiment outweighs the negative sentiment, the overall sentiment of the tweet is positive. Note: It's important to keep in mind that sentiment analysis can sometimes be ambiguous due to the limitations of natural language understanding and the complexity of human emotions. So, identifying the sentiment of a text may not always be 100% accurate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A Wh-pronoun is a type of pronoun that is used in questions. It helps to introduce a clause, making a question indirect or linking it to a statement as well. In this case, \\"what\\" is used to ask about some information (the game that the water polo player also played), hence it is classified as a Wh-pronoun.  A Wh-pronoun is also sometimes referred to as an interrogative pronoun since it is used to conduct queries. Other examples of Wh-pronouns include 'who', 'whom', 'which', 'whose', and so on.

New Order were formed in the demise of their previous post-punk band Joy Division, following the suicide of vocalist Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. Their integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most critically acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. The initial release as New Order was the single \\"Ceremony\\", backed with \\"In a Lonely Place\\". These two songs were written in the weeks before Curtis took his own life. With the release of Movement in November 1981, New Order initially started on a similar route as their previous incarnation, performing dark, melodic songs, albeit with an increased use of synthesisers. The band viewed the period as a low point, as they were still reeling from Curtis' death. Hook commented that the only positive thing to come out of the Movement sessions was that producer Martin Hannett had showed the band how to use a mixing board, which allowed them to produce records by themselves from then on. More recently, Hook indicated a change of heart: \\"I think Movement gets a raw deal in general really - for me, when you consider the circumstances in which it was written, it is a fantastic record.\\"  New Order visited New York City again in 1981, where the band were introduced to post-disco, freestyle and electro. The band had taken to listening to Italian disco to cheer themselves up, while Morris taught himself drum programming. The singles that followed, \\"Everything's Gone Green\\" and \\"Temptation\\", saw a change in direction toward dance music.  The Hacienda, Factory Records' own nightclub (largely funded by New Order) opened in May 1982 in Manchester and was even issued a Factory catalogue number: FAC51. The opening of UK's first ever superclub was marked by a nearly 23-minute instrumental piece originally entitled \\"Prime 5 8 6\\", but released 15 years later as \\"Video 5 8 6\\". Composed primarily by Sumner and Morris, \\"Prime 5 8 6\\"/\\"Video 5 8 6\\" was an early version of \\"5 8 6\\" that contained rhythm elements that would later surface on \\"Blue Monday\\" and \\"Ultraviolence\\".  1985's Low-Life refined and sometimes mixed the two styles, brandishing \\"The Perfect Kiss\\"--the video for which was filmed by Jonathan Demme--and \\"Sub-culture\\". In February 1986, the soundtrack album to Pretty in Pink featuring \\"Shellshock\\" was released on A&M Records. An instrumental version of \\"Thieves Like Us\\" and the instrumental \\"Elegia\\" appeared in the film but were not on the soundtrack album. Later that summer, New Order headlined a line-up that included the Smiths, the Fall, and A Certain Ratio during the Festival of the Tenth Summer at Manchester's G-Mex.  Brotherhood (1986) divided the two approaches onto separate album sides. The album notably featured \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" and \\"Angel Dust\\" (of which a remixed instrumental version is available on the UK \\"True Faith\\" CD video single, under the title \\"Evil Dust\\"), a track which marries a synth break beat with Low-Life-era guitar effects. While New Order toured North America with friends Echo & the Bunnymen, the summer of 1987 saw the release of the compilation Substance, which featured the new single \\"True Faith\\". Substance was an important album in collecting the group's 12-inch singles onto CD for the first time and featured new versions of \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Confusion\\"--referred to as \\"Temptation '87\\" and \\"Confusion '87\\". A second disc featured several of the B-sides from the singles on the first disc, as well as additional A-sides \\"Procession\\" and \\"Murder\\". The single, \\"True Faith\\", with its surreal video, became a hit on MTV and the band's first American top 40 hit. The single's B-side, \\"1963\\"--originally planned on being the A-side until the group's label convinced them to release \\"True Faith\\" instead--would later be released as a single in its own right several years later, with two new versions.  In December 1987, the band released a further single, \\"Touched by the Hand of God\\", with a Kathryn Bigelow-directed video parodying glam-metal. The single reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and number 1 in the UK Independent Singles chart, but would not appear on an album until the 1994 compilation The Best of New Order.  The group reconvened in 1998 at the suggestion of Rob Gretton. Nearly five years had passed since they had last seen each other. Sumner said, \\"We decided before we agreed to doing any gig, to have a meeting, and if anyone had any grudges to bear, to iron them out.\\" By the second meeting everyone agreed to continue playing, scheduling their reunion gig for the Phoenix Festival that same year. In addition to rarer songs, New Order also decided to begin playing Joy Division songs again. When the Phoenix Festival was cancelled due to low ticket sales, New Order instead played the last night of that year's Reading Festival.  Their 2001 release Get Ready largely departed from their more electronic style and focused on more guitar oriented music. According to Sumner, \\"Get Ready was guitar-heavy simply because we felt that we'd left that instrument alone for a long time.\\" Longtime fan Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins played guitar and sang back-up on the track \\"Turn My Way,\\" and in 2001 toured with the band on dates in the UK, US, and Japan for a short period of time. Phil Cunningham (formerly of Marion) joined the band in a live capacity, deputising for Gilbert who declined to tour in favour of caring for her and Morris' children. Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie provided vocals on the track \\"Rock the Shack\\". Singles from the album included Crystal, 60 Miles an Hour and Someone Like You.  In 2002, Q featured New Order on their list of the \\"50 Bands to See Before You Die\\", although this was as part of a sub-list of \\"5 Bands That Could Go Either Way\\". Both New Order and Joy Division were portrayed in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, depicting the rise and fall of Factory Records as seen through the eyes of label founder Tony Wilson. Cameos by Wilson himself, along with Mark E. Smith of The Fall and former members of Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets, lent a degree of legitimacy to the proceedings. The film touched on some of Factory's other artists, including Happy Mondays and The Durutti Column. The soundtrack featured the new track Here to Stay, produced by the Chemical Brothers, which was released as a single.

World ; First US flight in Vietnam since 1975 World News, HO CHI MINH CITY, A United Airlines plane has landed in Vietnam #39;s Ho Chi Minh City, the first commercial American airliner to fly to the country since the Vietnam War. What is this text about?","output":"This text is about a significant event in which a United Airlines plane landed in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This marked the first commercial American airliner to fly to the country since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The event carries historical and symbolic importance, as it represents a milestone in the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the United States and Vietnam, two countries that were once engaged in a protracted and divisive conflict. The Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975, saw the United States intervening in the conflict between North and South Vietnam. The intervention aimed to prevent the spread of communism in the region, but the war ultimately resulted in heavy casualties and a tremendous loss of resources for both the U.S. and Vietnam. With the fall of Saigon in 1975, the United States withdrew from the conflict and diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed. Since then, the U.S. and Vietnam have made significant efforts to rebuild and nurture diplomatic ties, ultimately reestablishing formal relations in 1995. Reconciliation and cooperation initiatives have been pursued in areas such as trade, investment, education, and cultural exchange. The resumption of commercial flights after decades serves as a powerful symbol of the progress made between the two nations. The landing of the United Airlines plane in Ho Chi Minh City suggests a continuation of positive developments in U.S.-Vietnam relations. As the first commercial American airliner to fly to the country since the war, this event highlights how far both nations have come in terms of moving beyond the painful memories and divisions of the past. This progress is crucial for fostering mutual understanding, trust, and cooperation across various sectors, including economic partnerships, security matters, and cultural connections. In summary, the text discusses the arrival of a United Airlines plane in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, marking the first commercial American flight to the nation since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. This event underscores the ongoing process of reconciliation and normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam, reflecting the significant strides both countries have taken to move forward from the shared history of conflict and towards a more collaborative and peaceful future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We identified variables predicting 1-year mortality and synthesized them into a comprehensive risk scoring construct using backward selection.', 'Of 1189 patients deemed by their treating physicians as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy, 62 (5.2%) patients died within 1 year of ICD implantation. The risk score, composed of 6 clinical factors (age ≥75 years, New York Heart Association class III/IV, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), diabetes, and use of diuretics), had good discrimination (area under the curve 0.77) for 1-year mortality. Addition of 3 biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor α receptor II, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin T) further improved model discrimination to 0.82. Patients with 0-1, 2-3, 4-6, or 7-9 risk factors had 1-year mortality rates of 0.8%, 2.7%, 16.1%, and 46.2%, respectively. Answer: Individuals with more comorbidities and elevation of specific serum biomarkers were at increased risk of all-cause mortality despite being deemed as having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy. A simple risk score composed of readily available clinical data and serum biomarkers may better identify patients at high risk of early mortality and improve patient selection and counseling for primary prevention ICD therapy.

But format-wise, don't look for him to reinvent the wheel â€” there will be a desk, a monologue, celebrities, and the like. That said ... * The content will have a Meyers spin. Though Meyers and Co. claim there's still much to be decided, it seems they have a pretty good idea of what they want already. Producer Mike Shoemaker and Meyers, for example, talk of booking \\"more authors, politicians and explainers\\" and of having sketches \\"with staffers playing recurring characters.\\" * Amy Poehler will be on his first show.

Israel's politics of fear It feels like ancient history now, but in 1993 – the year of the Oslo Accords – Israel’s prime minister Yitzakh Rabin judged that his country was ready to make a momentous choice. Israelis, he confided to the author and politician Shlomo Ben-Ami, were tired of war. Secular and pragmatic, the young generation dreamed of a life of prosperity and normalcy their parents had never known. Israel, he reasoned, was emerging as a place of individualism, hedonism, even – to use a phrase then in vogue – \\"post-Zionism\\". As a result of these changes, Zionism is in the ascendancy again – but in a new, coarsened form. Whereas it was once informed by the collectivist ethos handed down from the first, pioneering generation of Israeli state-builders, the Zionism of Benjamin Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett is rooted in something much more primal: fear. Like all demagogues, Netanyahu (who is sure to remain prime minister after the vote) knows the value of fear, and has spent the last four years frightening his people with the spectre of Iranian nukes, Palestinian terror and international anti-semitism. Even the squandering of his country’s most valuable strategic asset – its close relationship with the White House – has strengthened the Right, convincing voters that Israel is alone in a hostile world and must look inward for strength and safety. But this nationalist mood belies the fact that Israel is, in many ways, splitting at the seams. Trust – between Israelis and in their elected leaders – is at an all-time low. Two-and-a-half decades of privatisation and deregulation have turned it from among the most egalitarian of countries to the most unequal in the Western world, alongside the United States. Meanwhile outgoing foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, currently facing charges of fraud, is just the latest Israeli leader who seems to spend as much time fighting lawsuits as making laws. As society becomes less equitable and the political class grows more squalid and corrupt, fewer Israelis than ever say they value the good of society above their personal interests: 28 per cent today, down from 64 per cent at the beginning of the 80s. The paradox of Israel today is that the more fractured and atomised it becomes, the more it glues itself together by resorting to a belligerent form of nationalism. It is a country that projects its insecurity outwards, finding a comforting unity only in the face of external perils, real or imagined. The irony is that, with the West Bank pacified and the Gaza front quiet, the threat from Palestinian terror is at an all-time low. When Israelis glance up at the lengthening shadows on the iron wall they have erected around themselves, the shapes that increasingly menace them are their own.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: When Greg Smith resigned in March as an executive director and vice president of Goldman Sachs with an Op-Ed page article in The New York Times, he leveled some sweeping charges: Goldman’s culture was “toxic and destructive”; the firm promoted “morally bankrupt people”; and — most devastating to any professional organization — Goldman Sachs bankers were “ripping their clients off.”      Mr. Smith’s letter clearly hit a popular nerve, coming as it did during a devastating financial crisis in which Goldman emerged as the rich, arrogant and unfeeling perpetrator of much of the financial wreckage still afflicting Americans. And it’s hard to quarrel with Mr. Smith’s overriding message: Wall Street should put clients interests’ first or risk oblivion. Indeed, that was Goldman Sachs’s own credo, “Our clients’ interests always come first.”      But stripped of its incendiary conclusions, Mr. Smith’s manifesto was curiously short on facts. Other than the now-infamous reference to muppets — “I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as ‘muppets,’ sometimes over internal e-mail” — there were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off. Mr. Smith declined to elaborate after the article was published, heightening suspense and no doubt fueling the literary bidding that reached a reported 1.5 million for a book that would deliver the goods.      That book, “Why I Left Goldman Sachs,” goes on sale on Monday. Despite tight security, copies of the book have been circulating, and I read one. The book not only fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions, but he admits changing “names or descriptors” for some (but not all) people and acknowledges that what he does disclose is “from memory.”      He says he has tried “to retain the spirit” of what actually occurred. This makes it nearly impossible to verify much of what he says.      Beyond that, from his perch on the equity trading desk he seems to have had a narrow view of the institution where he worked for nearly 12 years. His disillusionment comes across as heartfelt, but much of it seems to have come less from his own experiences than from news reports about the firm’s behavior in deals he wasn’t involved in.      Mr. Smith’s book might even bolster Goldman’s reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets — Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman — then he hasn’t made much of a case.      But Mr. Smith isn’t in much of a position to exonerate Goldman, either. The firm was deeply enmeshed in nearly all aspects of the financial crisis and its causes, including mortgage-backed securities. And after an injection of taxpayer support, it managed to profit handsomely and pay the lavish bonuses that Mr. Smith shared in. But you won’t find that story in “Why I Left.”      Mr. Smith declined to discuss any of this before his scheduled appearance on Sunday on “60 Minutes.” Goldman Sachs responded to some of my questions with copies of parts of their internal investigation and made several employees available.      Potential problems with Mr. Smith’s approach surface almost immediately. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 describes “an intern named Josh” who’s being “grilled” and asked to explain risk arbitrage but “was floundering badly.” Josh, Mr. Smith adds, is the son of a billionaire.      There was no “Josh” in Mr. Smith’s group of interns, and only one son of a billionaire: Teddy Schwarzman, son of Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of the asset management firm Blackstone Group.      “I was never grilled on risk arbitrage, or asked to give a presentation on it,” Mr. Schwarzman said when I contacted him this week. “I realize it was a long time ago, but I would certainly have remembered it if I had floundered.” Nor did anyone else in the class I spoke to recall such an episode.      Mr. Smith also recounts what purports to be a verbatim exchange between a Goldman vice president and a fellow intern named Brynn Thomas who graduated from Brown University. Brynn is interrogated and humiliated by her lack of knowledge about Microsoft, and “starts to tear up and runs out of the room.” Goldman said it has no record of anyone named Brynn Thomas, and other members of Mr. Smith’s intern class said no one by that name was in his class. Nor did they recall any such incident. “The program wasn’t that cutthroat, and it certainly wasn’t abusive,” said Mr. Schwarzman, now a movie producer. “No one ever ran out of a room crying. They were trying to recruit us and also to shape us. They had high expectations, but I learned a tremendous amount.”      (The actual person apparently described in the anecdote, a Brown graduate named Ebony Thomas who was an intern with Mr. Smith, didn’t respond to requests for comment.)      On the larger issue of whether Goldman was “ripping off” clients, his principal evidence is that while he was working in London in the two years before his resignation, Goldman was urging clients to buy or sell options on European banks while countries like Greece and Portugal were in the midst of debt crises. In Mr. Smith’s telling, Goldman was trying to get clients to take positions that Goldman was trying to get rid of, which Mr. Smith describes as “axes.” “The firm believes, deep down, that one outcome is going to transpire, yet it advises the client to do the opposite, so the firm can then take the other side of the trade and implement its own proprietary bet.”      But Goldman officials told me the firm never acted as a principal on any of those trades, and Mr. Smith doesn’t provide any specific examples where it did. Moreover, they noted, Mr. Smith sold United States equities and derivatives while he was in London, not European ones, so he would have had no direct knowledge of European options trading.      Mr. Smith also faults Goldman for constantly changing its views on the outlook for European banks, requiring clients to keep trading and presumably generating more commissions for the firm. “No thinking client could believe that conditions on the ground could change that frequently. It was so obviously misleading and disingenuous,” he writes. But Goldman officials said that anyone immersed in the European debt crisis and government responses at the time would understand that conditions changed frequently, and it was Goldman’s obligation to keep clients informed.      As for muppets — a mildly derogatory term common in British slang — Goldman officials said they had conducted an exhaustive search after Mr. Smith resigned. They said they found only one such reference to a client, and it was about educating the client, a midsize European bank, not taking advantage of it.      The mere mention of Mr. Smith invokes passionate reactions at Goldman, but much of the initial anger seems to have dissipated. People I spoke to who had been close to him felt hurt, wronged and saddened by a broadside from someone they considered a friend and colleague, dedicated to the firm and its values, who was hard-working, reliable and humble. He seemed, they said, the last person to attack the firm and its culture.      One of Mr. Smith’s fellow interns said, “I thought he loved the firm and its culture.” The former intern, now a managing director, said he helped organize a going-away party for him at SPiN, a Manhattan club with 17 Ping-Pong tables. (Mr. Smith was a table tennis champion in his native South Africa.) “In his book he makes every element of our intern program seem demeaning,” the former intern said. “It was intense and stressful, but it was fun. And we learned so much.” He showed me a yearbook he had saved from that summer with several photos of a beaming Mr. Smith.      The Goldman officials I spoke to all asked not to be named because they didn’t want to be drawn into a public debate about the book.      A partner who said he acted in many ways as Mr. Smith’s mentor and was in regular contact with him until shortly before he left, said: “He never raised any issue with me. I had no inkling. I thought he’d settled in in London and was doing fine. I know he was disappointed he hadn’t been made a managing director yet, but he just wasn’t ready. For some people it’s a sprint, but it took me 18 years to make managing director and 20 years to make partner. I told him to keep at it and good things will happen. Serve clients and they’ll serve you. Give them good ideas. London was a great opportunity for him, and I thought he was excited.”      One thing Mr. Smith was clearly unhappy about was his compensation, which had peaked at 500,000 and, like the compensation of most Goldman employees, had recently declined slightly. After he asked for a 1 million bonus, his supervisor wrote in an e-mail, “Greg Smith off the charts unrealistic, thinks he shld trade at multiples, we told him there’s v little tolerance for reactions like that and he needs to tone it down.”      The partner told me this week: “He was an outlier in London. Most people were disappointed but realistic. He had a complete disconnect from the macro environment. Europe wanted to outlaw bonuses. They were discussing bonus caps. We were laying people off. People were very sensitive to this.” The former intern added, “I was floored; I was beyond shocked” by Mr. Smith’s resignation and accusations. “He was making 500,000 at the age of 26 or 27 at a time when people were being laid off, and he complains? I can only conclude he was motivated by personal gain. The firm has been under attack, and I think he’s being opportunistic. None of it feels virtuous to me.”      Virtuous or not, “Why I Left” will surely not be the last word — good or bad — on Goldman. Fabrice Tourre, the young Goldman trader at the center of a now-infamous subprime mortgage deal, is scheduled to go on trial for civil fraud next July. Unlike Mr. Smith, Mr. Tourre was involved in a deal in which Goldman misled investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said. That deal has come to embody many of the excesses of the subprime mortgage bubble — something that actually did help cause the financial crisis. Mr. Tourre has denied any wrongdoing and is on unpaid leave from Goldman while studying for a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago and doing volunteer work in Rwanda.      Mr. Tourre hasn’t signed a seven-figure book deal, but he could surely get one — and if he does, it could be a tell-all worth reading. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Should Goldman Sachs care about Greg Smith’s book?      While “Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story” does not contain any explosive accusations of wrongdoing, it does lay bare at least one man’s view of how the firm’s culture went haywire over the last decade. The believability of his story could have a long-term effect on the firm and its ability to recruit and retain new talent.      Mr. Smith’s book is being released on Monday and was the subject of a segment on “60 Minutes” on Sunday night. On that program, Mr. Smith said Goldman, like other firms, started several years ago to use client information to bet with its own money, sometimes against its own clients. Getting an unsophisticated client, he said, became the “golden prize” because the “quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client.”      Goldman rejects Mr. Smith’s claims, saying, “We have taken a look at those claims as they relate to his business and found no evidence whatsoever to support them.”      Mr. Smith had a seat in the trenches as Goldman evolved from an old line investment bank into a trading power house. He was influenced, as most employees everywhere are, by both things he saw during his time there and by events he read about in the news.      CBS News/60 Minutes      “I knew in my heart there was simply something deeply wrong with the way people were behaving, in the way they didn’t care about the repercussions, in the way they saw their clients as adversaries,” Mr. Smith wrote in his book. “My human reaction was that it was bad for the future of the firm, a place that I had put lot of heart and soul into.”      On the one hand, Mr. Smith comes across as naïve. Yes, there is gambling going on at the casino. But Goldman has long stood out on Wall Street for its ability to hang onto the partnership culture it had before it went public in 1999. That culture, which Goldman says promotes teamwork, integrity and putting the client first, is at Goldman’s core. It helps the bank maintain and attract talent, and Goldman hopes it instills in its employees a type of focus that will allow it to thrive for decades to come.      Corporate culture can make or break a firm. Mr. Smith’s book is interesting because while the tone for corporate culture is set at the top, managers like the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, rely on people like Mr. Smith to believe it and live by it.      While the book is at its heart a story about how the firm’s culture broke down, it is oddly also a testament to some of the ways in which Goldman’s culture still works.      For instance, Goldman is legendary for instilling the idea in traders that it is better to fess up to your mistakes, and the penalty for covering something up will be worse than if you had not spoken up.      This lesson was drilled into Mr. Smith on his few months on the job, in the summer of 2000, when he was an intern and witnessed it in action throughout his career. The mantra of one of his first bosses, he says, was “no ambiguity, no error.” One morning he made a mistake on a trade, and came clean as the firm would hope he would.      “We covered the error, traded out of it, and the correct trade was put on. In all that time – it seemed like 10 minutes but was probably 1 – the market had moved only one tick.” Mr. Smith noted that the error cost Goldman just 80, but the larger point he was making was reporting his error was the right thing, and encouraged by his managers.      Another positive revelation: “Drugs were severely frowned upon at Goldman, even regarded with a certain horror.”      And while Mr. Smith’s depiction of a bachelor party for a Goldman trader, replete with a topless woman in a hot tub, will not go down as Goldman’s finest moment, there was no obvious abuse of corporate funds at that party, or at anytime during his time there, at least that he cared to mention.      He even goes out of his way to note that he once saw a partner who ordered a 400 bottle of wine and then paid for it himself because it exceeded the firm’s corporate spending guidelines.      At the heart of Mr. Smith’s book, though, is what went wrong with Goldman’s culture.      The firm’s overriding business principle is its clients’ interests always come first. He says traders in London frequently refer to clients as “muppets” and that their goal is to land elephant trades, transactions that will net the firm more than 1 million in revenue.      Goldman, he said, “really had become more like a hedge fund, concerned more with helping itself than helping its clients with doing only the business we thought could make us a lot of money and ensure our survival,” he wrote. “Company culture and morale seemed to be bygone values.”      Goldman could not disagree more. “Nothing that Greg suggested rang true to me,” said the head of human capital management, Edith W. Cooper, last week in an interview with Bloomberg TV.      For years, the essential read for any new Goldman recruit has been a 1999 book, “The Culture of Success” by Lisa Endlich, a positive look at what sets Goldman apart from its rivals. Mr. Smith’s book will no doubt be added to the reading list of at least some students thinking about applying to Goldman.      In the last few weeks, Goldman has adopted an uncharacteristically public attack plan, which has included media briefings and on the record interviews. Its effectiveness is critical because it will color the view of future recruits who pick up the book, and whether they believe (or even care) about his concerns.      “I don’t see what he suggests are challenges at the firm,” Ms. Cooper said, “and I believe our culture is stronger than it’s ever been.” ||||| NEW YORK |      NEW YORK (Reuters) - The tell-all book that Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) former equity derivatives salesman Greg Smith has delivered may end up being remembered more for the marketing skills he picked up at the Wall Street bank than for any bombshell revelations.      Smith created a furor earlier this year when he resigned from the blue chip Wall Street firm, alleging in a New York Times Op-Ed column that the firm had engendered a \\"toxic\\" culture of treating clients as \\"muppets\\" - slang in Britain for idiots - and relieving them of their money.      Smith then promised a book about the bank, building up expectations of an exposé with new insights about the culture at Goldman. The threat prompted a public relations campaign and internal inquiries at the bank, as it tried to avoid another hit to its image after suffering a barrage of bad publicity in recent years.      Smith reportedly received 1.5 million as an upfront payment for the book, which is being published by Grand Central Publishing, a unit of Hachette. He has lined up a series of interviews, including one with Reuters, to talk about the book \\"Why I left Goldman Sachs\\", which will be released on Monday.      Early reviews of Smith's 288-page book are now in, and they aren't good. Reviewers, who received copies of the full book, have panned it for being a sleepy read with no big revelations -- or worse, misleading.      The tawdriest revelations are about a bachelor party in Las Vegas with a topless woman, and Smith having seen Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, in the buff after showering at the gym.      \\"There were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off,\\" wrote James Stewart, himself the author of top selling business books such as Den of Thieves, in his column in the New York Times.      \\"Mr. Smith's book might even bolster Goldman's reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets — Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman — then he hasn't made much of a case,\\" said Stewart.      Stewart also cast doubt on some of the anecdotes Smith tells in his story, interviewing people who were in his internship class, such as Teddy Schwarzman, son of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) CEO Stephen Schwarzman. Schwarzman and others say the incidents Smith described, such as an intern running out of a room crying after being humiliated by a more senior Goldman executive, never happened.      Other early reviews have also been critical. The financial blog Dealbreaker mocked less-than-revelatory anecdotes in Smith's book, including one in which a managing director threw out a \\"cheddar cheese salad\\" that an intern had brought him for lunch, instead of the cheese sandwich he had asked for. That anecdote led to more jokes on Twitter and other financial blogs about what, exactly, a cheddar cheese salad is.      Smith's publicist, Jimmy Franco, did not respond to a request for comment for this article.      Smith's ability to so easily build up buzz about his book over the past few months shows how difficult it has been for Goldman to try to counter perceptions that it is the poster child for all that's wrong on Wall Street.      In 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of betting against clients on a mortgage trade, charges that were later settled, but nevertheless led to a firestorm of criticism. One of its former traders, Fabrice Tourre, is due in court next summer to face civil charges for his involvement in those events.      Smith's allegations had raised the same questions about Goldman's culture and ethics all over again.      For its part, Goldman has characterized Smith as a disgruntled and mediocre employee who stirred up all this attention because he did not get the raise and promotion he wanted. Smith spent 12 years at the investment bank. By the time of his resignation, he was a vice president, earning about 500,000 a year, Goldman said.      Goldman has said that it looked into Smith's assertions and did not find any evidence of employees misbehaving or treating clients poorly. Blankfein told CNBC recently that the firm \\"went over everything like crazy and, frankly, we could find nothing.\\"      The marketing strategy for the book shines a spotlight on tactics used by publishers and authors to drum up sales for upcoming publications - and the problems that it can create when the book in question fails to deliver.      It appears to be \\"a typical example of overpromising and under-delivering,\\" said George Belch, chair of the marketing department at San Diego State University and an expert on consumer behavior, who noted that he has not yet read the book.      \\"What they do is try to drum up publicity and whet the public appetite, and clearly Goldman Sachs, for certain portions of the population, is intriguing. But that doesn't mean the book will do anything more than reinforce your disdain for the industry if you already feel that way.\\"      Smith's failure to meet expectations also raises uncomfortable questions for the Times, which first published his allegations in an op-ed column.      On Friday morning, New York Times business columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin said on CNBC he thought the newspaper might have been \\"duped\\" by Smith into publishing the op-ed in the first place, given the lack of substantial information in the book.      A Times spokeswoman declined to comment.      TRADER MENTALITY      Smith, who vanished from the public spotlight after his Times op-ed appeared in March, will make his first television appearance on Sunday evening, on the CBS show \\"60 Minutes.\\"      A clip of the show released on Friday has him recounting an incident in which he says a 24- or 25-year-old junior salesman calls a client a \\"muppet\\" after charging the client an additional 1 million for a trade.      \\"Now you could think to yourself, 'Is this some rogue guy who's just talking callously about clients?'\\" Smith told CBS. \\"But his boss, who's a managing director, was sitting right next to him nodding and chuckling along.\\"      In the interview, Smith wears a dark blue suit, white shirt and red tie, talking for the first time to the public in his native South African accent.      Smith told CBS he does not think he betrayed Goldman and that he has gone on this public campaign to try to affect change at a firm he was once proud of.      Belch, the marketing professor, said that by publicly slamming the firm, Smith might have done more harm than good, since the book appears to have little new information.      \\"Here's another book about how we got taken to the cleaners by the financial services industry,\\" said Belch. \\"Well, yeah, what a shock. Most people don't want to spend money to read about it.\\"      (Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Martin Howell and Marguerita Choy) ||||| In this Tuesday, Oct. 16, 2012, photo, Greg Smith, the former Goldman Sachs banker, responds to questions during a news interview in New York.

He announced his departure from the investment bank with a blistering editorial in The New York Times, accusing Goldman of routinely deceiving clients and relentlessly pursuing profit at the expense of morality.      And he struck a nerve. The essay went viral in the financial world and beyond. Smith was praised for uncloaking corruption that was crying out to be addressed, and also derided as a disgruntled employee.      Goldman Sachs denies Smith's allegations about deceiving clients. The bank says it took his concerns seriously, thoroughly investigated them, and found no evidence to support them.      Smith's book, \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" is being released Monday. It's a window into a company that is notoriously tight-lipped, with stories about a swaggering place where interns arise for 5 a.m. meetings and business trips mean slapping down 150 for one person's dinner.      What Smith hopes to do, he says, is educate people about how Wall Street works, and fuel a public conversation about what went wrong ethically, and how to fix it. The practices that caused the financial crisis, he says, were never really resolved; they're just lying dormant.      Smith, 33, gave his first print interview to The Associated Press. Excerpts have been edited for clarity and length.      Q: Tell us about March 14, the day you left Goldman. You were working in the London office, and you say you had already cleaned out your desk and had been told the editorial would go online at 7 a.m. your time.      A: I get up at 6 a.m., and I type a very heartfelt email to nine people in Europe, including the CEO of Goldman Europe, and express in very personal terms why I'm leaving. I talk about exactly what I thought was wrong with the place, this obvious deceit of clients.      Within five minutes I get an email back from someone on the management committee in Europe who says, \\"I'm really surprised to hear this. I'm in London today. I'd love to meet with you.\\" I get two voice mails from two other people. And then at 6:57 or 6:58, the piece comes online.      Q: What did the bank do?      A: My work BlackBerry stayed on for about three more hours, and I started getting emails from clients who were saying, \\"We completely agree with you, we don't trust Goldman Sachs, we do business with you guys with a \`buyer beware' attitude.\\" I started getting text messages from Goldman managing directors who were supportive as well. And Goldman reached out to me in formal fashion and said, \\"We're sorry to hear you resigned; we'd like to air these concerns out.\\"      Q: The bank denies everything you've charged about them ripping off clients.      A: The thing that disappoints me most is that management is denying there's a problem. Why not try to repair the trust instead? Clients are telling you they don't trust you. There's been an SEC fraud suit that was settled for half a billion dollars.      (The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of selling investments to clients when the bank believed the investments were going to fail. Goldman paid 550 million. It remains the largest SEC penalty paid by a Wall Street firm.)      I'm not some lone voice who thought there was a problem, a change from a client fiduciary model (doing what's best for the client) to use-the-client-to-extract-wealth model. It's a problem that many, many of my colleagues felt and that the public feels as well, borne out in SEC suits and congressional testimonies and clients saying publicly that they don't trust us.      Q: Were you just disgruntled? Maybe you didn't get the bonus or the promotion you wanted?      A: I was actually doing well in my career at Goldman. My bonus, I was told I outperformed my peers by 10 percent. I'm a competitive person, and my goal was to get promoted, and I was told by multiple partners that I was two years away from getting promoted. So it certainly was a goal of mine. And on the compensation side, I was earning a lot of money and had a very good living, so I was grateful for what I was earning. It allowed me to have a good life and to support my family and to do things that I thought were valuable.      Q: But you were at Goldman for almost 12 years, if you start with your summer internship in 2000. Weren't there times when you should have stood up, should have said something about what you thought was morally wrong?      A: I actually made a conscious decision not to sell toxic deals to clients. I didn't think it was the right thing to do, but I also saw the idea that if clients' trust is being burned and they're getting blown up, you're not going to have a career for very long.      Now that does not mean I was not part of a system that was doing things that were unethical. In the book, I try to show some of the conflicts I noticed that gave me pause. For many years, I gave the firm the benefit of the doubt.      It absolutely could have happened quicker. But one can always see things earlier and sooner.      Q: OK, but isn't the purpose of any capitalist company to make money? You certainly made a lot of money at Goldman. (Smith says he made in the \\"high hundreds of thousands of dollars\\" in his best years but declines to be more specific. His publisher declines to say what he was paid for the book.)      A: Capitalism should be where everyone competes hard and makes money, in an environment where there is fair play and competitiveness. Right now the system is stacked against everyone else in favor of the banks.      It's a little like a casino. A real casino is regulated and there are cameras everywhere and the casino cannot see your cards. With Wall Street today, the bank can see what every government, every pension fund, every hedge fund in the world is doing. They can effectively see everyone's cards. Then, instead of facilitating the client's will, they're trying to get the client to facilitate their will.      Q: What do you hope to accomplish with your book?      A: People know there's this huge conflict, and that things are being done that are unethical but are not necessarily illegal. But nobody can put their finger on exactly what the problem is. My goal with the book was to write it to a general reader who knows nothing about finance. By the time someone reaches the end of the book, they can say, \\"I can now speak more intelligently about where the conflicts of interest are, and I can lobby my congressman or I can speak about it more.\\" If people are not educated about what the issues are, they're powerless. That was the problem with Occupy Wall Street _ they didn't know what they were protesting.      Q: The banks are going to say any bad practices were caused by just a few bad actors, and that those guys are gone.      A: This is not some conspiracy of five people sitting in a room plotting to destroy the world. This is far more boring. This is where people have created a perverse incentive system.      If someone can overcharge a client by a million dollars, their leaders are going to say, \\"Great job, we just made an extra million dollars off this pension fund.\\"      Q: So the endemic part is that people don't speak up?      A: People don't like being asked or compelled to make morally dubious decisions. But unfortunately a lot of people's livelihoods are tied up in this, and it's not an easy thing to unwind. Their lives are caught up in this system where they're sending their kids to private schools _ it's almost like the machine for them is working so well that there's no way to undo it unless you want to change your lifestyle.      Q: Why should we care about what happens on Wall Street?      A: You see a lot of commentary that Wall Street is just rich people gambling with other rich people's money. I want people to know that it ultimately affects everyone. In 2008, banks had to be bailed out and that hits taxpayers. If you're a teacher or a fireman or a charity, and you have an investment fund that is trading with Wall Street, and Wall Street is not being held accountable and behaving ethically, then that directly impacts everyone.      Q: What about the reaction of your family and friends to all this? You didn't tell them about the editorial beforehand.      A: No, my mother would have been really upset, and frankly my mother is still very upset. She's mostly worried about how I don't have a job right now. For my parents' generation, the idea of stability is very important, while my generation is a little more idealistic about wanting to actually change things, even if it involves some kind of personal risk. It took me a while to show my mother that I was actually very proud of this. ||||| Greg Smith, who blasted Goldman Sachs when he publicly resigned from the firm and is releasing a book about his experience there, is telling a story that increasingly doesn’t make any sense.      In his first television interview since submitting his resignation letter to the opinion pages of The New York Times in March, Smith continued to say things that were inconsistent with some of his biggest allegations against Goldman Sachs.      One example from his 60 Minutes interveiw: Smith said that a big shot at a key Goldman Sachs client, some huge fund in Asia, told him that he didn’t trust Goldman Sachs, but that he would continue to do business with the firm. The anonymous fund man, Smith says, made this statement after Goldman Sachs was accused by the Securities & Exchange Commission of profiting by misleading clients in a single deal in 2010 and Goldman Sachs execs were grilled in a congressional hearing.      Smith said he was troubled by this story, but he shouldn’t have been. It’s precisely what should be happening in financial markets, especially among large and sophisticated financial institutions. No one charged with making large financial decisions on behalf of themselves or others should just trust any big Wall Street firm, not just Goldman Sachs, but also Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and on and on—and if they do blindly put faith in those institutions trying to sell them stuff then the bigger problem is that such individuals have been given the authority to buy products from Goldman Sachs in the first place.      Smith was not selling sophisticated financial products to retail investors, he was selling them to large and sophisticated institutions. That doesn’t mean that it’s not sleazy, wrong and in some cases potentially illegal for Wall Street banks to mislead their clients, but it does undermine Smith’s argument about Goldman Sachs doing business with muppet clients. Smith wrote that at Goldman “callously people talk about ripping their clients off” and refer to those clients as muppets. But now Smith is saying that at least one muppet, after the financial crisis, wised up and openly declared entering into transactions with the care that is required.      So what’s the problem now? Smith, by the way, remained happily employed at Goldman making as much as 500,000 in the years prior to the financial crisis—which I think we can all agree was a low point for ethical behavior on Wall Street and at Goldman—but not the low point in tell-all Wall Street book sell-outs. James Stewart, who has helped set the standard for writing books about Wall Street scandal, read Smith’s book and found it “fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions.” Stewart also alleges that Smith may have invented a billionaire intern he cites in a Goldman Sachs anecdote.      Last week, Goldman Sachs released a summary of its investigation into Smith’s claims that said Smith was denied a big raise and promotion shortly before quitting. Anderson Cooper asked Smith about this charge on 60 Minutes. Smith did not deny it and said he would have quit anyway. |||||","output":"Greg Smith resigned from Goldman Sachs and accused the company of having a \\"toxic and destructive\\" culture, claiming that the firm promotes \\"morally bankrupt people\\" and that the bankers were ripping off their clients. In his book \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs,\\" he states that he has not provided any concrete examples because he has changed \\"names or descriptors\\" for people and acknowledges that what he discloses is \\"from memory,\\" which makes it almost impossible to verify what he says. Critics argue that his book might actually strengthen Goldman's reputation as they say the claims made are not as bad as initially thought and the fact that Greg Smith stayed at Goldman Sachs for 12 years before sharing his concerns makes people question the credibility of his book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Moisture can make your silver tarnish more quickly than normal. When not in use, store your silver with desiccating packets filled with silica gel. These can usually be purchased at craft stores, general retailers, and hardware stores.  If you have small children or pets, be sure these packets are inaccessible to them. Eating these packets could be deadly. Alternatively, store a piece of chalk with your silver. Similar to the desiccating packets, the chalk will absorb moisture. Chalk will also be less dangerous to children and pets. Anything that contains lemon juice or vinegar will likely cause your silver to tarnish very quickly. Forego using your silver when serving any acidic food. Mustard, onions, and eggs are some of the most common foods that contribute to rapid oxidation.  Food that has a sour taste often has acidic properties. When in doubt, use non-silver items with food like this. In some cases, perspiration may be acidic enough to cause oxidation. Other possible culprits include perfume, makeup, hair products, and cleaning products. Rubber and latex will have a strong negative reaction to silver. They can permanently deface its finish or cause the metal to be eaten away. Avoid storing your silver with other metals. Doing so can also make the silver oxidize more quickly. The detergent and heat of your dishwasher can cause oxidation and corrosion in your silver. Silver should be cleaned with cool water and a mild soap. Use a soft cotton cloth to wipe dirty silver clean when necessary. Opposite of what you might expect, using your silver and cleaning it thoroughly by hand after every use can defend against oxidation. Even using your silver once a week could keep it looking oxidation free for longer. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To prevent silver from tarnishing quickly, store it with desiccating packets filled with silica gel or a piece of chalk to absorb moisture.

Researchers have discovered a protein that they claim is the missing link to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that blocking this protein with an existing drug can restore memory in mice with brain damage that mimics the disease. The findings could offer hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness. Alzheimer's causes a decrease in the size of the brain, shown here by the enlarged ventricle cavities (white, at centre of brain) and the widened pale blue regions. Researchers now believe they have found the 'missing link' that triggers the disease. 'What is very exciting is that of all the links in this molecular chain, this is the protein that may be most easily targeted by drugs,' said the study’s senior author Stephen Strittmatter at Yale School of Medicine. The study offers hope of developing drugs to slow the degenerative illness. 'This gives us strong hope that we can find a drug that will work to lessen the burden of Alzheimer’s.' During Alzheimer's disease protein 'plaques' develop in the structure of the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. People with Alzheimer's also have a shortage of some important chemicals in their brain involved with the transmission of messages within the brain. Scientists have already provided a partial molecular map of how Alzheimer’s disease destroys brain cells. In earlier work, Professor Strittmatter’s lab showed that the amyloid-beta peptides, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, couple with prion proteins. By an unknown process, the coupling activates a molecular messenger called Fyn. The new findings, published in the journal Neuron, reveals the missing link in the chain, a protein within the cell membrane called metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, or mGluR5. When the protein is blocked by a drug similar to one being developed for Fragile X syndrome, the deficits in memory, learning, and synapse density were restored in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s. Prof Strittmatter stressed that new drugs may have to be designed to precisely target the amyloid-prion disruption of mGluR5 in human cases of Alzheimer’s and said his lab is exploring new ways to achieve this. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, currently affecting around 496,000 people in the UK. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article talks about researchers finding a protein that may be linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

I could memorize fingerprints. The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house.

Pamplona's population of 200,000 swells to around two million during the festival, the largest in Spain. After each morning run, the animals are killed in an afternoon bullfight. Around 3,500 thrill-seekers compete in the most popular weekend runs with 2,000 taking part during the week.

His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister. I think the experience made us both content to elope. Who does not want mother to help plan a wedding?

Dave Holland (born 1 October 1946) is an English jazz double bassist, composer and bandleader who has been performing and recording for five decades. He has lived in the United States for over 40 years. His work ranges from pieces for solo performance to big band. Holland runs his own independent record label, Dare2, which he launched in 2005. During the 1990s, Holland renewed an affiliation, begun in the 1970s, with Joe Henderson, joining the tenor saxophonist on So Near (So Far), a tribute to Miles Davis, and Porgy & Bess. Holland also reunited with vocalist Betty Carter, touring and recording the live album Feed the Fire (1993). Fellow Davis alumnus Herbie Hancock invited Holland to tour with him in 1992, subsequently recording The New Standard. Holland joined Hancock's band again in 1996. He was also part of the sessions for River: The Joni Letters, winner of the 2008 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.  As a leader, Holland formed his third quartet and released Dream of the Elders (1995), which introduced the vibraphonist Steve Nelson to his ensembles. Holland formed a quintet that includes tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, trombonist Robin Eubanks and, a more recent addition, drummer Nate Smith. Their recordings include Points of View, Prime Directive, Not for Nothin, Extended Play: Live at Birdland and Critical Mass. In addition to releasing four quintet albums on ECM, Holland debuted his Big Band, which released What Goes Around in 2002. The album won Holland his first Grammy as a leader, in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category. The second Big Band recording, Overtime (2005), again won the Grammy in the Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album category; it was released on Holland's Dare2 label, which he formed that year.  In 2009, Holland was a co-founder of an all-star group called the Overtone Quartet. The group consisted of Holland on bass, Chris Potter on tenor saxophone, Jason Moran on piano, and Eric Harland on drums. The group toured extensively throughout the United States and Europe.

If \\"A man with brown hair talks on a microphone.\\", does it logically follow that \\"man talks on microphone\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"a man talks on a microphone\\" when given the statement \\"a man with brown hair talks on a microphone.\\" Let us break down the statement and analyze the logical components. The original statement contains three key pieces of information: 1. \\"A man\\" - This identifies the subject of the statement. It informs us that we are talking about a male human being, without specifying any further details about who he is. 2. \\"With brown hair\\" - This adds a descriptive element to the subject. It tells us that the man has brown hair. Although this additional information helps develop a visual image, it is not required to understand that a man is talking on a microphone. 3. \\"Talks on a microphone\\" - This specifies the action being performed by the subject. It tells us that the man is engaged in speaking into a microphone. From these components, we can derive the simplified statement, \\"a man talks on a microphone.\\" This statement removes unnecessary descriptive details (brown hair) while preserving the core message, which conveys that a man is talking on a microphone. The logical reasoning behind this simplification follows deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a type of logic that aims to build arguments based on premises that, if true, guarantee that the conclusion is also true. In this case, we have the statement, \\"A man with brown hair talks on a microphone,\\" which can be broken down into two premises: Premise 1: A man with brown hair is still a man. Premise 2: Talking on a microphone is the action being performed by the man. The conclusion, \\"a man talks on a microphone,\\" is logically derived from these premises. Since the premises are true, the conclusion must be true as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A: be mad at others  B: have a good time  C: avoid others The answer is:","output":"B: have a good time According to the context provided, Kai has put effort into getting Addison's friends together for a surprise party with a group of people from school. This implies that Kai is proactive and concerned with making Addison and their friends happy by organizing a fun event.

In this context, it is reasonable to assume that Kai's actions are motivated by the desire to have a good time by bringing their social circle together for a fun surprise. Therefore, option B: \\"have a good time\\" is the most suitable answer according to the context given. The other options do not align with the context provided: Option A: \\"be mad at others\\" would not make sense as the context does not provide any reason for Kai to be mad at others. On the contrary, Kai has made an effort to gather people together for a surprise party, indicating a motivation for ensuring everyone's enjoyment.

Would \\"An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The pendulum improved upon earlier clocks by providing a more accurate and consistent timekeeping mechanism. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, time was measured using devices like water clocks, hourglasses, and verge-and-foliot mechanisms, which were less accurate and susceptible to errors due to external factors like temperature and humidity. A pendulum clock uses the regular swinging motion of the pendulum as its timekeeping element, and the period of this motion remains constant regardless of the amplitude, making it a more precise measuring tool. As for your proposed answer, \\"An exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors\\" may not be a direct answer to the question of how the pendulum improved upon earlier clocks. This statement focuses on a visual representation of the pendulum's motion in terms of velocity and acceleration.

The statement appears to express confusion or ambiguity about the movie. While it is not explicitly negative, it does not shed a positive light on the movie either. If we were to interpret the sentence, we could infer a sense of uncertainty or lack of clarity about the plot, acting, direction, or themes within the movie. This could be an indication that the movie is complex, requiring more in-depth analysis, or perhaps poorly executed, leaving audiences baffled by the narrative and overall direction. On the other hand, it is also possible that the reviewer is expressing their personal confusion or struggle to understand the movie, rather than criticizing the movie itself. In this case, the review might not necessarily reflect the movie's merits or demerits. Instead, it could be more of a reflection of the reviewer's subjective experience and understanding.

Question: Information:  - The nave is the central aisle of a basilica church, or the main body of a church (whether aisled or not) between its western wall and its chancel. It is the zone of a church accessible by the laity.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - Minor basilica (in plural) is a title given to some Roman Catholic church buildings. According to canon law, no church building can be honoured with the title of basilica unless by apostolic grant or from immemorial custom. Presently, the authorising decree is granted by the Pope through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.  - The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando is a Roman Catholic diocese in Florida. It was established on June 18, 1968. Prior to that the Central Florida area was part of the Diocese of St. Augustine. Today the diocese encompasses nine counties including Orange, Osceola, Seminole, Marion, Lake, Volusia, Brevard, Polk, and Sumter, a total of about . William Borders, the first Bishop of the diocese, claimed in 1969 to Pope Paul VI that the then-active 1917 Code of Canon Law placed newly explored territory under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the port of departure, making the Diocese of Orlando responsible for the moon following the flight of Apollo 11. If true, the total area of the diocese would be , making it the largest Catholic diocese in existence. In 2010, the diocese contained 81 parishes, 10 missions, and 37 schools. St. James Cathedral serves as the seat of the diocese. Within the diocese are two minor basilicas, Mary, Queen of the Universe Shrine, a basilica which ministers to Catholic tourists, and St. Paul's in Daytona Beach.  - The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments is the congregation of the Roman Curia that handles most affairs relating to liturgical practices of the Latin Church as distinct from the Eastern Catholic Churches and also some technical matters relating to the Sacraments. Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V.  - A pastor is usually an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \\"Pr\\" (singular) or \\"Ps\\" (plural). A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation.  - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented.  - The Basilica of the National Shrine of Mary , Queen of the Universe is a Latin Rite basilica located in Orlando , Florida at 8300 Vineland Avenue . It was built to service the large number of Catholic tourists who visit the attractions in the Greater Orlando area . While it is a 2,000 seat church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando and provides Mass for the faithful , it has also become a regional tourist attraction . In 2009 , it was designated as the 63rd minor basilica in the United States . Since it is not a parish , no regular sacraments are performed , and no weekly bulletins are distributed . The Shrine consists of the main church , the Rosary Garden , the Mother & Child Outdoor Chapel , the Blessed Sacrament Chapel , the Shrine Museum , and a gift shop .  - The Latin word basilica (derived from Greek  , lit. \\"royal stoa\\", serving as the tribunal chamber of a king) has three distinct applications in modern English. The word was originally used to describe an ancient Roman public building where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. To a large extent these were the town halls of ancient Roman life. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the main forum. These buildings, an example of which is the Basilica Ulpia, were rectangular, and often had a central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides.  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - The word diocese is derived from the Greek term \\"\\" meaning \\"administration\\". When now used in an ecclesiastical sense, it refers to a territorial unit of administration. In the Western Church, the district is under the supervision of a bishop (who may have assistant bishops to help him or her) and is divided into parishes under the care of priests; but in the Eastern Church, the word denotes the area under the jurisdiction of a patriarch and the bishops under his jurisdiction administer parishes. This structure of church governance is known as episcopal polity.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'religion' with 'latin church'.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Objective: To make nutella runny and easier to work with, you can Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"Given that the objective is to make Nutella runny and easier to work with, we can analyze the different solutions in terms of their naive physics reasoning to determine which solution is more sound. Naive physics reasoning refers to the basic understanding and reasoning about the physical world that comes naturally to humans without any formal physics education. Solution 1: Heating Nutella One way to make Nutella runny is by heating it. When you heat Nutella, the temperature increases, and this causes the viscosity of the Nutella to decrease. The decrease in viscosity makes the Nutella flow more easily and become runnier. This is aligned with our naive understanding of the effect of heat on substances: when you heat a substance, especially fats or chocolate-based substances, they generally become less solid and more liquid-like. Therefore, using heat to make Nutella runny is a sound solution according to naive physics reasoning. Solution 2: Adding oil to Nutella Another possible solution is to add a small amount of oil, such as vegetable oil, to Nutella. When oil is mixed with Nutella, it changes the texture and consistency of the Nutella, making it smoother and more liquid. According to naive physics reasoning, mixing oil with other substances, especially those that are fat-based like Nutella, can help thin the mixture and make it easier to spread or work with. This can be observed in simple home cooking scenarios, where we often combine oil with other ingredients to create a smoother consistency. Thus, adding oil to Nutella can also be considered a sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. Conclusion: Both solutions, heating Nutella and adding oil to Nutella, are sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. They each address the problem of making Nutella runny and easier to work with, based on our common understanding of the physical world. However, it is important to note that the choice of the solution depends on the specific needs and context. For example, if you're looking to maintain Nutella's original flavor, heating it up might be the best option, as adding oil could potentially dilute its taste. On the other hand, if external conditions or equipment make it difficult to heat the Nutella effectively, adding oil could be a quicker and more practical solution. From the perspective of naive physics reasoning alone, both options are viable to achieve the objective of making Nutella runnier and easier to work with."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Francisco Pizarro was born in Trujillo, Caceres, Spain (then in the Crown of Castile) in modern-day Extremadura, Spain. He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446-1522) and Francisca Gonzalez, a woman of poor means. His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1474. Little attention was paid to his education and he grew up illiterate. On 10 November 1509, Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World with Alonso de Ojeda on an expedition to Uraba. He sailed to Cartagena and joined the fleet of Martin Fernandez de Enciso and, in 1513, accompanied Balboa to the Pacific. In 1514, he found a supporter in Pedro Arias Davila, the Governor of Castilla de Oro and was rewarded for his role in the arrest of Balboa with the positions of mayor and magistrate in Panama City, serving from 1519 to 1523.  Reports of Peru's riches and Cortes's success in Mexico tantalized Pizarro. He undertook two expeditions to conquer the Incan Empire in 1524 and in 1526. Both failed as a result of native hostilities, bad weather and lack of provisions.  Pedro de los Rios, the Governor of Panama, made an effort to recall Pizarro, but the conquistador resisted and remained in the south. In April 1528, he reached northern Peru and found the natives rich with precious metals. This discovery gave Pizarro the motivation to plan a third expedition to conquer the area. He returned to Panama to make arrangements, but the Governor refused to grant permission for the project. Pizarro returned to Spain to appeal directly to King Charles I. His plea was successful and he received not only a license for the proposed expedition, but also authority over any lands conquered during the venture. He was joined by family and friends and the expedition left Panama in 1530.  When hostile natives along the coast threatened the expedition, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. Atahualpa refused to tolerate a Spanish presence in his lands, but was captured by Pizarro during the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. A ransom for the emperor's release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him on 26 July 1533, overriding his associates who thought he was overstepping his authority. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of Cuzco and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, Pizarro founded the city of Lima, a project he considered his greatest achievement. Quarrels between Pizarro and his longtime comrade-in-arms Diego Almagro culminated in the Battle of Las Salinas. Almagro was captured and executed and, on 26 June 1541, his embittered son, Diego de Almagro \\"el mozo\\", assassinated Pizarro in Lima. The conquistador of Peru was laid to rest in the Lima Cathedral. How long did he stay there?","output":"The article does not provide a specific length for Francisco Pizarro's stay in the New World or in particular regions. However, we can deduce some information about the time he spent in certain areas. Pizarro began his journey to the New World in 1509 and remained there until his assassination in Lima in 1541. This means he was in the New World for approximately 32 years. Some notable milestones mentioned in the article include him serving as mayor and magistrate in Panama City from 1519 to 1523 and then founding the city of Lima in January 1535. Pizarro was assassinated in Lima on June 26, 1541, so he spent approximately 6.5 years there after its foundation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. Celtic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \\"Celtic\\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \\"Celtic art\\" only from the La Tene period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. The ancient peoples now called \\"Celts\\" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier Hallstatt culture and La Tene culture. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples. The extent to which \\"Celtic\\" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial.  Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.  The term \\"Celt\\" was used in classical times as a synonym for the Gauls (Keltoi, Celtae). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as Edward Lhuyd brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the Brythonic--and Goidelic--speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland. Then in the 18th century the interest in \\"primitivism\\", which led to the idea of the \\"noble savage\\", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and Druidic. The \\"Irish revival\\" came after the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the \\"Celtic Revival\\". Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article: 1. Artistic continuity: The fact that a case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age or even the Neolithic age shows that Celtic art has deep historical roots. 2. Celtic art in different periods: The distinction between early Celtic art (while the term \\"Celtic art\\" generally refers to the European Iron Age) and the La Tene period implies that the art form evolved over time. 3. Shared linguistic origin: The origin of Celts as a group of people who spoke a common language (Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic) highlights the importance of language in shaping cultural identity and artistic expression. 4. Debate over common genetic origin: The ongoing debate among scholars regarding the genetic origin of Celtic groups points at the complexity and diversity of Celtic cultures in Europe. 5. Connection between culture and genetics: The uncertainty surrounding the extent to which \\"Celtic\\" language, culture, and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods raises interesting questions about the formation of cultural identity in general. 6. The \\"Celtic Revival\\": The shift in attitude towards Celtic and Druidic art forms during the 18th and 19th century demonstrates the impact of historical and political events on the way we appreciate and rediscover cultural heritage.

Information:  - Friedrich Mandl ( 9 February 1900 -- 8 September 1977 ) was chairman of Hirtenberger Patronen - Fabrik , a leading Austrian armaments firm founded by his father , Alexander Mandl . A prominent fascist , Mandl was attached to the Austrofascism and Italian varieties and an opponent of Nazism . In the 1930s he became close to Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg , the commander of the Austrian nationalist militia ( \`\` Heimwehr '' ) , which he furnished with weapons and ammunition . From 1933 to 1937 , Mandl was married to Austrian actress Hedwig \`\` Hedy '' Kiesler , who would later become known as Hedy Lamarr in Hollywood . Both Hedy Lamarr 's parents were born Jewish , but her mother converted to Roman Catholicism and was a practicing Catholic . Hedy was brought up Catholic . It is understandable , considering the times that she lived in , that she kept her ethnicity a secret . The couple were rumored to have very intimate contacts with the very highest levels of the people controlling Germany . In her autobiography she indicates that she attended a convent school for girls . When she went to Hollywood her connections with very wealthy people were obviously helpful to her career . Her first \`\` serious '' film was Algiers for which she was highly acclaimed at the time . Mandl is rumoured to have attempted to bring a halt to her acting career in Germany and to purchase all copies of her infamous film Ecstasy ( 1933 ) , in which she appeared nude . Following incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany with the Anschluss of 1938 , Mandl 's remaining property which had not yet been transferred to Swiss ownership was seized , since he had supported the separatist Austrofascism and his father was Jewish . Despite Mandl 's part Jewish heritage , his then - wife Lamarr wrote in her autobiography Ecstasy and Me , that both Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and German dictator Adolf Hitler attended Mandl 's parties . Lamarr described Mandl as extremely controlling , and wrote that she escaped only by disguising herself as a...  - Freikorps (\\"Free Corps\\") were German volunteer units that existed from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the members of which effectively fought as mercenaries, regardless of their own nationality. In German-speaking countries the first so-called \\"Freikorps\\" \\"free regiments\\" were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades and deserters, and criminals. These sometimes exotically equipped units served as infantry and cavalry or, more rarely, as artillery. Sometimes in just company strength, sometimes in formations up to several thousand strong, there were also various mixed formations or legions. The Prussian \\"von Kleist Freikorps\\" included infantry, jäger, dragoons and hussars. The French Volontaires de Saxe combined uhlans and dragoons.  - Engelbert Dollfuss (; October 4, 1892  July 25, 1934) was an Austrian Christian Social and Patriotic Front statesman. Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, he shut down parliament, banned the Austrian Nazi party and assumed dictatorial powers. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934, he cemented the rule of austrofascism through the authoritarian \\"First of May Constitution\\". Dollfuss was assassinated as part of a failed coup attempt by Nazi agents in 1934. His successor Kurt Schuschnigg maintained the regime until Adolf Hitlers annexation of Austria in 1938.  - Kurt Alois Josef Johann Schuschnigg (14 December 1897  18 November 1977) was Chancellor of the Federal State of Austria from the 1934 assassination of his predecessor Engelbert Dollfuss until the 1938 \\"Anschluss\\" with Nazi Germany. He was opposed to Hitler's ambitions to absorb Austria into the Third Reich.  - Austrofascism was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934, which ceased with the annexation of the newly founded Federal State of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (\\"Vaterländische Front\\") and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss's assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement.  - A paramilitary is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not included as part of a state's formal armed forces.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Hirtenberg is a town of approx. 2,500 inhabitants near Baden bei Wien in Lower Austria, Austria. The river Triesting is located at the south border of the town. Coming from the Vienna Woods, the valley of Triesting joins the Vienna Basin here.  - The Heimwehr (\\"Home Guard\\") or sometimes Heimatschutz (\\"Homeland Protection\\") were a nationalist, initially paramilitary group operating within Austria during the 1920s and 1930s; they were similar in methods, organisation, and ideology to Germany's Freikorps. Although opposed to parliamentary democracy, the Heimwehr maintained a political wing known as the Heimatblock, which cooperated with Engelbert Dollfuss' conservative government. In 1936, the Heimwehr was absorbed into the Fatherland Front by decree of Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg and replaced by a militia supposedly less inclined towards uproar against the regime, the \\"Frontmiliz\\".

Throughout the film, Annie struggles with her personal and financial problems, which are further complicated by the presence of Lillian's new friend and fellow bridesmaid, Helen (played by Rose Byrne). Helen is rich, successful, and seemingly perfect, leading to a rivalry between her and Annie for Lillian's attention and affection. As the preparations for the wedding progress, Helen starts to assume control over the planning of various events, including the bridal shower. This ultimately leads to Annie being sidelined and feeling increasingly frustrated. The bridal shower organized by Helen is an elaborate, over-the-top event that reflects her wealthy lifestyle, further driving a wedge between Annie and Lillian. During the bridal shower, Annie's emotions boil over and she throws a fit, destroying some of the decorations and creating a scene in front of all the guests, including Lillian. This incident results in a falling-out between Annie and Lillian, as well as Annie's removal as the maid of honor.

In Q1 2017, IDC reported that Samsung was first placed, with 80 million units, followed by Apple with 50.8 million, Huawei with 34.6 million, Oppo with 25.5 million and Vivo with 22.7 million.

Samsung and Apple are the dominant brands, capturing the largest portions of the worldwide footprint. But trends have waxed and waned, with differing success for these two industry giants, while other companies, such as Huawei, LG, Lenovo, Oppo, and Vivo, have individually captured smaller, yet not insignificant, slices of the market. Samsung commanded the highest shipment market share worldwide in 2011, a position it consistently held over the next few years. In 2012, its market share stood at 30.3%, rising slightly to 31.3% in 2013. There was a slight drop to a 31% share in Q1 2014, but by Q2 2016 it fell to 22.3%. Despite these fluctuations, Samsung remained a market leader, and in Q1 2017, it led the pack with 80 million units shipped. On the other hand, Apple saw both growth and decline during this period. Having a 15.3% market share in 2013, it lost ground from its 18.7% share in 2012. Despite this, its shipment volume still increased by 12.9%, demonstrating the iPhone's continuing popularity. In Q1 2014, Apple held a share of 16%, but by Q4 2014, its piece of the pie grew to 20.4%, outperforming Samsung's 19.9% share for that quarter. However, by Q2 2016, Apple saw another dip, now holding 12.9% of the market. By Q1 2017, though second to Samsung, Apple still managed to ship 50.8 million units. Huawei, LG, and Lenovo each maintained roughly 5% market share and showed noticeable improvement over their 2012 figures. In terms of shipment volumes, these companies experienced substantial growth between 36% to 92%. In Q1 2017, Huawei shipped 34.6 million units, making it the third largest player at that time. Newer entrants, Oppo and Vivo had also begun to make their mark by Q1 2017. Oppo shipped 25.5 million and Vivo 22.7 million units respectively, numbers that were significant and likely reflected their growing footprint in the global smartphone arena. Overall, the detailed information outlines the dynamic and competitive nature of the smartphone industry, with Samsung and Apple leading the pack, while other players such as Huawei, LG, Lenovo, Oppo, and Vivo increase their presence. This data suggests that while market shares can fluctuate, the shipment volumes, particularly those of Apple, can still demonstrate growth. This shows that even when market share decreases, it does not necessarily correlate to a decrease in consumer demand or overall success. The market is continually evolving with new players making significant strides in their shipment volumes, signaling a robust and competitive industry landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[B]. dangerous bugs. [C]. protein. [D]. fat.","output":"Illness is prevented in people by reducing [B]. dangerous bugs in food. Bacteria are a form of dangerous bugs that can contaminate food and cause illness in people. Reducing the presence of harmful bacteria in food is critical to ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals who consume it. Many foodborne illnesses are caused by the consumption of contaminated food, which may harbor pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, or toxins produced by these microorganisms. There are several methods to reduce dangerous bugs in food, including proper food handling, storage, and preparation techniques. Here are some key strategies for minimizing the risk of foodborne illness: 1. Maintain proper hygiene: Washing hands before handling food, using clean utensils and cutting boards, and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods can significantly reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. 2. Cook food thoroughly: Cooking food at the appropriate temperatures can help eliminate harmful bacteria and other dangerous bugs. The recommended minimum internal temperature for various types of food include: - 165°F (74°C) for poultry and leftovers - 160°F (71°C) for ground meats and egg dishes - 145°F (63°C) for whole cuts of beef, pork, veal, and lamb - 145°F (63°C) for fish 3. Store food correctly: Proper food storage can also prevent the growth of dangerous bugs. Perishable food should be refrigerated or frozen within 2 hours of being cooked or purchased. Keep the refrigerator temperature at 40°F (4°C) or below and the freezer temperature at 0°F (-18°C) or below. 4. Handle raw ingredients carefully: Avoid cross-contamination by keeping raw meats, poultry, and seafood separate from ready-to-eat foods. Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw and cooked foods. 5. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly: Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running water before consuming, cutting, or cooking them to remove any surface bacteria or other contaminants. 6. Be cautious with high-risk foods: Foods such as raw eggs, unpasteurized milk, and raw shellfish can carry higher risks of bacterial contamination. Only consume these products if they have been properly handled and prepared. By following these food safety practices and reducing the presence of dangerous bugs in food, the risk of illness in people can be significantly minimized, promoting overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Lost Kafka writings resurface, trapped in trial      JERUSALEM — It seems almost Kafkaesque: Ten safety deposit boxes of never-published writings by Franz Kafka, their exact contents unknown, are trapped in courts and bureaucracy, much like one of the nightmarish visions created by the author himself.      The papers, retrieved from bank vaults where they have sat untouched and unread for decades, could shed new light on one of literature's darkest figures.      In the past week, the pages have been pulled from safety deposit boxes in Tel Aviv and Zurich, Switzerland, on the order of an Israeli court over the objections of two elderly women who claim to have inherited them from their mother.      \\"Kafka could easily have written a story like this, where you try to do something and it all goes wrong and everything remains unresolved,\\" said Sara Loeb, a Tel Aviv-based author of two books about the writer. \\"It's really a case of life imitating art.\\"      Literary experts in both cities are sifting through the boxes, and the contents are expected to be of priceless literary and monetary value. What exactly is there remains unknown, but the papers include handwritten manuscripts, letters and various literary works by the famed Jewish writer, said Meir Heller, an attorney for the Israeli National Library, which also claims ownership of the trove.      Loeb says the cache could include endings to some of Kafka's major works, many of which remained unfinished in his lifetime.      \\"We could find out about his methods, his style, how his art was created, how he built a text,\\" she said.      Kafka, a Prague native who wrote in German, was one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, known for his surreal tales of everyman protagonists crushed by mysterious authorities or twisted by unknown shames. His works have become classics, like \\"The Metamorphosis,\\" in which a salesman wakes up transformed into a giant insect, and \\"The Trial,\\" where a bank clerk is put through an excruciating trial without ever being told the charges against him.      But the newly emerged writings won't see the light of day until the Israeli court unravels the tangled question of the collection's rightful owner.      The case boils down to the interpretation of the will of Max Brod, Kafka's longtime friend and publisher. Kafka bequeathed his writings to Brod shortly before his own death from tuberculosis in 1924, instructing his friend to burn everything unread.      Brod ignored Kafka's wishes and published most of what was in his possession, including the novels \\"The Trial,\\" \\"The Castle\\" and \\"Amerika.\\"      But Brod, who smuggled some of the manuscripts to pre-state Israel when he fled the Nazis in 1938, didn't publish everything. Upon his death in 1968, Brod left his personal secretary, Esther Hoffe, in charge of his literary estate and instructed her to transfer the Kafka papers to an academic institution.      Instead, for the next four decades, Hoffe kept the papers in her Tel Aviv apartment and in safety deposit boxes in Tel Aviv and Zurich banks.      She sold some of the items for hefty sums. In 1988, for instance, Hoffe auctioned off the original manuscript of \\"The Trial\\" at Sotheby's in London. It went for 1.8 million to the German Literature Archive in Marbach, north of Stuttgart.      When Hoffe died three years ago at age 101, she left the collection to her two daughters, Eva Hoffe and Ruth Wiesler, both Holocaust survivors like herself.      But the Israeli National Library has long claimed the papers, saying Brod intended for the collection to end up in its hands. It filed an injunction against the execution of Hoffe's will.      \\"As long as Esther Hoffe was alive, she was responsible, she could still say, 'I am handling it,'\\" said Heller, the library's lawyer. \\"The late Mrs. Hoffe did not do what the late Mr. Brod asked her to do and deposit the documents in the national library. ... The will was not honored, it was desecrated.\\"      Oded Hacohen, a lawyer for Eva Hoffe, said Brod's will gave the collection to her mother as a gift and gave her the right to bequeath it to the Israel National Museum or any institution of her choosing, in Israel or abroad, under whatever conditions she decides. He cited a 1974 Tel Aviv District Court ruling backing that interpretation and quoting Brod's will.      That means, he said, Eva Hoffe inherited the documents legally and is free to do with them as she pleases, including selling them to the German Literature Archive, which has been negotiating with her to buy the remaining Kafka and Brod papers.      \\"Esther Hoffe dedicated her life to publishing Brod's works. ... Brod wrote in his will that her family should enjoy the profits,\\" Hacohen said.      Heller retorts that the will only refers to royalties, not ownership, and didn't give Esther Hoffe the right to hand the collection to her heirs. He argued in court that since she failed to pick an archive to receive the documents, the court should do so. Heller contended in court that the Israeli National Library was Brod's first preference, saying he had evidence Brod wrote a later will bequeathing his literary estate directly to it.      The Tel Aviv Family Court ordered the collection opened a year ago, saying it wants to know what is there before deciding who owns it. That ruling won't come until experts are done inspecting the papers, which could take several weeks.      \\"The library does not intend to give up the cultural assets that legally belong to it and thus to the Israeli and Jewish people,\\" said David Blumberg, chairman of the Israel National Library, which is a nonprofit and non-governmental body.      Ulrich von Buelow, the director of manuscripts at the German Literary Archive, said Brod and Esther Hoffe had frequent discussions with the archive over placing the material there.      \\"We are interested in having the manuscripts because we have so many others, also from Brod, and so many letters that would complement them,\\" von Buelow said.      Whatever they contain, the piles of handwritten material will keep historians and researchers busy for years, Heller said.      Aside from previously unknown versions of Kafka's work, the trove could give more insight on Kafka's personal life, including his relationship with his lover, Dora Diamant. It may include papers that Kafka gave to Diamant but were stolen by the German Gestapo from her Berlin apartment in 1933, later obtained by Brod after World War II.      Loeb suspected that Brod kept many of the documents away from the public for fear their publication could compromise his friend's legacy.      \\"Kafka was very critical. He was not an easy man,\\" she said. \\"Maybe Brod was worried that this could ruin his image.\\"      Associated Press writers Melissa Eddy in Berlin and Bradley Klapper in Geneva contributed to this report.

The discovery emerged as an Israeli court rejected an application to keep secret the contents of a vast collection of Kafka's writings that has been buried in the vaults of three banks in Israel and Switzerland for over 40 years.      The news will cause enormous excitement in the literary world. Although his longer novel The Trial gave the world the adjective Kafkaesque, it is his short stories that are perhaps best known to the reading public. His most memorable short story was probably The Metamorphosis, whose unfortunate hero, Gregor Samsa, wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into \\"a monstrous insect\\".      The ruling came after a group of lawyers and scholars, acting on the instructions of Israel's supreme court, began opening some of the 10 safety deposit boxes containing the collection last week.      There had been fears that the archive, which is also believed to contain letters, diaries and drawings, would remain hidden from wider view after two sisters who claim ownership of the collection filed an injunction to keep its contents secret.      Eva Hoffe and Ruth Wiesler, both in their seventies, have been at the centre of a legal wrangle over the Kafka papers since they inherited the collection two years ago from their mother Ester, who was the secretary of Kafka's great friend, Max Brod.      Ester Hoffe kept the contents of the papers secret since she came into possession of them in 1968.      Talia Pardo, a judge in the Tel Aviv district court, rejected the secrecy application made by the two sisters and ordered them to pay costs.      The court is now expected to rule on the legitimacy of their inheritance.      Israel's state-owned national library has insisted that it should be granted custodianship of the papers on the grounds that they represent an important piece of Jewish heritage.      Kafka died of tuberculosis in 1924. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is as follows: Ten safety deposit boxes containing unpublished writings by Franz Kafka have resurfaced, having been untouched and unread for decades. The exact contents of these boxes are unknown, but experts believe they may contain valuable literary works and provide new insights into one of literature's most enigmatic figures. The documents were retrieved from bank vaults in Tel Aviv and Zurich, Switzerland, on the order of an Israeli court, over the objections of two elderly women who claim to have inherited the writings from their mother. The contents of these boxes could include handwritten manuscripts, letters, and other literary works by Kafka. However, the documents will not be released to the public until the Israeli court resolves the ownership dispute involving the Israeli National Library and the two sisters who claim to have inherited the collection. The outcome of this case could potentially reveal unknown works by Kafka, give insight into his personal life, and unlock new interpretations of his writing style and methods."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Page Joseph Falkinburg, the eldest of three children, was born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, the son of Sylvia (nee Seigel) and Page Falkinburg Sr. Falkinburg was raised by his father during his early years, after his parents divorced. The name \\"Dallas\\" came from his love of the Dallas Cowboys. His brother, Rory, and sister, Sally, were raised by their maternal grandmother. Context: Page developed a yoga fitness program initially called Yoga for Regular Guys Workout or YRG after recovering from ruptures to his L4/L5 discs in 1998 and discovering the health benefits of yoga through his former wife, Kimberly. His favorite kind of yoga (according to his \\"Yoga for Regular Guys\\" book published in 2005) is \\"Power Yoga,\\" an American-style version of \\"Ashtanga Style\\" yoga. Page worked with Doctor of Chiropractic Dr. Craig Aaron, the \\"Yoga-Doc\\" and developed the Yoga for Regular Guys Workout.  Page developed the book into a series of workout videos titled DDP YOGA (formerly YRG). DDP Yoga was featured in a video about Arthur Boorman in May 2012. The story was picked up by the mainstream media, including Good Morning America. The video describes the journey of Arthur Boorman, a disabled war veteran who was told by doctors he would never walk again. After 15 years on crutches, Boorman lost 140 pounds in 10 months and regained the ability to walk and run without his crutches, back braces or leg braces.  On February 21, 2014, Page appeared on the ABC series Shark Tank, where he was seeking 200,200 for a 5% share in the company. He declined to sell a 50% share for that same amount. He had hoped to use the money to develop a mobile app. The investors believed the company's profits (800,000 in the previous year) would fall. Page later said he sold more than 1 million worth of product in the first six days after his appearance. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article. The answer lies in numerous facets of Page Joseph Falkinburg's life and his development of DDP Yoga. Key aspects include: 1. Page's early life and background: Born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, Page was raised by his father after his parents divorced. His love for the Dallas Cowboys led to his nickname \\"Dallas.\\" Understanding Page's upbringing and family background offers insight into his determination and resilience, which later played a crucial role in the development of DDP Yoga. 2. Injury and recovery: Page suffered from ruptured L4/L5 discs in 1998. This challenging situation not only served as a turning point in his life but also laid the foundation for DDP Yoga. It was during this time that Page discovered the health benefits of yoga through his then-wife, Kimberly, and American-style \\"Power Yoga.\\" 3. Collaboration with Dr. Craig Aaron: Page worked closely with Dr. Craig Aaron, also known as the \\"Yoga-Doc,\\" to develop the Yoga for Regular Guys Workout. This collaboration highlights the significance of professional guidance and expertise in creating an effective and accessible fitness program. 4. Transformation of YRG to DDP Yoga: Page initially began with the Yoga for Regular Guys Workout, which later evolved into a series of workout videos under the name DDP Yoga. This transformation demonstrates Page's dedication to refining his program to reach a wider audience. 5. Arthur Boorman's story: The success of DDP Yoga was underscored by the inspiring story of Arthur Boorman, a disabled war veteran who lost 140 pounds and regained his mobility using DDP Yoga. The mainstream media coverage generated by Boorman's story raised awareness of the program's potential to change lives. 6. Shark Tank appearance: Page's appearance on the ABC series Shark Tank illustrates his tenacity and belief in his product, as he declined offers for a 50% share in his company. This decision proved to be profitable, as he went on to sell over 1 million worth of DDP Yoga products in the first six days after his appearance on the show. These captivating aspects of the article shed light on Page Joseph Falkinburg's dedication to developing DDP Yoga, the impact it has had on numerous people's lives, and the role of determination and resilience in bringing about significant changes in one's life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Officials said they had lied when they applied for tourist visas and would not be allowed to work in Guatemala. The Dutch group, Women on Waves, offers free abortion services to women in countries where the procedure is banned. It takes women in the early stages of pregnancy out to international waters, where the abortion is performed. Abortion is only allowed in Guatemala when the mother's life is at risk. A spokeswoman for Women on Waves confirmed that they had been told to leave the country immediately, but she said its lawyers had appealed against the decision. La Prensa Libre newspaper said the four crew members being expelled were US citizens. It is not clear if other members of the group have also been ordered to leave the country. The Army said on Thursday it had been instructed by President Jimmy Morales to act, and would defend \\"human life and the laws of our country\\" by preventing the group from carrying out abortions. The Women on Waves' boat docked on the Pacific Ocean port of Quetzal, in the city of San Jose, on Wednesday. The group says it had a legal permit to sail in Guatemalan waters and the boat was being illegally \\"detained\\" by the authorities. The group says more than 60,000 illegal abortions are performed in Guatemala every year, and most of the women who put their lives at risk at the hands of untrained professionals are poor. \\"We respect religious beliefs but this [abortion] is a fundamental right in a democracy,\\" spokeswoman Leticia Zevich told La Hora Newspaper. However, Guatemala's Catholic Church, other religious leaders and politicians protested against the presence of the boat. In most Latin American countries, abortion is either illegal or only allowed to save the life of the woman.

Bruno Latour (French: [latuR]; born 22 June 1947) is a French philosopher, anthropologist and sociologist. He is especially known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS). After teaching at the Ecole des Mines de Paris (Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation) from 1982 to 2006, he became Professor at Sciences Po Paris (2006-2017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017. After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists. Latour rose in importance following the 1979 publication of Laboratory Life: the Social Construction of Scientific Facts with co-author Steve Woolgar. In the book, the authors undertake an ethnographic study of a neuroendocrinology research laboratory at the Salk Institute. This early work argued that naive descriptions of the scientific method, in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.  In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.  Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences. Drawing on the work of Gaston Bachelard, they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are socially constructed within the laboratory--that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them. They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices-- in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society is one of the key texts of the sociology of scientific knowledge in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: \\"Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor.\\"  Some of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed. Similarly, philosopher John Searle argues that Latour's \\"extreme social constructivist\\" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently \\"comical results.\\"","output":"This text is about Bruno Latour, a French philosopher, anthropologist, and sociologist known for his work in the field of science and technology studies (STS)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\".

Write a title for this article: NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) -- U.S. Rep. William Jefferson easily defeated his fellow Democratic opponent in a runoff election Saturday, despite an ongoing federal bribery investigation. In complete but unofficial returns, Jefferson, Louisiana's first black congressman since Reconstruction, received 57 percent of the vote over state Rep. Karen Carter, who had 43 percent. Carter was unable to capitalize on a scandal that included allegations the FBI found 90,000 in bribe money in Jefferson's freezer. In a concession speech, Carter embraced family members and pledged to work with Jefferson, especially on the area's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. \\"I guess the people are happy with the status-quo,\\" she said. Jefferson was forced into the runoff against Carter when he failed to win 50 percent of the vote in a crowded open multiparty primary. Carter had sought to become the first black woman from Louisiana elected to Congress. He described his win as \\"a great moment, and I thank almighty God for making it possible.\\" He called for regional unity to focus on the hurricane recovery and in bringing back evacuees who are still scattered across the country. His presence in Washington could be embarrassing for Democrats, who won control of Congress on a platform of cleaning up corruption. In June, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, led a successful effort to remove Jefferson from the powerful House Ways and Means Committee as the probe unfolded. He was accused of taking bribes from a company seeking lucrative contracts in the Nigerian telecommunications market. He has not been charged with any crime and denies any wrongdoing. The scandal turned the race into a debate largely divided along racial lines, an age-old dynamic in this city that has intensified since Hurricane Katrina displaced large numbers of blacks and upended their demographic and political dominance. Whites, who overwhelmingly voted for Carter in the primary and have been her most enthusiastic financial backers, believed a Jefferson win would confirm this city's image as corrupt and untrustworthy as it asks the nation to fund its recovery from Katrina. City Councilman Oliver Thomas said Jefferson's success would make the recovery more difficult. \\"People are watching this election all around the country, and I can only imagine what they are thinking,\\" Thomas said. \\"It will be very difficult to go back to them and ask them to trust us with the money we need here.\\" Carter's campaign spokesman and father, Ken Carter, said he felt they had done all they could to compete against Jefferson, but regretted the tone of the campaign in the final stages. \\"Race is all too often a factor in campaigns in New Orleans,\\" Ken Carter said. \\"Here we had a candidate that tried to paint this young African-American woman as a pawn of the white establishment.\\" One white voter, George Christen, a registered independent, cast his ballot in a predominantly white precinct in the Algiers neighborhood, just across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter. \\"I just didn't want Jefferson in. Period,\\" said Christen, 42. \\"Jefferson is an embarrassment. He needs to be out.\\" Jefferson did get a vote from Jene Allen, who is black. \\"He started the job. Let him finish it,\\" said Allen, who wouldn't give her age. \\"I know Karen Carter would be the first black woman, but I think she played it dirty, too dirty.\\" Jefferson drew widespread support among blacks who are skeptical of the federal government's motives in its investigation of him. He repeatedly suggested the probe is groundless because he has yet to be indicted more than a year after the FBI raided his home in New Orleans. Carter, 37, raised nearly five times as much money as Jefferson, but she was largely outflanked in the endorsement game. Jefferson picked up the backing of Mayor Ray Nagin and other prominent black politicians. The endorsements spoke to Jefferson's solid footing in New Orleans politics. He arrived here in the 1970s as a Harvard-educated lawyer from rural north Louisiana, the sixth of 10 children brought up in a three-room country home. By 1980, he represented New Orleans in the state Senate. At 42, he became the first black from Louisiana in the House since Reconstruction. The law firm Jefferson founded became the largest black-owned practice in the South. He created a political organization, the Progressive Democrats, which fielded candidates for the school board, assessors' races, state House seats and mayoral contests. Before the bribery scandal erupted, Jefferson had climbed to the pinnacle of the Democratic Party. He was a confidant of former President Bill Clinton and held a seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Copyright 2006 The Associated Press.

Fact 2: Air pollution is caused by the build-up of harmful gases and particles in the air.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does a gas mask keep out?\\" with the following options:  - disease  - The atmosphere  - heat energy  - air pollution  - energy barrier  - Bodily water  - Dehydration  - bacteria The answer is:","output":"Air pollution. A breathing mask, or more commonly known as a gas mask, is designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful airborne substances. It functions by filtering the surrounding air, providing a barrier to prevent the entry of dangerous particles and gases into the wearer's respiratory system. Given the two facts provided, we can analyze how a gas mask works to keep a person safe from these hazards. Fact 1: A breathing mask is used for keeping harmful particles from entering the respiratory system. This statement highlights the primary function of a gas mask, which is to act as a filter for inhaled air. It achieves this through a combination of physical barriers and specialized filter materials, preventing the penetration of hazardous particles such as dust, smoke, and airborne pathogens. Fact 2: Air pollution is caused by the build-up of harmful gases and particles in the air. Many of these harmful substances are generated through human activities, such as exhaust emissions from vehicles, industrial processes, and the burning of fossil fuels. In addition, natural events like volcanic eruptions and forest fires can also cause the release of hazardous particles and gases. Given these two facts, it is clear that a gas mask's primary purpose is to keep air pollution out, specifically by filtering harmful particles and gases from the air that can pose a risk to human health. Now let's examine the other options provided: 1. Disease: While a gas mask can help reduce exposure to airborne pathogens, it is not specifically designed to keep out diseases. Its primary function is to filter out harmful particles and gases, which can indirectly help reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with air pollution. 2. The atmosphere: The atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding the Earth, and a gas mask cannot keep out the entire atmosphere. It is designed to filter out specific harmful particles and gases from the air, not block out the entire atmosphere. 3. Heat energy: A gas mask is not intended to provide protection against elevated temperatures or heat energy. Specialized equipment, such as heat-resistant clothing and protective gear, are necessary for safeguarding against heat exposure. 4. Energy barrier: Gas masks are not designed to create or interact with energy barriers, which are typically the realm of science fiction. 5. Bodily water: Gas masks are designed to protect the respiratory system, and they have no function related to bodily water regulation or filtration. 6. Dehydration: Gas masks do not address dehydration issues, as they are strictly focused on filtering air pollutants. 7. Bacteria: Although some gas mask filters can help block out specific types of airborne bacteria, their primary purpose is to protect against air pollution. Gas masks are not designed specifically to keep bacteria out but can have a secondary benefit of reducing exposure to some forms of bacteria found in polluted air. In conclusion, based on the facts provided and subsequent analysis, a gas mask is designed to keep out air pollution by filtering harmful particles and gases from the air. While some secondary benefits can include reducing exposure to certain types of bacteria and airborne pathogens, the main function of a gas mask remains air pollution protection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No clear morphological features characterize all of the Cyatheales, but DNA sequence data indicate the order is monophyletic. Some species in the Cyatheales have tree-like growth forms, but others have rhizomes.   - The Cyatheaceae are the scaly tree fern family and include the world 's tallest tree ferns , which reach heights up to 20 m. They are also very ancient plants , appearing in the fossil record in the late Jurassic , though the modern genera likely appeared in the Cenozoic . Cyatheaceae are the largest family of tree ferns , including about 500 species . Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae , together with Metaxyaceae and Cibotiaceae , are a monophyletic group and constitute the \`\` core tree ferns '' . Cyatheaceae are leptosporangiate ferns , the most familiar group of monilophytes . The Cyatheaceae usually have a single , erect trunk - like rhizome ( stem ) . Their fronds ( leaves ) are also very large , some of the largest in the plant kingdom . Some species have fronds reaching 3 -- 4 m in length , and have a final crown width of some 6 m. The fronds are circinate before unfolding and usually pinnately or bipinnately compound , with deeply pinnately lobed leaflets . The large leaves are covered in scales and hairs , and bear sori ( spore clusters ) on their undersides . The sori are often covered by a flap of tissue called an indusium , a useful characteristic for classifying the Cyatheaceae . Some indusia are cup - shaped ( cyatheoid ) , while others are hood - shaped ( hemitelioid ) , enclose the sorus ( sphaeropteroid ) , or scaly . Like most ferns , members of the Cyatheaceae are homosporous . Cyatheaceae are found in both New and Old World tropical wet montane forests and cloud forests , with some species extending into south - temperate regions . Most Cyatheaceae are terrestrial , with one sometimes being epiphytic and others having a creeping habit , but these are exceptions to the family norm . Cyatheaceae can be distinguished from arborescent Dicksonia by the presence of scales , the position of the sori , and the morphology of sporangia and spores . In the Cyatheaceae , the sori occur away from the margins of the pinnules , and are elongate or rounded . Since the exact number of species is not known ,...  - Cyathea is a genus of tree ferns, the type genus of the fern order Cyatheales.   - The Cenozoic Era (also Cænozoic, Caenozoic or Cainozoic ; meaning \\"new life\\", from Greek \\"kainos\\" \\"new\\", and \\"zoe\\" \\"life\\") is the current and most recent of the three Phanerozoic geological eras, following the Mesozoic Era and covering the period from 66 million years ago to present day.  - A fern is a member of a group of about 10,560 known extant species of vascular plants that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers. They differ from mosses by being vascular, i.e., having certain tissue that conducts water and nutrients. They have branched stems and leaves like other vascular plants. These are \\"megaphylls\\", which are more complex than the simple \\"microphylls\\" of clubmosses. Most ferns are Leptosporangiate ferns, sometimes denominated the \\"true ferns\\": they produce what are called \\"fiddleheads\\" that uncoil and expand into fronds.  - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.  - The Late Jurassic is the third epoch of the Jurassic period, and it spans the geologic time from 161.2 ± 4.0 to 145.5 ± 4.0 million years ago (Ma), which is preserved in Upper Jurassic strata. In European lithostratigraphy, the name \\"malm\\" indicates rocks of Late Jurassic age. In the past, this name was also used to indicate the unit of geological time, but this usage is now discouraged to make a clear distinction between lithostratigraphic and geochronologic/chronostratigraphic units.  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.

I chose a gun instead of a knife for defense in the fight because the","output":"gun presented several advantages that I believed would increase my chances of success during the altercation. The decision to opt for a firearm in this situation, despite the potential drawbacks and broader consequences, was based on a thorough evaluation of the pros and cons. First and foremost, a gun offers a significant range advantage compared to a knife. In a high-stress, life-or-death scenario, maintaining distance from a potential attacker is a crucial aspect of self-preservation. A firearm allows me to engage threats from both short and long distances, providing me with an opportunity to protect myself and others around me while minimizing the risk of harm. On the other hand, using a knife would require close-quarters combat, which significantly increases the likelihood of injury to either party involved. Secondly, a gun often has an intimidation factor that a knife lacks. The mere sight of a firearm can deter an attacker, preventing an incident from escalating further. Additionally, the loud noise produced by a gunshot can draw attention and potentially dissuade an assailant from continuing their attack. A knife, while still potentially deadly, doesn't have quite the same impact on an aggressor's mindset. The stopping power of a gun is another critical advantage. In many cases, a single shot can incapacitate an assailant, allowing for a quick resolution to a dangerous situation. This is particularly important when considering multiple potential attackers, as the ability to neutralize one threat rapidly can give me time to address other threats. In contrast, a knife not only requires more physical strength and skill to be effective but also may not immediately disable an attacker, prolonging the confrontation and increasing the risk of injury to myself and others. Furthermore, the versatility of a gun also played a significant role in my decision. Depending on the type of firearm, I could choose between different ammunition types, allowing for non-lethal options such as rubber bullets or bean bag rounds. This flexibility gives me the ability to respond appropriately to varying threat levels and make split-second decisions that can help prevent unnecessary loss of life. In conclusion, although both the gun and knife have their merits in a self-defense scenario, the gun ultimately offers a superior combination of range, stopping power, intimidation factor, and versatility. I recognize that carrying a firearm entails a substantial responsibility and potential consequences, from lethal results to legal ramifications. Nonetheless, in a life-threatening situation, the careful and considered use of a gun can significantly improve the odds of survival for myself and others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Temperatures there tend to be mild. Its not too hot and not too cold. You might expect places near the equator to be hot and wet. Thats not always the case. Sometimes there are other factors at work. These factors can affect the local climate type or a region. Oceans and mountain ranges can have a major impact. They can greatly influence the climate of an area.

Symbiosis played a major role in the co-evolution of flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them. Many plants that are pollinated by insects, bats, or birds have highly specialized flowers modified to promote pollination by a specific pollinator that is also correspondingly adapted. The first flowering plants in the fossil record had relatively simple flowers. Adaptive speciation quickly gave rise to many diverse groups of plants, and, at the same time, corresponding speciation occurred in certain insect groups. Some groups of plants developed nectar and large sticky pollen, while insects evolved more specialized morphologies to access and collect these rich food sources. In some taxa of plants and insects the relationship has become dependent, where the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of insect. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What animals need to be modified in order to be correspondingly adapted?","output":"To answer your question, the animals that need to be modified in order to be correspondingly adapted to specific plants are typically insects, bats, and birds, as these are the primary pollinators. The modifications in these animals would be dependent on the specific plant species they need to pollinate and the characteristics of the plant's flower. Adaptations can include changes in morphology, behavior, or sensory capabilities to access, collect, and transfer pollen more effectively. For example, bees are known to have evolved specialized pollen-carrying structures and proboscises adapted to access nectar in flowers. In some cases, flowers have coevolved with specific pollinating animals to such an extent that the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of animal. For these specialized relationships to occur, both the plant and the specific pollinator need to evolve in a way that their adaptations complement each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's review the information provided in the paragraph and consider the factors that may contribute to the risk of skin cancer.   1. Identify key factors: In this case, we are looking at tanning methods to determine the risk of skin cancer. 2. Compare the tanning methods for patients E and F: Patient E tans using tanning lamps, while Patient F tans in the sun. Now that we have identified the methods used by patient E and patient F to tan, let's evaluate the risk for both patients: 3. Research the risks associated with tanning lamps: Tanning lamps emit UVA and UVB radiation that has been linked to an increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. The use of tanning lamps is not considered safe and can significantly contribute to the overall risk of developing skin cancer. 4. Research the risks associated with sun tanning: Sun tanning also exposes the skin to UVA and UVB rays that increase the risk of skin cancer. However, this risk can be mitigated by using protective measures like sunscreen and limiting sun exposure during peak hours. Based on the information given, it seems that both methods of tanning increase the risk of skin cancer due to exposure to UVA and UVB rays. However, tanning lamps are generally considered to pose a higher risk than sun tanning, particularly when sun exposure is managed responsibly with protective measures. In conclusion, patient E, who tans using tanning lamps, is more likely to risk skin cancer than patient F, who tans in the sun."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a set of queries separated by ' ', and your job is to find out the query which is not a well-formed or well-structured query in terms of grammar, punctuations, or spelling errors.

Write highlights for this article: Brooklyn, New York (CNN)A New York police officer was charged Wednesday with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed Brooklyn man in November. Officer Peter Liang was arraigned Wednesday in Brooklyn Supreme Court for \\"recklessly\\" causing the death of Akai Gurley, according to court documents. In addition to the manslaughter charge, Liang faces one count of criminally negligent homicide, one count of second-degree assault, one count of reckless endangerment and two counts of official misconduct. He was released without bail. If Liang were convicted on the charge of second-degree manslaughter, he could face up to 15 years in prison. \\"The defendant ignored his training\\" when he used his firearm, lead prosecutor Marc Fliedner told the court. The defendant also did not try to help Gurley, instead retreating to a hallway and telling a fellow officer \\"I'm going to get fired,\\" Fliedner said. The prosecution will prove Liang made a \\"deliberate motion\\" with his firearm, he added. CNN tried to get a comment after court from defense attorney Stephen Worth but was unsuccessful. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson thanked Fliedner and others \\"who worked so hard on this case so that the judicial process could be conducted fairly.\\" Thompson also thanked NYPD officers for their assistance. It was important to \\"recognize the courage and valor\\" that many officers showed when they responded to the scene, he said. Several officers tried to stop Gurley's bleeding. Prosecutors don't believe Liang intentionally killed Gurley, the DA said, but he had his finger on the trigger and an innocent man was killed. Gurley, 28, was \\"a total innocent who just happened\\" to run into Liang in a \\"pitch black\\" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters the day after the killing. At the time, the NYPD said the fatal shot was an \\"accidental discharge.\\" Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, had been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. \\"This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,\\" Patrick Lynch, head of the police union, said in a Tuesday statement. \\"The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident.\\" Liang and his partner were part of a \\"violence reduction overtime detail\\" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton told reporters after the shooting. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the 8th floor, Bratton said, when the officer fired his weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon \\"for safety reasons,\\" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old child, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said. Shot once in the chest, Gurley died at a hospital. The lights on the seventh and eighth floors were not working, Bratton said. The police commissioner said the decision on when to draw a weapon is the discretion of officers \\"based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter. So there is not a specific prohibition against taking a firearm out. But again, as in all cases, an officer would have to justify the circumstances that required him to or resulted in unholstering his firearm.\\" The shooting also is being investigated by police internal affairs. Gurley's shooting occurred at a time of strained police-community relations after the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police on Staten Island. The chokehold death of the unarmed 43-year-old man sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury declined to prosecute the officer. A few weeks after Garner's death, the police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed teenager Michael Brown thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury declined to prosecute Officer Darren Wilson, a decision that led to national  demonstrations.","output":"1.

The women were tracked down by authorities after a passenger on the Vietnamese Airline flight tested positive for coronavirus. They have been in isolation for seven days. Lucy, 22, Alice, 25, and their friend Hanna Ahlberg, 23, were traced to their hostel in Ha Long Bay by authorities days after Lucy disembarked from the plane. Police were deployed to their accommodation to ensure the women did not escape and hostel staff burnt mattresses and other items the women had come into contact with. Two and a half days after being tested for the virus, it was confirmed the women had not caught it. They were taken to an abandoned hospital in Ninh Bình, north Vietnam, and ordered to stay isolated for a further 12 days.

Plot title: Drop Zone Movie plot: Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew. Jessie agrees to train Pete how to skydive, if he will sponsor her team for the parachute exhibition. When Jessie's... My question: how does ty die?

At this point, Pete Nessip, the U.S. Marshal played by Wesley Snipes, and Jessie Crossman, the skilled skydiver played by Yancy Butler, are determined to stop Ty and his team from carrying out their plan. While in mid-air, Pete and Ty engage in a high-stakes skydiving battle. In the midst of their fight, Pete manages to snatch the disk containing the undercover agents' names from Ty. Then, in a desperate attempt to kill Pete, Ty tries to shoot him with a pistol, but Pete successfully kicks the weapon away. The two continue to fight while free-falling through the sky. As they near the ground, Pete manages to deploy his parachute, but Ty struggles with his own chute, which Pete had damaged during their struggle. Finally, Ty manages to deploy a reserve chute, but it is too late. The chute only partially opens, and Ty's descent is not slowed enough to prevent him from hitting the ground at a fatal speed. Ty Moncrief's death is a result of a combination of his intense mid-air battle with Pete, the damage to his primary parachute, his inability to properly deploy his reserve chute in time, and ultimately, the impact of his high-speed collision with the ground."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was once distinctly unsettled by a utility man who called to read the gas meter. We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson.

The Cygnet was a powered version of the  tetrahedral kite designed by a Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer, and innovator who is credited with founding what in 1885? The answer is:","output":"Alexander Graham Bell is the Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer, and innovator who designed the Cygnet, a powered version of the tetrahedral kite. He is also credited with founding the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1885. Alexander Graham Bell, who is best known for inventing the telephone, had a strong interest in aeronautics and aviation. In the early 1900s, Bell began experimenting with tetrahedral kites as he believed they had great potential in the field of aviation. The tetrahedral kite is a kite constructed of pyramid-shaped cells and is known for its stability, strength, and lightness. Bell experimented with different variations of the tetrahedral kite to improve its aerodynamics and lift capacity. In 1907, he designed the Cygnet, a powered version of the tetrahedral kite. The Cygnet incorporated a small internal combustion engine, which drove two propellers, with a pilot also on board. The Cygnet had a total of 3,393 tetrahedron wing cells and was the first powered aircraft Bell built. On December 6, 1907, the Cygnet was tested by the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA) at Bras d'Or Lake in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The AEA was founded by Alexander Graham Bell, Glenn Curtiss, Frederic Baldwin, J.A.D. McCurdy, and Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge, who shared a common interest in aviation. The pilot on the Cygnet's inaugural flight was Lieutenant Selfridge. He rode on the wing of the unconventional aircraft while tethered to a boat. Although the Cygnet only managed to rise slightly above the water before crashing, the tetrahedral kite still proved to be resilient and held together after the crash. In 1885, Bell played a crucial role in founding the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). The AIEE was a professional organization aimed at promoting knowledge, exchanging ideas, and standardizing best practices among the electrical engineering community. As the field of electrical engineering grew rapidly, the AIEE was instrumental in supporting engineers, researchers, and inventors working on groundbreaking electrical innovations. In 1963, the AIEE merged with the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE is now the largest professional engineering organization globally, representing individuals in various areas of electrical, electronics, communications, and related fields. In conclusion, Alexander Graham Bell designed the Cygnet, a powered version of the tetrahedral kite, and is credited with founding the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1885. Bell's contributions to both aviation and electrical engineering have had a lasting impact on the development of new technologies and innovations, setting the foundation for many modern advancements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nebraska-based Molly Schuyler, 34, a competitive eater with several food guzzling accolades to her name already, smashed the previous world record, which was a paltry 2lbs 15oz of pudding in the same time. The stomach-churning feat was performed on Dish Nation and uploaded to YouTube, and sees the slim brunette consume a whopping 15,120 calories in one sitting - that's the equivalent of over seven days' worth of recommended calorie intake for a woman. Scroll down for video. Pudding guzzler: Molly Schuyler, a 34-year-old mother-of-four, consumed exactly 12lbs of pudding in a record-smashing three minutes, earning herself a Guiness World Record. In the three minute stunt, which tows the fine like between revolting and riveting, Ms Schuyler crouches eagerly over the enormous glass bowl of creamy pudding and shovels it down her throat with hawk-like concentration and lightning-fast spoon-to-mouth motion. The five hosts behind her observe slack-jawed with disbelief, one repeatedly questioning: 'Is she even breathing?' 'I don’t think she’s swallowing, I think it’s just, like, this natural gravitational pull', observes another. Determination: The bony speed-eating champion barely came up for air once during the bizarre feat, leading one stunned host to question whether she was even breathing. She certainly earned that! Ms Schuyler beat the previous world record an astonishing six times over, devouring more than a week's worth of recommended calorie intake in just one sitting. At one point, Ms Schuyler pauses to let out an almighty belch, before dutifully returning to the task at hand, her cheeks smeared with the custard colored goop. 'I'm so scared for what's going to happen after!' squeals one queasy looking judge, sheepishly clutching a black garbage bin in preparation for a possible resurgence. But no, Ms Schuyler completes the task and gracefully accepts her certificate as she is welcomed into the Guiness World Record 'family'. Where did it all go? With a petite frame, at 5ft 7in and 125 pounds, her eating abilities are truly incredible. Make mine a large! Ms Schuyler has been competitive eating for less than a year and says she eats to support her four kids. Not only has the ravenous mother defied previous records, she's overcome the normal abilities of the human stomach, which can usually only stretch to hold a capacity of 8lbs. And it's far from the first time she has demonstrated her eating prowess for the world to see. She is currently ranked the number one Female Independent Competitive Eater in the world. Other records include demolishing a 12lb sandwich washed down with 1lb of French fries in just under an hour - the only woman to even finish this particular challenge. Slender: Mrs Schuyler's slim physique, and the fact that she has birthed four kids, may come as a surprise to those who've watched her eat. New-found skill: The full-time server only started eating competitively last August. She also devoured a 72oz steak, the size of a newborn baby, in under three minutes in January of this year, and competed in over 20 different food eating contests nationwide in 2013. Ms Schuyler, who serves food for a living, has spoken previously of her unusual talent, saying: ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon. I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.' Her husband, Sean, also says she is 'amazing when it comes to eating.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In an impressive display of competitive eating, Nebraska-based Molly Schuyler, a 34-year-old mother-of-four, set a new Guinness World Record by consuming 12lbs of pudding in a mere three minutes. This achievement greatly exceeds the previous record, which involved eating 2lbs 15oz of pudding in the same time span. Schuyler demonstrated this feat on Dish Nation, and the video can be found on YouTube. Her remarkable consumption amounted to an incredible 15,120 calories, which equates to over seven days' worth of recommended calorie intake for a woman. She performed the task with remarkable focus and speed, quickly spooning the pudding into her mouth to the astonishment of the five observing hosts. What stands out about Schuyler isn't just her eating habits, but also her physical figure: she is incredibly slender for a woman who has won numerous food-eating competitions. At 5ft 7in and 125 lbs, her capacity to consume such great quantities of food is genuinely astounding. Notably, a standard human stomach typically has a maximum stretch capacity of only 8 lbs. Being ranked as the number one Female Independent Competitive Eater in the world, this accomplishment is not Schuyler's first feat. Her previous records are equally imposing, including finishing a 12lb sandwich and 1lb of French fries in under an hour - the only woman to complete this challenge. Earlier this year, she devoured a 72oz steak, analogous in size to a newborn baby, in less than three minutes. She participated in over 20 different food eating contests across the nation in 2013, showcasing her capacity to consume considerable portions of food consistently. Schuyler works as a server and has been involved in competitive eating for less than a year. Her husband, Sean, admires her eating abilities, and Schuyler herself refers to it as an 'unexplained phenomenon,' adding: \\"I was just born that way.\\" Her speed-eating ability and slender physique are fascinating juxtapositions, providing an intriguing narrative and earning her a prominent place in competitive eating circles and beyond.  Apart from establishing a new world record, Schuyler's achievements serve as a testament to the surprising capabilities and quirks of the human body, as well as underlining the astonishing diversity found within the competitive eating sector.  Despite the shock and disbelief expressed by some observers of this kind of sport, there's no denying the mesmerizing appeal of these feats - a blend of the bizarre, unexpected, and extraordinary that keeps spectators eagerly anticipating the next record-breaking attempt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Housing has become a major obstacle  for Chinese young men hoping to start a family. China may breed a new group of bachelors, men caught in the trap of unaffordable houses. Since early 2009, the housing market has once again become a hot pot at boiling point. Even with allowance  and special government policies, home prices in China's first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai are riding the crest of a rising wave. According to the \\"2010 China Marital Status Report\\" released on Dec 15, 2010, about 70 percent of women interviewed said that housing, a stable income and some savings were the main requirements for marriage. From the report, we can see that housing is given top priority  and that women see an apartment as essential  to show that the man is responsible and can provide for his family. Personality and morals lay outside the top three matrimonial  requirements. Some women and their families hold the traditional position and take it for granted that the home issue should be the man's responsibility, which doesn't agree with the contemporary independent spirit of women and gender equality. These marriage values reflect the fact that many women consider marriage another form of \\"social welfare\\". Things may be different overseas. Social housing, provided by European authorities, offer the less wealthy people their own piece of real estate. Such housing is usually apartments in tall buildings with 10 or more floors on the _ of town, whose main advantage is the low rents. For many Americans, houses don't pose an obstacle to getting married. They often buy a house after the wedding, because more and more people are reconsidering their real estate worship, and going back to a more rational  mode of consumption. In Japan, renting is the custom for newly married young couples. Few young couples can afford to purchase property. Up to 67.1 percent of young couples choose to rent. Generally speaking, renters account for most... Question: Which of the following is Not True according to the text? - Home prices have been extremely high since early 2009. - In the modern society, women don't want to be independent. - Chinese government has already done something to control home prices. - Lots of Chinese young men couldn't get married because of their economic capability.

By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified  as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes.  Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\"  In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate  their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a 1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further.  Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days.  City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002.

The second question is a hypothetical situation or counterfactual thinking that wonders about the strategies or potential decisions the U.S. could have implemented to alter the historical outcome of the war. To answer your first question, the Vietnam War does not have a clear victor in the traditional sense. It is generally acknowledged that the North Vietnamese forces and the Viet Cong, who were fighting to reunify Vietnam under a single, communist government, managed to fulfill their objectives after the U.S. withdrew its forces in 1973 and South Vietnam fell in 1975. However, it was also a pyrrhic victory for North Vietnam due to the tremendous cost in human lives and infrastructure destruction. Saying who \\"won\\" the war can be seen as subjective, as it can depend on one's perspective.  To address your second question, the alternate strategies to \\"win\\" the Vietnam War could have included better understanding of the local culture and the nature of the conflict, improving the political and military coordination between South Vietnam and the U.S., utilizing more effective strategic measures to counteract the Viet Cong's guerilla warfare tactics, and possibly garnering better public support at home.

Answer the following question: Process:  - A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less stormy weather happens, how will it affect slower weathering occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that if there is less stormy weather, the rate or intensity of weathering might be affected. To determine the impact of the perturbation and if it has a direct or indirect effect on the process, we need to examine how storms play a role in the weathering of rocks and the role of plants in that process. Mechanical weathering (also known as physical weathering) refers to the natural process where rocks are broken down into smaller pieces by various factors such as temperature changes, freeze-thaw cycles, and the growth of plants (as mentioned in the process question). Chemical weathering refers to chemical transformations which cause rocks to disintegrate, dissolve, or to become more susceptible to other weathering processes. Stormy weather can lead to higher rates of both mechanical and chemical weathering. In the case of mechanical weathering, strong winds, heavy rain, and fluctuations in temperature can cause rocks to crack, break, and disintegrate into smaller pieces. Similarly, the flow of water caused by rainstorms can lead to erosion, which further accelerates the breakdown of rock material. Chemical weathering can also be intensified by stormy weather, as rainfall and fluctuations in pH levels can encourage the dissolution of rock components. Now, let's examine the process involving the plant growing near or on a rock. The plant's roots exert pressure on the rock as they grow, causing additional mechanical weathering. Additionally, the plant's acids dissolve parts of the rock, contributing to the chemical weathering process. If less stormy weather occurs, the immediate effect may be a decrease in weathering rates due to reduced mechanical and chemical forces acting on the rocks. This can lead to slower surface erosion, and potentially fewer cracks and openings in the rocks for the plant roots to penetrate. However, the plant's growth and presence on or near the rock will still contribute to the weathering process, albeit at a potentially slower pace. In this scenario, the perturbation of less stormy weather has a direct effect on the overall rate of weathering due to the causal relationship between storm intensity and both mechanical and chemical weathering rates. The plant's role in the weathering process will still occur but may be indirectly affected by the reduced weathering rates caused by the absence of stormy weather.  To summarize, the perturbation of less stormy weather will likely lead to slower weathering occurring and will have a direct effect on the weathering process. The plant's role in the weathering process might be indirectly affected, as the reduced weathering rates may change the rate or ease at which the plant can break the rocks apart, but the plant will still be a contributing factor in the overall weathering process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fact 2: Heat is caused by molecules moving.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What causes causes thermal expansion?\\" with the following options:  - molecules moving  - kinetic energy  - Electrical energy  - Evaporation  - molecules stopping  - sunlight  - molecules slowing down  - molecules standing still Answer:","output":"Thermal expansion is predominantly caused by molecules moving, which is also a manifestation of kinetic energy. To understand this, we must delve deeper into the relationship between these factors and their effect on the phenomenon of thermal expansion. When heat is introduced to a substance, the increased energy causes the molecules to move more rapidly. This movement is in the form of kinetic energy, which is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. As these molecules move more quickly, they transfer this kinetic energy to other molecules within the substance through collisions, causing them to vibrate more rapidly as well. As these vibrations increase, the substance's molecules begin to push further away from each other, resulting in thermal expansion. In some materials, the amount of expansion is directly proportional to the increase in temperature. Thermal expansion is an essential consideration in various applications, including construction, engineering, and manufacturing, where materials undergo changes in temperature during their lifecycle. Though other factors listed in the options can play some role in causing the molecules to move more rapidly, they are not the primary causes of thermal expansion. For instance: - Electrical energy: In some instances, it can generate heat and lead to molecular motion, but it is not a direct cause of thermal expansion. - Evaporation: This is a process where molecules with relatively high kinetic energy escape the surface of a liquid and become vapor. It is not a direct cause of thermal expansion, though it shares a relationship with heat. - Sunlight: It is a source of heat, but it is not the direct cause of thermal expansion. Rather, sunlight can cause the temperature to rise and subsequently cause molecules to move faster, indirectly causing thermal expansion. - Lastly, options like molecules stopping, slowing down, or standing still are not causes of thermal expansion. On the contrary, these options tend to result in the opposite effect - which is thermal contraction or a decrease in a substance's volume. In conclusion, while some factors such as sunlight or electrical energy are indirectly related to thermal expansion by causing a temperature increase, the direct cause of thermal expansion lies in the molecules moving more rapidly due to the additional kinetic energy they possess."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Answer:","output":"Preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past are known as fossils. Fossils provide critical evidence about the history of life on Earth, allowing scientists to study the evolution of species, their distribution over time, and the environmental conditions that prevailed in different epochs. Fossils can be categorized into two main types: body fossils and trace fossils. Body fossils are the preserved remains of an organism's body parts, such as bones, teeth, shells, and even soft tissues in rare cases. Trace fossils, on the other hand, are indirect evidence of an organism's existence, such as footprints, burrows, nests, or coprolites (fossilized feces). The process of fossilization involves several key factors, including rapid burial, the absence of oxygen, and the presence of minerals. Typically, an organism must be quickly buried in sediment, such as mud or sand, to prevent decomposition and scavengers from destroying its remains. Over time, unaltered remains such as shells, teeth, and bones may become surrounded and filled with minerals, turning them into fossils. In some instances, the original organic materials are replaced with minerals, resulting in petrifaction (also known as permineralization), a phenomenon that preserves the organism's original structure in great detail. Fossils can provide essential information to paleontologists, scientists who study the history of life on Earth. By examining the morphology and distribution of fossils, paleontologists can understand how ancient organisms lived, died, and evolved. They can also make inferences about an organism's habitat, diet, and behavior. Furthermore, the study of fossils helps researchers create a comprehensive picture of the geological timescale, as well as the reasons behind mass extinction events in Earth's history. The discovery and collection of fossils are often conducted through a systematic process known as fossil excavation or paleontological fieldwork. This involves identifying potential fossil-bearing sites (usually sedimentary rock formations), carefully excavating the fossils, and collecting relevant contextual information, such as the stratigraphic layers and surrounding rock types. Once collected, fossils are cleaned, preserved, and categorized for further study in laboratories and museums. Fossil discoveries have played a significant role in shaping our understanding of the history of life on Earth. For example, the famous fossils of Archaeopteryx, a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds, provided compelling evidence in support of the theory of evolution. Similarly, the numerous transitional forms found within the fossil record showcase the gradual evolutionary changes experienced by various lineages over millions of years. In summary, fossils are preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past, providing crucial information about the history and evolution of life on Earth. With the help of fossils, paleontologists can study species' morphological and ecological changes, reconstruct the geological timescale, and gain a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationship between life and Earth's changing environments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Extremely high pollution levels shrouded eastern China for the second time in about two weeks Tuesday, forcing airlines... (Associated Press)      The capital was a colorless scene. Street lamps and the outlines of buildings receded into a white haze as pedestrians donned face masks to guard against the caustic air. The flight cancellations stranded passengers during the first week of the country's peak, six-week period for travel surrounding the Chinese New Year on Feb. 10.      The U.S. Embassy reported an hourly peak level of PM2.5 _ tiny particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs _ at 526 micrograms per cubic meter, or \\"beyond index,\\" and more than 20 times higher than World Health Organization safety levels over a 24-hour period.      Liu Peng, an employee at a financial institution in Beijing, said he will keep his newborn baby indoors.      \\"It's really bad for your health, obviously,\\" Liu said. \\"I bike to work every day and always wear a mask. The pollution in recent years is probably due to the increase in private cars and government cars.\\"      Visibility was less than 100 meters (100 yards) in some areas of eastern China, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. More than 100 flights were canceled in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, 33 in Beijing, 20 in Qingdao and 13 in Jinan.      Every year, China's transport system bursts at the seams as tens of millions of people travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, in the world's largest seasonal migration of people.      Ren Haiqiang, a bank worker in his early 30s, said he had booked tickets to fly out of Beijing on Thursday to visit family in the coastal city of Dalian, but now worried about flight cancellations.      \\"Traveling over the holiday is already a huge hassle, along with all the gift-giving and family visits. We thought flying would be the best way to avoid the crush, but if the weather continues like this we'll be in real trouble,\\" Ren said as he waited in line at a bakery in downtown Beijing.      Beijing's city government ordered 103 heavily polluting factories to suspend production and told government departments and state-owned enterprises to reduce their use of cars by a third, Xinhua said. The measures last until Thursday.      Beijing's official readings for PM2.5 were lower than the embassy's _ 433 micrograms per cubic meter at one point in the afternoon_ but even that level is considered \\"severe\\" and prompted the city government to advise residents to stay indoors as much as possible. The government said that because there was no wind, the smog probably would not dissipate quickly.      Patients seeking treatment for respiratory ailments rose by about 30 percent over the past month at the Jiangong Hospital in downtown Beijing, Emergency Department chief Cui Qifeng said.      \\"People tend to catch colds or suffer from lung infections during the days with heavily polluted air,\\" he said.      Air pollution has long been a problem in Beijing, but the country has been more open about releasing statistics on PM2.5 _ considered a more accurate reflection of air quality than other pollutants _ only since early last year. The city hit its highest readings on Jan. 12, when U.S. Embassy readings of PM2.5 reached as high as 886 micrograms per cubic meter.      Celebrity real estate developer Pan Shiyi, who has previously pushed for cities to publish more detailed air quality data and who is a delegate to Beijing's legislature, called Tuesday morning for a \\"Clean Air Act.\\" By late afternoon, his online poll had received more than 29,000 votes, with 99 percent in favor.      On Monday, Wang Anshun was elected Beijing's mayor after telling lawmakers the municipal government should make more efforts to fight air pollution, according to Xinhua.      Last week, he announced plans to remove 180,000 older vehicles from the city's roads and promote government cars and heating systems that use clean energy.      ___      Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen and researcher Flora Ji contributed to this report. ||||| Photographer Goran Tomasevic captures the moment two Syrian rebels are hit by sniper fire in Damascus.      BEIJING |      BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing temporarily shut down 103 heavily polluting factories and took 30 percent of government vehicles off roads to combat dangerously high air pollution, state media reported on Tuesday, but the capital's air remained hazardous despite the measures.      Air quality in Beijing has mostly stayed above \\"very unhealthy\\" and \\"hazardous\\" levels for about two weeks. On Tuesday, it hit 517 on an index maintained by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, which described the pollution as \\"Beyond Index\\".      Pollution in Beijing regularly exceeds 500 on an index that measures particulate matter in the air with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers. Above 300 is considered hazardous, while the World Health Organisation recommends a daily level of no more than 20.      Earlier this month pollution hit a record, 30-45 times above recommended safety levels, blanketing the city in a thick, noxious cloud that grounded flights and forced people indoors.      Beijing's pollution problem has caused widespread public outrage, alarming the ruling Communist Party, which has failed to rein in pollution despite repeated pledges to get tough.      Premier Wen Jiabao told top leaders at a forum that the \\"recent fog and haze have affected the people's normal life and health\\".      \\"We should take effective measures to speed up the enhancement of our industrial structure, push for energy conservation and build an ecological civilisation,\\" Wen was quoted as saying on state television. \\"Use actions so that the people can see hope.\\"      State news agency Xinhua said the Beijing municipal government held an urgent meeting on Tuesday \\"for the emergency work of controlling the heavy air pollution\\".      \\"All counties, departments, businesses and institutions should take the lead in suspending the service of 30 percent of official vehicles,\\" Xinhua said. Beijing would also shut down 103 heavily polluting businesses.      But the emergency measures only last until Thursday.      The government has already announced that it would take 180,000 old vehicles off the roads in Beijing this year and control the \\"excessive\\" growth of new car sales in the city.

Next question: the invention of linear perspective is generally attributed to?","output":"The invention of linear perspective is generally attributed to the Italian Renaissance architect, artist, and mathematician Filippo Brunelleschi. Born in Florence around 1377, Brunelleschi played a revolutionary role in the history of art, owing largely to his groundbreaking development of linear perspective, among other achievements. Linear perspective is a technique that uses mathematical and geometric principles to create the illusion of a three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. It enables artists to represent objects and scenes more accurately, capturing their relative sizes, proportions, and positions as they recede into the distance. The key idea behind linear perspective involves a vanishing point, which is typically placed at the viewer's eye level. Converging lines are drawn from the vanishing point, assisting in the portrayal of depth and volume. Brunelleschi's invention of linear perspective is believed to have occurred during the early 15th century, between 1410 and 1420, as a result of his extensive studies in the field of optics and geometry. Prior to this time, most art was characterized by stylized and abstract representations, with little attention to accurately representing objects in a three-dimensional space. Due to the lack of a unified system, artists relied heavily on their intuitions, resulting in inconsistencies and inaccuracies in their artworks. It is said that Brunelleschi first demonstrated the principles of linear perspective through a few notable experiments. One of these involved creating a painted panel of the Florence Baptistery, observable through a hole in the painting's back when reflected in a mirror. By aligning the vanishing point of the painting with the viewer's eye, he produced an illusion of depth that convincingly matched the real-world view. Another experiment conducted by Brunelleschi involved constructing a set of grids on a panel, along with a small hole for the observer's eye. When placed in front of a scene, the observer could then use a lenticular device to trace the objects onto the grid, providing a proportional and accurate representation of the scene in perspective. Brunelleschi's groundbreaking work on linear perspective had a significant impact on the art world. It quickly spread throughout Florence and, subsequently, the rest of Europe. Artists like Leon Battista Alberti and Masaccio further explored and developed these perspective techniques, eventually leading to the creation of masterpieces during the Renaissance era. Alberti even penned a treatise in 1435, titled 'De pictura' ('On Painting'), which articulated the rules of linear perspective to a broad audience and solidified the significance of these concepts within the realms of art and architecture. In summary, Filippo Brunelleschi's invention of linear perspective revolutionized the art world and the ways in which artists accurately represented reality. This critical development enabled artists to create more believable, vivid, and immersive works, which greatly contributed to the remarkable advancements in art and architecture during the Renaissance period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A voice type is a particular human singing voice identified as having certain qualities or characteristics of vocal range, vocal weight, tessitura, vocal timbre, and vocal transition points (\\"passaggio\\"), such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register. A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type. The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \\"Fach\\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted.  - Maria Malibran ( 24 March 1808 -- 23 September 1836 ) was a Spanish mezzo - soprano who commonly sang both contralto and soprano parts , and was one of the most famous opera singers of the 19th century . Malibran was known for her stormy personality and dramatic intensity , becoming a legendary figure after her death at age 28 . Contemporary accounts of her voice describe its range , power and flexibility as extraordinary .  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by the use of sustained tonality, rhythm, and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist. Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists, or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues and popular music styles such as pop and rock.  - A contralto is a type of classical female singing voice whose vocal range is the lowest female voice type. The contralto's vocal range is fairly rare; similar to, but different from the alto, and almost identical to that of a countertenor, typically between the F below middle C (F in scientific pitch notation) to the second F above middle C (F), although at the extremes some voices can reach the E below middle C (E) or the second B above middle C (B). The contralto voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, lyric, and dramatic contralto.    What object entity has the relation of 'movement' with the subject 'maria malibran'?

Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon.

Be respectful of personal space, like bedrooms, journals, or cell phones.   Remembering your sibling’s boundaries will show them your love and respect. Don't read their journal or snoop around in their room when they aren't home. When you feel angry or upset, you will likely start a fight. Work on your emotions in healthy ways rather than taking them out on the people close to you.  Try venting to a friend or to your parent about what is on your mind. This will get rid of your feelings so you don't carry them with you next time you talk to your brother. If you’re really angry with your brother, rather than yelling at him, try writing a letter. This is a safe place for you to vocalize your true feelings, without maybe saying harsh things to him right away. After you've written your letter, you'll be able to discuss your feelings calmly. It’s easy to forget your sibling’s friendship if you’re stuck fighting all the time. Show your brother or sister you appreciate them by doing something nice, for no reason. It’s easy to take your family for granted. You can do things like buy them ice cream or a coffee when you are running errands. Also try things like playing their favorite game together, or buy them a new coloring book or magazine. Whether you share a room with your sibling or you live across the country from each other, it’s important to spend time together when you can. Spend time together that is positive and fun, rather than spent arguing. This will strengthen your relationship and you are less likely to fight. Do an activity you both enjoy, like playing golf, walking in the park, or watching a sci-fi movie. If you tell your brother that you will stop teasing him, do it. Be accountable to what you agree upon, and your sibling will start to trust you. Trust is important to maintain healthy relationships and prevent fights.  If you both agree your fights are starting because you want to be the boss, stop ordering around your sibling and let them make decisions.

Entailment means that the information provided in the Premise logically supports the claim made in the Hypothesis. Agreement means that the Premise and Hypothesis concur in meaning but don't provide logical support. Step 2: Read and comprehend the given sentences. Premise: Whether the process is anabolic or catabolic is not demonstrated. Hypothesis: Catabolic and anabolic hormones in the body help regulate metabolic processes. Step 3: Compare the Premise and Hypothesis. In this case, the Premise is stating that it is not demonstrated if the process being discussed is anabolic or catabolic, but it does not disagree or provide any other information regarding the hormones. The Hypothesis, on the other hand, discusses the role of catabolic and anabolic hormones in regulating metabolic processes. Step 4: Determine if there is entailment or agreement. Since the information in the Premise does not provide enough information or support to the claim made in the Hypothesis, there is no entailment. However, there is also no disagreement, so the relation between these two sentences is neutral. Output: neutral"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The book is about Thomas Cromwell, an adviser to King Henry VIII, and charts the bloody downfall of Anne Boleyn.      It is the second book in a trilogy.      A third instalment, to be called The Mirror and the Light, will continue Cromwell's story until his execution in 1540.      Mantel was announced as the winner at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night.      Mantel's win also makes her the first person in Man Booker history to win the prize for a direct sequel. She is only the third double winner of the award, after JM Coetzee and Peter Carey.

She also won the prize in 2009 for \\"Wolf Hall,\\" the first novel in the trilogy.      \\"You wait 20 years for a Booker Prize and then two come along at once,\\" she told reporters, adding, \\"I feel a bit weak at the knees to be honest.\\"      \\"This double accolade is uniquely deserved,\\" said Sir Peter Stothard, chairman of the judging panel and editor of the Times Literary Supplement. \\"In 'Bring up the Bodies,' our greatest modern writer retells the origins of modern England.\\"      Mantel is the third author to win the prize twice, alongside South-African-born J.M.

Established in 1969, the Man Booker is the best-known fiction prize for English-language authors from Commonwealth countries and Ireland. It is intended to reward literary heavyweights rather than bestsellers.      While sales are not a factor in the judges' decision, authors typically experience a dramatic increase in sales after receiving the prize.      Weekly sales in the U.K. of last year's winner, \\"Sense of an Ending\\" by Julian Barnes, jumped from 2,535 to 14,534 -- an increase of 473% -- in the week it won, according to Nielsen Bookscan.      In the week she won the prize in 2009, Mantel enjoyed a 463% rise in weekly sales and more than 600,000 in total sales in the U.K.      She joked then that she would spend the prize money on \\"sex, drugs and rock and roll.\\"      This time around, she said she would probably spend it on her pension, although she said she still has writing years left in her, despite suffering \\"misadventure\\" since her first win and illness that stopped her from writing for most of 2010.      \\"Bring up the Bodies\\" and \\"Wolf Hall\\" are being adapted into a six-part series for the BBC and stage plays.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere - Falls onto the ground - The acid rain starts scouring rocks - Destroys vegetation - The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rain is able to be absorbed into soil happens, how will it affect \\"acid rain is absorbed into the earths soil\\".  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of acid rain being absorbed into the Earth's soil does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of acid rain production and its consequences. Direct Effects: 1. Soil Acidification: When absorbed into the soil, the acidic components of the rain (mainly sulfuric and nitric acids) will react with soil minerals and lead to a decrease in soil pH. This acidification process can negatively impact the soil's nutrient balance and bacterial activity, which in turn influences plant growth and crop production.   2. Leaching of essential nutrients: Acid rain absorbed into the soil can cause essential nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium, to leach out of the soil. The loss of these vital nutrients can stunt plant growth and make them more susceptible to disease and environmental stressors. 3. Mobilization of toxic metals: Acidic conditions in soil can also cause potentially toxic metals, such as aluminum, to become more soluble and mobile. When these toxic metals are absorbed by plants or enter water bodies, they can harm aquatic ecosystems and enter the food chain, posing a risk to both wildlife and human health. Indirect Effects: 1. Impact on aquatic ecosystems: The leaching of acidic components and toxic metals from the soil into water bodies can disrupt aquatic ecosystems, leading to negative impacts on organisms such as fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. This can, in turn, lead to a decrease in overall biodiversity and affect the ecological balance of the surrounding environment. 2. Climate change feedback: Due to the detrimental effects on vegetation and ecosystems, acid rain can indirectly contribute to climate change by reducing the overall resilience of ecosystems to cope with environmental changes, such as increased temperatures and extreme weather events, resulting from climate change. 3. Human health impacts: Acid rain can also indirectly affect human health by altering the quality of the water, soil, and crops we consume. Contaminated water and food can result in deficiencies of essential nutrients, accumulation of toxic metals in the body, or exposure to harmful substances. In conclusion, the perturbation of acid rain being absorbed into the Earth's soil does have a significant effect on the overall process of acid rain production and its consequences for vegetation, ecosystems, and human health. It initiates a cascade of direct and indirect effects that disrupt natural systems and lead to long-term environmental damage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Exercise is a great way to release stress and keep your body happy.  Go for a walk, skip, or do some jump rope. You can join sport teams at school to keep you moving. Spend time with friends. One the best ways to bust stress is to surround yourself with fun and supportive people. It’s important to have someone in your life that you trust that you can talk to about your mother’s problems and how they affect you. It’s okay to talk about the hurt, frustration, embarrassment, anger, and fear associated with your mother’s use. This can be a coach, guidance counselor, spiritual leader, aunt/uncle, or therapist. It can be helpful to find an adult that has similar experiences to you to talk to. This person can encourage you, show you that you can make it through, and be an example that things can work well for you.

Choices:  - sound well - fly - become broken - gain speed - fall into hole  The rationale to choose \\"gain speed\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"As the round object rolls down the ramp, it will \\"gain speed.\\" This answer is the most appropriate choice among the given options, and the rationale behind it is based on basic physics principles, particularly the concepts of gravitational force, potential energy, and kinetic energy. When the round object is at the top of the ramp, it possesses potential energy due to its position in a gravitational field (i.e., its height above the ground). As the object starts to roll down the ramp, this potential energy is gradually converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. Since kinetic energy is related to both the mass and the velocity of the object, the increasing kinetic energy means that the object's speed (or velocity) is also increasing. This can be easily explained using the principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be converted from one form to another. In this case, the total mechanical energy (sum of potential and kinetic energy) of the object remains constant as it rolls down the ramp, but the distribution of energy changes from potential energy to kinetic energy. The other options, such as \\"sound well,\\" \\"fly,\\" \\"become broken,\\" and \\"fall into a hole,\\" do not accurately describe the expected behavior of a round object rolling down a ramp based on fundamental physics concepts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that the type of seed of a plant is an inherited characteristic to answer this question: \\"If a seed is planted and it develops into a large tomato plant\\"","output":"To answer the question \\"If a seed is planted and it develops into a large tomato plant,\\" I will use evidence from the fact that the type of seed of a plant is an inherited characteristic: Step 1: Consider the genetic information in seeds Seeds carry genetic information from the parent plant, which determines the characteristics of the resulting plant. In this case, the characteristic we're considering is the size of the tomato plant. Step 2: Examine the inheritance of traits Traits like large tomato plant size are passed down from parent plants to their offspring through heredity. This means that the large tomato plant size is likely a result of genetics inherited from one or both of the parent plants. Step 3: Analyze the role of environmental factors While the type of seed is an inherited characteristic, it's important to consider environmental factors that may have an impact on the resulting plant's size. Proper care, such as watering, nutrient availability, and sunlight exposure, can also contribute to the development of a large tomato plant. Conclusion: If a seed is planted and it develops into a large tomato plant, this can be attributed to a combination of inherited characteristics from the parent plants and favorable environmental conditions. The seed's inherited genetic information plays a significant role in determining plant size, but factors such as proper care and overall growing conditions should also be considered for the successful development of a large tomato plant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: High school senior Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) is introduced as a stereotypical, shallow cheerleader at Hemery High School in Los Angeles. She is a carefree popular mean girl whose main concerns are shopping and spending time with her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey. While at school one day, she is approached by a man who calls himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland). He informs her that she is The Slayer, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting uncanny abilities not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature and sharp-tongued remarks. After several successful outings, Buffy is drawn into conflict with Lothos (Rutger Hauer), a local vampire king and his acolyte, Amilyn (Paul Reubens). Two young men, Oliver Pike (Luke Perry), and best friend Benny (David Arquette), who resented Buffy and her friends due to differing social circles, are out drinking when they are attacked by Amilyn. Benny is turned but Pike is saved by Merrick. As a vampire, Benny visits Pike and tries to get him to join him. Later, when Pike and his boss are discussing Benny, Pike tells him to run if he sees him. Not only this, but a studious girl from Buffy's class, Cassandra, is abducted one night by Amilyn and sacrificed to Lothos. When her body is found, the news spreads through LA and Hemery High, but her murder is met with indifference from Buffy's clique.

Text: In a car equipped with air conditioning, outside air, or cabin air if the recirculation flap has been set to close the external air passages, is first forced, often after being filtered by a cabin air filter, through the air conditioner's evaporator coil. This can be thought of as a heater core filled with very cold liquid that is undergoing a phase change to gas (the evaporation), a process which cools rather than heats the incoming air. In order to obtain the desired temperature incoming air may first be cooled by the air conditioning and then heated again by the heater core. In a vehicle fitted with manual controls for the heater and air conditioning compressor, using both systems together will dehumidify the air in the cabin, as the evaporator coil removes moisture from the air due to condensation. This can result in increased air comfort levels inside the vehicle. Automatic temperature control systems can take the best course of action in regulating the compressor operation, amount of reheating and blower speed depending upon the external air temperature, the internal one and the cabin air temperature value or a rapid defrost effect requested by the user. Question: does the heater core affect the air conditioning?","output":"Yes, the heater core can affect the air conditioning in a car. Think of it like this: the air conditioning is like a cold box that makes the air cool, while the heater core is like a warm box that makes the air warm. Sometimes, when you want the perfect temperature inside the car, the cold air from the air conditioning has to pass through the warm box (heater core) to get a little warmer. This helps make the air inside the car feel just right and more comfortable for you. So the heater core and air conditioning work together to create the best temperature for everyone in the car."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

Article: Historically, AC motors were used for single or double speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution. The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.
