Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Jerry and Gary each live in separate cities, but both run equally sized farms that grow the same produce. The cities they live in have very similar environments with the only difference being that the CO2 levels in Jerry's town are elevated, and in Gary's they are not. Jerry and Gary regularly talk on the phone and compare notes with each other since their farms are so similar.  Will there be more or less micronutrients on Jerry's crops?  Hint: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments.Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein.The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jerry's crops, which are grown in elevated CO2 levels, will likely have decreased concentrations of micronutrients when compared to Gary's crops grown in the normal CO2 levels.

Particularly when it comes to romantic interests, nonverbal communication plays a crucial role in approaching, attracting, and building a bond with your crush. In this article, we will explore five essential nonverbal cues to help you navigate the landscape of romantic encounters and develop a more intimate connection with the person you admire. 1. Make Eye Contact: Eye contact is the first and most important nonverbal cue to establish a connection with your crush. It shows that you are genuinely interested in them and creates a sense of intimacy. Moreover, eye contact can convey confidence and trustworthiness. To practice making eye contact, start by holding their gaze for a couple of seconds before looking away, then gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. Be sure to maintain a balance between attentive eye contact and looking away periodically to avoid staring, which can make the interaction feel overwhelming. 2. Smile: A warm, genuine smile can work wonders in winning over your crush's heart. It demonstrates that you're approachable, friendly, and interested in getting to know them. Additionally, smiling can help put both you and your crush at ease, creating a comfortable atmosphere for further interaction. To practice smiling, think of something that genuinely makes you happy or amused, and let that emotion show on your face. Avoid forcing a smile, as it can come across as fake or insincere. 3. Look Your Best: Taking pride in your appearance goes a long way in making you feel more confident and attractive. When you feel good about yourself, it reflects in your body language and overall demeanor, making you more appealing to your crush. Dress in a way that makes you feel comfortable and confident, ensuring that your personal hygiene and grooming are up to par. Looking your best isn't just about clothes or grooming – it’s also about adopting a positive body language. Hold your head high, stand with a relaxed posture, and wear your confidence. 4. Touch Your Crush: When the moment feels right and with respect for their personal boundaries, gently establish physical contact with your crush. A light touch on the arm during conversation or a comforting hand on their back shows that you are emotionally connected, empathetic, and approachable. Always gauge the comfort level of your crush and if you sense any discomfort, refrain from further physical contact. The key is to be sensitive and respect their boundaries while endeavoring to build a connection. 5. Touch Yourself: Interestingly, research suggests that subtly touching certain areas of your body like your neck or hair can make you appear more attractive to others. This self-touching gesture can indicate vulnerability and openness, making your crush feel more connected and attracted to you. However, make sure these gestures are natural and not overdone. The aim is to appear genuine and comfortable in your skin, rather than come across as contrived or self-conscious. Conclusion: In summary, effectively utilizing nonverbal cues such as making eye contact, smiling, looking your best, touching your crush, and touching yourself can contribute significantly to building an authentic and memorable connection with your romantic interest. By understanding and practicing these gestures, you can create an environment of trust, intimacy, and warmth, paving the way for a blossoming relationship with your crush."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts was debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter.  Wykham Delandre had quarrelled with his sister--or perhaps it was that she had quarrelled with him--and they were on terms not merely of armed neutrality but of bitter hatred.  The quarrel had been antecedent to Margaret going to Brent's Rock.  She and Wykham had almost come to blows.  There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other; and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house.  She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house.  On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day.  Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock.  It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom.  Even his own servants never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in the house being aware of his coming.  This was his usual method of appearing after a long absence.  After reading the above, is \\"In the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What were Margaret and Wykham quarreling about?\\"?

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood.

Here is a goal: how to make a mulled red wine Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To make mulled red wine, I will follow these step-by-step instructions and justify each step: 1. Gather ingredients and utensils:    - Ingredients: red wine, orange, honey or sugar, whole spices (cinnamon sticks, star anise, cloves, and cardamom pods), and optional garnishes (e.g., fresh orange slices, star anise, and cinnamon sticks).    - Utensils: a saucepan, a sharp knife, a cutting board, a wooden spoon, and serving glasses.    Justification: To make mulled wine, we need the appropriate ingredients and utensils to prepare and serve the drink. 2. Prepare the orange:    - Wash the orange.    - Use the sharp knife to thinly slice the orange.    - Set aside a few slices for garnishing (optional).    Justification: The orange adds a citrusy flavor to the mulled wine and also serves as a garnish. 3. Combine the ingredients in a saucepan:    - Pour the red wine into the saucepan.    - Add the orange slices.    - Stir in honey or sugar to sweeten the mixture.    - Add the whole spices: cinnamon sticks, star anise, cloves, and cardamom pods.    Justification: The combination of these ingredients contributes to the richness, sweet taste, and aromatic scent associated with mulled wine. 4. Heat the mixture:    - Place the saucepan on the stove over low to medium heat.    - Warm the mixture until it begins to steam, but avoid boiling, as this can cause the alcohol to evaporate.    Justification: Gently heating the wine allows the flavors and aromas to meld without losing the alcohol content. 5. Steep the mixture:    - Once the wine is heated, reduce the heat to low, and let it steep for about 20-30 minutes.    - Stir occasionally to ensure even distribution of flavors.    Justification: Steeping the mixture allows the spices to fully infuse the wine, enhancing its overall flavor. 6. Taste and adjust:    - Taste the mulled wine and adjust the sweetness by adding more honey or sugar if necessary.    Justification: Different people have different preferences for sweetness, so adjusting the sweetness ensures the mulled wine suits your taste. 7. Strain the mixture (optional):    - If you prefer a smooth and clear mulled wine, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the spices and orange slices.    Justification: Straining the mixture removes any solid particles and creates a smoother, more visually appealing drink. 8. Serve the mulled wine:    - Pour the mulled wine into serving glasses.    - Garnish with reserved orange slices, star anise, and cinnamon sticks (optional).    - Serve warm.    Justification: Serving the mulled wine warm with garnishes enhances its visual appeal and provides a comforting, aromatic drinking experience.

To make m alone, we need to move 3100 to the other side of the equation. Remember, if you move a number to the other side, you change its sign. So, the equation becomes:  124 * m = -3100 4. Now, we have 124 * m, and we want to find out what m is. To do that, we need to divide both sides by 124. It's like sharing -3100 cookies evenly among 124 friends.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Money, jewels and important documents are not the only valuable placed in banks these days. Some mothers store their breast milk in banks. There're ten breast banks set up across the United States, where mothers can donate their extra milk for other women's babies. Experts say breast milk is the best food for babies. The World Health Organization says it is the only food babies should get during the first six months of life, in most cases. Breast milk is especially important for babies born too early. Sometimes these premature babies must stay in the hospital for many weeks. James Cameron is a doctor who treats newborns at Lutheran Children's Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He says breast milk is almost like medicine. Doctor James Cameron said, \\"The fact is that there are so many different proteins and specialized sugars in the breast milk that the mom's able to make that help provide immunity. It's very important for the health of the newborn.\\" There are several reasons some mothers may not be able to breastfeed. Some are not able to produce enough milk. Others might be taking medicines or have medical problems that prevent the process. Lucy Baur lives near Fort Wayne. She fed her milk to both her children and always had more milk than they needed. She wanted to donate to the Indiana Mothers Milk Bank in Indianapolis. But freezing and shipping milk can be costly. Then, a donor station opened near her home. Milk donations in the United States work like this: Donors must be willing to provide almost three liters of breast milk. They freeze the milk and take it to the station. There, employees warm the milk and mix it with other mothers' milk. Then, the milk is heated to kill bacteria. After that, the technicians test samples of all the milk to make sure it is safe and healthful. The milk is re-frozen and sent to the main milk bank. The milk bank transports the milk to hospitals to feed premature or sick babies. Donors are tested for diseases before any milk is accepted. _ are not permitted to smoke tobacco,...

Boris Johnson Made Foreign Secretary by Theresa May: Smart? Eyes were rolling across Britain last night as the news emerged that one of Theresa May’s first acts as Prime Minister was to appoint Boris Johnson as her Foreign Secretary. Yes, the former Mayor of London cast into the political wilderness just last week has already made a comeback to an office of state held in times past by such figures as the Duke of Wellington, Lord Palmerston and Sir Anthony Eden. Johnson, it need hardly be noted, is not widely considered to be in the same league as these illustrious forebears. Nor is he someone who has displayed a lot of diplomatic tact over his years as a newspaper journalist, a Conservative MP and latterly London’s mayor. The media in the U.K. and elsewhere quickly highlighted his many, many faux-pas: Calling the people of the Congo “pickaninnies.” Suggesting Papua New Guineans practise cannibalism. Rugby-tackling a German player during a friendly game of soccer. And all of that before his April column about President Barack Obama criticizing the “part-Kenyan President’s ancestral dislike of the British empire.” Accordingly, the reaction was swift and incredulous. The Daily Mirror, Britain’s left-leaning tabloid, put Johnson on its cover with the words “Dear world … sorry.” Abroad, German newscasters could not help sniggering as they delivered the news. Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said on Twitter he “wished it was a joke.” State Department spokesperson Mark Toner could barely disguise a smile as he learned of the appointment. So what’s behind the decision to insert a massive Johnson into this great office of state? Does May really expect him to be taken seriously by, for example, Turkey’s President Erdogan — recently the subject of an award-winning limerick by Britain’s new Foreign Secretary in which he is described as a goat-molesting “wankerer”? It’s important to note firstly that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is not as powerful an office as it once was. Foreign policy has largely become the edict of the Prime Minister under leaders like Tony Blair, who saw himself as a head of state as well as the head of a government. Its remit has been watered down by other areas of government; for example the Department for International Development, which became its own ministry in 1997, is in charge of international aid. And under Theresa May, the dominant issue of British foreign policy for at least the next five years — the matter of Britain’s departure from the European Union — will become the purview of newly appointed Secretary of State for European Union Relations David Davis. Another cabinet minister, Liam Fox, will oversee a whole new department overseeing international trade in the wake of the Brexit vote. So it’s likely that under May the FCO will primarily dedicate itself to promoting British interests overseas, becoming a department better overseen by a salesman than a statesman. Which makes it the perfect place for Johnson, a man who easily makes up in charm for what he lacks in gravitas. He will be able to channel the patriotic spirit of his hero, Sir Winston Churchill, without having to fight any wars. It’s a job he pulled off with aplomb when he welcomed the world to London for the 2012 Olympics (zip line mishaps aside). For May personally, the move also makes strategic sense. Although she and Johnson have never been close, he remains a highly popular figure among her party’s membership, despite questions about his commitment to the Brexit result and his ducking out of a leadership bid. Keeping him in the cabinet will placate the grassroots, as well as the rightwing of the party eager for the front bench to be stocked with Brexiteers. This way May gets to keep a political nemesis close, but not that close. As Foreign Secretary, Johnson will be required to spend large amounts of time traversing the globe to gladhand ambassadors, attachés and other dignitaries. He is likely to be a more absent figure than other members of her cabinet. Of course, the move has a huge potential to backfire. Johnson’s foot has an amazing propensity to find its way into his mouth, and it would not look good for May to have to deal with a diplomatic incident caused by her own Foreign Secretary. Much depends on Johnson’s ability to recast himself as a slightly more serious figure for his most senior and visible job yet. He has at least recognized that he has some work to do. Asked by ITV if he owes anyone an apology for his amazing string of diplomatic blunders, he rather sheepishly answered: “The United States of America will be at the front of the queue.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Theresa May's appointment of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary is considered by some to make strategic sense, as the role could harness his charm while keeping him too busy to oppose May's leadership; however, it also runs the risk of causing diplomatic incidents due to Johnson's controversial statements in the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At preschool he tried to govern every person, including the aides and teachers.  And I was wondering Why did Alex do this? The answer is:","output":"Alex's behavior in preschool can primarily be attributed to his upbringing by his parents and the environment he was exposed to at home. When parents indulge their child excessively and do not enforce rules or boundaries, it often leads to the development of spoiled and entitled behaviors. In Alex's case, the lack of discipline and consistent guidance might have led him to believe that he can control or govern others around him. There are several reasons why Alex might have exhibited such behavior at preschool: 1. Lack of boundaries: Since Alex's parents never disciplined him or set clear expectations, he might have never learned to understand the concept of boundaries - both his own and those of others. This lack of understanding could have led him to believe that it was acceptable to try and control others, including the aides and teachers. 2. An inflated sense of self-importance: Continuous pampering and the absence of discipline can foster a belief that the child is special or superior to others. In Alex's case, this inflated sense of self-importance might have driven him to feel entitled to make decisions for others or assert control over them. 3. Reinforcement of controlling behavior: If Alex's parents catered to his every whim and allowed him to govern all aspects of their lives, he might have simply carried that behavior into preschool. Having never been taught that such behavior is inappropriate, Alex possibly continued to impose his will on others without considering the consequences. 4. Difficulty adapting to new environments: In some cases, a child who has been consistently spoiled may struggle to adapt to environments outside their home, where they're not the center of attention and rules are more strictly enforced. Consequently, they might try to recreate the dynamics they're familiar with by attempting to govern others in the new setting. To address this issue, it's essential for parents to establish boundaries, enforce appropriate consequences, and cultivate empathy in their child. Consistency in parenting and the development of social skills can help prevent and correct behaviors like those exhibited by Alex. Additionally, teachers and caregivers play a vital role in addressing such behaviors to ensure a healthy and respectful learning environment for all children."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: The hourly 50-period SMA broke through the slower 200-period SMA, adding credence to the recent bearish USD/NOK profile. From here, if USD/NOK spot rises closer to the level where the moving averages crossed, then sellers might see it as an opportunity to reenter at a better price. Furthermore, a convincing break through the 50-SMA signals a neutral tone, shifting positive above the 200-SMA. Hypothesis: The hourly 50-period SMA broke is highest level the SMA has ever been and the 200 period  is the lowest","output":"Alright, let's break this down for a 5-year-old: Imagine we are looking at a fancy graph that helps people understand how two things called USD and NOK are related. On this graph, we have something called SMA, which is just a wiggly line that helps us see how the relationship between USD and NOK changes over time. Now, there are two SMAs: the 50-period SMA is a faster wiggly line, while the 200-period SMA is a slower wiggly line. The fast line moved up and crossed the slow line, which means things are not looking great for the relationship between USD and NOK. People who pay attention to these lines might think that when the fast line goes up near the spot where it crossed the slow line, it's a good time to make some actions. And if the fast line goes above the slow line in a convincing way, things might change from not-so-good to better. So, the hypothesis is not entirely accurate. We cannot say that the hourly 50-period SMA is at its highest level ever or the 200-period is at its lowest. What we can say is that the 50-period SMA crossed the 200-period SMA, and people watching the graph might base their decisions on these changes."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms.

She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day.

Cue loud, mean girl laughter. When #1 resumed her post next to me at the front desk, I calmly told her, “I'm cashing out, and leaving. I'm uncomfortable.” And I did. It was noon.

Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: FOr what even is the vicar writing a sermon? Movie plot title: Keeping Mum Movie plot: In the opening scene, as pregnant young Rosie Jones (Emilia Fox) rides on a train, her very large trunk starts leaking blood. When questioned by the police, she calmly reveals that the two dismembered bodies inside are of her unfaithful husband and his mistress. She is then sentenced by the judge (Roger Hammond) to a secure unit for the criminally insane for manslaughter.Forty-three years later, in the village of Little Wallop, Walter Goodfellow, the vicar (Rowan Atkinson) is very busy writing the perfect sermon for a conference, having no idea about the problems in his house, which include the unfulfilled sexual needs of his wife Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas) who subsequently starts an affair with her golf instructor, Lance (Patrick Swayze); the rebellious nature of his daughter Holly (Tamsin Egerton) who constantly picks up new boyfriends; and son Petey (Toby Parkes) who is bullied by schoolmates. Then everything changes with the arrival of the new housekeeper Grace (Maggie Smith).Walter and Gloria first meet her when they fail to fetch Petey from school and see him strolling with her. Gloria becomes very angry, thinking that Grace is trying to kidnap him and is appeased only when the latter identifies herself by showing an envelope with her name on it. Grace is installed into their lives and learns about some of the problems in the house Clarence, the neighbour's (Mr. Brown's) nuisance-barking Jack Russell terrier, who disturbs Gloria's sleep; the boys who bully Petey; and the golf instructor with whom Gloria is having an affair. Walter does not know anything about any of this - the only problem he has is the toxic blue-green algae in the garden pond. Grace resolves to solve these problems in her own way. She first kills the dog, Clarence, and when his owner finds out that his dog has been killed, she kills him, too. She sabotages the bullies' bicycles, injuring one of them and thereby making Petey very happy. She catches the golf instructor outside the house one night, videotaping Holly undressing, and...

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who calls someone who dies in an ambush? , can you please find it?   Mack \\"Truck\\" Turner is a former professional football player who becomes a Los Angeles-based bounty hunter after an injury. Truck visits his girlfriend, Annie, who is in jail and wants to leave LA when released. Truck and his partner Jerry Barnes go to collect their bounty from Nate Dinwiddie, a bail bondsman, who refers them to Fogarty, a bail bondsman after a pimp who skipped bail named Gator. The two visit Dorinda, who runs Gator's stable of prostitutes. Truck and Jerry wait for Gator to visit, and chase him, but Gator escapes.  A tip from Truck's friend Duke allows them to locate Gator again, and kill Gator when he attempts to shoot Truck. Dorinda threatens Gator's former whores to keep them in line. Dorinda offers Gator's competing pimps a deal: whoever kills Truck gets to replace Gator while she runs the stable. The only pimp interested in the violence is Harvard Blue. Truck survives several ambushes by Blue's goons.  When Blue points out that Dorinda will not be able to deal with Truck, they agree to share the cost of getting rid of Truck, and Blue will take over more control of Gator's stable. Blue's men force Nate to call Truck and tell him that there is a big job. Truck does not feel sober enough after a night of partying, so he calls Jerry, who dies in Blue's ambush. Nate warns Truck of the hit out on him. Truck frames Annie for shoplifting, and the police arrest her. Truck visits Nate again in the hospital.  Truck gives Nate Jerry's gun for protection, and then they shoot Blue's goons when they burst in. Blue flees, but Truck shoots him. Blue dies a few minutes later in the driver's seat of his car. Truck confronts Dorinda and more goons at her house, and kills her when she reaches for a gun.

But Scunthorpe broke the deadlock on 23 minutes, when Hopper headed in Conor Townsend's inch-perfect cross on the overlap. Wimbledon were reeling and Iron doubled their lead four minutes before the break when Darius Charles clipped Hopper's heels, Josh Morris coolly slotting home. Dons manager Neal Ardley switched formation at half-time, bringing on Tom Elliott and Dean Parrett, and they combined on 62 minutes. Elliott met Parrett's free-kick with a thundering header onto the crossbar before Charles converted the rebound six yards out. Elliott then almost equalised minutes later, heading Barry Fuller's cross inches wide of the near post.

Two of the best actors of their time-Walter Matthau & George Burns collaborate with Neil Simon and all of the other actors that are in this film + director Herbert Ross, and all of that makes this stage adaption come true. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70's. I love the type of humor in this film, it just makes me laugh so hard. I got this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper-only 3). I watched it as soon as I got home, but I had to watch it again because I kept missing a few parts the first time. The second time I watched it, it felt a lot better, and I laughed a lot harder. I'm definitely going to re-get this on DVD because I HAVE to see the special features. It's very funny how that happens. Two people work together as entertainers/actors/performers. They get along well on stage, but really argue off stage, they can't survive another minute with each other, then some 15 years later, you want to reunite them for a TV special. You can find that in this film. Matthau & Burns were terrific in this film. It's a damn shame they died. George Burns deserved that Oscar. He gave a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this movie was filmed. So far, he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor. He deserved that Golden Globe. Although many people might disagree with what I am about to say, everybody in this film gave a strong performance. This Comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it.

This production was made in the middle 1980s, and appears to be the first serious attempt to put BLEAK HOUSE on celluloid. No film version of the novel was ever attempted (it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other, so that it would have been very hard to prune it down). The novel was the only attempt by Dickens to make a central narrator (one of two in the work) a woman, Esther Summerson. Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle, who (in typical Dickens style) mistreat her. She is illegitimate, but they won't tell her anything about her parentage. Later we get involved with the gentry, Sir Leicester Dedlock, and his wife. Lady Honoria Deadlock (Dame Diana Rigg) is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor Tulkinghorn (Peter Vaughn). We also are involved with the actions of Richard Carstone (Esther's boyfriend) in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case, Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, which everyone (even Richard's cousin John Jarndyce - played by Desmond Elliot) warns is not worth the effort. Dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction. Starting with the breach of promise case in PICKWICK PAPERS, Dickens looked closely at the law. Mr. Bumble said it was \\"a ass\\" in OLIVER TWIST and Dickens would consistently support that view. He looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in TWIST, that the law barely tries to cure. He attacks the Chancery and outdated estate laws, as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers (Tulkinghorn, Vholes) in BLEAK HOUSE. In LITTLE DORRIT he attacks the debtors' prisons (he had hit it also in David COPPERFIELD). In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he looks at testators and wills. In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently was going to go to a murder trial. Dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries, including Thackeray. But the novel also looks at other problems (like charity and religious hypocrisy, the budding Scotland Yard detective force, social snobbery in the industrial revolution). He also uses the novel to satirize various people: Leigh Hunt the writer, Inspector Fields of Scotland Yard, and even the notorious Maria Manning.

Please answer the following question: “Have you ever been in a situation that was getting out of control and you were able to calm it down before it escalated further? What was the situation and what did you do or say?” As senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won’t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient. On one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own. Suddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says “[insert demand here] or I’m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].” The situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, “STOP! DROP IT, NOW!” He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying. What happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it’s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren’t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation’s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved. * IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools. The pocket knife is commonly used throughout camping trips. We have a set of rules and responsibilities set to the users so that they are used for the camping purposes.

Given the question: I went over to a guy's house to see a movie that he had acted in. It was our first date. He starts the movie and I settle back to watch. I was in film school and the guy, Nick, had told me he wanted my “professional” opinion. We're five minutes into the movie when Nick reaches for the remote and says, “Let's fast forward to my part.” I reply that, in order to adequately critique the movie, I should see it from the beginning. Nick assures me that his scene is self-contained and needs no context. A fight scene plays. Nick pauses and asks, “What did you think?” I look confused and Nick says, “Did you miss me? Let's play it again.” I watch the scene again, but still can't make out Nick. Nick rewinds, plays and pauses. “There I am,” he says, gazing fondly at the screen. Except the screen was gray. No actors. No landscape. Nothing, but gray snow. “What do you think,” he asked, his eyes never leaving the empty screen. At that point, I realized Nick was crazy. “That's great!,” I said. “But look at the time. Time sure flies when you're having fun.” Nick was still staring at the screen with a strange little smile. I stood up. Nick stood up, now not smiling. “You're not going anywhere,” Nick said. It's funny how fear works. I've found that in times of danger, adrenaline supersedes fear. I managed to trick Nick, hide from Nick and finally to escape after more than an hour of suspense. Turns out it wasn't even Nick's place.

Have we lost you? Don't feel too bad. Unless you're well-versed in genetics and neurology, you probably re-read that sentence a few times before moving on - a feature of science papers that, according to new research, has been slowly getting worse.      It's not just jargon that has become increasingly dense over the past century, according to a team of neuroscientists from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, but the language of science itself has also become more taxing to decipher.      To test whether published research has become harder to read over time, the researchers downloaded 707,452 biomedical articles from 122 journals in the science database PubMed, all produced between 1881 and 2015.      The papers' abstracts were then analysed according to two measures of readability:      the Flesch Reading Ease, which provides a score based largely on things like sentence length and the number of syllables per word      the New Dale-Chall Readability Formulae, which analyses text based on a general familiarity of words.      Readability tests such as these are often used to determine whether a text is appropriate for children and young adults at a particular stage of learning, with levels fine-tuned to match a grade or year level in the US.      Based on an average of annual scores, the researchers identified a steady decline in the readability of the abstracts in scientific papers over the past century, finding that more than 26 percent of the texts they analysed required a college graduate (tertiary) level of English to comprehend, up from about 16 percent in 1960.      This rise represented not only more field-specific jargon, such as the aforementioned \\"VTA glutamatergic neurons\\", but an increase in what the researchers called in-group scientific language, or 'science-ese' - words such as \\"robust\\", \\"underlying\\", or \\"furthermore\\".      Of course, one explanation for why science is getting harder to read could be that science itself is becoming more complex, requiring new words to describe more specific concepts.      But if that were that simple, the researchers would expect the jargon and science-ese to be more diverse than what they found, which suggests something else is going on.      The research has so far only analysed one field – biomedicine – and the results have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, so we can't read too much into them just yet. But if they can be replicated with further research, the study could hint at an underlying 'tribalism' that is making science less accessible to the wider community.      On its own, jargon and 'in-group' language can be useful, speeding up communication and reducing the risk of misunderstanding.      But jargon can also have a habit of making it harder for outsiders to understand a piece of writing, and also act as a way to identify and control who is part of a community and who is not.      Not that it's the general public alone or those outside of a field who could benefit from more plain-speaking science – the researchers point out that scientists who rewrite their abstracts for a lay audience are better able to comprehend their own work.      They also suggest that writing more plainly could help address science's reproducibility crisis by improving the communication of the methods of previous studies.      As science writer Philip Ball points out in a column in Nature, one thing to keep in mind here is that tests designed to evaluate the reading levels of pre-teen US school children might not clearly lend themselves to testing scientific literature.      But he added his own observation – not only is readability about the words in the story; it's about the words that are missing.      \\"As a regular reader of research papers, I am often staggered by their leaps of reasoning or omission of key details, especially when I discover that these gaps are no less real to experts,\\" Ball writes.      He also suggests that papers could be improved by scientists learning to look outside of their field to find good role models.      \\"Why not encourage students to put down Nature and pick up Darwin, Dawkins or Dickens?\\" suggests Ball.      Good science can be held back without good communication, so taking a page from their favourite writer's book is something all scientists – and science writers – could certainly benefit from.      This research was published on the pre-print website bioRxiv. ||||| Modern scientific texts are more impenetrable than they were over a century ago, suggests a team of researchers in Sweden. It’s easy to believe that.      You can be confident, for example, that if you pick up a random copy of Nature (which has long prided itself on the relative accessibility of its papers), you may find sentences like this in the abstracts:      Here we show that in mice DND1 binds a UU(A/U) trinucleotide motif predominantly in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNA, and destabilizes target mRNAs through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.      But this type of jargon-heavy phrasing is not the only problem that neuroscientist William Hedley Thompson and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm are tackling in their analysis. They scoured more than 700,000 English-language abstracts published between 1881 and 2015 in 122 leading biomedical journals. Their study1, posted on the preprint server bioRxiv on 28 March, suggests that it’s not just the technical jargon that has been on the rise.      There has also, the authors say, been an increase in “general scientific jargon”: that is, multisyllable words that have non-technical meanings but have become part of the standard lexicon of the science paper. These words include ‘robust’, ‘significant’, ‘furthermore’ and ‘underlying’ — all familiar enough in daily use, but markedly more prevalent in the scientific literature. The words aren’t inherently opaque, but their accumulation adds to the mental effort involved in reading the text.      Fourth-grade readers      Thompson and his colleagues examined the texts using standard indicators of reading ease, which measure factors such as the number of syllables per word, the number of words in a sentence and the number of words in the paper not included in a predefined list of common words (the New Dale–Chall, or NDC, list). By these measures, the trends seem very clear: a steady and marked decline in readability since 1881.      You could argue over the technicalities of the study. The list of common words is measured against the comprehension skills of US fourth-graders — children aged nine and ten — and its applicability to the scientific literature is not clear, points out Yellowlees Douglas at the University of Florida in Gainesville, author of The Reader’s Brain (Cambridge University Press, 2015), a writing manual that bases its advice on neuroscience. More problematically, metrics such as syllable-counting are too simplistic: for example, they rate words such as ‘orange’ and ‘praxis’ as equivalent.      What’s more, says physicist Luís Amaral of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who has studied trends in scientific publications, the data from before 1960 are too sparse and variable to be very reliable, and the trends in the data from after 1960 are less clear.      Besides, Amaral says, distinguishing between technical and general jargon isn’t easy. And an increase in technical jargon is not wholly a bad thing: it can reflect the appearance of useful concepts and techniques in science. ‘Sequencing’ was probably not part of the scientific vocabulary before 1980, he says, but who would complain about its presence now?      However, the need for specialized terms cannot completely explain the increased impenetrability of modern scientific literature.      Thompson and his colleagues are probably right to pin some of that opacity on a habitual, almost ritualistic use of ‘power words’ such as ‘distinct’ and ‘novel’. But a focus on word-counting risks distracting from what really matters about good writing.      Tangled sentences      Short, common words can be used to write sentences that are awfully hard to understand, simply because of poor grammatical construction. This is the point of Douglas’s book: the reader expects to encounter concepts in a particular order, without having to search back for the right noun to go with a verb, or having to untangle intervening information-filled clauses. You can always look up jargon, but with a poorly constructed sentence you’re on your own.      And comprehensibility isn’t just about what a paper says, but also about what it leaves out. As a regular reader of research papers, I am often staggered by their leaps of reasoning or omission of key details, especially when I discover that these gaps are no less real to experts.      So how could the readability of scientific papers be improved? First, by recognizing that good writing doesn’t happen by magic. It can be taught — but rarely is. Douglas suspects that many first drafts of papers are written by junior members of a research team who, lacking any model for what good writing looks like, take their lead from what is already in the journals. And there “they see the jargon and complexity as markers of what passes as scientific writing”, she adds. Such self-reinforcing mimicry could certainly account for the trends highlighted by Thompson and his colleagues.      So where do you find good models of writing? Obviously, from good writers — not necessarily in the sciences, but anywhere2. There is hard evidence that sophisticated readers make sophisticated writers3. Why not encourage students to put down Nature and pick up Darwin, Dawkins or Dickens? |||||","output":"A group of scientists in Sweden found that scientific texts have become more difficult to understand over the past century.

The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\".  - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\".  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.  - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.  - Vanishing Point are a progressive / symphonic metal band based in Melbourne , Australia .

Wilcox and starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, Leslie Nielsen, Warren Stevens, Jack Kelly and Robby the Robot. Shot in Eastmancolor and CinemaScope, it is considered one of the great science fiction films of the 1950s, a precursor of what was to come for science fiction cinema. The characters and isolated setting have been compared to those in William Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\". Its plot contains certain story analogues to the play.  - Leslie William Nielsen, (11 February 192628 November 2010) was a Canadian actor, comedian, and producer. He appeared in more than 100 films and 150 television programs, portraying more than 220 characters.  - Fred McLeod Wilcox ( December 22 , 1907 -- September 23 , 1964 ) was an American motion picture director . He worked for Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer for many years and directed the classic family film Lassie Come Home and the science fiction classic Forbidden Planet , which were enshrined on the National Film Preservation Board 's National Film Registry in 1993 and 2013 respectively .  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised)  23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.  - Hugo D. Butler (4 May 1914  7 January 1968) was a Canadian born screenwriter working in Hollywood who was blacklisted by the movie studios in the 1950s.  - Science fiction film (or sci-fi) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies. Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.  - Roderick Andrew Anthony Jude McDowall (17 September 1928  3 October 1998), known as Roddy McDowall, was an English-American actor, voice artist, film director and photographer.

Author Eric Knight introduced the reading public to the canine character of Lassie in a magazine story published on December 17, 1938, in \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\", a story which he later expanded to a novel and published in 1940 to critical and commercial success. In 1943, the novel was adapted to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer feature film \\"Lassie Come Home\\" starring Roddy McDowall as the boy Joe Carraclough, Pal as Lassie, and featuring Elizabeth Taylor. The motion picture was selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry. A remake of \\"Lassie Come Home\\", entitled \\"Lassie\\", was released in 2005.  - United Artists (UA) is an American film and television entertainment studio. The studio was founded in 1919 by D. W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks with the intention of controlling their own interests rather than depending upon commercial studios. The studio was repeatedly bought, sold and restructured over the ensuing century.  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - The National Film Registry (NFR) is the United States National Film Preservation Board's (NFPB) selection of films for preservation in the Library of Congress. The NFPB, established by the National Film Preservation Act of 1988, was reauthorized by acts of Congress in 1992, 1996, 2005, and again in October 2008. The NFPB's mission, to which the NFR contributes, is to ensure the survival, conservation, and increased public availability of America's film heritage. The 1996 law also created the non-profit National Film Preservation Foundation which, although affiliated with the NFPB, raises money from the private sector.  - The National Film Preservation Foundation (NFPF) is an independent, nonprofit organization created by the U.S. Congress to help save Americas film heritage. Growing from a national planning effort led by the Library of Congress, the NFPF began operations in 1997. It supports activities nationwide that preserve American films and improve film access for study, education, and exhibition. The NFPF's top priority is saving orphan films, so called because are not protected by commercial interests and are unlikely to survive without public support. Through its grant programs, the NFPF has helped archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and universities from all 50 states preserve American films and make them available to the public.  - The Library of Congress (\\"LOC\\") is the research library that officially serves the United States Congress and is the \\"de facto\\" national library of the United States. It is the oldest federal cultural institution in the United States. The Library is housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.; it also maintains the Packard Campus in Culpeper, Virginia, which houses the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center.  - CinemaScope is an anamorphic lens series used, from 1953 to 1967, for shooting widescreen movies. Its creation in 1953 by Spyros P. Skouras, the president of 20th Century Fox, marked the beginning of the modern anamorphic format in both principal photography and movie projection.  - Robby the Robot is a fictional character and science fiction icon who first appeared in the 1956 film \\"Forbidden Planet\\".

News article: Incurable American Excess A few years ago, Americans and Europeans were asked in a Pew Global Attitudes survey what was more important: “freedom to pursue life’s goals without state interference,” or “state guarantees that nobody is in need.” In the United States, 58 percent chose freedom and only 35 percent a state pledge to eradicate neediness. In Britain, the response was the opposite: 55 percent opted for state guarantees and just 38 percent for freedom. On the European Continent — in Germany, France and Spain — those considering state protection as more important than freedom from state interference rose to 62 percent. This finding gets to the heart of trans-Atlantic differences. Americans, who dwell in a vast country, sparsely populated by European standards, are hardwired to the notion of individual self-reliance. Europeans, with two 20th-century experiences of cataclysmic societal fracture, are bound to the idea of social solidarity as prudent safeguard and guarantor of human decency. The French see the state as a noble idea and embodiment of citizens’ rights. Americans tend to see the state as a predator on those rights. The French ennoble the dutiful public servant. Americans ennoble the disruptive entrepreneur. To return from Europe to the United States, as I did recently, is to be struck by the crumbling infrastructure, the paucity of public spaces, the conspicuous waste (of food and energy above all), the dirtiness of cities and the acuteness of their poverty. It is also to be overwhelmed by the volume and vital clamor of American life, the challenging interaction, the bracing intermingling of Americans of all stripes, the strident individualism. Europe is more organized, America more alive. Europe purrs; even its hardship seems somehow muted. America revs. The differences can feel violent. In his intriguing new book, “The United States of Excess,” Robert Paarlberg, a political scientist, cites the 2011 Pew survey as he grapples with these divergent cultures. His focus is on American overconsumption of fuel and food. Why, he asks, is the United States an “outlier” in greenhouse gas emissions and obesity, and what, if anything, will it do about it? Per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the United States are about twice those of the other wealthy nations of the 34-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. American obesity (just over a third of American adults are now obese) is running at about twice the European average and six times the Japanese. Paarlberg argues persuasively that these American phenomena are linked. He finds their causes in demographic, cultural and political factors. A resource-rich, spacious nation, mistrustful of government authority, persuaded that responsibility is individual rather than collective, optimistic about the capacity of science and technology to resolve any problem, and living in a polarized political system paralyzed by its “multiple veto points,” tends toward “a scrambling form of adaptation” rather than “effective mitigation.” Americans, in their majority, don’t want to increase taxes on fossil fuels or tax sugar-sweetened drinks because they see such measures as a regressive encroachment on individual freedoms — to drive an automobile and consume what you want. They won’t go the German route of promoting renewables like solar and wind power by guaranteeing higher fixed prices for those who generate it because higher electricity costs would result. Whether it comes to food or fuel, they don’t want measures where “voting-age adults are being coerced into a lifestyle change.” Individualism trumps all — and innovation, it is somehow believed, will save the country from individualism’s ravages. Paarlberg notes that: “Americans eat alone while at work, alone while commuting to work in the car, alone at the food court while shopping, alone at home while watching TV, and alone in front of the refrigerator both before and after normal mealtime.” But if all that eating continues to generate obesity — as it will — Americans tend to put their faith in “improved bariatric surgeries, and new blockbuster diet drugs” that “will be challenges welcomed by America’s innovative and responsive private market institutions.” Rather than cut back, they prefer to consume more — whether fuel or food — and then find ways to offset excess. With the strong policy measures needed to control excess consumption — taxes, regulations and mandates — blocked, political leaders are “tempted to shift more resources and psychological energy toward the second-best path of adaptation,” Paarlberg writes: Easier, and potentially more profitable, to develop drought-resistant farm crops or improve coastal protection systems than tackle global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. His conclusions are pessimistic. The world should not expect America to change. Its response to overconsumption is inadequate. On global warming, the country adapts but does not confront, content “to protect itself, and itself alone.” On obesity, it shuns the kind of coordinated policy action that will help the less fortunate, particularly disadvantaged minorities. The question, of course, is whether America’s virtues — its creative churn, vitality and energy — are intrinsic to these vices. My own pessimistic conclusion is that they probably are. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about the differences between Americans and Europeans in terms of their views, lifestyle, and priorities. The author points out that Americans value individual freedom more than state protection and that they have a higher rate of overconsumption of fuel and food, leading to issues like greenhouse gas emissions and obesity. The article states that Americans are less willing to accept policies that restrict their individual freedoms, and instead prefer to find innovative solutions to the problems caused by their overconsumption.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making a fishing pond in your backyard, there are several steps and factors to consider for the planning and construction of the pond. Here's a detailed guide to help you: 1. Research and planning:    a. The first step is to study the local regulations and building requirements that apply to creating a pond on residential property. Check with your local municipality and confirm if any permits are required.        b. Research the types of fish you want to keep in the pond. Keep in mind the climate, water parameters, and compatibility with other fish species in the pond. 2. Location and size:    a. Choose the right location for your pond. Several factors to consider include sunlight exposure, proximity to trees (to avoid excessive leaf debris), accessibility for maintenance, and distance from underground utility lines.        b. Determine the size and depth of the pond based on the fish species you plan to keep and the aesthetics of your backyard. Remember that a larger pond will require more maintenance, while a deeper pond will provide a more stable environment for the fish. 3. Design and layout:    a. Choose between a formal or natural design. Formal designs have geometric shapes, while natural designs mimic natural bodies of water with irregular shapes and soft edges.        b. Plan the layout of edging, lighting, waterfalls, filtration systems, and landscaping around the pond. 4. Excavation and construction:    a. Mark the outline of the pond using rope, spray paint, or wooden stakes. Include space for plumbing and filtration equipment.    b. Excavate the outlined area. This will likely require using shovels or renting excavation equipment.    c. Apply a layer of sand or geotextile fabric at the bottom of the hole to create a barrier between the pond liner and any sharp objects in the soil.    d. Install the flexible pond liner or rigid pond shell. Make sure it's secure and fits the contours of the pond. 5. Filtration system and water features:    a. Choose a suitable filter to ensure good water quality. The most common types are mechanical/biological filters, skimmers, and UV filters. Consider the size of your pond, fish population, and water features when selecting a filter.    b. Install a pump that can handle the capacity of your pond. The pump should be able to circulate the entire pond volume within 1-2 hours.    c. Add water features, such as waterfalls or fountains, to improve water circulation and create a relaxing atmosphere. 6. Landscaping and finishing touches:    a. Landscape the area around the pond. This can include adding rocks, plants, or decorative items.    b. Add a border of stones or pavers around the pond to create a neat edge.    c. Install outdoor lighting for safety and to highlight the pond's features at night. 7. Introduce fish and maintain the pond:    a. Fill the pond with dechlorinated water and allow it to settle for a few days.    b. Introduce fish gradually, monitoring water quality and making necessary adjustments to ensure their health and well-being.    c. Establish a regular maintenance schedule, including checking for leaks, trimming plants, cleaning sludge and debris, and testing water quality regularly. By following these steps, you're well on your way to create a beautiful fishing pond in your backyard. Enjoy the process of planning and building, and soon enough, you'll have a tranquil space where you can relax and enjoy the rewards of your hard work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"The Enchantment\\" Genre: Comedy/Mystery Step 1: Establishing the background In the small town of Bellwood, a mysterious phenomenon has suddenly begun occurring at the local theater. Whenever a certain indie movie featuring an actress named Heidi is screened, the female audience members strip off their clothes soon after Heidi takes off her clothing in a scene. This bewildering incident has attracted the attention of outsiders. Step 2: Introduce the protagonist Alice, a young aspiring journalist, is fascinated by the strange events happening in her otherwise ordinary town. Eager to find the reason behind this bizarre phenomenon, she begins investigating while balancing her responsibilities at the local news outlet. Step 3: Exacerbating factors Rumors start spreading throughout the town that there might be a wicked spell, causing both panic and excitement among the townsfolk. Speculations run wild, garnering massive interest in the phenomenon. The theater owner profits from the increasing demand for the screenings, furthering media coverage and curiosity. Step 4: Diving deeper into the mysteries Alice realizes that Heidi was a resident of Bellwood before becoming an actress. She begins digging into Heidi's past and uncovers that Heidi had an ongoing rivalry with her childhood friend, Valerie, who became a practitioner of witchcraft. Alice suspects that the unexplained phenomenon might be tied to their rivalry and Heidi's sudden fame. Step 5: Complicating elements As Alice digs deeper, she starts receiving mysterious threats, warning her to stop investigating. Undeterred, Alice decides to interview Heidi, who is set to return to Bellwood for a brief visit. Heidi denies any knowledge of the unusual occurrences but confesses that however successful she might be, she longed for the same attention Valerie received in their hometown. Step 6: Climactic confrontation Alice confronts Valerie during one of her witchcraft gatherings, accusing her of casting a spell on the theater. Valerie admits to placing an enchantment on the film reel but reveals that its effects were unintended. She intended to simply embarrass Heidi but accidentally caused the stripping phenomenon. Step 7: Resolution Valerie, remorseful for her actions, lifts the spell using a counter-enchantment. The phenomenon ceases to occur, and life in Bellwood returns to normal. Alice's investigation earns her recognition as a budding journalist and brings her closer to solving the mystery of human nature and the lengths people will go to for attention. Heidi and Valerie reconcile, acknowledging that their rivalry was a product of jealousy and rekindle their friendship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined.  But I can use this background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1]  What is an answer for this question: Which location most probably didn't suffer land loss or similar processes, location A or location B?

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which century saw northeast Michigan's water table increased, sixteenth century or twentieth century?  In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone.  Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. A:","output":"The twentieth century saw northeast Michigan's water table increased. This is because the paragraph mentions that vegetation clearance and heavy irrigation occurred during this time, leading to an increase in the water table and the mobilization of salts."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A doll is a model of a human being, often used as a toy for children. Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.  - Clothing (also called clothes and attire) is fiber and textile material worn on the body. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of nearly all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on body type, social, and geographic considerations. Some clothing types can be gender-specific.  - The term living statue refers to a street artist who poses like a statue or mannequin , usually with realistic statue - like makeup , sometimes for hours at a time . Living statue performers can fool passersby and a number of hidden camera shows on television have used living statues to startle people . As with all performing arts , living statue performers may perform as buskers .  - A craft is a pastime or a profession that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. In a historical sense, particularly as pertinent to the Middle Ages and earlier, the term is usually applied to people occupied in small-scale production of goods, or their maintenance, for example by tinkers. The traditional terms \\"craftsman\\" and \\"craftswoman\\" are nowadays often replaced by \\"artisan\\" and rarely by \\"craftsperson\\" (craftspeople).  - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast.  - A statue is a sculpture representing one or more people or animals (including abstract concepts allegorically represented as people or animals), normally full-length, as opposed to a bust, and at least close to life-size, or larger. A small statue, usually small enough to be picked up, is called a statuette or figurine, while one that is more than twice life-size is called a colossal statue.  - A figurine (a diminutive form of the word \\"figure\\") or statuette is a small statue that represents a human, deity or animal, or in practice a pair or small group of them. Figurines have been made in many media, with pottery, metal, wood, glass, and today plastic or resin the most significant. Ceramic figurines not made of porcelain are called terracottas in historical contexts.  - First aid is the assistance given to any person suffering a sudden illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, and/or promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing CPR while awaiting an ambulance, as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut. First aid is generally performed by the layperson, with many people trained in providing basic levels of first aid, and others willing to do so from acquired knowledge. Mental health first aid is an extension of the concept of first aid to cover mental health.  - Computer simulations reproduce the behavior of a system using a model. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, climatology, chemistry and biology, human systems in economics, psychology, social science, and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.  - Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time. The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors/functions of the selected physical or abstract system or process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time.  - Tracheal intubation, usually simply referred to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (windpipe) to maintain an open airway or to serve as a conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction.  - A street artist is a person who creates their art or craft in public, most usually on streets, for monetary reward. Some artists also sell their art or craft. Artists include portrait artists, caricaturists, artists who replicate famous paintings on the street itself or on large canvases, hair braiders, friendship bracelet makers and many others.  - A mannequin (also called a manikin, dummy, lay figure or dress form) is an often articulated doll used by artists, tailors, dressmakers, windowdressers and others especially to display or fit clothing. The term is also used for life-sized dolls with simulated airways used in the teaching of first aid, CPR, and advanced airway management skills such as tracheal intubation and for human figures used in computer simulation to model the behavior of the human body. During the 1950s, mannequins were used in nuclear tests to help show the effects of nuclear weapons on humans.  - A dress form is a three-dimensional model of the torso used for fitting clothing that is being designed or sewed. When making a piece of clothing, it can be put on the dress form so one can see the fit and drape of the garment as it would appear on a body, and make adjustments or alterations. Dress forms come in all sizes and shapes for almost every article of clothing that can be made. Dress forms in standard clothing sizes are used to make patterns, while adjustable dress forms allow garments to be tailored to fit a specific individual.  - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art.  - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'craft'.

Question: What did Alan actually set in when leaving the building? Movie plot title: The Final Cut Movie plot: In this futuristic tale, Alan Hakman (Robin Williams) witnesses the death of his childhood friend who had fallen off a plank of wood in the abandoned building in which they were playing. Flash to the present, and chips called \\"Zoe\\" are inserted into the brain at birth and record a person's entire life; when the person dies, the video is edited and shown at the funeral. Video editor (\\"cutter\\") Alan Hakman edits the recordings of people's lives according to the wishes of the subject's family, interviewing the person's family members to get an idea of what to look for in the recordings. Of course, in the case of some unscrupulous people, the bad parts are left out, but the entire recording of a person's life is therefore subject to scrutiny. So, in some cases, Hakman was knowingly burying the bad and highlighting the good. As a result, Alan is turned into a cold megalomaniac, but things change when he stumbles across a subject's memory of his friend, who he thought was dead. In searching for a record of his friend's Zoe chip, he finds none, as only 20% of all people have the implants. What he does find is a record of his own implant, of which he was unaware. He goes about accessing the memory, which shows that Alan's friend was still breathing, and the \\"blood\\" Alan thought he remembered stepping in as he was leaving the building turned out to be paint. Meantime, the Zoe chip of his subject is destroyed during a confrontation in his office. Confronted by activists who want his subject's life opened to all, Alan attempts to flee because his memory chip recorded what he saw of the subject's life, but is shot and killed by the activist, who justifies his actions, hence Alan was not killed in vain.

Wall Street is an eight-block-long street running roughly northwest to southeast from Broadway to South Street, at the East River, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. Over time, the term has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry (even if financial firms are not physically located there), or New York-based financial interests.  Anchored by Wall Street, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Board of Trade, and the former American Stock Exchange.  There are varying accounts about how the Dutch-named \\"de Waalstraat\\" got its name. A generally accepted version is that the name of the street was derived from a wall (actually a wooden palisade) on the northern boundary of the New Amsterdam settlement, built to protect against Native Americans, pirates, and the British.

The sentiment here leans negative as well. 3. The interjection \\"hahaha\\" is used to indicate laughter and amusement, softening the initial negative tone. It implies that the author is taking the situation lightly and does not see it as a severe or serious matter. This inclusion leads to a neutral or slightly positive sentiment. 4. Lastly, the question about having multiple layovers signifies curiosity about the circumstances of \\"@TheSideProject.\\" It might also imply a slight frustration or inconvenience experienced by the author. The sentiment related to this question is neutral, leaning slightly negative. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of playful skepticism, mild disappointment, casual humor, and curiosity. Overall, the sentiment veers more toward the negative side, but the lighthearted tone and friendly interaction signify that it is not overly negative or hostile. This can be perceived as a casual conversation between friends or acquaintances, communicating their emotions and thoughts about a particular situation without any strong or deeply negative feelings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We don't know what Tommy is doubtful of, but it is clear that he has some level of uncertainty, skepticism, or hesitancy. Hypothesis: \\"Tommy wasn't doubtful.\\" This statement claims that Tommy did not experience any doubt. It contradicts the premise, stating that Tommy didn't have any uncertainty, skepticism, or hesitancy.

Question: \\"Who disagreed with Zahm?\\"  Context: \\"Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Father John Zahm, a well-known scientist and naturalist of his time, faced disagreement from a number of theologians and conservative Catholics who had differing views on the relationship between science and religion. In his book, \\"Evolution and Dogma\\" (1896), Zahm defended aspects of the evolutionary theory as true and argued that even great Church teachers such as Thomas Aquinas and Augustine held similar views. This position invited criticism from those who viewed Zahm's ideas as incompatible with traditional Catholic teachings. One notable individual who disagreed with Zahm was Monsignor James J. Hennessey, who served as the rector of the Catholic University of America from 1896 to 1903. Hennessey strongly opposed Zahm's attempts to reconcile Catholic teaching with the theory of evolution, maintaining that the teachings of the Church and the tenets of evolution were fundamentally at odds. This disagreement eventually led to a larger conflict within the Catholic community in the United States, with various factions advocating either for or against the integration of scientific advancements, such as the theory of evolution, with religious doctrine. Additionally, Zahm's views faced opposition from Irish American Catholics, who believed that embracing the evolutionary theory would undermine the Church's authority and teachings. Their intervention in Rome even helped prevent Zahm from being censured by the Vatican. Another person who somewhat disagreed with Zahm on the issue of evolution was his fellow priest and colleague, Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. Although Carrier believed that scientific research and progress were not at odds with the Church's intellectual and moral culture, it appears as though he did not fully embrace Zahm's ideas regarding the compatibility of certain aspects of the evolutionary theory with Catholic teachings. Moreover, the general opposition that Zahm faced can also be attributed to some members of the Catholic hierarchy and many conservative laypeople who were apprehensive about the potential consequences of integrating scientific theories, such as evolution, with religious beliefs. This opposition was rooted in the deep concern that doing so could erode the authority of the Church and pose a threat to adherence to traditional doctrine. In summary, Father John Augustine Zahm's views on the compatibility of certain aspects of evolutionary theory with Catholic teachings faced disagreement from various individuals, including Monsignor James J. Hennessey, Irish American Catholics, and possibly Father Joseph Carrier, along with other conservative members of the Church. This opposition stemmed from concerns regarding the potential impact of Zahm's ideas on the Church's authority and adherence to traditional doctrine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 - July 17, 1959), better known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed \\"Lady Day\\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. In 1935 Holiday was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond to record current pop tunes with Teddy Wilson in the new swing style for the growing jukebox trade. They were given free rein to improvise the material. Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was revolutionary. Their first collaboration included \\"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\\" and \\"Miss Brown to You\\". \\"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\\" has been deemed her \\"claim to fame.\\" Brunswick did not favor the recording session, because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like Cleo Brown. After \\"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\\" garnered success, however, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right. She began recording under her own name a year later (on the 35-cent Vocalion label), producing a series of extraordinary performances with groups comprising the swing era's finest musicians. The sessions were co-produced by Hammond and Bernie Hanighen.  With their arrangements, Wilson and Holiday took pedestrian pop tunes, such as \\"Twenty-Four Hours a Day\\" (number 6 Pop) and \\"Yankee Doodle Went to Town\\", and turned them into jazz classics. Most of Holiday's recordings with Wilson or under her own name during the 1930s and early 1940s are regarded as important parts of the jazz vocal library. She was then in her twenties.  Another frequent accompanist was the tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a special rapport. He said, \\"I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices, if you don't be careful, you know, or the same mind, or something like that.\\" Young nicknamed her \\"Lady Day\\", and she called him \\"Prez\\".  Hammond spoke about the commercial impact of the Wilson-Holiday sides from 1935 to 1938, calling them a great asset to Brunswick. The record label, according to Hammond, was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. Wilson, Holiday, Young, and other musicians came into the studio without musical arrangements and improvised as they performed, dispensing with the expense of having written arrangements, so that the records they produced were cheap. Holiday was never given any royalties for her work, instead being paid a flat fee, which saved the company money. Some of the records produced were successful, such as \\"I Cried for You\\", which sold 15,000 copies. Hammond said of the record, \\"15,000 ... was a giant hit for Brunswick in those days. I mean a giant hit. Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.\\" What happened in 1936?","output":"1936 was a significant year in Billie Holiday's life and career. Several important events and collaborations occurred during this time, contributing to her growing success and influence in the jazz and music industry. 1. In 1936, Billie continued recording with Teddy Wilson, performing some of her most well-known songs, such as \\"I Cried for You,\\" which sold 15,000 copies and became a major hit. 2. Throughout 1936, Billie's success in the recording studio translated to increased popularity and demand for her live performances. She worked alongside numerous prominent musicians and jazz bands, earning a reputation for her emotive and captivating live performances. 3. In 1936, Billie Holiday and pianist Teddy Wilson recorded \\"A Fine Romance\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight,\\" both penned by prolific songwriting duo Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields. These tunes were part of the soundtrack for the film \\"Swing Time,\\" starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Billie's recordings showcased her unique ability to breathe new life into popular songs by transforming them into timeless jazz standards. 4. It was during this time that Billie Holiday continued working with Lester Young, establishing their strong musical rapport. Young played the tenor saxophone and regularly accompanied Holiday during live performances and recording sessions. Their mutual respect and admiration for each other led to Young giving her the nickname \\"Lady Day,\\" and her, in return, calling him \\"Prez.\\" 5. Billie's collaboration with Brunswick Records continued to thrive in 1936, producing numerous recordings that became essential parts of the jazz vocal canon. As an example, Billie recorded the song \\"Summertime\\" (from the opera \\"Porgy and Bess\\") in 1936 with Teddy Wilson, marking one of the earliest and most influential interpretations of George Gershwin's classic composition. In summary, 1936 was a pivotal year in Billie Holiday's career, as she continued to collaborate with prominent musicians, expand her discography, and captivate audiences with her unique vocal style. The events of this year further solidified her status as one of the most innovative and influential jazz musicians in history, setting the stage for her continued success throughout the late 1930s and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His contacts inform him that his target is a former general who took part in Argentina's last military dictatorship. Following a meeting with one of the co-conspirators, Anderson hears music and is shown a tango studio. He is immediately entranced by the dancing and wants to learn more about it, which leads to his meeting with Manuela, a local tango dancer and instructor. Things are not as easy as they seem.

This article: Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \\"The Early Dürer\\". contains an answer for the question: Whose portraits are described as unflinching records of the effects of ageing?, what is it ?

Without breathing, we could not survive. Curiously, the act of breathing itself is little more than an application of Boyle’s law. The lungs are a series of ever-narrowing tubes that end in a myriad of tiny sacs called alveoli. It is in the alveoli that oxygen from the air transfers to the bloodstream and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream transfers to the lungs for exhalation. For air to move in and out of the lungs, the pressure inside the lungs must change, forcing the lungs to change volume—just as predicted by Boyle’s law. The pressure change is caused by the diaphragm, a muscle that covers the bottom of the lungs. When the diaphragm moves down, it expands the size of our lungs. When this happens, the air pressure inside our lungs decreases slightly. This causes new air to rush in, and we inhale. The pressure decrease is slight—only 3 torr, or about 0.4% of an atmosphere. We inhale only 0.5–1.0 L of air per normal breath. Exhaling air requires that we relax the diaphragm, which pushes against the lungs and slightly decreases the volume of the lungs. This slightly increases the pressure of the air in the lungs, and air is forced out; we exhale. Only 1–2 torr of extra pressure is needed to exhale. So with every breath, our own bodies are performing an experimental test of Boyle’s law.   Q: The lungs are a series of ever-narrowing tubes that end in a myriad of tiny sacs called what?

Flights overseas are long, and you'll want to wear loose, comfortable clothes. If your flight is especially long, consider packing a pair of sweats for your flight in your carry-on. Change back into your original clothes for the landing. Some airports offer long-term parking rates for your car while you're away. Call or email about the long-term car storage options and the costs of each choice. If car storage isn't an affordable option for you, use a shuttle service, hire a taxi, or ask a friend/family member to drive you there. Check in for your flight as early as possible to go through security and board on time. You'll also have time to use the bathroom or grab something to eat before you depart. While you're waiting for your flight, bring something to relieve boredom: keep a book, journal, or game in your carry-on to entertain you while waiting. Dehydration is a common problem on long flights, which can lead to exhaustion or irritability. Buy a large water bottle to fill up before you board the flight so you can take it in your carry-on. Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeine before and during your flight, as both can lead to dehydration. Most nations require you to mark on an official form what goods you bring with you to their country.

Feelings, also known as emotions, are complex psychological states that involve subjective experiences, physiological responses, and behavioral expressions. Emotions play a significant role in our daily lives, affecting our thoughts, decisions, and actions.

Movie title: Mortal Kombat Movie plot: Once every generation, there is an inter-dimensional martial arts tournament known as Mortal Kombat, designed by the Elder Gods to limit invasions between the realms of the universe. If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn (voiced by Frank Welker) will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. They have already won nine; so this will be their tenth tournament. The Shaolin warrior Liu Kang (Robin Shou) and his comrades, Hollywood movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and U.S. Special Forces officer Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), were handpicked by Raiden (Christopher Lambert), the god of lightning and Earthrealm's defender, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu Kang seeks revenge against tournament host Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) for killing his brother Chan (Steven Ho); Sonya also has vengeance on her mind, pursuing crime lord Kano (Trevor Goddard) who killed her partner; Johnny Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise to the world.At Shang Tsung's island, Liu Kang is attracted to Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), Shao Kahn's adopted daughter; a wary Shang Tsung orders the creature Reptile (Keith Cooke) to keep a close eye on her. Liu defeats his first opponent, and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano. Johnny Cage encounters the demonic ninja Scorpion (Chris Casamassa), who teleports Cage to his lair in the Netherealm; there the two battle viciously, with Cage the eventual victor. Liu Kang engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him advice for his next battle (\\"Use the element which brings life\\"). Liu's next opponent is the ninja Sub-Zero (François Petit), who's defense seems impregnable because of his freezing abilities, until Liu Kang recalls Kitana's advice and turns the tables. Prince Goro (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), a huge, four-armed... The answer to this question is:","output":"Shang Tsung is the one who ordered the creature Reptile to spy on Princess Kitana. Shang Tsung is the host of the tournament and has a strong interest in making sure that his plans go smoothly.

Article: Before washing your socks, you’ll want to separate them into two loads: whites and colors. This keeps your socks looking vibrant and prevents any unwanted bleeding.  If you’re washing both dress socks and athletic socks, consider separating those as well. For example, you might have a load of colored dress socks, colored athletic socks, white dress socks, and white athletic socks. You may also wish to separate socks by material. For instance, consider washing wool socks separately from cotton and cotton-blend socks. If you only have a few pairs of white athletic socks to wash, throw them into the washing machine with any white towels that you have. There are many products out there, such as Tide Ultra Stain Release Liquid, aimed to get rid of stains. Purchase a stain remover and follow the directions on the bottle. It may instruct you to either soak your stained socks in the remover or apply the remover directly to the stains. Mix a scoop of Oxiclean powder into a gallon (3.8 L) of warm water and soak your stained socks for a few hours, or overnight if you’re dealing with a tougher stain. Then wash the stained socks. There are also many home remedies that you can try to get rid of different kinds of stains. Try sprinkling salt onto red wine stains or spraying hairspray onto ink stains before washing. Make a generic stain remover at home by mixing a 1:2 ratio of dish washing liquid and hydrogen peroxide. Doing this allows the socks to be cleaned as thoroughly as possible, because the odor-causing bacteria mostly reside inside of the sock. This will also help to minimize lint accumulation. If you often find yourself with single socks, consider pinning each pair together with a clothespin before putting them in the washing machine. This way, they’ll stay paired throughout the washing process and they’ll be easier to put away afterward. Put a load of dirty socks in the washing machine. Set the machine to gentle, press start, and pour in a mild laundry detergent to prevent fading, stretching, and other types of wear and tear. Take the socks out of the washing machine. Feed the sock back through itself and gently pull it straight so that it’s right side in. Do this carefully to avoid stretching out the fabric. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a detailed guide on washing socks.

This suggests that his role involved governance or legislation for this area. After a redistricting event, his constituency shifted to House District 45. However, this does not change the fact that he was previously elected to serve the district representing Billings, Montana. To elaborate on this context, elected officials in state legislatures, like Daniel Zolnikov, are expected to govern in the sense that they make decisions and pass laws that affect their respective districts. When Zolnikov was elected to House District 47, he was responsible for representing the interests and concerns of Billings, Montana in the Montana Legislature. His role would have involved decision-making and law-making for the benefit of this area, so it is safe to say that \\"Billings, Montana is where Daniel used to govern.\\"  When redistricting occurred, Zolnikov's representative area shifted to House District 45. Redistricting is the process of redrawing the boundaries of electoral districts, usually in response to population changes detected in the national census. This process can lead to officials representing different areas than they initially were elected to govern, as we see in Zolnikov's case. Regardless of this change, his previous service for Billings, Montana and his reputation for pursuing pro-privacy legislation remain important parts of his political career. Therefore, the statement \\"Billings, Montana is where Daniel used to govern\\" accurately describes a part of Zolnikov’s history as a legislative representative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was waged between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice, the latter joined by the Holy League, a coalition of Christian states formed under the auspices of the Pope, which included Spain , the Republic of Genoa, the Duchy of Savoy, the Knights Hospitaller, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and other Italian states. The war, the pre-eminent episode of Sultan Selim II's reign, began with the Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell quickly to the considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only Famagusta in Venetian hands. Christian reinforcements were delayed, and Famagusta eventually fell in August 1571 after a siege of 11 months. Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, but was unable to take advantage of this victory. The Ottomans quickly rebuilt their naval forces, and Venice was forced to negotiate a separate peace, ceding Cyprus to the Ottomans and paying a tribute of 300,000 ducats.

Înțelegerea valorilor, tradițiilor și evenimentelor care ne unesc ca națiuni diferite dar cu același scop, poate întări relațiile dintre statele membre, consolidând în același timp eforturile comune pentru realizarea obiectivelor pe termen lung ale Uniunii Europene. Prin promovarea și respectarea patrimoniului cultural comun, această coeziune poate fi sporită și consolidată. Sensibilizarea cetățenilor cu privire la contribuția pe care fiecare stat membru o aduce la dezvoltarea și succesul Uniunii Europene ajută la reducerea potențialelor resentimente și a prejudecăților care pot rezulta din diferențele culturale și geopolitice. Astfel, creșterea acceptării și cunoașterii diversității culturale poate contribui la consolidarea toleranței și înțelegerii între populații, iar acest lucru poate duce la armonie și stabilitate în cadrul UE. Educația ar putea juca un rol crucial în acest proces, asigurând o înțelegere mai profundă și mai accesibilă a istoriei și patrimoniului culturale comune, astfel încât cetățenii să aprofundeze și să-și îmbogățească constant cunoștințele în acest domeniu. În același timp, educația poate facilita schimburile culturale și colaborarea între instituțiile europene și organizațiile culturale, precum și între diferitele mișcări culturale și artistice. În acest context, promovarea dialogului intercultural și sprijinirea proiectelor culturale transnaționale reprezintă oportunități semnificative pentru a contribui la dezvoltarea unei conștiințe europene comune și la întărirea solidarității între cetățeni, bazată pe respect, cooperare și valorizarea diferențelor culturale.

Examples were Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII; William Cecil, Lord Burghley under Elizabeth I; Clarendon under Charles II and Godolphin under Queen Anne. These ministers held a variety of formal posts, but were commonly known as \\"the minister\\", the \\"chief minister\\", the \\"first minister\\" and finally the \\"prime minister\\". Who served as the head minister under Charles II?","output":"Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, served as the head minister under King Charles II of England. He held the position of Lord Chancellor from 1658 to 1667 and played a prominent role in the administration and governance of the kingdom during the early years of Charles II's reign. Clarendon's tenure as the chief minister can be divided into two main periods: before and after the Restoration of Charles II to the English throne. Edward Hyde was a loyal supporter of the Stuart monarchy and served as a key advisor to Charles I, the father of Charles II. During the English Civil War between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians, Hyde firmly stood on the side of the King. He continued to support the Royalist cause even after Charles I was executed in 1649. When Charles II ascended to the Scottish throne in 1651, Hyde became his chief counselor. After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, Hyde played a critical role in organizing the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Charles II was then invited to return to England and claim the throne, putting an end to the republican rule of the Commonwealth of England. Hyde was rewarded for his services and loyalty with the title of Earl of Clarendon in 1661 and appointed as Lord Chancellor, effectively making him the head of the government. As the chief minister, he was responsible for overseeing the administration of the country and providing counsel to the King on various matters. During his time as the chief minister, Clarendon worked to restore the monarchy's power and influence, as well as maintaining peace with other European nations. He was involved in the negotiation of the Treaty of Breda in 1667, which ended the Second Anglo-Dutch War. However, his tenure was marked by controversies, including his failure to address the grievances of the public after the Great Fire of London in 1666 and his unsuccessful attempt to suppress the religious dissent with the Clarendon Code, a series of repressive laws targeting nonconformists. Clarendon's fall from power came in 1667 when he was impeached by the House of Commons on charges of high treason and other high crimes. The charges were mainly driven by political rivals who blamed him for the poor outcome of the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the increasing unpopularity of the government. Fearing a death sentence, Clarendon fled to France where he lived in exile until his death in 1674. In summary, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, was the head minister under King Charles II and held the position of Lord Chancellor from 1658 to 1667. He played a significant role in the Restoration of the monarchy and the early governance of Charles II's reign. However, his time in power was marked by controversies and challenges, ultimately leading to his impeachment and exile."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Released from prison and warned to stop drinking, he immediately goes to a familiar bar where he comforts Eva (Eva Mattes), a prostitute down on her luck, and lets her stay with him at the apartment his landlord kept for him. They are then harried and beaten by Eva's former pimps, who insult Bruno, pull his accordion apart and humiliate him by making him kneel on his grand piano with bells balanced on his back. Faced with the prospect of further harassment, Bruno and Eva decide to leave Germany and accompany Bruno's eccentric elderly neighbour Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz), who was planning to move to Wisconsin to live with his American nephew Clayton. After sightseeing in New York City they buy a used car and arrive in a winter-bound, barren prairie near the fictional town of 'Railroad Flats'. There Bruno works as a mechanic with Clayton and his Native American helper, Eva as a waitress at a truck stop and Scheitz pursues his interest in animal magnetism. The pair buy a trailer which is sited on Clayton's land, but as bills mount, the bank threatens to repossess it. Eva falls back into prostitution to supplement her wages, but it is not enough to meet the payments. She tires of Bruno's drunken ramblings and deserts him by leaving with a couple of truck drivers bound for Vancouver. A man from the bank (Scott McKain) visits Bruno, who is now drinking steadily, and has him sign off on the repossession. The home is auctioned, and he and Scheitz, who is convinced that the world is conspiring against him, set off to confront the \\"conspiracy.\\" Finding the bank closed, they hold up a barber shop beneath it, make off with 32 dollars and then go shopping in a small store across the street.

Paragraph- Sent 1: The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. Sent 2: The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Sent 3: Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay.

Sent 5: \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. Sent 6: In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996.

A: A:","output":"Tendon, cartilage, and bone are examples of connective tissue, a type of tissue that primarily supports and binds other tissues of the body. Connective tissue is one of the four primary tissue types in the body, along with epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissues.  Connective tissue's function is to provide structural and mechanical support, maintain the shape and integrity of other tissues, and facilitate the transport of various substances between cells and tissues. This tissue type has a diverse range of structures and functions, including the continuous support and anchoring of organs, muscles, and nerves, the transmission of forces generated by the musculoskeletal system, and the preservation of body homeostasis. The main components of connective tissue are cells, fibers, and the extracellular matrix. Cells found in connective tissue include fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing fibers and the ground substance of the extracellular matrix; adipocytes, which store energy in the form of fat; chondrocytes, which maintain the cartilage matrix; and osteocytes, which maintain the bone matrix. Connective tissue contains different types of fibers, including collagen, elastic, and reticular fibers. Collagen fibers are the most abundant and provide tensile strength to the tissue. Elastic fibers allow for elasticity, enabling the tissue to return to its original shape after stretching or deformation. Reticular fibers are thin, delicate collagen fibers that form a supportive mesh in soft tissues. The extracellular matrix is a complex mixture of water, proteins, and carbohydrates. It is present in all connective tissues and serves as a supportive scaffold for the cells. The composition of the extracellular matrix varies from one type of connective tissue to another, resulting in diverse properties. Let's discuss each example of connective tissue in detail: 1. Tendon: A tendon is a dense fibrous connective tissue that connects muscles to bones. Tendons are composed mainly of collagen fibers produced by fibroblasts, which provide strength and flexibility. Tendons transmit forces generated by muscle contractions to the bones, enabling movement at the joints. 2. Cartilage: This is a flexible and avascular connective tissue found in various parts of the body, including the joints, ears, nose, and trachea. Cartilage provides support, flexibility, and cushioning while reducing friction between moving structures during movement. There are three types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage. Chondrocytes, located in cavities called lacunae, produce and maintain the extracellular matrix of cartilage. 3. Bone: Bone is a rigid, mineralized connective tissue that forms the framework of the vertebrate skeleton. Bone provides structural support, protection to vital organs, and serves as a mineral storage reservoir. It also plays a crucial role in blood cell production in the bone marrow. Osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts are the primary cellular components of bone tissue, responsible for maintaining the balance between bone resorption and formation. In summary, tendon, cartilage, and bone are examples of connective tissue that have diverse functions and structures, but they all share the primary purpose of supporting and binding other tissues in the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island.

It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - Mount Taranaki, or Mount Egmont, is an active but quiescent stratovolcano in the Taranaki region on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island. Although the mountain is more commonly referred to as Taranaki, it has two official names under the alternative names policy of the New Zealand Geographic Board. The 2518-metre-high mountain is one of the most symmetrical volcanic cones in the world. There is a secondary cone, Fanthams Peak, , on the south side. Because of its resemblance to Mount Fuji, Taranaki provided the backdrop for the movie \\"The Last Samurai\\".  - The South Taranaki Bight is a large bay that extends south and east from the south coast of Taranaki in New Zealand's North Island. With more symmetry than poetry or originality, it is matched by the North Taranaki Bight to the north of Cape Egmont.  - Makahu is a settlement in inland Taranaki , in the western North Island of New Zealand . It is located to the southeast of Strathmore . the Makahu Stream runs south through the area to join with the Mangaehu Stream , which flows into the Patea River . The name \`\` Makahu '' means \`\` White Hawk '' .  - Patea is the third-largest town in South Taranaki, New Zealand. It is on the western bank of the Patea River, 61 kilometres north-west of Whanganui on State Highway 3. Hawera is 27 km to the north-west, and Waverley 17 km to the east. The Patea River flows through the town from the north-east and into the South Taranaki Bight. For the former electorate from 1893 to 1963 see Patea.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island.

It runs for 105 kilometres from the eastern slopes of Mount Taranaki, passing east through Stratford before swinging south and reaching the South Taranaki Bight near the town of Patea.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents.

Florentini drags her/him out of the club in handcuffs, assaulting other patrons who come too close to free the captive woman or attempt to hinder his exit. Unfortunately, one of these patrons includes the chief's son.Hubert Florentini is chastised for the violent and unorthodox methods that he uses to accomplish his goals and is put on paid leave from the force. Despite his success and his seemingly enjoyable lifestyle of fighting crime, playing golf, and being the object of a beautiful woman's (Bouquet's) attentions, he has been unable to forget his one true love, Miko, a Japanese spy he met 19 years prior. Upon receiving news of her death, he is summoned to Japan by her lawyer, Hishibachi (Hirata Haruhiko) for the reading of her will.Hishibashi informs Florentini that he has inherited the guardianship of Yumi (Hirosue), a fiery, adorable and eccentric Japanese/French teenage girl over whom he has custody until she reaches adulthood in two days (the age of adulthood in Japan being 20). Yumi, who was led to believe she was the result of her mother's rape and subsequent abandonment, hates her unknown father. Hubert realizes Yumi is his daughter, but doesn't tell her as she would probably flee from him.Florentini uncovers evidence that Miko was the victim of foul play. He discovers that Miko had stolen a small fortune from the Yakuza, a fortune now destined for Yumi upon reaching adulthood.

Under this policy, a limited number of citizens from eligible countries like Tuvalu are granted the opportunity to live and work in New Zealand each year. The Pacific Access Category (PAC) was introduced in 2001 to allow citizens of participating countries in the Pacific region to migrate to New Zealand to work, reside, contribute to the economy, and improve their quality of life. This also helps in strengthening the bond between New Zealand and the Pacific countries. As per the statement, New Zealand's annual quota for Tuvaluans is 75 work permits granted under the Pacific Access Category. This means that every year, up to 75 Tuvaluan citizens can obtain a work permit to find employment and reside in New Zealand. The quota system is in place to ensure a fair and systematic distribution of work permit opportunities among eligible nations and their citizens. The PAC is an important route for individuals and families in Tuvalu and other participating countries who wish to avail themselves of better economic opportunities and a higher standard of living in New Zealand. The quota system ensures that New Zealand maintains a balanced approach to immigration and labor market requirements, while also fostering ties with its Pacific neighbors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Among the many tributaries, two large western tributaries of the Mississippi River stand out due to their size and importance. These are the Missouri River and the Arkansas River. 1. The Missouri River: The Missouri River is the longest river in the United States, originating in the Rocky Mountains in western Montana and flowing approximately 2,341 miles before joining the Mississippi River just north of St. Louis, Missouri. It is considered the primary western tributary of the Mississippi River and has a drainage basin that covers over half a million square miles. The Missouri River plays a vital role in the ecology, agriculture, and economic development of the Great Plains region. 2. The Arkansas River: The Arkansas River is another significant western tributary of the Mississippi River. It arises in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and flows about 1,469 miles through Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas before joining the Mississippi River near Napoleon, Arkansas. The Arkansas River is notable for its length, wide-ranging watershed, and historical relevance as a transportation route during the westward expansion of the United States.

How do Russians feel about the election of Donald Trump for president of the USA? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?  A). no B). yes","output":"B). yes Both questions inquire about the same information: the opinions and feelings of Russians regarding the election of Donald Trump as the president of the United States.  It is important to note that the opinions and feelings of Russians as a whole can be diverse, and it is difficult to make broad generalizations. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the different perspectives and reactions from Russia about Donald Trump's presidency. 1. Political elite: The political elite in Russia, typically associated with President Vladimir Putin's administration, initially reacted positively to Trump's election. This enthusiasm was largely due to Trump's campaign rhetoric, which advocated for improving the US-Russia relationship and easing tensions between the two countries. Many Russian politicians expressed hope that Trump's presidency could open a new chapter of cooperation and lead to the lifting of economic sanctions imposed on Russia. 2. State-controlled media: Russian state-controlled media outlets also embraced Trump's election, framing it as a victory against the establishment and the continuation of the global trend against liberalism. They emphasized the potential benefits and opportunities for Russia, such as an end to NATO expansion and a potential alliance to combat terrorism in the Middle East. 3. Russian opposition: The Russian political opposition viewed Trump's election with skepticism and concern. Some opposition figures found it troubling that Trump admired Putin's leadership style, and they worried that Trump's presidency might strengthen Putin's domestic political standing. They were also concerned that improved US-Russia relations could lead to increased acceptance of Russia's actions in Ukraine and its role in Syria. 4. General public: Public sentiment regarding Trump's election varied among the population. A survey conducted in 2017 by the Levada Center (an independent Russian research organization) showed that around 38% of Russians had a positive opinion of Trump, while 31% had a negative opinion, with the remaining participants expressing no opinion or having a neutral stance. Some individuals were optimistic about the possibility of improved relations and economic prospects; others were skeptical and concerned about Trump's unpredictability. 5. Intellectuals and analysts: Russian intellectuals and political analysts observed Trump's election with a mix of curiosity, caution, and pragmatism. While some believed that Trump's presidency could lead to a reconfiguration of the global order and offer Russia new partnership opportunities, they also recognized the challenges and uncertainties that Trump's administration could bring to the US-Russia relationship. In summary, the opinions and feelings of Russians regarding Donald Trump's election as the president of the USA are diverse and multifaceted, encompassing a range of emotions from optimism and hope to skepticism and concern.

Organisers of one of the country's largest agricultural shows are investigating claims that cattle have been tampered with to improve their appearance. Bosses at the Great Yorkshire Show have warned tactics such as glueing extra hair onto animals will not be tolerated. Other methods of improving the way cattle look include pumping up udders with liquid or gas and then sealing the teats. Allegations: Bosses at the Great Yorkshire are investigating claims cattle have been tampered with to improve their appearance. These Highland cattle are being prepared for exhibiting at the show. Competition: A steward makes sure the next round of cows are prepared for the Jersey cow section at the Great Yorkshire Show. Two cases of tampering are currently being investigated - the first time in the event's 155-year history that such allegations have come to light. Bill Cowling, honorary show director of the Great Yorkshire Show, described the practice as 'despicable and heinous' and warned a screening system is in operation. On the second day of the event, he confirmed investigations were underway into two suspected cases after checks by the Yorkshire Show's vets when animals were brought out of the ring. He said: 'The owners have been informed, and any substances which may contravene the Society's malpractice rules are being analysed. Cooling off: The cattle classes are a hugely popular part of the show. 'The animals continue to participate in the show.'

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Problem:find the name of Person table with largest value of age Solution:","output":"The task is asking to retrieve the name of the person who has the highest age value from a database table named Person. We will be using SQL (Structured Query Language), a standard language for interacting with databases. Here is a simple breakdown of the steps needed to accomplish this using SQL. 1. **Identify the Table and Columns:** The table in question here is 'Person', and the columns involved are 'name' and 'age'. 2. **SELECT Statement:** It is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a results table known as the result-set. Here, we are interested in the name of the person with the highest age, so we need to select 'name'. 3. **FROM Statement:** It is used to specify the table from which to retrieve the data. In this case, the table is 'Person'. 4. **ORDER BY Clause:** It is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. Here, we need to order the results by age in descending order so the person with the highest age is at the top of the result-set. 5. **LIMIT Statement:** It is used to specify the maximum number of records to return. Since we are only interested in the person with the highest age, we will limit our results to 1. Using these guidelines, we can construct the SQL statement to solve this problem: \`SELECT name FROM Person ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1;\` This SQL statement will return the name of the person with the highest age value from the 'Person' table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  Paragraph: John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would era B see higher or lower rate of weathering than era A? A:","output":"Given the information in the background and the paragraph, it can be concluded that era B would see a lower rate of weathering than era A. Step 1: Understanding the background information The background information provided indicates that rainfall influences the rate of weathering. More rain means higher chemical reactions as more rainwater passes through the soil and reacts with the particles.  Step 2: Applying the background information to the details of the paragraph From the paragraph, era A had plenty of rainfall while era B had less rainfall. Step 3: Making conclusion based on Step 1 and Step 2. Given that rainfall increases the rate of weathering (from background information),  and era A had more rainfall than era B (from the paragraph),  it can be concluded that era A would have higher rate of weathering than era B. Therefore, era B would see a lower rate of weathering than era A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process:  - Particles in the environment interact with rocks - The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks - The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks - The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact - The pieces of the rock are now small rocks - The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less atoms are getting split happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER erosion of rocks.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, suggesting that fewer atoms are getting split, can indeed have an effect on the erosion of rocks, both directly and indirectly. Erosion is a complex process involving various factors and mechanisms, and a decrease in the splitting of atoms can contribute to a slower rate of erosion. Let's analyze the direct and indirect effects of this hypothesis on the erosion process. Direct effects: 1. Reduced Surface Area for Erosion: When fewer atoms are split, the surface area exposed to erosive forces (such as wind, water, and ice) decreases. This reduced surface area results in less direct contact between rocks and these forces, slowing down the erosion process and leading to a less worn appearance of the rocks, as they retain more of their original form. 2. Lower Potential Energy for Erosion: The energy required to break apart the atoms within a rock and drive erosion is dependent on the atomic structure. If fewer atoms are being split, this implies that the rock is more resistant to the forces acting upon it, thus requiring more energy to erode. A higher energy threshold translates to a slower rate of erosion since the forces involved need to be stronger. Indirect effects: 1. Weaker Mechanical Weathering: One of the main drivers of rock erosion is mechanical weathering, which includes processes like freeze-thaw, abrasion, and thermal expansion. When fewer atoms are being split, the ability of these forces to break apart the rock is diminished. This results in weaker mechanical weathering, contributing to a slowed erosion process. 2. Impaired Chemical Weathering: Chemical weathering is another major factor in rock erosion, where chemical reactions between the rock's minerals and surrounding substances (such as water and oxygen) break down the rock. A decreased rate of atom splitting may affect the rock's composition, making it less susceptible to chemical weathering. This, in turn, also slows down the overall erosion process. 3. Altered Ecosystem Interactions: The erosion of rocks is influenced by the organisms that inhabit the area. Some plants can accelerate erosion by breaking down rock material through root growth, whereas others can help stabilize soil and rock, decreasing the erosion rate. If fewer atoms are being split, the composition and stability of the rock may change, leading to altered interactions with plant life and other organisms, which can indirectly affect the erosion process. 4. Shifts in Climate Patterns: Changes in the splitting of atoms within rocks may have long-term implications on climate patterns, which can indirectly impact erosion rates. An altered climate scenario could lead to differences in precipitation, temperature fluctuations, and wind patterns, which can all affect the forces involved in the erosion process. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting less splitting of atoms has both direct and indirect effects on the erosion process. It can lead to reduced surface area exposure, lower potential energy for erosion, weaker mechanical weathering, impaired chemical weathering, altered ecosystem interactions, and potential shifts in climate patterns, all of which contribute to a slower erosion rate of rocks. However, further research and study are necessary to determine the extent to which this hypothesis holds true and to quantify the impacts in specific geological settings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading.  - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus.  - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries.  - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.  - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial  based on feudal responsibilities  and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court.  - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - Holyport (pronounced \\"Hollyport\\") is a village in the civil parish of Bray (where at the 2011 Census the population was included), about 2 miles south of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.  - Ockwells Manor is a timber - framed 15th century manor house in the civil parish of Cox Green , adjoining Maidenhead , in the English county of Berkshire . It was previously in the parish of Bray . Ockwells is an early example of a manor built without fortifications , which Sir Nikolaus Pevsner called \`\` the most refined and the most sophisticated timber - framed mansion in England '' . It preserves a superb set of contemporary heraldic stained glass in the hall . Many of its bargeboards and other exterior timbers are run with rich mouldings and carved . Herringbone brickwork provides the infill . The manor was originally given , in 1283 , to Richard le Norreys , the chief cook to Queen Eleanor . It passed down through the Norreys family , ending up in the possession of Sir John Norreys , Keeper of the Wardrobe to Henry VI , who starting re-building the manor in 1446 . In the windows of the great hall , Sir John inserted beautiful stained glass , proudly showcasing his Lancastrian connections by displaying the arms of his friends at Court : the King the Queen the Duke of Warwick Duke of Somerset Duke of Suffolk Bishop of Salisbury James Butler , 1st Earl of Wiltshire Sir John Wenlock , Baron Wenlock Baron Mortimer of Chirk Sir William Laken Sir Richard Nanfan Sir John Langford John Purye Richard Bulstrode Abingdon Abbey The Norreys family lived there until 1517 . At that time , Sir John 's great - grandson , also Sir John , had to surrender the estate in return for a pardon after having murdered a certain John Enhold of Nettlebed . Ockwells was then owned by Sir John 's uncle , Sir Thomas Fettiplace . It passed through the Fettiplace family , before being owned by the Day family .  - White Waltham is a village and civil parish, west of Maidenhead, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is crossed briefly by the M4 motorway, which along with the Great Western Main Line and all other roads covers of the parish and 'greenspace' which includes cultivated fields covers the most part - this covered (in January 2005) . White Waltham Airfield is in the parish.  - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties:  - The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is a Royal Borough of Berkshire, in South East England. It is home to Windsor Castle, Eton College, Legoland and Ascot Racecourse.   - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government.  - Crossrail is a railway line under development in London and the home counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex. The central section and a large portion of the line, between in central London and in the south-east, are due to open in December 2018; at that time the service will be named the Elizabeth line. The western section beyond Paddington, to in Berkshire and Heathrow Airport, is due to enter operation in December 2019, completing the new east-west route across Greater London. Part of the eastern section, between and in Essex, was transferred to a precursor service called TfL Rail in 2015; this section will be connected to the central route through central London to Paddington in May 2019.  - Taplow is a village and civil parish in the South Bucks district of Buckinghamshire, England. It sits on the left bank of the River Thames, facing Maidenhead in the neighbouring county of Berkshire, and is roughly west of Burnham and west of Charing Cross in London.  - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry.  - Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \\"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\\". Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \\"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\\" design.  - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".  - Pinkneys Green is a village within the north-western bounds of the town of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire. Location. Pinkneys Green is located at , just north-east of the A404 road and north-west of Highway. Stubbings is to the west and Bisham and Cookham Dean some way to the north.  - The Council of the Royal County of Berkshire  also known as the Berkshire County Council  was the top-tier local government administrative body for Berkshire from 1889 to 1998. A strategic authority, with responsibilities for education, social services, public transport, planning, emergency services and waste disposal, it was composed of 87 members. Berkshire County Council shared power with six lower-tier district councils, each of which directed local matters.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city.

Browse the app store on your iPhone, Blackberry, Android or other smartphone device by using a search term such as \\"fake call.\\" There will be options on the app store that are offered for free or can be purchased. Be sure to read reviews to determine what features will suit your needs best as the features will vary between apps. You may also find apps that generate prank calls by offering specific personalities such as celebrities, characters or even a significant other. These may not provide the same versatility as general apps, but may be useful for themed occasions such as the holidays or birthdays. You may have options available such as making a fake identity for your mystery caller, using a contact from your contact’s list, pre-recording audio and scheduling the call. Plan out when you are to receive a call to use in an appropriate situation.  Apps will allow you to create a name, phone number and provide a photo to create an identity to a fake caller. When receiving a call, the phone call interface will look similar to the phone call interface of your phone. You can also choose between other phone interfaces if it does not match your device. In some apps, you are allowed to create your own interface. Try to match it as close as possible to yours. Handing the phone to someone who is familiar with your phone device may uncover your prank. Apps can provide an array of audio clips that provide different topics, personality types or you can even create your own by providing a compatible audio file. The app may not allow you to record a conversation, but you will be able to use other apps to record audio. Apps will allow you to place the call immediately. If you want the app to call at a later time, you can set it’s scheduler to place a call after a certain period, or you can have it place a call at a specific time. You can use allow the app to run in the background or place your phone in sleep mode to simulate receiving a call. Be sure to practice the situation beforehand. Try to rehearse and memorize the call in order to provide a convincing situation. If you are to give the phone to someone, make sure the prank app is not visible. Your phone will still receive regular calls from other phones which can interrupt your prank. Be sure not to schedule your call when you are expecting to receive an actual call.

Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- Elizabeth Smart has long been silent about the details of an ordeal that began in June 2002 when a stranger crept into her bedroom, held a knife to her throat, marched her up a hillside trail and made her his sex slave. She has spoken to local groups about how to move on after a traumatic experience, celebrated the passage of a national Amber Alert law for missing and abducted children, and offered advice to another alleged kidnapping victim, Jaycee Dugard. In October 2009, Smart drew a general outline of her experience at a hearing to determine whether her accused captor, Brian David Mitchell, 57, was mentally competent to stand trial. Much of her testimony focused on Mitchell's ability to manipulate people and talk his way out of a jam. He added that OPTIONS: - Amber Alert made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - Brian David Mitchell made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - CNN made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - Elizabeth Smart made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - Jaycee Dugard made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - Mitchell made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - Salt Lake City made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - Smart made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself. - Utah made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself.","output":"Brian David Mitchell made other attempts to \\"strip Elizabeth of her identity,\\" to break down her sense of herself.

Can we draw the following conclusion? New York has more Jewish residents than Florida, and that is why Grunblatt moved positions","output":"It would be inappropriate to draw the conclusion that the reason for Rabbi Akiva Grunblatt's move from Florida to New York was solely because of the larger Jewish population in New York. Although it is true that New York has a larger Jewish population compared to Florida, there may have been various factors influencing Rabbi Grunblatt's decision to change positions.  Rabbi Akiva Grunblatt took on the position of co-rosh yeshiva at Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen (Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim) in Flushing, New York, after serving as a rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva Toras Chaim in Miami, Florida. His appointment in New York may have been due to various personal or professional factors, such as growth opportunities, influence, proximity to family, or community dynamics. Furthermore, rabbis and other religious leaders often make career moves based on factors beyond the size of the population they serve. These may include opportunities for personal growth, new challenges, the reputation of the institutions they join, the needs of the communities they serve, or a calling to fulfill a specific mission. It is important to consider the complexity of decisions individuals make when changing careers or accepting new positions, especially when it pertains to religious leadership roles. The assumption that Rabbi Grunblatt moved to New York solely because of its larger Jewish population is simplistic and may overlook other significant motivations behind the change. In conclusion, while it is possible that the larger Jewish population in New York may have influenced Rabbi Grunblatt's decision to move, it is important to recognize and respect the complexity of the factors at play in such decisions. It would be more appropriate to understand Rabbi Grunblatt's move as a result of a combination of personal, professional, and spiritual factors, rather than solely attributing it to the demographic difference between the two states."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

'CEO' - The acronym 'CEO' stands for Chief Executive Officer, which signifies a high-ranking executive within an organization. This individual is usually responsible for overseeing and managing the overall operations of the company. In the context of the sentence, the term 'CEO' denotes a key person around whom the situation in the sentence revolves. 2. 'Organization' - This term refers to a structured group of people operating collectively to achieve a common goal, often a business or a non-profit entity. This word gives context to the CEO's role, indicating that they lead an organization and therefore hold a significant position within it. 3. 'Leader' - The term 'leader' underlines the CEO's position of authority within the organization. It highlights their responsibilities and suggests that they have a significant influence on the direction, policies, and decision-making within the organization. 4. 'Asked' - The word 'asked' is crucial to the sentence because it indicates the action taking place. It tells us that the CEO is being actively engaged by another party through questions, indicating a situation in which they are accountable or required to provide information about their organization. 5. 'Questions' - The term 'questions' demonstrates that the interaction between the CEO and the other party is informational or investigative in nature. This word suggests that the journalists are seeking explanations, clarifications, or opinions on various topics related to the CEO's organization. 6. 'Journalists' - 'Journalists' denotes the group of professionals who are engaging with the CEO by asking questions. As the primary element of the sentence, journalists play a pivotal role in shaping the context of the interaction. Their involvement implies that the event could be a press conference, an interview, or a similar gathering that requires the CEO to answer inquiries related to their organization. 7. 'Show' - Lastly, the word 'show' provides context for when and where the interaction between the CEO, journalists, and the audience is taking place. The term refers to a program or event where discussions or presentations occur, suggesting that the CEO's responses may be broadcasted or published to reach a wider audience. In summary, these words are important because they outline the actors, context, purpose, and nature of the interaction in the sentence.

Tenzin Gyatso is known as the 14th Dalai Lama, which means that there have been 13 previous Dalai Lamas before him. The Dalai Lama is a title given to the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people. The institution of the Dalai Lama dates back to the 14th century, with the first Dalai Lama, Gendun Drup, who was posthumously recognized as the first in the lineage. Throughout history, the role of the Dalai Lama has evolved and carried significant importance in Tibetan politics, religious practices, and culture. Each Dalai Lama is believed to be a reincarnation of a previous one, serving as the embodiment of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. The political power and influence of the Dalai Lamas, however, has varied, depending on the historical context and external forces. The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has advocated for a non-violent approach to the Tibetan issue, particularly in the case of opposing China's rule. With this in mind, the sentence could be rephrased for clarity as, \\"There were 13 Dalai Lamas before Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

However, on the ensuing Jets drive, rookie quarterback Geno Smith scrambled for a 10-yard run to the right sideline. A personal foul penalty was called on Lavonte David of the Buccaneers for a late hit out-of-bounds, which advanced the Jets to the Buccaneers 30 yard line. With 2 seconds left in regulation, Nick Folk kicked a 48-yard field goal, and the Jets won the game 18-17. Answer this question: How many yards was the difference between Lindell's field goal and Folk's field goal?","output":"To calculate the difference in yards between Lindell's field goal and Folk's field goal, we need to find the yardage for each field goal and then subtract the smaller yardage from the larger yardage. 1. Identify Rian Lindell's field goal yardage: Tampa Bay took the lead 17-15, which means the field goal was worth 3 points. 2. Identify Nick Folk's field goal yardage: It is stated that Nick Folk kicked a 48-yard field goal. 3. The Jets were at the Buccaneers 30 yard line before Folk's field goal. Since the goal posts are located at the back of the end zone, which is 10 yards deep, we need to add 10 yards to the distance from the field to the end zone. So, Lindell's field goal = 30 yards + 10 yards = 40 yards. 4. Calculate the difference: Subtract Lindell's field goal yardage from Nick Folk's field goal yardage:    48 yards (Folk's field goal) - 40 yards (Lindell's field goal) = 8 yards. The difference between Lindell's field goal and Folk's field goal is 8 yards."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  At a bus stop  for the following movie plot:  The first shot shows a lonely house by the ocean.

Mr. Dyke's comments echo the sentiments of fans and stakeholders alike, reminding us that there is still much to improve in the world of UK sports governance. In addition to Dyke's reflection on the World Cup, it has been revealed that Rugby Football Union (RFU) chief executive Ian Ritchie is now the highest-paid boss of a national sports governing body in the United Kingdom. Ritchie's position highlights the continually growing importance of rugby within the realm of UK sports, as well as the increasing need for strong leadership and organizational strategy. Meanwhile, the British Judo Association (BJA) has made headlines by turning down a £250,000 sponsorship offer from mixed martial arts (MMA) organization Ultimate Fight Championship (UFC) for their European Championships in Glasgow. This decision signifies the BJA's commitment to maintaining its independence and identity, and to preserving the essence of the sport of judo in the face of increasing commercial pressures from other sporting entities. In other FA news, departed general secretary Alex Horne recently weighed in on the handling of high-profile disciplinary cases, stating that he believes the organization's disciplinary team has dealt with such matters effectively, despite the ongoing controversy surrounding the Leeds case. It remains to be seen whether the FA will indeed emerge stronger from this situation, but Horne's insights offer a measure of reassurance in the meantime. In conclusion, the recent statements and events in UK sports governance offer a snapshot of the often tumultuous world of professional sports, with FA Chairman Greg Dyke's reflection on the World Cup performance serving as a reminder of both the potential and the challenges faced by UK sports organizations. With leaders such as Dyke and Ritchie at the helm, there is reason to hope for improvement both on and off the field as the UK sports community continues to evolve and grow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography.

The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am...

Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix.

A. tip  B. park officer  C. incinerator  D. dump  E. wastebasket  The best answer is Answer:","output":"E. wastebasket This answer makes the most sense in this context because a wastebasket is a container for temporarily storing waste or litter, and is commonly found in public areas such as parks.

Which person is more likely to have trouble talking?  Jill and Bob are working on a construction site together when suddenly two wooden planks fall from three stories up. One plank hits Bob on the head and the other lands directly on Jill's shoulder. Everyone rushes over to them to check if they are ok. All the people are relieved that Bob and Jill appear to be alright, but they urge them both to go visit a doctor to get checked out.  Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. The answer is:","output":"Bob is more likely to have trouble talking. The paragraph explains that a person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage, and these injuries often occur due to an external mechanical force like a blow to the head. It also mentions that such injuries may lead to difficulties in talking, controlling body movements, and other problems depending on the part of the brain that was injured. In this scenario, Bob was hit by a wooden plank directly on his head, which is consistent with the kind of external force that could cause a brain injury. On the other hand, Jill was hit on her shoulder, which, while painful, might not necessarily involve the same risk of brain damage as a blow to the head. While both individuals should seek medical attention, based on the information provided, Bob is more likely to have trouble talking due to the potential for traumatic brain injury resulting from the impact to his head."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with their dining experience, which is evident in their description of the food. The negative sentiment can be attributed to the following aspects of the review: 1. Temperature of the food: The reviewer mentioned that their burrito was cold. Cold food may not only be uncomfortable to consume, but it also suggests that the dish might not have been prepared or served adequately. This observation contributes to the negative sentiment because the reviewer expected a high-quality dining experience in exchange for the restaurant's relatively high prices. 2. Seasoning of the El Pastor: Another aspect that adds to the negative sentiment is the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the seasoning of El Pastor, a key element of their dish. The El Pastor's under-seasoning implies that the flavors were not up to their desired expectations, which further detracts from their overall satisfaction, as the food's taste is one of the most important factors in an enjoyable dining experience. 3. High price for disappointing food: The reviewer highlights their issue with the restaurant's costly food, which makes their dissatisfaction even more pronounced. Given the high expectations tied with pricey dishes, the negative sentiment is heightened by the fact that the food's quality did not match its price. In conclusion, the review's sentiment is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and dissatisfaction in multiple facets of their dining experience, including the burrito's temperature, lack of adequate seasoning in the El Pastor, and the high price for low-quality food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oldman was born in New Cross, London, the son of Leonard Bertram Oldman (1921-1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder, and Kathleen (nee Cheriton; born 1919). He has stated that Leonard was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, and later a singer, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the 1971 film The Raging Moon. Oldman was charged with drunk driving in 1991 after a night out in Los Angeles with actor Kiefer Sutherland. A deputy city attorney stated that Oldman's blood alcohol content was found to be more than twice California's limit for legal intoxication.  Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared \\"sloppy sensationalism\\" by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who said that Oldman was \\"the least political person he knew\\", that \\"neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them,\\" that they had \\"produced the film every last cut and frame,\\" and that \\"DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.\\" It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result.  In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, and argued in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints, but regarding the former, agreed, \\"Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews\\" (referring to Hollywood). After criticism from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Oldman apologised to them in an open letter. ADL director Abraham Foxman acknowledged that Oldman was remorseful, but felt his letter was insufficient and asked for \\"a little more introspection, a little more understanding and a little more education\\". Oldman then made a public apology on the 25 June edition of late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he stressed that he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for his \\"insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed\\" remarks.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is Chan's father's job? Options: - pet food factory - not enough information - gardening tools factory - sweets factory Answer:","output":"The correct answer is \\"not enough information\\". The context provided does not explicitly state or give sufficient details about Chan's father's job. It is mentioned that his father missed out on a promotion at a factory, but the type of factory or the nature of his work is not specified. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that he works at a pet food factory, a gardening tools factory, or a sweets factory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Kelsie Schelling met Donthe Isiah Lucas at Northeastern Junior College in 2010. She was taking general courses in preparation for majoring in psychology. Donthe was a standout basketball player from Central High School in Pueblo. He was a forward for the Plainsmen.      Lucas talked about his aspirations of going to the NBA. After two years at Northeastern, Schelling went to Vanguard University, a Christian school in Costa Mesa, Calif., and Lucas went to Emporia State University in Kansas, hoping to play ball for the Division 1 school.      Schelling moved into an apartment in Denver at the end of the first semester and got a job at Floor & Decor, a Highlands Ranch store.      She and Donthe continued to correspond, and during the Christmas break Donthe drove from Kansas to Denver and stayed with Kelsie, her mother, Laura Saxton of Yuma, says.      Not long afterward, she took a home pregnancy test and learned she was pregnant. Kelsie told her mother that Donthe wasn’t happy about the pregnancy.      “He was upset. She said they were so young. She made excuses for him,” Saxton said her daughter told her. “She wasn’t sure he would be involved in their lives.”      But sometimes he gave mixed signals. Donthe would tell Kelsie at times that he would take the baby away from her after the child was born.      “She was bound and determined to have the baby. She was really excited to be a mom,” Saxton said.      By early February, however, Donthe seemed to be coming around, indicating that he did wish to be involved in his child’s life.      He had grown up without a father and it was important to him that his child would have a father. That was also very important to Kelsie, she told her mother, but she was prepared to raise the child as a single mother if need be.      On Sunday, Feb. 3, 2013, Donthe sent a series of e-mails to Kelsie trying to persuade her to drive the two hours to his home in Pueblo after she worked at Floor & Decor. It was apparent by the texting exchange that she had an appointment with a doctor the next morning and Donthe knew about it.      He wrote back that he had something he wished to give her. Read review on 48 Hours website of high profile Denver cold case ||||| DENVER - Two years after the disappearance of a 22-year-old pregnant Denver woman, her parents have filed a federal lawsuit against her boyfriend for \\"wrongful death\\" and Pueblo police investigators for \\"deliberately obstructing\\" the investigation of the \\"killing.\\"      Kelsie Schelling's body, however, has never been found.      She vanished on the night of Feb. 4, 2013, after she drove to Pueblo to meet her boyfriend, Donthe Lucas, to tell him she was two months pregnant with his child, according to the lawsuit.      Police said surveillance video showed Schelling's car was parked at a Walmart in Pueblo on Feb. 5. The same video showed an unidentified man getting into the car on Feb. 6 and driving off. Police said the car was left at St. Mary-Corwin Hospital about 24 hours later.      Donthe Lucas, a 6-foot-8 former basketball star at Pueblo's Central High School and Northeastern Junior College in Sterling, has never been arrested or charged in connection with her disappearance or death.      However, the woman's parents, Doug Schelling and Laura Saxton, filed the lawsuit against Donthe Lucas, his mother, Sara, his grandmother, Vivian, and another family member, Dawn Shay Lucas.      \\"Kelsie Schelling was feloniously killed when Donthe Lucas committed first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter against Kelsie and Sara Lucas and Lucas acted as co-conspirators or accomplices during or after the killing,\\" the lawsuit claims.      The lawsuit also names as defendants Pueblo's Deputy Police Chief Andrew McLachlan, Detective Neal Robinson and Sgt. Ken Espinoza along with the City Of Pueblo.      The lawsuit accuses police detectives of \\"deliberately\\" interfering with the Schelling family's \\"right to file a wrongful death lawsuit in Colorado District Court … by refusing to open and investigate a criminal case arising from the death and disappearance of Kelsie Schelling, by tampering with or destroying evidence material to any wrongful death claim, by deliberately disregarding compelling leads and evidence pointing to the homicide of Kelsie Schelling by Donthe Lucas.\\"      On Friday night, Pueblo Police Capt. Chris Noeller told 7NEWS, \\"I had not heard about the lawsuit, but we can't comment on pending litigation anyway.\\" He suggested 7NEWS contact the police department spokesman on Monday.      The lawsuit says Lucas \\"coaxed\\" Schelling into driving to meet him on the night of Feb. 4, 2013 at the Walmart at 4080 W. Northern in Pueblo.      She arrived at the Walmart parking lot at 11:20 p.m., but Lucas wasn't there. The couple exchanged text messages. At 12:32 a.m. on Feb. 5. \\"Kelsie sent Donthe a text message wanting to know where he was at, complaining that she had been waiting for over an hour for him. That was the last confirmed message that will indicate that Kelsie was alive,\\" the lawsuit states.      At 3:54 a.m., Lucas called Schelling's cellphone, the suit states. Cellphone pings indicate Lucas and Schelling’s cellphones were very close proximity.      \\"The theory is that Kelsie had been murdered before this call was made and that the call was made to Kelsie’s phone to locate the phone in the dark,\\" the lawsuit states.      At 11:39 a.m., on Feb, 5, the lawsuit states \\"surveillance video clearly shows\\" Donthe Lucas driving Schelling's 2011 Black Chevrolet Cruze to a Pueblo bank, where he withdraws 400 in cash from an ATM with Schelling's debit card.      \\"Donthe Lucas is then observed by surveillance video parking Kelsie's car at the Wal-Mart parking lot, located at 4080 West Northern Avenue in Pueblo,\\" the lawsuit states. \\"Donthe exits the car and walks to the rear of the store where he was picked up by his mother, Sara Lucas, and grandmother, Vivian Lucas.\\"      Schelling's car is parked in the lot until the morning of Feb. 6 when surveillance video shows an unidentified black male drive away in the car, the lawsuit states. Police eventually find it parked at the local hospital.      Lucas was arrested and charged with felony identity theft and misdemeanor theft in connection with the alleged misuse of Schelling's ATM card. But the Pueblo County District Attorney's Office soon dropped the charges.      The lawsuit accuses Pueblo police detectives of obstructing the investigation almost from the start. It says police failed to properly process Schelling's vehicle and submit evidence for analysis.      Detective Robinson \\"confessed that he had lied to Kelsie's family about evidence found in Kelsie's car\\" when he initially told them \\"the car was wiped clean, no evidence was recovered,\\" the lawsuit states.      Private investigators hired by Schelling's parents say Robinson later admitted that suspected \\"dried bodily fluids\\" and two large palm prints off the front seat head rests of Kelsie's car had been recovered from the car, the lawsuit states. Ultimately, Detective Robinson said the \\"evidence did not return anything.\\"      Yet, the family's private investigators three fingerprints from the driver's side visor mirror that police had missed. They also identified \\"undercarriage damage on the passenger side of the vehicle and obtained what appeared to be a human hair from the damaged area,\\" the lawsuit states.      While Detective Robinson witnessed the private investigators recover this evidence, he refused to submit it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation crime lab for analysis or to store it at the Pueblo Police Department, the lawsuit states. Instead, Robinson said the evidence would have to be analyzed at a private lab at the family's expense.      On May 31, 2014, a man fishing with his girlfriend on Lake Minnequa in Pueblo snagged his line on what appeared to be a \\"human upper head and torso,\\" the lawsuit states. The man reported the discovery to Detective Robinson and took him to the lake to show him the exact location of where the body was located.      Robinson told one of the Schellings' investigators that the \\"tip was credible\\" and he had asked the department's dive team to search the lake. But the lawsuit said that never happened.      \\"This is a deliberate act of not investigating a possible criminal act or lead to recover human remains that could possibly be Kelsie or that of another individual,\\" the lawsuit asserts.      The lawsuit also accuses police detectives of refusing submit evidence to the FBI for expert analysis.

Saxton's life changed forever on February 4th of 2013. Her daughter, Kelsie Schelling, disappeared. That night, Kelsie headed to Pueblo to visit her boyfriend, Donthe Lucas. Just that morning Schelling confirmed she was two months pregnant with their child.      \\"We know that she and Donthe met,\\" said Saxton. \\"He has admitted that they met, but what transpired after is where the lies begin and where the statements don't match the physical evidence that we have.\\"      Saxton has made it clear she believes her daughter is dead. She claims Donthe Lucas is responsible and Pueblo police have botched the investigation. A lawsuit, filed earlier this year against the Lucas family, several police officers and the city of Pueblo, is pending.      Because the courts in our area don't give someone the right to sue over a botched police investigation, a magistrate judge is recommending the case against the police officers be thrown out. Still, it gives insight into what Laura Saxton believes happened to her daughter.      In the lawsuit, Saxton states the last text message Kelsie ever sent was to Donthe Lucas at 12:32 in the morning on February 5, 2013 asking where he was and quote \\"complaining that she had been waiting for over an hour for him.\\"      According to the lawsuit, the next morning Donthe \\"withdrew 400 cash from the ATM\\" with Kelsie's card.      The lawsuit claims Donthe then parked Kelsie's car at the Walmart on West Northern Avenue in Pueblo. Video released by the Pueblo Police Department shows a person driving Kelsie's car out of the Walmart parking lot. It was found more than a week later parked at St. Mary Corwin hospital.      Months later, Laura Saxton's lawsuit claims a Pueblo landlord who was renting to Donthe's mother found her apartment abandoned and trashed. When he went to replace the carpet, the lawsuit claims the bottom was \\"soaked\\" with what \\"appeared to be blood.\\"      11 News anchor Dianne Derby asked Pueblo Deputy Chief Mike Bennett about those claims. When asked if his department ever retrieved that carpet from the landlord Bennett replied, \\"That's what I meant when I said there is some misinformation going around involved in this case. I'm aware of all of those tips, our detectives are aware of all of those tips. As I said, all tips that we are aware of have been followed up thoroughly.\\"      The lawsuit also claims Pueblo police did not search Lake Minnequa in Pueblo even after getting reports in person from a man fishing there that he had snagged his line on what appeared to be a body.      When asked if his department searched Lake Minnequa, Bennett replied, \\"I'm not at liberty to talk about that.\\"      Derby then asked Bennett if his officers or the department in any way searched Lake Minnequa since February of 2013.      Bennett replied, \\"Yes, we have followed up on every tip we have been made aware of.\\"      Bennett said the Schelling and Lucas families have been uncooperative.      Derby went to Donthe Lucas' home in Pueblo and tried to talk to him in person. His grandmother would not talk on camera but said cadaver dogs searched her home twice.      \\"I don't know how those people live with themselves, how they sleep at night,\\" said Saxton.      Without her daughter's body, without answers about what happened to her, Saxton clings to memories.      \\"Her smile could light up a room, and her laugh would make everyone laugh and I miss hearing that,\\" said Saxton. \\"I'm scared of when I don't remember what it sounded like.\\"      If you or anyone you know has information about the disappearance of Kelsie Schelling, please come forward.

Dr. Jan Żabiński is director of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest in 1930s Europe, assisted by his wife, Antonina.  On September 1, 1939, the aerial bombardment of Warsaw and Invasion of Poland commences. Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) barely survive. As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck, head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, visits the zoo while Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals until after the war, later returning with Nazi soldiers to shoot the rest. He develops a romantic interest in Antonina. The Jews of Warsaw are forced into the Ghetto. The Żabińskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel and his partner Magda Gross, seek a safe place for a friend's insect collection. Antonina offers to shelter Magda. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Antonina decide to use the zoo to save more lives. They seek out Heck to propose turning the abandoned zoo into a pig farm to feed the German occupying forces, secretly hoping to bring food to the Ghetto. Heck, in need of a new site for his experiments in recreating Aurochs as a symbol of the Reich, agrees. Jan collects garbage from the Ghetto for the pigs and sees Jews starving. He begins working with the Underground Army to transport Jews to safehouses throughout the country. Jews are hidden in the zoo's cages, tunnels, and inside the Żabińskis' house. After some trepidation, Antonina agrees to help. The Żabińskis continue smuggling Jews out of the Ghetto. In 1942, the Germans begin deporting Jews to death camps.

Options: - car - tree - hardware store - lumberyard - boat  Explain why a human would choose \\"boat\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"boat. A human would choose \\"boat\\" as the answer to the question above because, historically, boats were often made of wood. Wood was an abundant and durable material, making it suitable for boat construction. It allowed the builders to create sturdy and buoyant structures that could be used for transportation and exploration.

By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen.  First, the story was \\"moved outside,\\" so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story.  Second & Third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ??

Answer the following question: Process:  - Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades - The shaft of the turbine spins - Shaft is connected to a generator - The generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor - The rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops inside - The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more clam days happens, how will it affect MORE electricity being generated.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context refers to the assumption that there will be more calm days (days with little to no wind) than usual. In order to understand the effects of this hypothesis on the process of wind energy generation, we need to revisit each step of the process and analyze the role of wind in each stage. 1. Wind passes the turbines and moves the blades: The most direct impact of the wind is on the movement of the turbine blades. The kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the turbine blades, which causes them to rotate. This step is crucial for harnessing wind energy since the lack of wind will result in the blades not spinning, and thus no energy being generated. 2. The shaft of the turbine spins: As the blades rotate, the shaft connected to the blades also spins. The energy from the spinning blades is transferred to the shaft, which is necessary for the subsequent steps of electricity generation. Again, the absence of wind will prevent the shaft from spinning, leading to no electricity generation. 3, 4, and 5. Shaft is connected to a generator, the generator uses the spins of the shaft to rotate a rotor, and the rotor spins inside the core, which has magnets inside surrounded by wire loops: These steps collectively describe the conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy. The spinning shaft drives the generator, which comprises a rotor and a core with magnets and wire loops. However, these steps are also dependent on the wind as the driving force behind the mechanical energy that initiates this conversion process. 6. The spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity: Finally, the rotation of the rotor within the core generates electricity due to electromagnetic induction. The electricity generated by the movement of the rotor can then be transported and utilized. This final step, like the earlier steps, relies on the presence of wind to provide the initial mechanical energy necessary for the generation of electricity. Considering the perturbation hypothesis where more calm days occur, there will be a direct effect on the process of electricity generation using wind turbines. As there is a significant decrease in the wind, the turbine blades will not rotate as much. The reduction in the blade rotation directly impacts the spinning of the shaft, the generator's operation, and the electricity generation process. This perturbation scenario would result in less electricity being generated, not more, as the question suggests. The decrease in wind would have a direct negative impact on the efficiency and productivity of wind energy generation. Therefore, the perturbation hypothesis, in this case, does not lead to more electricity being produced but rather a decline in the overall energy output of the wind turbines. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of more calm days occurring would have a direct and negative impact on the process of electricity generation using wind turbines. The wind is an essential element of the entire process, and a reduction in wind presence would significantly affect the amount of electricity generated, causing a decline in productivity and efficiency for wind energy power plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The two men went down seven miles to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean inside a small steel ball called a \\"bathyscaphe\\"   to find out if there are any ocean currents or sings of life.  It was necessary to set out early, so that the \\"bathyscaphe\\" would come to the surface in daylight, and so be easily found by the mother ship which would be waiting for it. The drivers began preparations at dawn and soon afterwards, when all was ready, the steel ball disappeared under the surface of the water.  In time, the temperature dropped to freezing-point and the men trembled   inside the ball. They kept in touch with the mother ship by telephone describing how they felt. Then, at a depth of 3,000 feet, the men were surprised by a sudden, loud noise, even the smallest hole in the ball would have meant instant  death. Luckily, though, it was only one of the outer windows that had broken. Soon afterwards, the \\"bathyscaphe\\" touched the soft ocean floor raising a big cloud of \\"dust\\" made up of different kinds of small, dead sea animals.

Solve this math problem Solve 24*c + 177 = 441 for c.","output":"Sure, we'll solve the equation 24*c + 177 = 441 for variable 'c'. Here is a step-by-step solution. Step 1: First subtract 177 from both sides of the equation in order to isolate c on one side. In mathematical terms: 24 * c + 177 - 177 = 441 - 177 Which simplifies to: 24 * c = 264 This step is important because basic arithmetic rules (and specifically the subtraction property of equality) allow you to remove the same value from both sides in order to simplify the calculation and make the equation clearer. Step 2: Now, c is alone on one side, but it's currently being multiplied by 24. To solve for c, we should get it completely on its own. So, next we'll divide both sides of the equation by 24. In mathematical terms: (24 * c) / 24 = 264 / 24. Once calculated, that results in: c = 11. Again, this step is important because dividing both sides by the same number is another rule of basic arithmetic (specifically the division property of equality).

When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money. After Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. David pays a visit with his ex-girlfriend, Noel, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay. While in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway.

Here is an article: From Google Glass to car dashboards to shopping, Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the most talked-about trends in technology. At its core, the idea behind AR is to bring additional context to the \\"real\\" world. With the advent of smartphones and tablets, the potential for AR to add context in real-life tasks including finding your way around or fixing a car becomes an actual possibility. Although AR gained more mainstream recognition over the last few years, most AR projects are confined to designated proof-of-concepts or specific experiences wrapped around a specific app. German company Metaio wants to change that, and its goal is to bring augmented reality everywhere. To do that, Metaio is focused on brining AR to every smartphone and focusing on helping developers and companies build AR apps. Over the years, we've seen lots of apps with AR features built in, and most of them are of a more promotional nature. The idea was less about showing the useful potential of AR and more about showcasing the cool-factor of the technology itself. That makes sense, in part because it's not easy for developers to figure out how to build AR features and functionality into their apps, websites or physical products. That's what Metaio is trying to solve with its Metaio Creator tool. Designed for coders and non-coders alike, the Metaio Creator lets users add 3D models, video and other graphical content to print media. That makes it easier for a catalog company to show off 3D rotating models of a piece of furniture or for a product maker to embed an installation video to the pages of a manual. The idea is to make AR as a concept mainstream enough that apps will exist and be useful — hopefully without becoming ubiquitous yet unused, like the unfortunate QR code. At Mobile World Congress 2013, I spoke with Trak Lord from Metaio about the future of AR and what's holding it back now. Performance, Lord says, is one of the core problems with making AR mainstream in larger-than-life installations. Right now, if you use an AR app on even the latest and greatest smartphone, changes are there will be some stutter in the graphical display. The experience isn't 100% seamless. To solve that problem — as well as furthering adoption and developer interest in AR — Metaio partnered with ST-Ericsson to create the first augmented reality chipset for mobile phones. Smartphones already have chipsets for graphics, Bluetooth/WiFi/LTE and any host of other services, why not something just for AR? Dubbed AREngine, the ST-Ericsson/Metaio project aims to do for the AR industry what the GPU did for gaming. An AR-focused chipset also means the battery implications of current AR apps could be dissipated, in part because AR functionality would be controlled by its own dedicated hardware. That also means that app developers could target a specific AR framework on a chip, rather than having to write just to an SDK on an app and hope the phone or tablet could function. The first smartphones with the AREngine IP are expected to start appearing later this fall and Metaio is bullish on wanting AR in every smartphone by 2014. Tablets and smartphones are great, but the real potential of AR is in applications that are directly in your field of view. That's why Google Glass is so exciting. If anything, Google Glass might be the best thing that ever happened to AR, because it brings a visual image of what the experience can be to a greater consciousness. In fact, one of the biggest potential assets of wearable computing is the context and real-time visualizations promised by AR. For Metaio, the promise of this sort of technology is exciting because it aligns with its end-goal of bringing AR everywhere. What do you think of AR? Let us know in the comments.

(Associated Press)      BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian opposition activists and rescuers said Sunday that a poison gas attack on a rebel-held town near the capital has killed at least 40 people, allegations denied by the Syrian government.      The alleged attack in the town of Douma occurred late Saturday amid a resumed offensive by Syrian government forces after the collapse of a truce with the Army of Islam rebel group.      The reports could not be independently verified.      First responders said they found families suffocated in their homes and shelters, with foam on their mouths. The opposition-linked Syrian Civil Defense were able to document 42 fatalities but were impeded from searching further by strong odors that gave their rescuers difficulties breathing, said Siraj Mahmoud, a spokesman for the group, which is known as the White Helmets.      A joint statement by the Civil Defense and the Syrian American Medical Society, a relief organization, said more than 500 people, mostly women and children, were brought to medical centers with difficulty breathing, foaming at the mouth, and burning of the eyes. It said patients gave off a chlorine-like smell. Some had blue skin, a sign of oxygen deprivation.      It said the symptoms were consistent with chemical exposure. One patient, a woman, had convulsions and pinpoint pupils, suggesting exposure to a nerve agent.      The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 80 people were killed in Douma on Saturday, including around 40 who died from suffocation. But it said the suffocations were the result of shelters collapsing on people inside.      \\"Until this minute, no one has been able to find out the kind of agent that was used,\\" Mahmoud, the White Helmets' spokesman, in a video statement from Douma.      He said the government was also targeting homes, clinics, and first responder facilities with conventional explosives and barrel bombs. Most of the medical points and ambulances of the town have been put out of service.      Videos posted online by the White Helmets showed victims, including toddlers in diapers, breathing through oxygen masks at makeshift hospitals.      The Syrian government, in a statement posted on the state-run news agency SANA, strongly denied the allegations. It said the claims were \\"fabrications\\" by the Army of Islam, calling it a \\"failed attempt\\" to impede government advances.      \\"The army, which is advancing rapidly and with determination, does not need to use any kind of chemical agents,\\" the statement said.      Syrian government forces resumed their offensive on rebel-held Douma on Friday afternoon after a 10-day truce collapsed over disagreement regarding the evacuation of Army of Islam fighters. Violence resumed days after hundreds of opposition fighters and their relatives left Douma toward rebel-held areas in northern Syria. Douma is the last rebel stronghold in eastern Ghouta.      The alleged gas attack in Douma comes almost exactly a year after a chemical attack in the northern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun killed dozens of people. That attack prompted the U.S. to launch several dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base. President Donald Trump said the attack was meant to deter further Syrian use of illegal weapons.      U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that Washington was closely following \\"disturbing reports\\" of the alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma.      \\"These reports, if confirmed, are horrifying and demand an immediate response by the international community,\\" she said in a statement late Saturday.      The Syrian government and its ally, Russia, denied any involvement in the alleged gas attack.      Douma is in the suburbs of Damascus known as eastern Ghouta. A chemical attack in eastern Ghouta in 2013 that was widely blamed on government forces killed hundreds of people, prompting the U.S. to threaten military action before later backing down.      Syria denies ever using chemical weapons during the seven-year civil war, and says it eliminated its chemical arsenal under a 2013 agreement brokered by the U.S. and Russia after the attack in eastern Ghouta. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Several Syrian activist groups, including the White Helmets, have reported that a brutal chemical attack on the rebel-held city of Douma in Eastern Ghouta left dozens of civilians dead and hundreds wounded.

Article: Many children have a \\"bug  period\\"--a time of life when bugs are a source of endless fascination and learning. Naturalist Edward O. Wilson jokes that unlike other kids, he never grew out of his bug period.  Luckily for this biologist, his lifelong passion for ants has led to a career rich in accomplishments and praise. He is not just the world's foremost expert on the social behavior of ants, but also the receiver of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for nonfiction. Now, at the age of 80, Wilson has tried his hand at fiction. His first novel, Anthill, combines two of his greatest loves -- his childhood home, Alabama, and the ants that have been his lifelong friends.  Described as a \\"six-legged Iliad,\\" Wilson's Anthill draws parallels between human and ant societies. Though there are no ant bands, secret police, or schools of philosophy, both ants and man conduct wars, divide themselves into specialized classes of workers, build cities, maintain infant nurseries and cemeteries, take slaves and practice agriculture, though ant societies are more energetic, selfless, and efficient than human ones. The book's first and third sections deal with the adventures of an Alabama boy, Raphael    Semmes Cody, who goes by the name Raff. The boy grows up knocking around the Nokobee woods; he's drawn to its natural wonders, and uses the forest to escape from his parents' unhappy marriage. In the woods he leaves almost no stone unturned as he discovers the forest's rich flora and fauna . Raff grows up and heads to Harvard to study law, but returns later in life to protect the Nokobee from crazy developers. But fans of Wilson's science will be most interested in the book's middle section, where the author inserts a mini-novel describing the trials and sufferings of the ants living in the endangered forest. Reviews of the book have been mixed.

Choices: - unacceptable - acceptable","output":"The given sentence: \\"I explained it to Bill that she was lying,\\" is syntactically and semantically unacceptable. Here's a detailed explanation of why the sentence is considered unacceptable: Syntactically, the sentence seems to be a blend of two acceptable sentences: 1. \\"I explained to Bill that she was lying.\\" 2. \\"I told Bill that she was lying.\\" In both sentences above, the verb \\"explained\\" and \\"told\\" are used to convey information to someone. However, the original sentence adds the pronoun \\"it\\" after the verb \\"explained,\\" which disrupts the syntactical structure of the sentence.  In a sentence containing the verb \\"explain,\\" the structure typically follows this pattern: - Subject + \\"explain\\" + Indirect Object (the listener) + \\"that\\" + Clause (information or situation) However, the inclusion of \\"it\\" in the given sentence results in an unconventional structure, making the sentence syntactically incorrect. Semantically, the sentence is also unacceptable because it doesn't effectively communicate the speaker's intended message. A listener or reader could be confused by the presence of \\"it\\" in the sentence. This confusion would arise from the difficulty in understanding what \\"it\\" is referring to, as it appears to be redundant in the context of the sentence. In summary, the sentence \\"I explained it to Bill that she was lying\\" is both syntactically and semantically unacceptable.

Given the question: Process:  - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the water does no come into contact with the air happens, how will it affect the water does not break down into hydrogen and oxygen.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation will have a direct effect on the process of rust formation. Under normal circumstances, when water is exposed to air, it readily absorbs carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid. Carbonic acid increases the acidity of water, encouraging the dissolution of iron. Some water molecules break down into hydrogen and oxygen at the same time, providing free oxygen that readily combines with the dissolved iron to form iron oxide, which is rust. However, if water does not come into contact with the air, the formation of carbonic acid is hindered. The absence of carbon dioxide in the water would inhibit the formation of the weak carbonic acid. This will result in a minimal increase in acidity compared to when water does come in contact with the air. Without the presence of carbonic acid, the rate of dissolution of iron will be significantly slower. Furthermore, the lack of oxygen availability in the water, as it is dissociating at a much lower rate without the air interaction, would directly impact the formation of iron oxide. The perturbation hypothesis essentially reduces the likelihood of rust formation when water does not come into contact with the air. In this situation, the process of rust forming is greatly slowed down, as crucial components such as carbonic acid and freely available oxygen are either minimized or nonexistent. It is important to note that, while the perturbation may not entirely prevent the formation of rust, it will significantly reduce the rate at which it occurs. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that water does not come into contact with air directly affects the rust formation process. By inhibiting the creation of carbonic acid and reducing the availability of free oxygen, the process is slowed down, and the eventual formation of rust is substantially less efficient than in the typical situation where water comes into contact with the air."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sawing the pool into pieces would make it unusable for its intended purpose. - The water pump and maximum power are not relevant at this stage of the pond construction.

The first one is talking about a specific scenario of Archimedes' quote, using the moon as the 'place to stand', while the second one is more general, without specifying where the lever is placed. As for how long the lever would have to be, that is tricky. In reality, it's not just about the length of the lever but also about how much force you apply. In theory, even an extremely long lever would need an incredible amount of force to move the Earth.

The survey asked thousands of people which fast-food places they liked best, and they found that 21 other burgers were more delicious than the McDonald's Big Mac. People now seem to like places like Chipotle and Panera more, because they have healthier ingredients and let people choose how their meal is prepared.

The song is a first-person narrative to \\"sparse\\"  musical accompaniment. It reveals a tale, mostly in the form of brief dialog extracts by the narrator's family at dinnertime, on the day that a local boy - and apparently friend of the narrator - jumped to his death from a nearby bridge. Throughout the song, the suicide and other tragedies are contrasted against the banality of everyday routine and polite conversation. The final verse conveys the quick passage of events and other deaths in a year's time.  The song begins with the narrator, her brother and her father returning, after agricultural morning chores, to the family house for dinner (on June 3). After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, \\"Mama\\" says that she \\"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\\" that \\"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\".  At the dinner table, the narrator's father appears unmoved and almost dismissive; he comments that \\"Billie Joe never had a lick o' [meaning, any] sense\\", and asks for the biscuits to be passed to him, and comments that he has \\"five more acres in the lower forty\\" to plow. Her brother seems somewhat taken aback (\\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\"), but follows the comment by asking for a second slice of pie. He recalls a prank that he and his friends played on the narrator, and that he saw her and Billie Joe talking after church a few days previously.  The only person who seems genuinely upset is the narrator. Her mother - who eventually notices the narrator's abrupt and complete change of mood at the news - seems unable to realize she is affected by the news (\\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\\"). She shares other news instead, that a local preacher visited earlier in the day, and almost as an aside, that the preacher had mentioned seeing Billie Joe and a girl who looked very much like the narrator herself \\"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\" - the object they were throwing is not identified. But again, the narrator's mother fails to connect this in any way to her daughter's emotional distress.  In the song's final verse, a year has passed, and brought more harm and pain. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson, but they have moved away to another town (\\"bought a store in Tupelo\\"). Their father died from an unspecified viral infection, and their mother has been depressed and despondent, and \\"doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything\\". The narrator is also affected by the malaise; the main change she describes in her own life, is that she often visits Choctaw Ridge and picks flowers there to drop from the Tallahatchie Bridge into the murky waters of the river where Billy Joe jumped to his death. Answer this question \\"Who are other characters in the song?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"The other characters in the song are the narrator's brother, her father, her mother (referred to as \\"Mama\\"), Billie Joe McAllister, and Becky Thompson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When they say Tony Romo completed a 10-yard TD pass to Terrell Owens, it means that their touchdown pass was 10 yards long. And then, when they say Matt Moore completed an 11-yard TD pass to Steve Smith, it means that their touchdown pass was 11 yards long. To find out how many more yards Steve Smith's touchdown pass was compared to Terrell Owens', we need to subtract Terrell Owens' yards (10) from Steve Smith's yards (11). So, 11 yards - 10 yards = 1 yard.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

Process:  - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more sediment will form happens, how will it affect LESS oil.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"If more sediment forms and accumulates on top of the existing layers of dead organic material, it can affect the formation of oil and natural gas through several potential ways: 1. Increased pressure: Additional sediment layers will lead to increased pressure on the underlying organic material. Greater pressure can speed up the transformation of kerogen into oil and natural gas. However, if the pressure increases too much, it might also lead to the formation of different types of hydrocarbons, which might not necessarily be conventional oil or natural gas. 2. Higher temperatures: With increased depth and pressure due to heavy sediment layers, the temperature will also rise. Higher temperatures can help in breaking up the kerogen molecules more efficiently, leading to the generation of oil and natural gas faster. But if the temperature reaches too high, it can cause the hydrocarbons to be broken down further, possibly producing less oil and more natural gas, or even converting them into other substances, such as graphite or carbon dioxide. 3. Alteration of geological structures: The increased accumulation of sediment can lead to the development of more complex geological structures and rock formations. These changes can directly impact the migration pathways and traps for oil and natural gas, potentially leading to less oil accumulation in certain regions. 4. Longer formation time: The rate of sediment deposition may outpace the rate of oil formation. As a result, the kerogen-rich zone within the sediment may not undergo the complete transformation into oil, and instead may remain trapped in intermediate forms, leading to less oil generation in the long run. 5. Impact on biota: The increased sedimentation rate can also impact the marine or swamp ecosystems where the organic material is formed. If the burial rate of organic material becomes too quick, it might not have enough time to accumulate and concentrate, possibly leading to less oil formation eventually. In summary, while the perturbation of increased sedimentation can have both direct and indirect effects on oil formation, its impact depends on various factors. Increased pressure and temperature from additional sediment can expedite oil and natural gas formation; however, if these conditions become too extreme, it may lead to the formation of alternative hydrocarbons, less oil accumulation, or hindered oil formation. Additionally, the altered geological structures and potential impacts on biota can influence the oil-formation process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Review: Perhaps you won't care for the social commentary, or the film makers point of view (I myself am mystified at the insignificance' angle Kasdan seemed to promote  when clearly, the actions taken in the movie promote CERTAIN significance. The ending confused me). However, there's absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented; the magnificent symbolism throughout; the threaded character arcs; visuals; dialogue  is absolute masterwork. I've watched the movie dozens of times, and I still marvel at its perfection. There's not a moment, action, cut, or line that doesn't have everything to do with the theme. Realistic human performances from all the actors. Scene to scene it's woven fantastically. I have a pretty level sap-meter. The buzzer never went off during this film. If you're a thinker (rather than a casual viewer)  this movie delivers. Exponentially. Absolutely mesmerizing. (Do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display? Who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or not, was it interesting?) Personally, the movie affected me  significantly. In my top 5. Note: The front-page reviewer clearly speaks from a flawed African American perception. What he may have failed to recognize, is, there was a hand  shake. Not a hand - out. The spiritually dead white man', simply saw a man to respect, and admire. And he did something about it. The fact he was black had little, if anything, to do with it (color is simply used to draw the parallel. And the chasm. It's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either). If you view the blacks in this movie as token'  you may want to reassess YOUR angst. You may be seeing only black and white yourself, eh. Just a thought. Now, what is this review like? OPT: [1]. negative. [2]. positive.","output":"This review is [2]. positive.

It suggests feelings of disappointment, nostalgia, and dissatisfaction, and a hint of hesitancy or uncertainty.  1. Disappointment: The reviewer seems disappointed with the significant changes that have taken place at the establishment, particularly in regards to staff changes. They begin by reminiscing about the previous person who ran the place, describing him as \\"cool, honest and helpful\\", implying they had a positive and satisfactory past experience with the service. However, their recent encounter with the \\"new counter guy\\" seemed to be unsatisfactory, triggering feelings of disappointment.  2.

They reminisce about their former positive experiences at the place, indicating a significant difference between past and present experiences, which evokes feelings of nostalgia and longing for the past positive interactions. 3. Dissatisfaction: The dissatisfaction is emphasised when the reviewer notes that they were talked down to and felt on verge of being \\"shammed\\". They also express dissatisfaction with the unavailability of Sunday service, which they were used to. This implies that the changes in the service, along with the disrespectful treatment, led to the overall dissatisfaction. 4. Hesitancy or Uncertainty: This sentiment is articulated through the reviewer's expression of hesitance to leave their car with the new counter guy. They state that they \\"will likely not be back\\", indicating a degree of uncertainty about whether or not to give the place another chance. Finally, the reviewer ends on a note of disappointment, stating they are considering finding a new place for oil changes and car tune ups, reinforcing the sentiment of dissatisfaction and a loss of trust in this business.

When Gina (Kangana Ranaut), the rich daughter of a powerful casino owner Bob (Kabir Bedi), falls for him, Jai goes along to marry into money. He discovers that his future brother-in-law, the vicious, homicidal Tony (Nicholas Brown), is about to marry a Mexican woman named Natasha (BÃ¡rbara Mori), whom Jai knows as Linda, the last of the immigrant women he married. On the night before \\"Natasha\\" and Tony's wedding, Linda and Jai spend a romantic but chaste night, humorously agreeing to a \\"divorce\\". A jealous, gun-wielding Tony arrives at her apartment while Jai is there. After he hits her, Linda impulsively knocks him out with a heavy object while he tussles with Jai. Linda and Jai go on the run toward Mexico, with Tony and police in pursuit. They are helped by a friend of Jai, Robin (Anand Tiwari). Robin gives them fake passports and IDs so that they can go wherever they want. In the following week, Jai and Linda get married in Mexico. On the day of their wedding, they come back to their house. There, Robin comes to give them the passports and is unexpectedly shot by Tony and his men. Linda and Jai escape, but Jai is shot in the process. In a car chase, Linda stops the car at a train, puts Jai aboard it, and drives off. Back to the present, Jai meets with Jamaal, one of Bob's employees, and is ambushed. Jamaal is killed but not before telling Jai of Linda's whereabouts. Jai kills off all of Tony's men and then kills Tony by smashing his face into the car door. He is shot then by Gina. He drives off to the location where Jamaal said Linda was last seen. It is shown that after Jai was put aboard the train, Linda was ambushed on a cliff and sent Jai a text message saying \\"I am going...Sorry, Forget me\\".

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have a chronic illness, and so I received quite a few sterling gems in the months between onset and accurate diagnosis. I had one GP — let’s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS. Literally THE most common sign/symptom/syndrome of autonomic dysfunction. The most common one. He could’ve confirmed right there in the office with a poor man’s tilt table test, if he knew to… Mayo Clinic had to confirm with expensive instruments because he’d never heard of a disease that affects 1/100 teenagers and between 1–3 million people in the United States! Would’ve done better with this Doctor. Question: Who was named Dr Douche? Answer: A:","output":"The person named Dr Douche was the general practitioner (GP) who was handling the care of the individual narrating the context. This GP demonstrated a considerable lack of medical insight and tact when dealing with the chronic illness of the narrator. Dr Douche often put forth outlandish theories with little basis to explain the narrator's worsening health condition, much to the annoyance and despair of the patient. Most notoriously, upon hearing the patient's symptoms of increased heart rate, dizziness, and pounding heart upon standing, he suggested that the individual may be experiencing a profound fear of standing or verticality, rather than recognising these signs as a common symptom of autonomic dysfunction, specifically Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). His lack of awareness about this common condition resulted in the delay of an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, hence earning him the less-than-flattering nickname of \\"Dr Douche\\" from the narrator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Fact 1: If gas is heated then that gas will expand.  Fact 2: If more space between 2 galaxies more space to expand so it moves away faster.  Given the two facts above, when gas is heated, it takes up more:? A:","output":"Space. Step 1: Analyze Fact 1 - If a gas is heated, it will expand. This means that the individual molecules of the gas move faster and occupy a larger volume or space. This is a basic principle of thermodynamics where increasing the temperature of a gas causes its volume to expand due to increased kinetic energy of the particles. Step 2: Connect with Fact 2 - Fact 2 states that with more space between two objects, like galaxies, there’s more room for expansion and thus the objects move apart at a faster rate. It is referring to Hubble's law used in cosmology.  Step 3: Application - By applying these facts to our original problem, we can say that when a gas is heated, it will expand and therefore take up more space.  The two facts are not directly related but both deal with the concept of expansion - gaseous expansion due to heat and cosmic expansion, respectively.

Here is a news article: WASHINGTON The Republican chairman of a House of Representatives committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said on Friday that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had failed to respond to the panel's subpoena for documents in the case.      Representative Trey Gowdy said Clinton had not provided a single new document and her lawyer told the committee a server she used for emails while she was the top U.S. diplomat had been wiped clean.      \\"We learned today, from her attorney, Secretary Clinton unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server,\\" Gowdy, chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said in a statement.      He said the committee will seek to speak to Clinton, the presumed front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, about the emails and the server.      Clinton, who was sharply criticized after it was revealed she used a private email address while secretary of state, has said she has already given copies of all her work-related emails to the State Department.      Clinton has told the committee and the State Department that she would like all her emails made public as soon as possible and welcomes the opportunity to appear before the House panel, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.      The State Department has said it has already given Gowdy's committee all the relevant emails from that cache, some 300 in all, about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.      Members of Gowdy's committee say they need to see all of Clinton's emails, including those she did not give to the State Department, to be sure of this.      But the top Democrat on the committee, Representative Elijah Cummings, said the letter the panel received from Clinton's lawyer confirmed that Clinton had turned over all relevant emails.      \\"It is time for the Committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton’s public testimony now,” Cummings said in a statement.      (Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Will Dunham and Ken Wills) ||||| He said while it’s “not clear precisely when Secretary Clinton decided to permanently delete all emails from her server, it appears she made the decision after October 28, 2014, when the Department of State for the first time asked the Secretary to return her public record to the Department.”      ADVERTISEMENT      Last week, Gowdy sent a letter to Clinton’s attorney asking that the email server be turned over to a third party in the hopes that an investigation could recover about 30,000 emails that her team deleted before turning the rest over to the State Department.      Gowdy said \\"it is clear Congress will need to speak with the former Secretary about her email arrangement and the decision to permanently delete those emails.\\" “Not only was the Secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest,” Gowdy said. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the panel's top Democrat, said the letter the select committee received from Clinton's attorney detailing what happened the server proves she has nothing to hide. \\"This confirms what we all knew — that Secretary Clinton already produced her official records to the State Department, that she did not keep her personal emails, and that the Select Committee has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in Benghazi,\\" he said in a statement. \\"It is time for the Committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton's public testimony now.\\"      Clinton has maintained that the messages were personal in nature, but Gowdy and other Republicans have raised questions over whether she might have deleted messages that could damage her expected White House run in the process.      “I have absolute confidence that everything that could be in any way connected to work is now in the possession of the State Department,\\" Clinton said during a press conference in New York earlier this month. She said she had culled through more than 60,000 emails from her time at State and determined that roughly 30,000 of them were public records that should have been maintained. Clinton said the rest were messages related to private matters, such as her daughter’s wedding or her yoga class schedule, and didn't need to be kept.      Gowdy said given Clinton’s “unprecedented email arrangement with herself and her decision nearly two years after she left office to permanently delete” information, his panel would work with House leadership as it “considers next steps.”      Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Gowdy and other members of the Benghazi panel in the past have hinted that the full House could issues a subpoena for Clinton’s server. ||||| Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton advised a House panel that she permanently deleted all emails from her server, raising the stakes in a controversy that has dogged the presumptive presidential candidate for weeks.      WASHINGTON — Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told a House select committee Friday that she permanently deleted all emails from the private server she used to conduct official business, apparently after she was first asked by the State Department to turn them over, the panel’s chairman said Friday.      In response to a congressional subpoena, Clinton also said she would not allow an independent third party to analyze the server.      Clinton’s lawyer, David Kendall, said in a letter to the panel that after her lawyers determined which emails were personal and which were private, a setting was changed to retain only emails sent in the previous 60 days.      “Thus, there are no hdr22@clintonmail.com emails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized,” Kendall said.      The House Select Committee on Benghazi had subpoenaed the server this month, asking Clinton to hand it over to a third party so it could determine which emails were personal and which were government records.      The head of that committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said: “Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest.      The disclosure raised the stakes in the controversy that has dogged the potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate for weeks, since it was revealed that she had used an email server in her Chappaqua, N.Y., home to conduct government business during her tenure from 2009 to 2013 as the nation’s top diplomat. The home is protected around the clock by the Secret Service.      Gowdy said Clinton’s attorney informed the committee Friday that she “unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server.”      “While it is not clear precisely when Secretary Clinton decided to permanently delete all emails from her server, it appears she made the decision after Oct. 28, 2014, when the Department of State for the first time asked the secretary to return her public record to the department,” Gowdy said.      It was not immediately clear whether the emails still could be recovered from the server through cyberforensic procedures.      The congressman said that “in light of the secretary’s unprecedented email arrangement with herself and her decision nearly two years after she left office to permanently delete all emails,” and because of the matter’s import to the American people, the panel will work with House Speaker John Boehner, of Ohio, and other Republican leaders in considering its next steps.      Clinton said at a recent news conference at the United Nations that, in hindsight, it would have been smarter to have conducted State Department business through a government server. She said her attorneys had turned over 30,490 emails to the State Department in response to a request from the agency, but that she deleted more than 32,000 emails that she considered personal.      A spokesman for Clinton said in a statement Friday: “She’s ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the American public.”      The spokesman, Nick Merrill, added that Clinton’s representatives “have been in touch with the committee and the State Department to make clear that she would like her emails made public as soon as possible.”      The Benghazi committee’s ranking Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, sought to play down Friday’s development, saying it merely confirmed what was already known. “It is time for the committee to stop this political charade and instead make these documents public and schedule Secretary Clinton’s public testimony now,” he said.      Gowdy is heading the latest House inquiry into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Killed in the violence were U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.      Meantime, Clinton’s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, has asked his agency’s internal watchdog to examine how it handles its records and responds to requests for information after revelations about his predecessor’s use of a personal email account for government business.      “It is critical for the State Department to preserve a full and complete record of American foreign policy,” Kerry wrote to Inspector General Steve Linick. “It is also important for the American public to have access to that record.”      State Department officials said Friday that the request to the inspector general did not call for an examination of Clinton’s email but that Linick’s review could end up looking into the former secretary’s email.      The Obama administration has declined to explain much about Clinton’s use of a personal server and personal email account.      Clinton said many of her work-related emails were archived through other official accounts of those she communicated with. But State Department officials said in recent weeks that email was not automatically archived during her tenure. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has informed the House of Representatives committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks that she permanently deleted all emails from the private server she used to conduct official business. Clinton's lawyer stated that after determining which emails were personal and which were private, a setting was changed to retain only emails sent in the previous 60 days. The House Select Committee on Benghazi had subpoenaed the server earlier this month, requesting that Clinton hand it over to a third party to evaluate which emails were personal and which were government records. The committee continues to seek Clinton's testimony regarding the emails and the server."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s? from the following article ?  Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, Hope continued to hold a place in popular culture, and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. Percy Collick urged \\"Labour stalwarts\\" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during \\"the terrors of the Nazi War\\" had drawn \\"renewed faith and hope\\" from her photographic copy. Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by Martin Luther King Jr., now known as Shattered Dreams, took Hope as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that \\"shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life\\", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim for which there is no evidence.In 1990 Barack Obama, at the time a student at Harvard Law School, attended a sermon at the Trinity United Church of Christ preached by Jeremiah Wright. Taking the Books of Samuel as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as \\"a study in contradictions\\"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world. The answer is:","output":"Jeremiah Wright. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the text concerning the person who studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s and rediscovered it in the late 1980s.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: Over the course of American history, support for economic redistribution has been the exception, not the rule. In the 20th century, support for redistributive policies emerged as a dominant force in national politics only in the Depression decade of the 1930s; it was intermittently influential from 1945 to 1965. More recently, a 2008 study of public attitudes during periods of mounting inequality found that âwhen inequality in America rises, the public responds with increased conservative sentiment.â This conservative shift applies to all income groups, including the poor, according to the political scientists Nathan Kelly of the University of Tennessee and Peter Enns of Cornell. âRather than generating opinion shifts that would make redistributive policies more likely,â Kelly and Enns write, âincreased economic inequality produces a conservative response in public sentiment.â The Kelly-Enns study examines poll data and inequality trends between 1952 and 2006. In an email Enns wrote earlier this week, he added that more recent data shows a continuation of the trend: âBetween 2006 and 2011 (when the most recent data are available) inequality has mostly continued to increase and the public has shifted in a more conservative direction â especially since 2008. This relationship is consistent with our previous findings.â A key tool Kelly and Enns use for their work is a statistical analysis of the policy mood of the country developed by James Stimson, of the University of North Carolina. Stimson, using data from all available commercial and academic surveys, including American National Election Studies and Gallup, illustrated his findings in a graph, Figure 1, which covers the years 1952 to 2012. The graph tracks swings in public opinion, both to the left and right, using responses to polling questions measuring levels of support for government programs. From 1992 to 2012, according to Stimsonâs analysis, overall support for liberal, pro-government initiatives has declined. These results suggest that President Obamaâs plan to dedicate the remainder of his term to reducing inequality, to which he devoted a major speech last week, will face significant political opposition inside and outside of Congress. Obama argues that government action is required to redress the growing disparity between rich and poor, diminished opportunities for upward mobility and economic stagnation. Public opinion, at least according to the Stimson analysis, is moving in precisely the opposite direction. A 2011 Pew Research Center survey gives us a glimpse of some of the headwinds Obama faces. Pew found that among all voters, capitalism (a rough proxy for deregulated markets) is viewed favorably by a 50-40 margin and socialism (a rough proxy for interventionist government) negatively by 60-31. An exception, according to Pew â illustrated in Figure 2 â lies in the views of black and Hispanic voters. Both groups hold more negative than positive views of capitalism: blacks 51-41, and Hispanics 55-32. Blacks hold a positive view of socialism, 55-36; Hispanics, by a modest 5 points, a negative view, 49-44. This Pew data suggests that pro-government activists of the kind Obama needs to back his inequality agenda remain a minority. One of the crucial questions in determining likely support for or opposition to government initiatives to remediate inequality is whether a voter believes that people are poor because of their own bad choices or thinks that poverty is the result of what pollsters call âcircumstancesâ: dangerous neighborhoods, inadequate housing, bad schools, discrimination. A Pew survey, conducted in 2012, produced results that demonstrated the nationâs ambivalence on this question. The more voters blame poverty on a lack of effort by the poor themselves, the more inclined they are to say that there are legions of âundeservingâ poor for whom taxpayer-funded government programs are not warranted. The more a respondent blames poverty on external circumstances, the more likely he or she is to support government action to remedy those circumstances. Overall, according to Pew, 46 percent of the public does not fault the poor, agreeing that their plight is the outcome of unfavorable circumstances, while 38 percent are more judgmental, declaring that poverty stems from a lack of individual effort. This relatively modest eight-point difference among all voters masks very large partisan â and significant racial and ethnic â divisions. A decisive majority of Republicans (see Figure 3), 57-27, say that people are poor because of a lack of effort, while an even larger majority of Democrats, 61-24, say âcircumstancesâ are the cause of poverty. Whites are split, 41-41, while blacks back circumstances 62-28, as do Hispanics, 59-27. In his Dec. 4 speech at the pro-Democratic Center for American Progress, Obama acknowledged the racial and ideological hurdles he faces. He told his audience:","output":"\\"Shifting Public Sentiments: Tracing the History and Impact of Economic Redistribution Attitudes in America\\" This comprehensive article grapples with the complexities of public sentiment towards economic redistribution in the United States. Throughout American history, support for these policies has generally been the exception rather than the norm, with notable periods of interest coinciding with the Depression era of the 1930s and fluctuating influence from 1945 to 1965.  Researchers Nathan Kelly from the University of Tennessee and Peter Enns from Cornell have examined polling data and inequality trends from 1952 to 2006, gauging public opinion amid rising inequality. Findings from their 2008 study indicate an interesting trend: as inequality in America increases, the public, surprisingly, inclines towards a conservative sentiment, dampening rather than promoting any significant shifts towards more redistributive policies. Their findings were further complemented by James Stimson’s research at the University of North Carolina. Utilizing all accessible commercial and academic surveys, including the American National Election Studies and Gallup polls, Stimson, like Kelly and Enns, noticed trends leaning towards conservatism, high opposition for liberal, pro-government initiatives and eroding support for government programs.  These trends carry significant implications, particularly regarding President Obama's plan for addressing income inequality during his term in office. His proposals' success largely hinges on the public's perception of capitalism vs. socialism, individual responsibility vs. circumstantial influences in poverty. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center show mixed sentiments, with public opinion divided along ethnic, racial, and partisan lines. Ultimately, this article seeks to enlighten readers about the historical and contemporary challenges facing economic redistribution policies and strategies. It underscores the crucial correlation between public opinion and government action, state initiatives, and national politics. The coverage encourages readers to critically analyze these trends and their implications on American society, particularly regarding the question of poverty's root causes and the role government intervention should play in addressing it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1978 the UN Security Council passed UN Resolution 435 which planned a transition toward independence for Namibia. Attempts to persuade South Africa to agree to the plan's implementation were not successful until 1988 when the transition to independence finally started under a diplomatic agreement between South Africa, Angola and Cuba, with the USSR and the USA as observers, under which South Africa agreed to withdraw and demobilise its forces in Namibia. As a result, Cuba agreed to pull back its troops in southern Angola sent to support the MPLA in its war for control of Angola with UNITA.

Sambar deer: One of the main prey of tigers, these large deer species are commonly found in tiger habitats in Asia. 2. Chital (Spotted deer): Another significant food source for tigers, these deer are found in various parts of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. 3. Wild boar: A widely distributed mammal, wild boars provide a viable food source for tigers across their range. 4. Gaur (Indian Bison): A large bovine species found in South Asia and Southeast Asia, gaurs are occasionally preyed upon by tigers. 5. Barking deer (Muntjac): These small deer also inhabit tiger territories and serve as potential prey. 6. Langurs: These primates are found in various forest types in Asia, and although not common prey for tigers, they can occasionally fall victim to them. 7. Rhesus macaque: Another primate species that shares habitat with tigers in Asia. 8. Leopards: As smaller predators, leopards share the same habitat with tigers and compete for similar resources, but they are known to avoid direct confrontations. 9. Dholes (Asiatic wild dogs): As pack hunters, dholes can also compete with tigers for food, but they generally target smaller prey. 10. Sloth bears: These omnivorous bears share the same habitat with tigers in some regions, and although not common, tigers can sometimes prey on sloth bears.

Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation The equation given is: -194*o + 1109 = 356 - 2351 First, we will simplify the right side of the equation: 356 - 2351 = -1995 Now the equation becomes: -194*o + 1109 = -1995 Step 2: Isolate the variable \\"o\\" We want to isolate \\"o\\" on the left side of the equation.

Question: Who does Chatterer slice into pieces? Movie title: Hellraiser: Hellworld Movie plot: The film introduces a circle of youths who are addicted to playing Hellworld, an online computer game based on the Hellraiser series. The film opens at the funeral of Adam, one of the friends who was obsessed with the game and was murdered by the Cenobites after, unknowingly, releasing them by solving the puzzle box, which was in his father's possession. The remaining five friends blame themselves for not having prevented Adam's suicide.Two years later, they nonetheless attend a private Hellworld Party at an old mansion. Mike, Derrick and Allison are enthusiastic about the party, while Chelsea only reluctantily accompanies them. Jake, who also attends, is still very much distressed by Adam's death. They are cordially welcomed by the middle-aged party host, who offers them drinks, shows them around the mansion, allegedly a former convent and asylum also built by Lemarchand, and provides them with cell phones to communicate with other guests.As the party progresses, Allison, Derrick and Mike find themselves trapped in separate parts of the house and are gruesomely killed by the Host, Pinhead, or Cenobite minions Chatterer and Bound. Jake and Chelsea separately find themselves treated as if they were invisible by the other party guests and the police (called in by Chelsea). They also encounter appearances by the Cenobites (including Allison and Mike) which all turn out to be hallucinations.Chelsea finds out that the Host is actually Adam's father who is out to avenge his son's death on his Hellworld-playing friends. The two flee the now empty mansion but are stopped by the Host, who now reveals he earlier drugged the five with a powerful psychedelic, buried them outside the house in coffins provided with a tube for air and called their cell phones to feed them suggestions.

Harrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day's Night, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife Maureen, which Boyd called \\"the final straw\\". She characterised the last year of their marriage as \\"fuelled by alcohol and cocaine\\", and she stated: \\"George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart.\\" She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.Harrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978.

Animal studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) suppresses ovarian PGE2 production and ovulation. Although the expression of NO synthases has been detected in human granulosa cells, the effect of NO on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in these cells remains unknown.', 'The purpose of this article was to investigate the effects of NO on COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in human granulosa cells.', 'SVOG cells are human granulosa cells that were obtained from women undergoing in vitro fertilization and immortalized with simian virus 40 large T antigen.

The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern.

Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime. I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as \\"who's on first\\" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that \\"who's on first\\" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist. Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave 6's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey.

Josh Samuels, who moderated an International Game Developer’s Association “Women in Games Allies” roundtable, said he believes there is more work to be done in an industry that pushing for inclusion.      “I’m willing to give companies the benefit of the doubt if they immediately disavow and say no we did not want that,” Samuels said. “Diversity is becoming more of a front burner concern for sure. I think having something like exotic dancers at a Microsoft party is a big step back from that.” ||||| Microsoft is in hot water after the company’s after-hours party at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco featured dancers in “sexy schoolgirl” outfits dancing on podiums.      Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft’s Xbox division, issued a statement declaring the decision to have the dancers at the party “unequivocally wrong.”      “It has come to my attention that at Xbox-hosted events at GDC this past week, we represented Xbox and Microsoft in a way that was absolutely not consistent or aligned to our values,” Spencer said. “That was unequivocally wrong and will not be tolerated. This matter is being handled internally, but let me be very clear — how we represent ourselves as individuals, who we hire and partner with and how we engage with others is a direct reflection of our brand and what we stand for. When we do the opposite, and create an environment that alienates or offends any group, we justly deserve the criticism.”      Also Read: Microsoft Isn't Saying Why It's Closing One Of Its Biggest Video Game Studios      Flashy after-hours parties at GDC cause controversy seemingly on an annual basis, and the reason for it is usually the same: the hiring of female dancers to perform during the parties. Microsoft is at the center of this year’s controversy this year, but in 2015 the chief offender was graphics card maker Nvidia, which also featured dancers at its 2016 event.      @spamoir I was going to do the same thing pic.twitter.com/FB6rsmcf7R — Farah Khalaf @ GDC (@farahkhlf) March 18, 2016      The games industry has a reputation as a boy’s club that would prefer to keep women out, and it’s a common complaint that parties like this one do nothing but reinforce that idea. Consequently, that’s believed to have discouraged women from seeking careers in the industry.      A 2014 Independent Game Developers Association survey indicated that less than a quarter of the game industry workforce was female.      Earlier on Thursday Microsoft held a Women in Games luncheon at the conference. ||||| Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.      Enlarge Image IvanMoen/Instagram screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET      Every time you think the era of booth babes has passed, something else comes along to make you wonder whether tech has changed at all.      At Microsoft's official Xbox party on Thursday night at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, dancers entertained in tight bra-like tops and fishnet tights. Their short plaid skirts suggested a sort of comely schoolgirl look.      That didn't sit well with some attendees, watchdogs and even company officials who note the display runs contrary to the company's said efforts to be more inclusive and to help elevate women in their careers in technology.      Microsoft didn't say who hired the dancers and even Aaron Greenberg, head of Xbox games marketing, was apparently unaware of what the night had in store.      \\"Very disappointed to see this, going to follow up with team,\\" Greenberg tweeted on Friday.      The company later took full responsibility.      \\"We represented Xbox and Microsoft in a way that was not consistent or aligned to our values,\\" Xbox head Phil Spencer said in a statement, referring to the party. \\"It was unequivocally wrong and will not be tolerated. I know we disappointed many people and I'm personally committed to holding ourselves to higher standards. We must ensure that diversity and inclusion are central to our everyday business and core values. We will do better in the future.\\"      The Twitterverse, of course, was not as formal in its response to the party's entertainment.      Giant Spacekat co-founder Brianna Wu, a game developer who has been vocal about antagonistic attitudes toward women in the industry, tweeted: \\"Extremely disappointed @Microsoft and @Xbox hired women wearing these outfits to perform at @gd. PLEASE RT.\\"      Kamina Vincent, who attended the party, tweeted that the party cements her place as a customer of rival console Sony PlayStation. She later added: \\"Making a formal complaint tomorrow. I will not stand for this. I'm trying to encourage women into the industry then this happens.\\"      It seems that no matter how obvious the issue is, some eyes remain closed and some ears remain deaf. For all the necessary and strident conversation about the role of women in technology, there are those who believe nothing has changed and every tech festival still celebrates sausages.      But this was Microsoft, the same company that had, earlier in the conference, sponsored a \\"Women In Games\\" lunch.      This is the same Microsoft whose CEO, Satya Nadella, mused that women in tech shouldn't ask for raises, but instead rely on good karma. (He subsequently apologized.)      Microsoft isn't alone in knowing it should address such attitudes. But then someone goes and spoils it all.      I suspect that someone might be dancing on hot coals today. ||||| In an email, Kathleen Hogan says the company’s top leaders were “embarrassed and appalled” when they heard about scantily clad female dancers at the Xbox-hosted party.      The appearance of scantily clad female dancers at an Xbox event this week was “unacceptable in terms of how we treat women and how we represent Microsoft,” Kathleen Hogan, the Redmond company’s human resources chief, said in an email to employees on Saturday.      Hogan’s email comes after the company was criticized for the appearance of dancers in schoolgirl outfits, apparently hired to entertain guests at a party the company’s Xbox unit hosted on the sidelines of the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.      The scene, which came to light in social media posts Friday, highlighted for some the history of sexism in the video game business, along with the male-dominated technology industry’s struggles to build a more diverse workforce.      The images emerged as Microsoft’s senior leadership team, the company’s dozen senior leaders, and other executives were wrapping up a two-day annual planning retreat at a resort in central Washington.      “When we heard about this and saw the photos, the entire Senior Leadership Team was embarrassed and appalled,” Hogan said in her email. “We are not going to tolerate this.”      The group within Microsoft’s legal team responsible for looking into breaches of company policy was investigating the event, Hogan said.      Hogan, appointed to the HR post at the end of 2014, also forwarded to all Microsoft employees the note Xbox chief Phil Spencer sent to his team on Friday. Hogan said she had heard from many employees directly and on the company’s Yammer social networking service after the event.      “It is not a stretch to say that the company as a whole is shocked and upset, and that we all are determined that this is never repeated,” Hogan said.      Read the rest of Hogan’s email below:      From: Kathleen Hogan      Sent: Saturday, March 19, 2016 3:56 PM      To: Microsoft – All Employees; Retail: All FTE      Subject: Microsoft Values & Commitment      I’m sharing Phil Spencer’s mail about the party Microsoft sponsored Thursday evening in San Francisco at the Game Developers Conference. When we heard about this and saw the photos, the entire Senior Leadership Team was embarrassed and appalled.      This is unacceptable in terms of how we treat women and how we represent Microsoft, and it undermines the culture we are working so hard to cultivate – one that is diverse and inclusive and grounded in a growth mindset.      We are not going to tolerate this. I appreciate that we will be judged by our deeds, and not just our words. And yet every day, we see our people taking important and meaningful steps forward in our journey towards inclusion. As one example, at this same Game Developers Conference we had dedicated and passionate Microsoft employees sponsoring a Gaming 4 Everyone event.      I have heard from many of you individually and on Yammer that you can’t believe we let this happen. It is not a stretch to say that the company as a whole is shocked and upset, and that we all are determined that this is never repeated. In addition to what Phil says, Microsoft’s Employee Relations Investigations Team is involved to make sure we have a full understanding of what happened. And beyond this incident, we are strengthening our commitment to our diversity and inclusion efforts, while evaluating where we must take stronger action to show we are more resolute than ever to make progress and hold ourselves accountable.

In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\".

While Jaron Long undoubtedly had a successful college baseball career and is a talented professional baseball player now, it is impossible to definitively conclude that he was the best player on his college baseball team without further information.  Baseball is a sport that involves multiple positions and a wide array of skills, so comparing players in different positions can be challenging. Talents such as hitting, pitching, fielding, and base running are often evaluated separately, and it is challenging to determine an overall \\"best\\" player on a team. Statistics such as batting average, earned run average, and fielding percentage can give insight into a player's performance, but they do not always tell the full story. To say that Jaron Long was the best player on his college team, we would need to have a comprehensive knowledge of his team's roster during his tenure, the statistical performance of each player at their respective positions, and the overall impact each player had on the team's success. Furthermore, the term \\"best\\" can be subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives, the importance placed on different skills, and the team's specific needs at any given time.

No. In your description of Diego Cavalieri, there is no mention of him being a part of a team that won the World Cup.

The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious football event, organized every four years since 1930, excluding the years during World War II. Brazil as a national team has historically been successful at the World Cup, winning the tournament a record five times. However, having represented Brazil 3 times doesn't necessarily mean Diego Cavalieri was a part of those winning squads. Cavalieri was born in 1982. Considering the age at which footballers typically start and end their international careers, Cavalieri would have been eligible to play in World Cups from around 2002 (aged around 20) up until around 2018 (aged around 36). Brazil won the World Cup in 2002, but there's no information in your provided description that he was part of that team. Brazil, however, did not win the World Cup after 2002 and up until the present day. Therefore, without further information, we can't reach a conclusion that Diego Cavalieri has won a World Cup.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Face-to-face communication involves much more than the spoken word.In fact, we often communicate our feelings to others through our body language without realizing we are doing so.We communicate through posture, gesture and facial expression.But the eyes also play an important part in this unspoken language.William Shakespeare called the eyes \\"a window to the soul,\\" and you can learn to look through that window and better understand a person's body language by reading eye movement. Begin a conversation and ask a simple question.Watch carefully for eye movement during the response.If the person looks up, he or she is thinking or forming pictures.This is also a sign of a visual thinker.Looking up and to the left shows recalling a memory, while looking up and to the right could show imaginative construction or lying. If the person looks down, this could be a sign of obedience  or even blame.Looking down and to the left can show a person talking to themselves.Looking down and to the right can show that they are feeling strong emotion. Looking sideways can indicate distraction or checking out a potential  threat, hut a sideways glance can also show anger.In addition, eyes that look side to side often show shiftiness  and lying. A glance usually indicates a desire for something.Glancing at a door could show a desire to leave the room, while a glance, at a person could indicate a desire to talk to them.A glance is also used when it is forbidden to look at something. A person who is lying to you may hold eye contact longer than normal.In addition, this person might smile with his mouth but not with his eyes.Smiling with the eyes is difficult to do if the emotion is not genuine. Rapid blinking of the eyes can occur when a person is thinking, and this can also be another sign of lying.Again, a person who is aware of this sign might overcompensate  and stare.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the bridge that opened with a ceremony? , can you please find it?   Lake Burley Griffin is crossed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge (310 metres or 1,020 feet), Kings Avenue Bridge (270 metres or 890 feet) and a roadway over Scrivener Dam. The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \\"integral lighting\\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony. Menzies called it \\"the finest building in the national capital\\". Answer:","output":"The name of the bridge that opened with a ceremony is Kings Avenue Bridge.

Based on the premise \\"This law is rigidly enforced; consequently, motorboats are seldom available for hire to tourists.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"It is difficult to find motorboats that tourists can hire.\\" is true?","output":"Yes, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"It is difficult to find motorboats that tourists can hire\\" is true based on the given premise. Let's analyze the premise and how it supports the hypothesis in detail. The premise states that \\"This law is rigidly enforced; consequently, motorboats are seldom available for hire to tourists.\\" It implies two important pieces of information: 1. There is a law that affects the availability of motorboats for hire to tourists. 2. This law is rigidly enforced, which is the reason behind the scarcity of motorboats for hire. A rigidly enforced law means that the people and the authorities consistently and strictly adhere to and implement the regulations associated with the law. This implies that there is little to no room for deviation or exceptions. In this context, the law is designed to limit or restrict the availability of motorboats for tourists to hire. As a result of this strict enforcement, motorboats are described as \\"seldom available for hire to tourists.\\" The term \\"seldom\\" refers to the infrequent or rare occurrence of something, in this case, the availability of motorboats. It indicates that it is not easy for tourists to find motorboats they can hire, which directly supports our hypothesis. Considering the strong correlation between the rigid enforcement of the law and the limited availability of motorboats for hire to tourists, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis \\"It is difficult to find motorboats that tourists can hire\\" is true. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the entire statement is reliable and accurate. It is essential to recognize that our conclusion is contingent on the validity of the given premise. If the premise turns out to be false or inaccurate, the conclusion might change accordingly. However, given the information we have, the hypothesis appears to be true."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about American football positions.

(Associated Press) This photo combination of images shows the 10 highest paid women CEOs in 2016, according to a study carried out by executive compensation data firm Equilar and The Associated Press. Top row, from left:... (Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — Women CEOs earned big bucks last year, but there's still very few of them running the world's largest companies.      The median pay for a female CEO was 13.1 million last year, up 9 percent from 2015, according to an analysis by executive data firm Equilar and The Associated Press. By comparison, male CEOs earned 11.4 million, also up 9 percent.      But the number of women in CEO roles has barely budged. Just 6 percent of the top paid CEOs in the U.S. last year were women, according to the Equilar and AP analysis, a slight increase from about 5 percent in 2015 and 2014.      The highest paid woman was Virginia Rometty of International Business Machines Corp., bumping out Yahoo's Marissa Mayer from the top spot.      Rometty earned 32.3 million last year from the technology company, a 63 percent jump from the year before, mainly due to 12.1 million in stock option awards she didn't receive in 2015.      Mayer earned 27.4 million last year, making her the second-highest paid woman. But she may be out of a job after Yahoo Inc. completes the sale of its websites and email services to Verizon Communications Inc. in June. She's not expected to join Verizon, and Yahoo has said Mayer will receive a 23 million severance package if she departs.      Third on the list was Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo Inc., the maker of Mountain Dew soda and Lay's potato chips. She earned 25.2 million, up 13 percent from 2015. She was followed by Mary Barra, the CEO of automaker General Motors Co., who earned 22.4 million.      On the bottom of the list was Susan Story of American Water Works Co., the utility company, who earned 4.1 million.      To calculate pay, Equilar added salary, bonus, perks, stock awards, stock option awards and other types of compensation. Equilar only looked at companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index that filed proxy statements with federal regulators between Jan. 1 and May 1, 2017. And it only included CEOs that have been in their roles for at least two years in order to exclude sign-on bonuses. Of the 346 CEOs in that group, just 21 were women.      The only black woman on the list, Xerox's Ursula Burns, left the CEO role in January after the document management company split in two. Burns, who earned 13.1 million as CEO last year, retired as chairman of Xerox Corp.'s board this week.      Gracia Martore, who earned 8.5 million last year, announced earlier this month that she will retire as CEO of Tegna Inc., the TV station owner and operator. Her replacement is a man.      Experts say companies need to do more to get women into CEO roles.      Janice Ellig, the co-CEO of executive search firm Chadick Ellig, says \\"unconscious bias\\" in the workplace is keeping women from getting opportunities that will put them on track to for top roles.      Companies need to \\"start recognizing that gender inequality exists,\\" say Ellig, who is also chairperson of the Women's Forum of New York.      \\"If you don't recognize a problem, you can't solve a problem,\\" she says. ||||| These are the 10 highest-paid women CEOs for 2016, as calculated by The Associated Press and Equilar, an executive data firm.      ———      1.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage. Problem:Which of the following is not a music term: grace notes, dexterity or octaves?, Context: In 1841, Léon Escudier wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \\"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \\"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\\" He further stated: \\"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Understand the given question Usage: Which of the following is not a music term: grace notes, dexterity or octaves? Explanation: The question asks to identify the term that is not related to music among the three options provided - grace notes, dexterity, and octaves. Part #2: Locate relevant information in the context passage Usage: In the passage, we can find mentions of grace notes, dexterity, and octaves in the following sentences: - \\"In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction, and grace.\\" (grace notes) - \\"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\\" (dexterity) - \\"The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.\\" (octaves) Explanation: The passage provides information about each of the terms, which helps in understanding the context and their relation to music. Part #3: Analyze and answer based on the context passage Usage: Answer: Dexterity is not a music term. Explanation: While both \\"grace notes\\" and \\"octaves\\" are explicitly discussed in the context of Chopin's musical techniques (grace notes as a technique to add lightness and sweetness to the composition, and octaves as part of the entire range of the keyboard and chord groupings), \\"dexterity\\" is a more general term, referring to the skill in using one's hands, in this case for piano playing specifically. The passage does not mention it as a music term itself, but rather as a quality to be achieved by studying hand position in relation to the keys."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Great Lakes, consisting of Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are an incredible natural wonder and hold about 20% of the world's freshwater. They were formed over a period of around 2 million years, with their formation primarily attributed to the movement of massive glaciers during the last Ice Age. These glaciers, some over a mile thick, moved across the landscape, carving out river valleys, deepening existing depressions, and leaving behind moraines and other glacial deposits. As the glaciers retreated, they left a series of basins that filled with meltwater, ultimately forming the Great Lakes we know today. Michigan, as a state, is closely associated with the Great Lakes, as it has more than 3,000 miles of shoreline touching four of the five lakes: Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie. This close connection to the Great Lakes has had a significant impact on Michigan's history, economy, and culture.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.   - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991.   - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.  - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA. UEFA consists of 55 national association members.  - The UEFA Champions League is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champion (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of each UEFA national association.

Q:Information:  - Alla breve is a musical meter notated by the time signature symbol (a C with a line through it), which is the equivalent of . The term is Italian for \\"in the style of the breve\\".  - An eighth note ( American ) or a quaver ( British ) is a musical note played for half the value of a quarter note ( crotchet ) and twice that of the sixteenth note ( semiquaver ) , which amounts to one quarter the duration of a half note ( minim ) , one eighth the duration of whole note ( semibreve ) , one sixteenth the duration of a double whole note ( breve ) , and one thirty - second the duration of a longa , hence the name . It is the equivalent of the fusa in mensural notation ( Morehen and Rastell 2001 ) Eighth notes are notated with an oval , filled - in note head and a straight note stem with one flag note flag ( see Figure 1 ) . A related symbol is the eighth rest ( or quaver rest ) , which denotes a silence for the same duration . In Unicode , the symbols U +266A (  ) and U +266B (  ) are an eighth note and beamed pair of eighth notes respectively . The two symbols are inherited from the early 1980s code page 437 , where they occupied codes 13 and 14 respectively . Additions to the Unicode standard also incorporated additional eighth note depictions from Japanese emoji sets : ascending eighth notes ( U +1F39C ,  ) , descending eighth noes ( U +1F39D ,  ) , a graphical generic musical note generally depicted as an eighth note ( U +1F3B5 ,  ) , and three unconnected eighth notes in sequence ( U +1F3B6 ,  ) . Unicode 's Musical Symbols block includes several variations of the eighth note ; these are the versions intended to be used in computerized musical notation ( as opposed to the others , which are graphical dingbats ) . As with all notes with stems , the general rule is that eighth notes are drawn with stems to the right of the notehead , facing up , when they are below the middle line of the musical staff . When they are on or above the middle line , they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head , facing down . Alternatively , stems are used to indicate voicing or parts ; all stems for the upper voice 's notes ( or \`\` parts '' ) are drawn facing up , regardless of their position on the...  - Mensural notation is the musical notation system used for European vocal polyphonic music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term \\"mensural\\" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like \\"musica mensurata\\" (\\"measured music\\") or \\"cantus mensurabilis\\" (\\"measurable song\\") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to \\"musica plana\\" or \\"musica choralis\\", i.e., Gregorian plainchant. With mensural notation being employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, plainchant retained its own, older system of neume notation throughout the period, while some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific tablature notation.  - In music, a whole note (American) or semibreve (British) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head and no note stem. Its length is equal to four beats in time, that is the whole measure (or bar). Most other notes are fractions of the whole note (e.g., half notes and quarter notes are played for one half and one quarter the duration of the whole note, respectively).  - In music, a double whole note (American), breve (international), or double note is a note lasting two times as long as a whole note (or \\"semibreve\\"). In medieval mensural notation, the \\"brevis\\" (ancestor of the modern breve) was one of the shortest note lengthshence its name, which is the Latin etymon of \\"brief\\" . In \\"perfect\\" rhythmic mode, the brevis was a third of a \\"longa\\", or in \\"imperfect\\" mode half a \\"longa\\" (for full details of the complications here, see for example ). However, in modern music notation it is the longest note value still in common use .  - In music, a half note (American) or minim (British) is a note played for half the duration of a whole note (or semibreve) and twice the duration of a quarter note (or crotchet). It was given its Latin name (\\"minim\\", meaning \\"least or smallest\\") because it was the shortest of the five note values used in early medieval music notation . In time signatures with 4 as the bottom number, such as or time, the half note is two beats long. However, when 2 is the bottom number (including \\"alla breve\\"), the half note is one beat long.  - A quarter note (American) or crotchet (British, from the sense 'hook') is a note played for one quarter of the duration of a whole note (or \\"semibreve\\"). Often, musicians will say that a crotchet is one beat, but this is not always correct, as the beat is indicated by the time signature of the music; a quarter note may or may not be the beat. Quarter notes are notated with a filled-in oval note head and a straight, flagless stem. The stem usually points upwards if it is below the middle line of the stave or downwards if it is on or above the middle line. However, the stem direction may differentiate more than one part. The head of the note also reverses its orientation in relation to the stem. (See image.)  - A neume (sometimes spelled neum) is the basic element of Western and Eastern systems of musical notation prior to the invention of five-line staff notation. The word entered the English language in the Middle English forms \\"newme\\", \\"nevme\\", \\"neme\\" in the 15th century, from the Middle French \\"neume\\", in turn from either medieval Latin \\"pneuma\\" or \\"neuma\\", the former either from ancient Greek (\\"breath\\") or (\\"sign\\"), or else directly from Greek as a corruption or an adaptation of the former.  - Tablature (or tabulature, or tab for short) is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - In music, a 16th note (American) or semiquaver (British) is a note played for half the duration of an eighth note (quaver), hence the name. It is the equivalent of the semifusa in mensural notation, first found in 15th-century notation .  - The time signature (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are to be contained in each bar and which note value is to be given one beat. In a musical score, the time signature appears at the beginning of the piece, as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as or (read \\"common time\\" and \\"three-four time\\", respectively), immediately following the key signature or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty. A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"    What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'eighth note'?

Given those answer options, answer the question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. Question: What is probably true about Trump? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"It is probably true that President Donald Trump may be urged by North Korea human rights advocates to confront Kim Jong Un about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, such as the network of political prison camps and widespread government-sanctioned abuses, during their meeting in Singapore.

However, it is unclear whether human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit. The primary focus of the summit seems to be on the denuclearization process and the lifting of economic sanctions, but human rights activists urge that human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea improves its treatment of its citizens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: CLOSE As kids head back to school, you may want to rethink whether your child should play tackle football. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY      Ursula Goldston appears in an undated photo with her father Ralph, who played in the NFL from 1952-55. (Photo: Goldston family)      For debilitated and often-broke former football players and their families, the National Football League's agreement to pay more than 1 billion in a settlement for victims of chronic brain trauma appeared to be the end of the battle that had consumed them for years.      The money was supposed to provide a measure of peace and stability for the wives, widows and children of tormented players who had died young or are fading away in nursing homes. Not disclosed, however, is the significant portion of the fund that is being withheld from those it was promised.      As the award notifications begin to trickle out, some of the recipients have been stunned to find they may receive just pennies on the dollar of what they’re owed, likely setting off another spate of frustrating court battles.      Some have even received notices that show pending payments in the negative.      Sarah Goldston, the 90-year-old widow of Ralph Goldston – who was one of the first black players on the Philadelphia Eagles in 1952 before Alzheimer’s set in during his retirement – learned this month that their family had been awarded 160,000 from the settlement. But that preliminary award dwindled to negative 740 after deductions and “holdbacks,” including thousands the court has kept in case the family owes money for Ralph’s medical bills.      “I thought they made a mistake,” Ralph’s daughter, Ursula Goldston, said after seeing the family might receive nothing because of the pending liens, which email correspondences show might have been withheld in error. \\"I just cannot believe these people did that.”      USA TODAY reviewed documents or interviewed families in a dozen cases of former players whose settlement projections have been similarly reduced. Money that the former players or their family members had counted on will instead, for now, remain in the NFL’s settlement fund or will be redirected to insurance companies, lawyers, credit card companies or others who have placed a lien on the awards in an effort to secure a piece of the payout.      More: NFL had 'intervention' with seven teams on concussion rates      More: Pop Warner football is offering 'crash course' on concussion conundrum      More: Family of Junior Seau settles concussion lawsuit against NFL      The payout determinations are not final. Court officials and lawyers are sorting through the lienholders’ claims, while players can also appeal their deductions for an additional cost of 1,000. Out of 20,000 players involved in the suit, less than 700 have been approved for payment so far.      Some of the former players, as well as outside observers, blame in part lawyers who have filed liens seeking a large percentage of the awards even though they did minimal work on the case or recruited players with false promises after the settlement was reached.      USA TODAY reviewed letters in which former attorneys, who were fired before the case settled, demanded as much as 25 percent of a player’s award for as little as 15 months of work. The firms indicated in the letters that their work product amounted to “considerable time and effort.” They say they deserve fair compensation for helping qualify players to receive a settlement and that the lien is largely a fight with the new lawyer over fees.      John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School, reviewed a sample of the settlement payout notices obtained by USA TODAY. He said if attorneys who did little work are demanding large chunks of a player’s award, that amounts to “unjust enrichment.”      “That’s where you should be outraged,” he said.      'Patently unfair'      It’s now on those players to dispute the work their old lawyers put in, and a magistrate judge will ultimately decide if and how much of a cut they will get.      The settlement terms created a formula for each player’s specific case and then a court administrator decides how much of the settlement fund to disperse, while holding back any money contested in a lien.      As of this month, payouts in the settlement total almost 570 million, according to a claims administrator. Though it includes claims the NFL has appealed, the high dollar figure has been touted by both sides as evidence that the settlement is already compensating players.      But until now, the specific dollar amounts withheld from players had not been reported. Those involved will not release what share of the total payouts are actually deductions and disputed liens.      Jim Acho, a Michigan attorney who has represented roughly three dozen retired players, said that his clients have said they are stunned by the holdbacks. He called some of the deductions “patently unfair” and said they “eviscerate a big chunk of the payment,” leaving his clients with a fraction of what they expected.      “When it really hits home for them is when your are sent the breakdown of the payout by the claims administrator,”Acho said. He added that his clients have likened the reduced payouts to being “punched in the gut.\\"      Craig Mitnick, a lawyer whose firm co-represents more than 1,000 players in the class-action, said he now regrets publicly championing the agreement when it was first announced. Clients who fought for years to get a piece of the settlement have seen their potential payouts reduced to the low thousands, or even to nothing, by the holdbacks, he said.      \\"These players didn’t know what they were getting into,” Mitnick said. “The settlement is not what we thought it was.\\"      Players and their families who spoke with USA TODAY said the withheld payouts are the latest insult in a years-long battle to hold the NFL, the world’s highest-earning sports league, accountable for brain injuries incurred during playing careers. The league long denied connections between the sport and lasting brain injury and, the suit claimed, failed to warn players or do what it could to protect them from head trauma caused by hard hits, leading to a condition now known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE.      Plaintiffs have complained in the past that the legal battle against the NFL has been full of trapdoors and fine print that has tested resolve and stretched bank accounts, all while dealing with the devastating long-term impact of careers spent in football. Some had to unearth decades-old proof of their playing days and medical history before fighting through audits, appeals and narrow diagnosis criteria to show the court they deserved part of the settlement.      “A lot of people would have given up by now,” Ursula Goldston said. She and her family corralled decades-old paperwork documenting her father’s illness from past doctors. They got letters from neighbors who witnessed Ralph declining. One saw him standing by himself outside in the Ohio winter, freezing and confused, years ago. He stopped bathing and caring for himself. He lashed out at his wife in fits of rage.      “I’m not giving up,” Goldston said, “because my mother deserves this money.”      Different from other settlements      The terms of the class-action settlement are a result of negotiations between lawyers representing the players as a whole and those for the NFL. In interviews, many of those on the players’ side faulted Chris Seeger, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, for negotiating settlement terms that they said opened the door for holdbacks without safeguards to ensure players don’t leave empty-handed.      In a letter sent to USA TODAY, Seeger wrote that the court accepted the terms and payout structure. He pointed to the hundreds of millions in approved payouts as evidence that the settlement was “working effectively.”      \\"It is required by law” to hold back funds until medical liens are resolved, Seeger wrote. He added that no players whose medical liens had been finalized had received a negative payout.      In a statement from Seeger after the story was published online, he wrote, in part, that “the majority had 0 deducted from their awards for medical liens or lien-related fees. For the minority that did pay medical liens and related fees, their average deduction has been 2.2%.”      In other high-profile class-action cases with large settlements, the parties negotiated the ability to increase award amounts to make sure deserving victims did not see their payouts diminished, said Kenneth Feinberg, an attorney who has administered class-action settlements, including one stemming from the September 11 attacks.      “We had broad discretion to prevent the injustice of an eligible member getting nothing due to the cold calculation of a formula,” Feinberg said.      Similar steps were not taken to ensure NFL players won’t walk away with very low or no awards.      “I’m afraid that wasn’t part of the negotiating,” said Larry Coben, a lawyer for the plaintiffs involved in reaching the terms of the settlement.      The NFL declined to make a league official available for an interview. In a statement, the league did not address the issue of depleted awards but said, “The settlement program is working as intended, and we will continue to work in good faith to pay all approved claims under this settlement, which has been thoughtfully and thoroughly negotiated by the parties and approved by multiple courts.”      Coben defended the broader terms of this deal – which has been criticized by debilitated former players as too full of exclusions and provisions – as “not a one-time shot.”      “Ten to 15 years from now, if their condition worsens, they could apply again and potentially get a benefit,” Coben said.      Echoing an opinion of the federal judge overseeing the settlement, Coben justified the holdbacks as a measure to negotiate down liens and prevent players from later getting sued by medical providers or other entities. It’s not uncommon for large, public settlements like this to open the door for third parties who think they are due a cut. Health care plans with hospitals, insurance providers and Medicare often specify some sort of repayment should a patient ever win a windfall settlement meant to help cover the cost of care.      Some of the payout notices reviewed by USA TODAY show initial awards calculated by the administrator reduced to nothing after all the pending lien holdbacks.      After Gordon Smith – a Minnesota Vikings tight end who played in the 1960s – went through a formula that calculated his age at the time of his Alzheimer's diagnosis, degree of illness, years in the league and medical history, the courts administrator awarded him 183,000 for his brain trauma.      But because private insurance had covered some of the costs related to his care, the courts administrator held back all but 4,600.      Smith’s wife, Maetha, who spoke on Gordon’s behalf, said she was shocked at the amount after seeing the public statements about large payouts from the NFL and lawyers who negotiated the settlement.      “We were hearing hundreds of thousands,” she said. \\"This settlement is minuscule.”      The administrator awarded Barbara Stark 100,000 in a settlement for her husband, Ed Cooke, a defensive end on five teams in the 1960s who later developed Alzheimer’s. After holdbacks for pending liens, the final figure showed Cooke is slated to receive negative 200.      Andrew Stewart, a 52-year-old former linebacker who has Parkinson’s disease, said that angry phone calls and messages are circulating among retired players and their wives after receiving notices detailing their settlement payouts.      “It’s shocking what the offsets are,” said Stewart, who was on the Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals and San Francisco 49ers from 1989 through 1993. He saw his own potential award drop from 3 million to 750,000 after the administrator reduced the amount of seasons he was credited for because he missed time with injuries. He has not yet received his claim determination because his case is tied up in appeals, he said.      “I’ve heard of guys receiving a tenth of what they were going to get,” Stewart said. “Nobody’s getting what they thought they were getting.”      Officials working on the claim distribution said many of the liens placed on players’ payouts are from former lawyers, some of whom were fired before the class-action litigation even began.      Sandra Irvin, speaking on behalf of her husband, Darrell, a defensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks in the early 1980s who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, called her fired attorney’s 200,000 lien an affront.      “I think we got a total of three phone calls from them,” Irvin said. “What a joke.”      Contributing: A.J. Perez ||||| Photo: Chris Graythen (Getty)      The NFL’s 1 billion class-action settlement with retired players suffering from the effects of brain trauma has yet to make life much easier for those awarded damages. A bureaucratic morass has made it nearly impossible for the ex-players and their families to navigate the settlement, and even the ones who have made it through are running into trouble.            USA Today reports that a number of plaintiffs have had excessive liens put on their awards and are now in line to receive little or no money at all. One ex-player even had a six-figure settlement turn into a debt:      Sarah Goldston, the 90-year-old widow of Ralph Goldston – who was one of the first black players on the Philadelphia Eagles in 1952 before Alzheimer’s set in during his retirement – learned this month that their family had been awarded 160,000 from the settlement. But that preliminary award dwindled to negative 740 after deductions and “holdbacks,” including thousands the court has kept in case the family owes money for Ralph’s medical bills. “I thought they made a mistake,” Ralph’s daughter, Ursula Goldston, said after seeing the family might receive nothing because of the pending liens, which email correspondences show might have been withheld in error. “I just cannot believe these people did that.”      Advertisement      The liens have been placed by various parties including credit card companies and insurance companies, but the biggest culprits are lawyers who did very little work on the case but are demanding huge fees. The settlement process has long been plagued by the presence of lawyers with predatory fee structures designed to eat up more than half of the total settlement. Some of these lawyers were fired by their clients before the class-action litigation ever began.      This is just the latest in a long line of obstacles, ranging from endless red tape to denials of symptoms, that have been erected to keep the ex-players from their money. It’s almost as if this entire process has been designed to be as arduous and painstaking as possible.

Wetland: Wetlands are an important part of an ecosystem, as they serve as a habitat for various plants and animals that thrive in those conditions. They also play a crucial role in water purification and flood control. Wetlands consist of different types of plants, such as grasses, trees, and other aquatic plants, which require sunlight for their growth. Therefore, wetlands are considered parts of the ecosystem. 2. Garbage: Garbage, as a form of human-made waste, is not a natural part of an ecosystem. It can, however, affect ecosystems negatively as it pollutes the environment, disrupts the habitat of living organisms, and hinders ecological processes. Hence, garbage is not considered a valid part of an ecosystem. 3. Trees: Trees are an essential part of an ecosystem, as they provide habitat and food sources for a wide range of species. They also play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of gases in the atmosphere, acting as carbon sinks, and providing shade and shelter. Since trees are green plants, they require sunlight for growth, thereby relating to Facts 1 and 2. 4. Steam: Steam is not considered a part of an ecosystem. It is a byproduct of various natural processes, like geothermal activity, or human activities, such as industrial processes. Therefore, steam does not directly contribute to the functioning of an ecosystem. 5. Grass: Grass is a part of the ecosystem, as it is a green plant that requires sunlight for growth. It acts as an important food source for herbivores and provides ground coverage, preventing soil erosion. Grasses are also crucial in maintaining the balance of gases in the atmosphere and play a role in nutrient cycling. 6. Oak: Oak is a type of tree and, as discussed earlier, trees are an essential part of an ecosystem. They require sunlight for growth, provide habitat and food sources for a variety of species, and are vital in maintaining gas balances in the atmosphere. 7. Plants: Plants, in general, are a fundamental part of the ecosystem. They convert sunlight into energy through the process of photosynthesis, which contributes to the sustenance of life. Plants provide food, habitat, and raw materials for other living organisms and are essential in the maintenance of environmental processes like nutrient cycling and gas balance. 8. Plastics: Plastics, like garbage, are human-made materials that are not a natural part of an ecosystem. Plastics can negatively impact ecosystems through pollution, habitat disruption, and the entanglement or ingestion of plastic debris by wildlife. Thus, plastics are not considered parts of the ecosystem. In conclusion, the parts of the ecosystem among the options provided are wetland, trees, grass, oak, and plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \\"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\\" Tom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing. Tom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby. The ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself. But the Manager strolled out of the second theater with a broad grin, revealing his cutting overbite. \\"I don't know why,\\" the Manager exclaimed, \\"but they love it!\\" \\"Most of them are from the 'Ed 9 Film Society,'\\" Tom replied. \\"By the way, I need to restock the chocolates.\\" Tom sighs by the glass counter:  A.

Output:","output":"Adverse drug event Step-by-step explanation: 1. Understand the task: The task is to classify if a given medical case report indicates the presence of any adverse drug reaction. There are two possible categories: non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. 2. Analyze the input: In the given input, \\"We attribute the clinical and radiographic findings to cytotoxic edema secondary to intrathecal methotrexate\\", there are several key phrases to focus on. These include \\"cytotoxic edema\\", \\"secondary to intrathecal methotrexate\\", and \\"clinical and radiographic findings\\". 3. Identify the cause and effect: From the input, the clinical and radiographic findings seem to be the effect (adverse reaction) while the cause is the \\"intrathecal methotrexate\\" medication. With the phrase \\"secondary to intrathecal methotrexate\\", we can understand that the medication might be the reason for adverse reaction. 4. Compare with the definition of the task: According to the definition, an adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products, which requires prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product. The given input indicates that there was an adverse reaction (cytotoxic edema) due to the use of a medical product (intrathecal methotrexate). 5.

Kim Jong-Un is planning one of his 'purges' to rid North Korea of one of the country's most powerful figures, after the country's records reveal that they, not the son of Kim Jong-Il, might be the rightful heir to the communist state. 200 figures in Pyongyang are supposedly expected to be in the sights of the current leader of North Korea, because of their loyalty to his uncle, Jang Song-taek, who was executed late last year. But Choe Ryong-Hae, currently joint chairman of the powerful Politburo Presidium and political director of the North Korea People's Army has been singled out because of the new evidence which could threaten his leadership. Now, new reports indicate that it was OPTIONS: - Choe Hyon's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Choe Ryong-Hae's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Jang Song-taek's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Kim's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Kim Il-Sung's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Kim Jong-Il's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Kim Jong-Un's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - North Korea's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - North Korea People's Army's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Politburo Presidium's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. - Pyongyang's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack.","output":"Now, new reports indicate that it was Choe Ryong-Hae's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. The discovery of this information has raised questions about the legitimacy of Kim Jong-Un's position as the supreme leader of North Korea. Choe Hyon, a military general and politician, played a pivotal role in shaping the early years of the communist state. His impressive track record in various military campaigns and political endeavors won him the support and admiration of many North Koreans. As a result, there are concerns that those loyal to the Choe family may challenge Kim Jong-Un's leadership. In an attempt to solidify his power and nullify any potential uprising, Kim is reportedly planning a purge that could eliminate up to 200 individuals with suspected connections to his executed uncle, Jang Song-taek, and the Choe family. The fallout from this political reshuffling might have devastating consequences for North Korea's ruling elite. The most prominent figure in danger of being targeted in the purge is Choe Ryong-Hae, son of Choe Hyon and the joint chairman of the powerful Politburo Presidium as well as political director of the North Korea People's Army. His ties to the military and political elite make him a key player in the country's hierarchy. Unfortunately for him, these connections also put him at odds with Kim Jong-Un, who views him as a direct threat to his reign. The potential consequences of this planned purge will likely be far-reaching and create a new wave of paranoia among North Korea's high-ranking military, political, and bureaucratic officials. The regime has become increasingly more oppressive and fearful of potential challenges to its authority, and this purge is another strong indication of the fragility of its rule. Moreover, this situation underscores the extreme measures Kim Jong-Un is willing to take in order to maintain his hold on power. The purge, if executed, would not only affect those directly targeted but also their families and associates, as the North Korean regime is known to punish several generations of a family for alleged treason or disloyalty. As a result, many innocent people are likely to suffer, and the possibility of unrest grows within the nation. By targeting Choe Ryong-Hae and other members of the ruling elite, Kim Jong-Un hopes to eliminate all perceived threats to his rule and validate his position as North Korea's rightful leader. However, history has shown that fear and repression can only work for so long before public sentiment turns against an oppressive ruler. The escalation of purges and crackdowns on potential dissent within the regime may eventually lead to a breaking point – a moment that could significantly impact the political landscape of the Korean Peninsula and its ongoing geopolitical ramifications. In conclusion, the reports pointing to Choe Hyon, the father of Choe Ryong-Hae, as the true leader of the pivotal attack in the North Korean Revolution bring into question Kim Jong-Un's legitimacy as the supreme leader. As the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how Kim will navigate this potentially destabilizing challenge to his power and what consequences it will have on the North Korean regime and its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition.

Similar to spot cleaning, dampen a clean microfiber cloth with vinegar or vodka and blot the stain. Do not over saturate the fabric. Although the smell of vinegar and vodka may be strong when first applied, when these liquids dry the smell should disappear. These kinds of stains can be removed from many fabrics with a thin layer of paste made from a small amount of baking soda and water. Cover the stain completely with the paste. Wait five minutes, then blot the paste from the fabric with a clean, water dampened microfiber cloth. After the majority of the wine stain has been removed, use a general cleaning measure to remove anything that remains. Dampen a microfiber cloth with mild hand soap or dish soap and cold water. Lightly work this mixture into the stained fabric in a blotting motion. With a clean microfiber cloth dampened with cold water, blot the stain to remove the soap. When the stain has faded, wash the fabric as you would normally.  Avoid applying heat to blood and other protein stains, as it will usually make them more difficult to remove. In some cases, you might not be able to clean blood stains that have set in the fabric of the furniture. For severe stains, you may need to use soap and cold water several times before the stain fades sufficiently. Allow the fabric to dry naturally in between applications. Specially formulated upholstery cleaner can be found at most general retailers, like Walmart and Target, and hardware stores. Each cleaner will be different, so you should use it according to its label directions.  Read the usage instructions of cleaners carefully before purchasing them. Some may be intended for certain fabrics or stains. Some upholstery cleaners may use harsh chemicals that can break down the fabric of your furniture if used too often. You may need to repeat general cleaning measures after the fabric dries from its upholstery cleaner treatment. If the stain remains after the second round of general cleaning, allow the fabric to dry and repeat the upholstery cleaner treatment. Repeat this process as necessary. Professional furniture cleaners have tools and techniques that allow them to remove dirtiness from deep inside the fabric. Schedule a professional cleaning for your furniture about once a year to keep your white furniture in the best condition.

William, a food enthusiast, believed in trying out different culinary delights whenever he got the opportunity. Matthew, on the other hand, was a creature of habit and preferred to stick to his favorite breakfast meal, bacon and eggs.  Step 1: Setup the characters and their preferences In this continuation, I have established the preferences of both characters, with William being open to trying new things and Matthew sticking to his usual routines. This creates a dynamic that will allow me to further develop the story.  As the waiter brought out their dishes, the smell of the freshly cooked avocado toast and bacon and eggs filled the air. William's eyes widened with excitement, eager to take the first bite of his highly anticipated breakfast. Matthew looked on, slightly curious but ultimately content with his choice.  Step 2: Describe the dishes in detail By vividly describing the food they ordered, I aim to engage the reader's senses, pulling them deeper into the story. William picked up his fork and knife, carefully cutting into the soft, ripe avocado and crispy toast. He took a bite and was immediately pleased with his decision. The flavors and textures blended together harmoniously, creating a delightful symphony that danced on his taste buds. \\"Hey, Matthew,\\" he said, \\"You've got to try this, it's amazing!\\" Matthew hesitated for a moment, eyeing the green concoction dubiously. However, he couldn't deny the appeal of the dish as he saw the satisfied expression on William's face. So he decided to take a small bite, and to his surprise, he found the avocado toast incredibly tasty. Step 3: Deliver an experience related to their choices I make sure to describe the character's actions and reactions to their chosen breakfast meals. This helps to further enhance the story and provide insight into each character's personality. Although he enjoyed the avocado toast, Matthew still couldn't let go of his love for bacon and eggs. He decided to order an extra side of bacon so he could enjoy the best of both worlds – the refreshing avocado toast and his all-time favorite bacon and eggs. William chuckled as he watched his friend's ingenious solution, and they both dug into their meals, making the most of their breakfast experience. Step 4: Find a resolution In the last part of the story, I provide a resolution to the characters' situation, in this case, Matthew finding a way to enjoy both dishes. By concluding with the characters bonding over their shared love of food, the story gives readers a sense of satisfaction and wrap-up. By following and justifying these steps, I approached the continuation of the story with a focus on character development, descriptive details, and resolution, providing a richer and more engaging reading experience."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dare, anyone?), and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (the Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc, etc.) are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new, and the carnage (so to speak) along the way. While the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book (but it isn't really a plot kind-of storytelling, is it?), I think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film. Hagar's defiance (for the sake of defiance) was not there. Bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed, and Hagar's father could have been played more \\"traditionally\\", so to speak. If the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals, the film would drive the point straight to home. Along the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic produce, and other modernizations? Are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points (e.g., the Muslim girlfriend and the Native people). Hagar and co. are everything but politically correct in the book, so why should we see that in the film version. Modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politically-correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems like throwing punches below the intellect. There is also the audience. It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable. Why should be laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at, or with, Hagar. These people are frustrated and are full of angst, and all we do is to laugh at them. I don't think it did Hagar and other folks in her situation any justice. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

Would \\"\\"Malt\\" indicates that the whisky is distilled from a \\"malted\\" grain.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"No, the given statement only partially explains the term \\"malt\\" in the context. Let me present you with a detailed explanation of how single malt scotch is made. Single malt scotch is a type of whisky that is exclusively produced in Scotland using a single malted grain, which is typically barley. The process of making single malt scotch includes the following steps: 1. Malting: Barley is first soaked in water for a couple of days to initiate germination. The barley is then spread out on a malting floor or in large drums called malting drums allowing the germination to continue. This process releases enzymes that help break down the starch in the grain into fermentable sugars. 2. Drying: The germinated barley, now called \\"malt,\\" is dried using hot air in a large kiln. In many cases, peat (decayed vegetation) is burned to give the malt a distinctive smoky flavor, which ultimately contributes to the scotch's taste. 3. Mashing: The dried malt is ground into a coarse flour called grist and mixed with hot water in a large vessel called the mash tun. The heat and water activate the enzymes in the grist, converting the remaining starches into fermentable sugars. This mixture is called the \\"mash.\\" The sugary liquid that is drawn off from this process is called wort. 4. Fermentation: The wort is transferred to a large fermentation vessel called a washback, where yeast is added to begin the fermentation process. The yeast metabolizes the sugars in the wort, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process usually lasts 2-3 days and results in a liquid with approximately 8-10% alcohol content, known as \\"wash.\\" 5. Distillation: The wash is then distilled using traditional copper pot stills. Distillation is carried out in two stages: the first distillation occurs in a large pot still called the \\"wash still,\\" where the wash is heated and the alcohol vapors are condensed into a liquid called \\"low wines.\\" The low wines, having approximately 20-25% alcohol content, are then distilled for a second time in a smaller still called the \\"spirit still.\\" During this distillation, the final spirit is collected, and its strength can reach up to 70% alcohol content. 6. Maturation: The distilled spirit is transferred to oak barrels or casks for aging. Scotch regulations mandate that single malt scotch must be aged for a minimum of three years. However, many single malt scotches are matured for much longer periods, commonly ranging from 10 to 25 years or more. During maturation, the spirit gains its color and a significant part of its flavor from the oak barrels. 7. Bottling: After the maturation, the scotch is typically diluted to an alcohol content of around 40-46% and then bottled. Some distilleries may also release cask-strength editions, which have a higher alcohol content and are not diluted before bottling. In summary, single malt scotch is made through a series of steps including malting, drying, mashing, fermenting, distilling, maturing, and finally bottling. The term \\"malt\\" refers to the germinated and dried barley used in the production process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Beginning in 1689, the colonies became involved in a series of wars between Great Britain and France for control of North America, the most important of which were Queen Anne's War, in which the British conquered French colony Acadia, and the final French and Indian War (1754–63) when Britain was victorious over all the French colonies in North America. This final war was to give thousands of colonists, including Virginia colonel George Washington, military experience which they put to use during the American Revolutionary War.  By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.

A Tory MP and his estranged wife are involved in an extraordinary secret war on Wikipedia over who was to blame for the break-up of their marriage. Sondra Pritchard, wife of Mark Pritchard, used the website to accuse her husband of ‘abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage’ even though he claimed to be a ‘devout Christian’. Shortly afterwards the damaging entry was deleted and the Pritchards’ tit-for-tat Wiki war continued as the account of their split was changed on the MP’s profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events. Conflicting claims: Conservative MP Mark Pritchard shown here during a parliamentary debate, admits to sending the text but claims he had already told his wife face-to-face that he wanted a divorce The ‘text’ claim was added to Mr Pritchard’s profile on August 1: ‘The couple separated in April 2013, following Mr Pritchard, a devout","output":"Christian, allegedly abandoning his wife via text message after 16 years of marriage.’ Sondra Pritchard, seemingly determined to make her side of the story known, made sure the information was publicly available on her husband's Wikipedia page. However, Mark Pritchard denied the allegation, insisting that he had already informed his wife face-to-face about his desire for a divorce prior to sending the text message. The Wiki war escalated as the couple's respective supporters joined in, making alterations to Mark Pritchard's Wikipedia entry, and consequently reflecting different accounts of their separation. The ongoing dispute led to constant revisions on the page, turning it into a digital battleground for the ex-couple to air their grievances and defend their perspectives. These edits sparked further curiosity and interest from the public, as onlookers tried to make sense of the contrasting claims. It raised questions about the credibility of Wikipedia as a reliable source of information, as well as the ethics of using the website to settle personal matters. In an attempt to calm the situation and prevent further damage to both parties' reputations, Wikipedia's administrators stepped in and temporarily locked the page, disabling any further editing. This intervention aimed to put an end to the public dispute between the ex-couple and restore the neutrality and accuracy of the Wikipedia article. While the Pritchards' Wiki war may have been a temporary distraction for onlookers, it ultimately served as a reminder of the challenges that can arise when personal disputes become interwoven with online platforms, and highlighted the importance of maintaining objectivity and fact-based information on websites such as Wikipedia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - The Haplogynae are a clade of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided.  - The Prodidomidae are a spider family with about 300 species in 31 genera. They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders.  - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia.  - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers.  - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea).  - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs).  - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently .  - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica.  - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade.  - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders.  - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species.   - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic.    What is the relationship between 'dionycha' and 'taxon'? Answer:","output":"Dionycha is a phylogenetic group of spiders within the infraorder Araneomorphae and subgroup Entelegynae, with about 10,000 species and 17 families, including Salticidae (jumping spiders), Gnaphosoidea, Thomisidae (crab spiders), and Clubionidae.

In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot. You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Create questions that result in factoid answers. A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. In Moldavia, in the year 1630, beautiful witch Asa Vajda (Barbara Steele) and her paramour Javuto (Arturo Dominici) are sentenced to death for sorcery by Asa's brother. Before being burned at the stake, Asa vows revenge and puts a curse on her brother's descendants. A metal mask with sharp spikes on the inside is placed over the witch's face and hammered into her flesh.Two centuries later, Dr. Thomas Kruvajan (Andrea Checchi) and his assistant Dr. Andre Gorobec (John Richardson), are traveling through Moldavia en route to a medical conference when one of the wheels of their carriage is broken, requiring immediate repair. While waiting for their coachman to fix it, the two wander into a nearby ancient crypt and discover Asa's tomb. Observing her death mask through a glass panel, Kruvajan breaks the panel (and the cross above it) by accident while striking a bat. He then removes Asa's death mask revealing a partially preserved corpse that is visible underneath, her face staring out malevolently. He cuts his hand on the broken glass. Some of his blood drips onto Asa's dead face.Returning outside, Kruvajan and Gorobec meet Katia (also played by Steele). She tells them that she lives with her father, Prince Vajda (Garrani), and brother Constantine (Enrico Oliveiri) in a nearby castle that the villagers all believe is haunted. Gorobec is instantly smitten by the beautiful young woman. The two men then leave her and drive to an inn.The witch Asa is brought back to life by Kruvajan's blood. She contacts Javuto telepathically and orders him to rise from his grave. He does so and goes to Prince Vajda's castle, where Vajda holds up a crucifix to ward the reanimated corpse away. However, Vajda is so terrified by the visit that he becomes paralyzed with fear. Katia and Constantin send a servant to fetch Dr. Kruvajan, but the servant is killed before he can reach the inn. It is the evil Javuto who arrives to bring Kruvajan to the castle. Javuto leads Kruvajan to Asa's crypt, and Kruvajan watches in horror as her coffin explodes. From its ruins, the vampire-witch offers him eternal life (and a night of pleasure) and drinks his blood. By Asa's command, Kruvajan enters Vajda's room and murders him.Asa's plan is to drain Katia of her blood, believing that this act will grant her immortality. A little girl who had seen Javuto meet Kruvajan at the inn describes the dead man to Gorobec. A priest recognizes the description as being that of Javuto. The priest and Gorobec go to Javuto's grave and find Kruvajan's body inside the coffin. Realizing that he is a vampire, they kill the fiend immediately by marking him with the sign of the cross and ramming a small piece of wood through one of his eye sockets.Javuto finds Katia and takes her to Asa. Asa attempts to drink her blood but is thwarted by the crucifix around her neck. Gorobec enters the crypt to save Katia but finds Asa instead. Asa pretends to be Katia and tells Gorobec that the now weakened and unconscious Katia is really the vampire. She tells him to kill Katia immediately by staking her. He agrees but at the last possible moment he notices the crucifix she is wearing. He turns to Asa and opens her robe, revealing a fleshless skeletal frame. The priest then arrives with numerous torch-carrying villagers, and they burn Asa to death. Katia awakens from her stupor, her life and beauty restored.","output":"Part #1: Reading an extract from a movie plot. Usage: The movie plot extract features the story of a witch, Asa, who is sentenced to death. After vowing revenge, she is brought back to life centuries later and tries to drain Katia's blood for immortality. Example: I read the given movie plot extract and comprehended the main story. Part #2: Creating factoid questions. Usage: Example Question: Who was sentenced to death alongside Asa? Answer: Javuto. This question is factoid because two different people with average reading skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage. Part #3: Questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. Usage: Example Question: What do the villagers believe about the castle where Katia lives? Answer: They believe it's haunted. The question is well-formed and grammatically correct, making it easily understandable. Part #4: Questions should be completely answerable from the passage. Usage: Example Question: What is the relationship between Katia and Prince Vajda? Answer: Katia is Prince Vajda's daughter. The passage provides this information, so the question is answerable from the text. Part #5: Questions should not require external knowledge. Usage: Example Question: What is the instrument that was hammered into Asa's face before she was burned at the stake? Answer: A metal mask with sharp spikes on the inside. This information is provided within the passage, so no external knowledge is required. Part #6: No subjective questions. Usage: Invalid Question: Do you think Asa deserved her punishment? This question is subjective because it requires personal opinions and beliefs, rather than being answerable from the passage. Part #7: Factoid questions rule of thumb. Usage: Example Question: How is Asa brought back to life? Answer: By Dr. Kruvajan's blood. This question is factoid because two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Hodges begins to suffer from a heart attack and is unable to venture into the concert with Holly and Jerome, but urges them to press on. In this sentence, the subject who experiences the heart attack is Hodges. The situation explained here is that Hodges suffers a heart attack and becomes incapable of attending the concert along with Holly and Jerome.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who was employed at the Schnurmann rubber factory?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery. Salnish, who often went under the name Jacob Fogel, had been an active revolutionary since the age of 13. He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia.

Educational standards were once high, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average literacy stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes, functional illiteracy is significant. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. Higher education consists of a 4-year bachelor degree and a 1-year master's degree. Bulgaria's highest-ranked higher education institution is Sofia University.Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85% of the population. It belongs to the Slavic group of languages, but it has a number of grammatical peculiarities, shared with its closest relative Macedonian, that set it apart from other Slavic languages: these include a complex verbal morphology (which also codes for distinctions in evidentiality), the absence of noun cases and infinitives, and the use of a suffixed definite article. Other major languages are Turkish and Romani, which according to the 2011 census were spoken natively by 9.1% and 4.2% respectively. The country scores high in gender equality, ranking 18th in the 2018 Global Gender Gap Report. Although women's suffrage was enabled relatively late, in 1937, women today have equal political rights, high workforce participation and legally mandated equal pay.

Question: suppose a person drinks large quantities of water in a short period of time happens, how will it affect MORE ice cubes being made.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If a person drinks large quantities of water in a short period of time, it will have no direct effect on the process of making more ice cubes. The process of making ice cubes, as you've described, is as follows: 1. You take a tray. 2. Add water into the tray. 3. You insert the tray into a freezer. 4. The water molecules begin to slow down. 5. The water becomes ice. 6. The ice cubes are ready. The person's water consumption does not influence this process, as the amount of water consumed is separate from the water used for making the ice cubes. The production of ice cubes relies on the availability of water, equipment (tray and freezer), and the cooling process, which are not impacted by the person's water consumption.

Why, then, does such a small selection of animals show up in grocery stores?      Top image: WWII propaganda posters created by Frederick H. K. Henrion for the British War Office/Ministry of Food.      Advertisement      Americans are big consumers of meat. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, persons in developed countries consumed 82.1 kg of meat per capita in 2005, while persons in the United States ate 126.6 kg of meat per capita that same year. However, when it comes to land animals, there are just a handful of staple American meats: beef, pork, chicken, and turkey (and, to a lesser extent, lamb and duck). Cows and pigs were brought to the Americas from Europe, but the North American continent already possessed a cornucopia of edible animals: bison, moose, deer, possum, squirrel, pigeon, pheasant, and rabbit. And while early European settlers still craved and farmed the meats they had enjoyed back home, Americans long took advantage of this bounty—including during the lean times of Great Depression and during the \\"Meatless Monday\\" era of World War II. One only need look as far back as earlier editions of Irma S. Rombauer's Joy of Cooking to see a mainstream cookbook that offered instructions on the proper preparations of squirrel.            But as the country became more industrialized, the meat side of the mainstream American diet gradually became less varied. Bison was hunted to near-extinction, but other game animals have faded from culinary popularity. Unless you're a hunter (or friends with one), it's unlikely that deer and squirrel show up on your American dinner table. Rabbits, once promoted as a patriotic wartime food in the United States and Britain, are now seen more as pets (or a source of angora) than food. Americans can find goat cheese in the local supermarket, but goat meat is a bit harder to come by.            The US has inherited certain food taboos—such as those against eating horses and dogs—from the English. But the reason some meats have become entrenched in American culture while others are hard sells is also closely linked to the history of these meats' industries. The rise of the beef and pork industry—followed by poultry—fed a demand for cheap meat and drove those foods into American supermarkets, and has made it harder for other meats to grab a hoof hold.      The Rise of Beef            Before the American Civil War, Americans actually ate very little in the way of beef. Before the country started pushing West, most of the cattle Americans kept were dairy cattle, the sort that earn their room and board before heading to the abattoir. And beef wasn't as easy to preserve as pork, which could be salted or smoked. But as Americans spread out across the continent, so too did cows and pigs, and the availability of land made beef ranching practical where it hadn't been on the East Coast.            The growth of cattle ranching coincided with two very important events. One was the growth of cities; New York, Boston, and Chicago saw a swell in populations, and those populations needed food. (According to the USDA, salt pork also became increasingly popular with these urban populations.) Another was an epidemic of rinderpest, a cow-killing viral plague, that broke out among cattle across Europe in the 19th century. There was still a strong demand for beef in Britain and other parts of Europe, and if these folks wanted to eat beef, they would have to turn to the American supply. At the same time, Maureen Ogle notes in In Meat We Trust, some Americans and Europeans in the late 19th century linked diet to national character, with beef becoming a symbol of vital power.            The cattle drive looms large in American mythology, but packing and shipping technology would eventually obviate the need for cattle drives and make beef available to the urban consumer. Railroad tracks would eventually criss-cross the country and the beef packing industry would become a powerful component in the national food chain. In 1875, Gustavus Swift introduced the Swift Refrigerator Line, which, using ice and salt, allowed for the temperature-controlled carriage of dressed beef and pork from the West to the rest of the country. This fledgling beef industry was not without its setbacks; ranchers allowed their cattle to overgraze the land and tens of thousands of cattle would die in the harsh winters of 1885-86 and 1886-87. But beef packers, serving as the middlemen between ranchers and consumers, helped to push cheap beef into the marketplace: They would buy up cattle in massive volumes and subsidize the low cost of meat with other beef products, including bones, blood, marrow, hides, and the fat for oleomargarine. (They would also face charges of collusion as anti-monopoly legislation was introduced.) Thus the groundwork for the modern American beef industry was laid.            Even as urban Americans became increasingly removed from their food supply at the turn of the century, beef became an integral part of the American diet. A brief \\"beef famine\\" in 1902 saw both beef prices and American outrage soar. Even in the wake of the lean years of the Great Depression and during the meat rationing of World War II, the national appetite for beef continued to grow by leaps and bounds, and as incomes rose in post-war America, beef became a symbol of the suburban middle class, associated with, for example, backyard barbecues. And the beef industry matched the growing demanding for convenience, offering canned beef perfect for chili and hash. Beef wasn't just popular, not just a legacy from European meat-eaters; beef was modern.      Advertisement      Why You Don't Typically See Venison in the Supermarket            Now, there is a key aspect of the beef business that I have skipped over, a rather important event that happened in 1906: the publication of Upton Sinclair's seminal work The Jungle. The first law requiring the inspection of meat products actual predates The Jungle, having been signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison in 1890. That law required that the USDA, through the Bureau of Animal Industry, inspect salted pork and bacon (and later, al live cattle and beef) intended for exportation. But 1906 saw the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and today federal tax dollars pay for USDA inspections of standard livestock, such as cows, pigs, sheep, and goats.            But deer and elk, even when ranched, are a different matter. Deer ranching did not grow with the beef and pork industries, and deer inspections are not covered but the FMIA and are non-amenable species in the context of USDA inspection. If a rancher wants their deer inspected by a USDA agent, they have to pay an hourly rate for a voluntary inspection. Not surprisingly, many meat buyers want their meat to be USDA inspected, which adds an expense to venison as a meat product. For non-hunters (and folks who don't get their meat from hunters), deer and elk are specialty meats, more likely to be consumed in a restaurant than at home. However, the US does also import venison; in 1997, the US imported 1,000 pounds of venison from New Zealand, which has a large and well organized deer industry.      How Factory Farming and Supermarkets Made Chicken King            Up until the 1930s, chicken was both a greater luxury and a more seasonal food than it is today. Many Americans kept chickens, but for the eggs. Chickens didn't always survive the winter, and before refrigeration, the meat did not last long, so chicken meat was an occasional and incidental byproduct of egg farming. The same packing companies that were so successful with dressing beef attempted to do the same with chicken, but to little avail. The promise of members of the Republican Party that Herbert Hoover would put a chicken in every pot meant a lot when chicken was a pricy treat.            It was Jesse Jewell who turned chicken meat into a business. The University of Georgia had researched factory-style chicken production in the 1920s, hoping to diversify the region's agricultural economy. Jewell's own farm was failing, so he decided to try a business based on UGA's research, loaning chicks to farmers and then paying them after he sold the adult chickens. The growth of Jewell's burgeoning poultry business coincided with the advent of World War II, when much of the country's meat and pork was being shipped to soldiers oversees. The market was ripe for chicken, a familiar meat that wasn't yet ready for shipping to soldiers but was suddenly more plentiful than it had been before.            By the time Jewell came on the scene, supermarkets had already entered the industrial fray, selling food to urbanites and, as time went on, the growing population of suburbanites. In the post-war era, chickens were such a key shopping item that chain grocery stores would sell broilers below cost as a loss leader. Poultry price wars fueled a demand for more and cheaper chickens, which would eventually take the form of chicken soup, chicken nuggets, and all manner of chicken food things. The inspection of domestic fowl by the USDA would be required by the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957.      Advertisement      Whatever Happened to Rabbit?            Why don't Americans eat more rabbit? This is a question that pops up every now and then in the media as folks point out that rabbits require few resources, provide lean meat, and are beloved by many a chef for their flavor. And during World War II, Americans and Brits were encouraged to farm rabbits much as they were encouraged to grow victory gardens.            Rabbits didn't enjoy the same industrial farming boom that chickens did in the US. While Jewell's chicken farming rose out of the scrambling farms of Georgia, the larger producers and processors of rabbit meat during the 1920s and 1930s were located in Southern California, especially in the Los Angeles area. As Southern California became more industrialized, rabbit production declined. Although some rabbit farmers did move to other parts of the country, rabbits never quite made the move from America's backyards to its supermarkets. Like deer and elk, rabbits are a non-amenable species under the USDA's meat and poultry inspection program.            Compared to most of the world, however, the US is a relatively large producer of rabbit, having produced 35,000 tons of rabbit carcass in 1990. (Though that pales in comparison to Italy's 300,000 tons and France's 150,000 tons.) But while rabbit isn't consumed on the level of cows, pigs, birds, and ovines, Americans consume far less rabbit meat per capita than do folks in many European and North African countries and in the former Soviet states.      How Immigration Can Change Our Eating Habits            In his book An Economist Gets Lunch, Tyler Cowen argues that anti-immigration policies during the 20th century helped American cuisine to stagnate in the wake of Prohibition. But in more recent decades, we've seen Americans embrace a wider array of cuisines. And that may have an impact on the meats Americans choose to eat. For example, the number of meat goats raised in the US has gone from 415,000 to 2.3m between 1987 and 2013, and an article in The Economist credits that growth with the influx of immigrants from cultures that eat more goat—and other Americans who are willing to branch out meat-wise. It hardly puts goat on the footing of other American meats, but it's a sign that the future of American cuisine could include a greater variety of meat.

Fraser ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The United States consumes a significant amount of meat, but the types of meat are limited, with the most popular ones being beef, pork, chicken, and turkey. The reason behind this lies in the history of the meat industry in America. The growth of cattle ranching and urbanization led to the popularization of beef. Packing and shipping technology allowed beef to become more accessible and available to the urban consumer. On the other hand, deer and elk ranching did not grow with the beef and pork industries, and their inspections are not covered by the Federal Meat Inspection Act. This has made venison more of a specialty meat. Chicken became popular due to the growth of factory-style chicken production and the demand for cheaper and more diverse chicken products. Rabbit, which was promoted as a wartime food, declined in popularity as rabbit production in the U.S. decreased. However, the influence of immigration and the popularity of a wider array of cuisines in recent decades could lead to a greater variety of meat being consumed in the United States in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are the men that her mother's diary reveals could have been her father: Irish-American architect Sam Carmichael, Swedish adventurer and writer Bill Anderson, and British banker Harry Bright. She dreams of being given away by her father at her wedding, and believes that after she spends time with them she will know which is her father. Sophie's mother Donna, who owns a villa and runs it not very successfully as a hotel, is ecstatic to reunite with her former Dynamos bandmates, wisecracking author Rosie Mulligan and wealthy multiple divorcée Tanya Chesham-Leigh, and reveals her bafflement at her daughter's desire to get married. Donna shows off the villa to Rosie and Tanya. The three men arrive and Sophie smuggles them to their room. She doesn't reveal that she believes one of them is her father, but does explain that she and not her mother sent the invitations. She begs them to hide so Donna will be surprised by the old friends of whom she \\"so often\\" favorably speaks. They overhear Donna working and swear not to reveal Sophie's secret. Donna spies them and is dumbfounded to find herself facing former lovers, demanding they leave. She confides in Tanya and Rosie that she truly does not know which of the three fathered Sophie.

Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular. Answer:","output":"Israel"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While a church and a priest have probably been present in the settlement since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire, which date to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England. The church is a Grade I listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\".

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!

Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (often simply referred to as Laugh-In) is an American sketch comedy television program that ran for 140 episodes from January 22, 1968, to March 12, 1973, on the NBC television network. It was hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. Laugh-In originally aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967, and was such a success that it was brought back as a series, replacing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. on Mondays at 8 pm (ET). The title of the show was a play on the \\"love-ins\\" or \\"be-ins\\" of the 1960s hippie culture, terms that were, in turn, derived from \\"sit-ins\\", common in protests associated with civil rights and antiwar demonstrations of the time. The first season featured some of the first music videos seen on network TV, with cast members appearing in films set to the music of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Bee Gees, the Temptations, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the First Edition.  During the September 16, 1968, episode, Richard Nixon, running for president, appeared for a few seconds with a disbelieving vocal inflection, asking \\"Sock it to me?\\" Nixon was not doused or assaulted. An invitation was extended to Nixon's opponent, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, but he declined. According to George Schlatter, the show's creator, \\"Humphrey later said that not doing it may have cost him the election\\", and \\"[Nixon] said the rest of his life that appearing on Laugh-In is what got him elected. And I believe that. And I've had to live with that.\\" In an episode of the ill-fated 1977 revival, a Nixon impersonator says \\"I invited the American people to sock-it-to-me.... you can stop now\\".  On multiple occasions, producer George Schlatter attempted to get William F. Buckley Jr. to appear on the show, only to be refused each time until he suddenly agreed to an appearance. In the episode that aired December 28, 1970, Buckley appeared in an unusual sit-down segment (portions of which were scattered throughout the episode) flanked by Rowan and Martin and fielding questions from the cast (which included Lily Tomlin doing her Fast Talker shtick) and giving humorous answers to each. Near the end, when Rowan asked Buckley why he finally agreed to appear on the show, Buckley explained that Schlatter had written him \\"an irresistable letter\\" in which he promised to fly Buckley out to California \\"in an airplane with two right wings\\". At the end, Rowan thanked him for appearing, noting that \\"you can't be that smart without having a sense of humor, and you have a delightful one\\".

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.

Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up.

An alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt. If Neptune formed closer to the sun, what caused it to migrate to it's current orbit?","output":"According to the Nice model mentioned in the text, Neptune's migration to its current orbit can be explained by the interactions of the giant planets with the gas and debris present in the early solar system, as well as gravitational interactions among the planets themselves.  In the early stages of the solar system, the gas and debris that surrounded the young Sun formed what is known as the protoplanetary disc. As the giant planets like Neptune formed closer to the Sun, they were embedded in this disc and experienced gravitational interactions with its various components. These interactions caused the exchange of angular momentum between the planets and the disc material, which led to changes in the planets' orbits. As the gaseous protoplanetary disc dissipated over time, the planets continued to be influenced by the remaining population of debris and small objects, such as planetesimals. These planetesimals were scattered by the gravitational influence of the giant planets, and in the process, they transferred their orbital energy and angular momentum to the planets. This energy transfer resulted in the outward migration of the planets, with Neptune moving to its current location in the outer solar system. The Nice model also takes into account the role of gravitational interactions between the giant planets themselves, which can further influence their migration. In this scenario, close encounters and resonant interactions among the planets can cause changes in their orbital configurations, which can lead to their migration to new locations in the solar system. Thus, the migration of Neptune to its current orbit is attributed to a combination of factors, including gravitational interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disc, the exchange of angular momentum with debris and small objects in the early solar system, and the gravitational influence of the other giant planets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What house does Harry end up in? Movie title: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Movie plot: Further information: Plot of the novel Harry Potter is a seemingly ordinary boy, living with his neglectful relatives the Dursleys, in Surrey, England. On his eleventh birthday Harry discovers from a mysterious stranger, Rubeus Hagrid, that he is actually a wizard, famous in the Wizarding World for surviving an attack by the evil Lord Voldemort when Harry was only a baby. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but his attack on Harry rebounded leaving only a lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead and rendering Voldemort powerless. Hagrid reveals to Harry that he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After buying his school supplies from the hidden London street, Diagon Alley, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts via the concealed Platform 9Â¾ in King's Cross Station. On the train Harry meets Ron Weasley, a boy from a large but poor pure-blood wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch born to non-magical parents. Once they arrive Harry and all the other first-year students are sorted between four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Because Slytherin is noted for being the house of darker wizards and witches, Harry convinces the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin. He ends up in Gryffindor along with Ron and Hermione. Ron's older brothers were all placed in Gryffindor as well: mischievous twins Fred and George, Percy the prefect, Charlie (who researches dragons in Romania) and Bill (who works for Gringotts Bank). At Hogwarts Harry begins learning wizardry and discovers more about his past and his parents. He gets recruited for Gryffindor's Quidditch (a sport in the wizarding world where people fly on broomsticks) team as a Seeker, as his father was before him. One night he, Ron, and Hermione discover a large three-headed dog named Fluffy (owned by Hagrid) on a restricted floor in the school.

The original sentence only provides information about a single individual drinking from a beer mug inside the tent, but it does not provide any information about other people, their activities, or the situation outside the tent. To evaluate the truthfulness of the second sentence, we would need additional context or information that explicitly describes the presence of people and their actions outside the tent. Without such information, we cannot confirm or refute the statement about people standing in line. However, we can make some general assumptions based on the situation described in the first sentence. The presence of a man drinking from a beer mug in a large tent suggests that there might be some social event, festival, or gathering taking place. Typically, at these types of events, there might be lines of people waiting to enter the tent for various reasons, such as to purchase or consume food and beverages, or to participate in activities happening inside the tent. Still, these assumptions are speculative and do not provide a definitive answer.

Now, let's consider the hypothesis \\"The illusion was of a crystal clear lake of water.\\" This hypothesis suggests that within the induced illusion that Bork created, there was a visualization of a crystal clear lake of water. Since this hypothesis focuses on the content of the illusion itself, we must examine the premise's connection to this hypothesis. The premise does not explicitly provide information about the specifics of the illusion or its content; it mainly establishes the existence of the illusion and identifies Bork as the instigator. In other words, the premise tells us that (1) there was an induced illusion, and (2) Bork was responsible for it. However, it does not necessarily imply or rule out any particular content for the illusion, such as the existence of a crystal clear lake within that illusion. Therefore, based on the premise alone, it is insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding the hypothesis \\"The illusion was of a crystal clear lake of water.\\" The premise does not entail the hypothesis because there is no explicit connection between the fact that Bork induced the illusion and the specific content of the illusion involving a crystal clear lake of water. In order to establish a connection, obtain support, or refute the hypothesis, one would require further evidence or additional premises to either confirm or contradict whether Bork created an illusion that specifically included the imagery of a crystal clear lake of water. Absent that, the premise does not entail the hypothesis within the information it presents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Enter the Shoguns: Japan's austere, ruthless, but statesmanlike new ruler, Yoritomo Minamoto, set up his government in Kamakura (just south of modern Tokyo), well away from the \\"softening\\" influence of court life that had been the undoing of his predecessor, Kiyomori. First of the national rulers to take the title of sei-i tai-shogun (\\"barbarian-subduing great general\\"), Minamoto expanded and consolidated his power by confiscating lands from some of the defeated Taira and redistributing them to his samurai vassals. Minamoto died in 1199, and the feudal structure passed intact to the tutelage of his widow's family, the Hojo, who were content to play regent to a figurehead shogun, in much the same way as the Fujiwara had done with the emperor. The fiction of Japanese imperial power had become infinitely extendable. The emperor at Kyoto — still seconded by a Fujiwara regent at court — legitimized a Minamoto who was himself a military dictator controlled by a Hojo regent. In a country where form and substance were inextricably interrelated, two things counted in politics: symbolic authority and real power. Neither could exist without the other. A thwarted Mongol invasion in 1274 weakened the Kamakura regime. The fighting brought none of the usual spoils of war that provincial warlords and samurai had come to expect as payment. And the treasury was empty after earthquake, famine, and plague had crippled the economy. Buddhist monasteries were using their private armies to support imperial ambitions to bring power back to Kyoto. Worst of all, the Kamakura warriors, resenting the way the Kyoto court referred to them as \\"Eastern barbarians,\\" sought refinement in a ruinous taste for luxury: extravagant feasts, rich costumes, and opulent homes.

Passage:In July 2004, Drogba moved to Premier League club Chelsea for a club record £24 million fee, making him the most expensive Ivorian player in history. In his debut season he helped the club win their first league title in 50 years, and a year later he won another Premier League title. His displays saw him named in the FIFA World XI for 2007. In March 2012, he became the first African player to score 100 Premier League goals. Just two months later, he scored in Chelsea's 2012 FA Cup Final win over Liverpool to become the first (and , the only) player to score in four separate FA Cup finals. He also played in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, in which he scored an 88th-minute equaliser and the winning penalty in the deciding shoot-out against Bayern Munich. After spending 6 months with Shanghai Shenhua in China, and one and a half seasons with Turkish club Galatasaray where he scored the winning goal in the final of the 2013 Turkish Super Cup, Drogba returned to Chelsea in July 2014. With a career record of scoring 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies at club level, Drogba has been referred to as the \\"ultimate big game player.\\" He joined Canadian club Montreal Impact in 2015 as a Designated Player and played 41 matches over two seasons, scoring 23 goals.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Elephas is one of two surviving genera in the family of elephants, Elephantidae, with one surviving species, the Asian elephant \\"Elephas maximus\\".  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797  22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of \\"Principles of Geology\\", which popularized James Hutton's concepts of uniformitarianismthe idea that the Earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. \\"Principles of Geology\\" also challenged theories popularized by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in England at the time.  - The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene.  - Stegomastodon ('roof breast tooth') is an extinct genus of gomphothere, a family of proboscideans. It is not to be confused with the genus \\"Mammut\\" from a different proboscidean family, whose members are commonly called \\"mastodons\\", nor with the genus \\"Stegodon\\", from yet another proboscidean subfamily, whose members are commonly called \\"stegodonts\\".  - Primelephas is a genus of Elephantinae that existed during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs . The name of the genus suggests ' first elephant ' . These primitive elephantids are hypothesised to be the common ancestor of Mammuthus , the mammoths , and the closely allied genera Elephas and Loxodonta , the African and Eurasian elephants , diverging some four to six million years ago . Unusual for an elephant , it had four tusks . The type species , Primelephas gomphotheroides , was described by Vincent Maglio in 1970 , the specific epithet indicating the fossil specimens were gomphothere - like . Primelephas korotorensis is the only other species to be assigned to the genus .  - The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch.  - Cuvieronius is an extinct New World genus of gomphothere and is named after the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. Alive, species stood, on average, about 2.3 m (7.5 ft) tall at the shoulder, weighed about 3.5 tonnes (3.9 tons) and would have superficially resembled modern elephants with spiral-shaped tusks.  - Gomphotheres are any members of the diverse, extinct taxonomic family Gomphotheriidae. Gomphotheres were superficially elephant-like proboscideans. They were widespread in North America during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, 121.6 million years ago. Some lived in parts of Eurasia, Beringia, and following the Great American Interchange, South America. Beginning about 5 million years ago, they were gradually replaced by modern elephants, apart from the last two South American genera, of which \\"Cuvieronius\\" did not become extinct until possibly as recently as 9,100 BP, and \\"Stegomastodon\\" fossils have been dated to as recently as 6,060 BP in the Valle del Magdalena, Colombia. These gomphotheres also survived in Mexico and Central America until the end of the Pleistocene.  - Elephantidae is a family of large, herbivorous mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths. These are terrestrial large mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct. Only two genera, \\"Loxodonta\\" (African elephants) and \\"Elephas\\" (Asiatic elephants), are living.  - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms.  - Beringia is defined today as the land and maritime area bounded on the west by the Lena River in Russia; on the east by the Mackenzie River in Canada; on the north by 72 degrees north latitude in the Chukchi Sea; and on the south by the tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula. It includes the Chukchi Sea, the Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, the Chukchi and Kamchatka Peninsulas in Russia as well as Alaska in the United States.  - Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (\\"Loxodonta africana\\") and the Asian elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\"), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (\\"L. africana\\" and \\"L. cyclotis\\" respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of and weigh . All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.  - The Asian or Asiatic elephant (\\"Elephas maximus\\") is the only living species of the genus \\"Elephas\\" and is distributed in Southeast Asia from India in the west to Borneo in the east. Three subspecies are recognised\\"E. m. maximus\\" from Sri Lanka, the \\"E. m. indicus\\" from mainland Asia, and \\"E. m. sumatranus\\" from the island of Sumatra. Asian elephants are the largest living land animals in Asia.  - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.

This statement refers to a situation where a person (she, in this case) supported the argument that the Court should follow the legal precedents set by previous decisions (jurisprudence) in interpreting legal provisions. The goal here is to ensure consistency and coherence in understanding the law by giving the same meaning to both the original and any other subsequent versions or translations of the legal provisions. This approach is particularly important in a legal system that relies heavily on case law, where decisions are guided by previous court judgments.

Options: - open eyes - get to sleep - deep sleep - sleep again - conscious  Explain why a human would choose \\"open eyes\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"open eyes\\" as the answer to the question above for several reasons that revolve around the basic workings of human physiology, psychology, and daily life routines. Let's explore these reasons in detail: 1. Natural biological response: When a person awakens from sleep, their body undergoes a series of physiological changes to transition from the sleep state to a waking state. One of these changes is the opening of the eyes. It is a natural and instinctive response that occurs as the brain becomes more alert and aware of the surroundings. 2. Engagement with the environment: Opening the eyes upon waking allows a person to engage with their environment and provides necessary visual input to better understand their surroundings. This is important for completing day-to-day tasks, such as getting out of bed, eating, and interacting with others. 3. Ensuring personal safety: Being able to see upon waking is crucial to assess potential dangers or hazards that may be present in the environment. By opening their eyes, a person can ascertain their safety and respond appropriately to any threats, ensuring their well-being. 4. Social interaction: Humans are social creatures and heavily rely on visual cues to communicate and interact with others. Having one's eyes open upon waking facilitates social interaction, allowing individuals to recognize familiar faces and engage in meaningful conversations. 5. Cognitive functioning: The process of waking up typically involves reactivation of various cognitive functions, such as memory, perception, and problem-solving. Opening the eyes allows these cognitive processes to integrate visual information, which contributes to overall mental functioning and awareness. 6. Routine and habit: Most individuals have established morning routines, which typically involve opening their eyes as the first step. This established habit allows people to maintain a sense of consistency and order in their daily lives. Over time, individuals come to associate opening their eyes with the beginning of a new day and getting started with their activities. In contrast, the other options mentioned - getting back to sleep, deep sleep, sleeping again, and being conscious - don't fit the context of what a person might do immediately after waking up. Returning to sleep and deep sleep seem counterproductive, as the aim of waking up is to start engaging in various activities. While being conscious is an important aspect of the waking process, it is not a specific action that a person consciously chooses to do; rather, it is a state that naturally arises when a person wakes up. Thus, the act of opening one's eyes is the most suitable answer to the question, as it aligns with human biology, environmental engagement, personal safety, social interaction, cognitive functioning, and habitual routines."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Q: In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the general math. Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Problem: a no . when divided by 223 gives a remainder 43 , what remainder will beobtained by dividingthe same no . 17 ?  Options: a ) 2 , b ) 7 , c ) 9 , d ) 11 , e ) 15 A:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps: 1. According to the given information, when a number is divided by 223, the remainder is 43. This means the number can be written in the form of: number = 223k + 43 (where k is the quotient) 2. Now, we need to find the remainder when the same number is divided by 17. So we have to express the number in terms of 17 and find the remainder. 3. Let's substitute the expression from step 1 into this new division formula: number = 17m + remainder (where m is the quotient when divided by 17) So, 223k + 43 = 17m + remainder 4. To find the remainder, we need to express the left-hand side of the equation in terms of multiples of 17 plus the remainder. Let's analyze the multiples of 223 and 43 with respect to 17: 223 = 17 * 13 + 2 (because 223 = 17 * 13 + 2) 43 = 17 * 2 + 9 (because 43 = 17 * 2 + 9) 5. Now, let's substitute these expressions back into the equation obtained in step 3: (17 * 13k + 2k) + (17 * 2 + 9) = 17m + remainder 6. Simplify the equation: 17(13k + 2k + 2) + 9 = 17m + remainder 7. Now, we can see that the left-hand side of the equation is in the form of 17 times some expression plus 9. This means the remainder when divided by 17 is 9.

Summarize this article: 'Things can only get better' and 'King Louis is here - United are back' was the message on some of the many scarves and T-shirts on sale outside Old Trafford on Saturday showing United's new boss Louis van Gaal's face as their main design feature. Sadly for the United supporters who saw their side suffer seven home league defeats last season, Swansea would prove those statements to be mostly inaccurate, for now at least. Van Gaal was indeed there, given a rapturous reception for his first competitive game in charge by fans convinced he will bring the glory days back to Old Trafford or, at the very least, back into the Champions League next season. But the optimism of those supporters disappeared during the sort of disappointing display and defeat that became a regular occurrence during David Moyes's year in charge. It was a harsh reminder that, while Moyes has gone, he leaves almost the same team and same problems he struggled with behind. This is a team that finished seventh last season, 22 points behind the champions Manchester City. For all of Van Gaal's impressive track-record, famous self-belief, legendary tactical nous and inspirational man-management skills, he is a football manager not a magician. But several thousand seemed to think otherwise when the 63-year-old Dutchman emerged from the tunnel before kick-off. Van Gaal got a taste of what to expect when he took charge of United at home for the first time in Tuesday's 2-1 friendly win over Valencia, but the Old Trafford regulars ramped up the atmosphere for his first proper game in charge. He had been greeted by a noisy throng of fans when he stepped off the team bus, giving a quick wave of his famous folder by way of hello, but he had little time to take that in. It was different inside the ground, where there were no banners to welcome him, just a wall of noise from about 70,000 home fans who were all on their feet. On his walk along the touchline to the dugout, Van Gaal gave a cheery thumbs up and a wave to the fans nearest to him. Unlike on Tuesday, there was no autograph signing this time - it was time to get down to business - but he did take time to look up and around him to take in his surroundings. He had written in his first programme notes that the greeting he was given before the Valencia game was so good it gave him goosebumps, but the sheer volume of Saturday's reception might just have surprised him again. United's long list of injured and unfit players, as well as summer departures and a shortage of new signings, meant Van Gaal had to turn to youth for his first competitive United line-up. Media playback is not supported on this device Two locally born academy graduates, defender Tyler Blackett and midfielder Jesse Lingard, came into his team so Van Gaal could stick with his favoured 3-5-2 formation. On paper, this was a positive thing. After all, the Dutchman has had a reputation for developing young players since his Ajax days, and United have a rich history of bringing players through their ranks. In reality it exposed how thin United's squad is at present, in terms of both quality and personnel for the way Van Gaal wants to play. His side actually began the game well, with new skipper Wayne Rooney a bundle of energy and Lingard, employed as wing-back darting up and down the right flank. But Swansea seemed to be soaking up the home pressure all too easily, and were also looking dangerous on the break, something they made the most of when Ki Sung-yueng was allowed acres of space to fire them into the lead. United fans might have to get used to it. When he was asked about it after the game, United's defensive vulnerability in the first half was something Van Gaal seemed to accept came with wing-backs, a three-man defence and a high defensive line. \\"Every team will create chances against us because we are playing with a big space behind us which is always very difficult to defend,\\" he explained, before going on to say he would not be changing anything in the future. Swansea were certainly not complaining. Van Gaal barely moved a muscle on the touchline when his team fell behind, and in fact stayed rooted in his seat throughout the match. He looked cool and calm and did not rant and rave at half-time either, when he made a substitution - Nani for Javier Hernandez - and switched formation to 4-2-3-1. \\"We were not playing well and we were behind, so I changed the system to one they have used a lot at United before,\\" Van Gaal said afterwards. \\"During the break I always look to the future so I talked only about the change of system and how they have to act in that system. That is what you have to do in that situation, you have to help your players.\\" Initially, it seemed the renowned tactician had done it again. United emerged a more fluid attacking team and soon equalised through Wayne Rooney's acrobatic volley. Sadly for United, their momentum petered out and, thanks to more uncertain defending, Gylfi Sigurdsson sealed the three points for Swansea. Van Gaal put a positive spin on the outcome of his first game but there was thinly veiled criticism among his praise for his players' efforts. \\"I told them in the dressing room that I could not say they hadn't tried their utmost,\\" he said. \\"It was unbelievable what a fantastic mentality they have shown. \\"But reaching the level we want is something different. That is not only running, but also to use your brain and then you can play like a team. In that aspect, we failed today.\\" There was nothing downbeat about the Dutchman in defeat but he definitely saved the spikier side of his personality for the press, who pushed him on how urgently reinforcements were needed. When asked by one journalist how many players he would like to bring in before the window shuts on 1 September, Van Gaal replied: \\"No I will not discuss that with you. \\"I am sorry but I was asked the same question when I was in my press conference on Friday and I gave the same reply. I believe you were in that press conference because I remember your face.\\" What is not in doubt is that new players are needed but, in the meantime, at least some old favourites are on their way back. Robin van Persie was not considered fit enough to feature against Swansea because he reported back late from the World Cup, but Van Gaal confirmed he is \\"closer to selection now\\". When that happens, and also when the promised signings are made, maybe the slogan on that scarf will be true after all. Until then, it appears not even 'King Louis' can make the difference that the United fans demand. Summary:","output":"The article talks about the performance of Manchester United under the management of Louis van Gaal, referring to a game against Swansea. Despite hopes of fans that Van Gaal's presence would invigorate the team, United suffered a disappointing defeat, reminiscent of their performance during David Moyes's tenure as manager. The article points out that despite Van Gaal's proven track record, the same problems persist due to the poor composition of the team, and even great tactics couldn't make up for a lack of quality players.  During the game, United started well, but Swansea took over the lead, capitalizing on United's defensive vulnerability. Van Gaal reacted by switching formation at half-time from a 3-5-2 to a more traditional 4-2-3-1 and substituting a less effective player. The adjustment initially worked, and the team equalized through Wayne Rooney. However, Swansea overcame United's defense, sealing three points for themselves.  Van Gaal tried to stay positive after the match, praising the team's spirit but acknowledging that they failed in displaying collective intelligence on the pitch. Amid calls for new player signings, Van Gaal remained evasive. The article concludes with the hope that the return of Robin van Persie, and potential new signings, may yet confirm fans' belief in Van Gaal's ability to turn around the club's fortunes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While both sentences share the broader theme of time passing, eating, and contemplating about the future, there are a few details that are not the same or cannot be determined from the information provided.  In the first sentence, it is only stated that the woman is \\"munching buns\\". This is a general term that can refer to any kind of bun, so we don't know if the buns she is eating are hot cross buns as suggested in the second sentence.  Moreover, the second sentence mentions \\"her future with him,\\" implying that she's thinking about another individual and her potential future with that person. However, the first sentence only states \\"reflected on the future,\\" which doesn't clarify whose future it is or whether anyone else is involved. Without knowing who \\"him\\" is in the second sentence, we cannot confirm that it accurately follows the first statement.  Lastly, even though both sentences agree that the woman is thinking about the future, there is a subtle difference in the words 'reflecting' and 'pondering'. Reflecting can be about thinking back on past actions or choices in relation to the future, whereas pondering generally refers to thinking carefully about something that's currently happening or that might happen in the future.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 440 = 299*n - 343*n for n, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms involving n on the right side of the equation. The right side of the equation consists of two terms that involve n (299*n and -343*n). We can combine these terms by subtracting 343*n from 299*n. 440 = 299*n - 343*n → 440 = (299 - 343)*n Step 2: Simplify the right side of the equation. Now, we can simplify the expression within the parentheses: (299 - 343)*n → (-44)*n So, the equation becomes: 440 = -44*n Step 3: Isolate n. To isolate n, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -44. 440 / -44 = -44*n / -44 Step 4: Solve for n. Now, we can simplify the equation: -10 = n So, the answer is n = -10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Meanwhile, a killing spree targeting random locals is attributed to the Canadians, but the real perpetrators are a group of vampires, who are commonly confused with the Black Eyed Peas. Becca quickly befriends many students at her new high school, including Jennifer (Anneliese van der Pol). She is also intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter), who perplexes her during their time in the biology class, despite thinking she smells of tuna. Later, when Becca is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot, Edward stops the vehicle by thrusting another student in the van's way. He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother. Edward corrects her, saying he is a vampire but that he only consumes animal blood. He also states he is a killer, but despite this, Becca agrees to go to prom with Edward. Later, Becca and Edward kiss passionately in her room; Becca, wanting to have sex with Edward, then attempts to seduce him, but he abstains.

After being drafted in the 1966 MLB draft by Los Angeles, John Robert Gamble wanted to be acquired by the Tigers and succeeded in 1970. Possible answers:  a). Yes.  b). It's impossible to say.  c). No.","output":"b). It's impossible to say. Based on the information provided, John Robert Gamble was indeed drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1966 MLB Draft and was acquired by the Detroit Tigers in the 1970 Rule V Draft. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest that Gamble specifically wanted to be acquired by the Tigers. The process of being drafted and acquired by another team depends on various factors such as a player's skill, team requirements, and other considerations. In professional sports, players do not usually have a say in where they are drafted or traded unless specific clauses in their contracts provide them with that control. Though it is conceivable that Gamble may have wanted to play for the Tigers, there is simply not enough information to definitively conclude that this desire drove him towards an eventual acquisition by the Tigers in 1970. Furthermore, we cannot ascertain Gamble's personal feelings or wishes based solely on his career trajectory. In conclusion, while we can track the factual progression of John Robert Gamble's career from the Dodgers to the Tigers, we cannot determine his motivations or desires without more information. Thus, it is impossible to say whether or not Gamble specifically wanted to be acquired by the Detroit Tigers following his initial drafting by the Los Angeles Dodgers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: People born in winter are more likely to suffer mental health disorders, according to a recent study carried out by researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. Researchers raised baby mice from birth to weaning   in either \\"summer\\" light cycles of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark or \\"winter\\" cycles of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of dark. A third group experienced 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark a day. Then half the winter mice stayed in a winter cycle, while half switched to a summer schedule. The summer mice were similarly _ . The mice raised in equal periods of light and dark were split into three groups, one of which stayed on the 12hour schedule, one of which joined the winter group, and one of which joined the summer group. After 28 days, it turns out the summerborn mice behaved the same whether they stayed on the summer cycle or switched to winter. But among the winterborn mice, those stayed in winter kept their previous schedule, while those that switched to summer stayed active for an extra hour and a half, which indicates that mice born and weaned in a winter light cycle showed dramatic disruptions in their biological clocks. The finding is the first of its kind in mammals, and it could explain why people born in winter are at higher risk for mental health disorders including bipolar depression, schizophrenia and seasonal affective disorder. \\"We know that the biological clock regulates mood in humans,\\"said study researcher McMahon. \\"If the mechanism   similar to the one that we found in mice operates in humans, then it could not only have an effect on a number of behavioral disorders, but also have a more general effect on personality.\\" What's the main idea of the text?

This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid. When spaceships are destroyed by hostile alien beings, there would be no sound heard. Sound waves can travel through many kinds of matter.

At the play audition, Donald didn't get the role, though Christopher did, so","output":"Donald decided to try his best even though he was only cast as an understudy. He knew that time was of essence and anything could happen before the curtain dropped on opening night. Donald consoled himself with the thought that Christopher, being his best friend, would help him sharpen his skills and maybe even help him get more involved in the play. After all, they had been through thick and thin together, and sharing a stage was something that they both desired. During the weeks leading up to the performance, both friends pushed each other to keep learning and improving, which led to some comic missteps and late-night rehearsals. They both had the dedication and passion for acting and knew that a strong foundation was imperative if they wished to succeed in this cut-throat world. Christopher was grateful for Donald's support and he genuinely wanted Donald to shine in the play too. He could see that his friend would put in the work and that they could elevate each other to new heights. Christopher made sure that they both got every opportunity to be the best they could be. After all, success was nothing if not shared with the ones you care about. Many late nights, countless script readings, and endless cups of coffee later, the day of the opening show arrived. As the curtain rose, the nerves set in. Donald remembered the countless times he had wished for a lead role, yet here he stood backstage, genuinely excited and proud to be an understudy. The play moved into full swing and Christopher was delivering a stellar performance. Donald even caught the director smiling as the audience roared in laughter and applause. It was a hit, and everyone knew it. As the performance reached the midway point, something unimaginable happened. Christopher, while performing one of his well-rehearsed stunts, slipped and fell. The audience gasped. The cast members, equally shocked, tried to make light of it, but it was clear something was wrong. The curtain had to be closed to assess Christopher's condition. As it turned out, Christopher had sustained a serious sprain and was unable to continue. With Christopher's encouragement, the director turned to Donald - it was now his chance to step up and shine in the lead role. Donald felt a mixture of excitement and dread as he prepared to take the stage. His best friend believed in him, and he couldn't let him down. As the curtain opened once again, Donald took a deep breath and stepped onto the stage. The adrenaline coursed through his veins, and he delivered lines and movement with a sense of confidence and passion. The audience quickly warmed up to \\"the new guy\\" and the rest of the cast followed suit. In the end, the play was a smashing success. Both Christopher and Donald gained recognition for their outstanding performances. It was a tale of true friendship, perseverance, and the power of believing in one another. As they stood on the stage together during the final curtain call, the spotlight illuminating their bond of brotherhood, they knew that their friendship and support had been the critical factor in carrying both of them through to this moment. Life was unpredictable, that was for sure, but all the hard work and dedication to their craft had paid off. Donald had learned that though accomplishments and accolades were important, the true success came from having someone who believed in him, someone who supported him and improved him unwaveringly, and that person was Christopher. Donald always knew that he was more than just an understudy. And now, so did the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Philip Henry Sheridan (March 6, 1831 - August 5, 1888) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. His career was noted for his rapid rise to major general and his close association with General-in-chief Ulysses S. Grant, who transferred Sheridan from command of an infantry division in the Western Theater to lead the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the East. In 1864, he defeated Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and his destruction of the economic infrastructure of the Valley, called \\"The Burning\\" by residents, was one of the first uses of scorched earth tactics in the war. In 1865, his cavalry pursued Gen. Robert E. Lee and was instrumental in forcing his surrender at Appomattox. The protection of the Great Plains fell under the Department of the Missouri, an administrative area of over 1,000,000 mi.2, encompassing all land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock was assigned to the department in 1866 but had mishandled his campaign, resulting in Sioux and Cheyenne raids that attacked mail coaches, burned the stations, and killed the employees. They also killed and kidnapped a considerable number of settlers on the frontier. Under pressure from the governors, General Grant turned to Sheridan. In September 1866, Sheridan arrived at the former Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg, Texas, where he spent three months subduing Indians in the Texas Hill Country.  In August 1867, Grant appointed Sheridan to head the Department of the Missouri and pacify the Plains. His troops, even supplemented with state militia, were spread too thin to have any real effect. He conceived a strategy similar to the one he used in the Shenandoah Valley. In the Winter Campaign of 1868-69 (of which the Battle of Washita River was part) he attacked the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes in their winter quarters, taking their supplies and livestock and killing those who resisted, driving the rest back into their reservations. When Sherman was promoted to General of the Army following Grant's election as President of the United States, Sheridan was appointed to command the Military Division of the Missouri, with all the Great Plains under his command. Professional hunters, trespassing on Indian land, killed over 4 million bison by 1874, and Sheridan applauded: \\"Let them kill, skin and sell until the buffalo is exterminated\\". When the Texas legislature considered outlawing bison poaching on tribal lands, Sheridan personally testified against it, suggesting that the legislature should give each of the hunters a medal, engraved with a dead buffalo on one side and a discouraged-looking Indian on the other.  Eventually the Indians returned to their designated reservations. Sheridan's department conducted the Red River War, the Ute War, and the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, which resulted in the death of a trusted subordinate, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The Indian raids subsided during the 1870s and were almost over by the early 1880s, as Sheridan became the commanding general of the U.S. Army.  Comanche Chief Tosawi reputedly told Sheridan in 1869, \\"Tosawi, good Indian,\\" to which Sheridan supposedly replied, \\"The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.\\" In Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Dee Brown attributed the quote to Sheridan, stating that \\"Lieutenant Charles Nordstrom, who was present, remembered the words and passed them on, until in time they were honed into an American aphorism: The only good Indian is a dead Indian. Sheridan denied he had ever made the statement. Biographer Roy Morris Jr. states that, nevertheless, popular history credits Sheridan with saying \\"The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\" This variation \\"has been used by friends and enemies ever since to characterize and castigate his Indian-fighting career.\\" What happened as a result of this?","output":"As a result of General Sheridan's actions and strategies, the Native American tribes of the Great Plains experienced significant devastation and hardship. Sheridan's scorched-earth tactics, similar to those he used in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War, led to the destruction of their winter quarters, supplies, and livestock during the Winter Campaign of 1868-69. This forced the tribes, such as the Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Comanche, to retreat to their designated reservations. Sheridan's support for the professional hunters who killed over 4 million bison further contributed to the decline of the American Indian way of life. Bison were a primary resource for the tribes, providing food, clothing, and other essential materials. The massive loss of bison population disrupted the tribes' livelihood and forced them to depend more heavily on the U.S. government for sustenance. Sheridan's military campaigns, such as the Red River War, the Ute War, and the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, led to further suffering for the Native American tribes and violent encounters between them and the U.S. Army. These campaigns eventually subdued the Indian raids in the Great Plains, with the hostilities almost coming to an end by the early 1880s. The consequences of General Sheridan's tactics and views towards the Native Americans left a lasting impact on their lives and culture. The tribes were forced into reservations, many of their essential resources were depleted, and their fighting spirit was suppressed. Sheridan's reputed remark, \\"The only good Indians I ever saw were dead,\\" has been widely attributed to him, encapsulating the harsh and ruthless approach used to pacify the Plains. This quote, whether actually spoken by Sheridan or not, came to symbolize the devastating consequences of the U.S. Army's Indian-fighting campaigns, which sadly led to the subjugation of the Native American tribes and the destruction of their way of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the person Lennon become involved with in a protest?, using the article: In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response..., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: From what is Lobster Man instructed to steal air? ?  Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P. Shelldrake. Shelldrake has been desperately searching for a way to avoid problems with the IRS and unpaid millions owed them in back taxes. His brilliant yet overpaid accountant devises a scheme to allow the producer to write off the expenses of his next movie release, but only if the film is a box office flop. Armed with his foolproof plan, Shelldrake agrees to meet with Stevie and screen his film \\"Lobster Man From Mars\\" (financed by Stevie's jailed con man Uncle Joey). The plot resembles the premise of The Producers by Mel Brooks. Inside Shelldrake's private screening room, the \\"film within the film\\" begins. They watch the weird plot unfold: Mars suffers from a severe air leakage. The King of Mars commands the dreaded Lobster Man and his assistant Mombo, a gorilla wearing a space helmet, to pilot his flying saucer to Earth then steal its air. Once landed, the Lobster Man wastes no time transforming hapless victims into smoking skeletons. On a lonely road, John and Mary, a young and innocent couple discovers the hiding place of the flying saucer in a dark and mysterious cave. They attempt to warn the authorities but are ignored. Successfully contacting Professor Plocostomos, a plan is created to lure the Lobster Man to Mr. Throckmorton's Haunted House that just happens to be surrounded by boiling hot springs.  Once lured, it is simply a matter of pushing the Lobster Man into the hot water where he will be boiled to death. The plan is interrupted by Colonel Ankrum and his troops. The house is shelled and destroyed, the Lobster Man flees to his cave, taking Mary with him. Answer:","output":"Lobster Man is instructed to steal air from Earth.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Question: Title: Carnival of Souls rip-off CD Product review: This CD, supposedly Gene Moore's score from the classic film soundtrack, is actually nothing more than a cheaply produced recording of the mixed film soundtrack, with dialogue, footsteps, noises, etc. along with the music. If you think - as I did - that you'll be able to hear the admirable organ score better on this CD than you can with your own videotape - think again. This is a completely worthless CD, as you can easily make a cassette or CDR recording off your VCR that will be EXACTLY the same, except for some irrelevant organ hymn music that was never in the film in the first place.

A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration.

In support of Nine Inch Nails' third full-length studio album, The Fragile, the live-band reformed for the Fragility tour.  The lineup remained largely the same from the Self-Destruct tour, featuring Finck, Clouser, and Lohner.  To replace long-time member Vrenna, Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon.  Dillon would remain a member of the live band until 2005. Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following The Fragile's lukewarm sales.  Reznor instead committed himself to fund the entire tour out of his own pocket, concluding that \\"The reality is, I’m broke at the end of the tour,\\" but also adding \\"I will never present a show that isn’t fantastic.\\"The Fragility tour began in late 1999, running until mid-2000, and was broken into two major legs, Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0 respectively.

Before the first Fragility performance date in Spain, Nine Inch Nails opened their final rehearsal in London to 100 fans. Kick-starting the tour was a performance of the title track from The Fragile at the MTV Video Music Awards.  Atari Teenage Riot opened for Nine Inch Nails during Fragility 1.0, and A Perfect Circle for Fragility 2.0.  At the time, A Perfect Circle featured Josh Freese on drums, who would later replace Dillon and play drums for Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Where is there more asthma? Context: The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses. It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies. Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction. Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets. The answer is:","output":"There is more asthma in environments with reduced exposure to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses during childhood, such as in modern, cleaner societies with smaller family sizes. Lower rates of asthma are found on farms and in households with pets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Options:  A. oil refineries  B. underground  C. wall  D. kitchen  E. bathroom Answer:","output":"E. Bathroom The most plumbing in a house is likely to be found in the bathroom. This is because a typical bathroom contains multiple plumbing fixtures such as sinks, showerheads, bathtubs, and toilets that require regular functioning of the plumbing system. All these fixtures require a constant and properly functioning water supply and wastewater management, which adds to the complexity and demand of the plumbing system in a bathroom. Let's evaluate the other options to further substantiate the choice: A. Oil refineries: This option is not relevant to the context of a house. Oil refineries are large industrial complexes responsible for processing crude oil into useful products like gasoline, diesel, and other petrochemicals. B. Underground: While some plumbing components run underground, such as the main water supply line, sewer pipes, and possibly yard irrigation systems, the majority of intricate and vital plumbing connections are concentrated in specific areas within the house, like the bathroom and kitchen. Additionally, underground plumbing serves as the connection between the house plumbing system and a more extensive city or town infrastructure, rather than being a primary location for the house's plumbing system itself. C. Wall: Plumbing pipes often run through walls to reach fixtures. Although some plumbing components are housed within walls, it is not the most concentrated area for plumbing in a house. Additionally, plumbing in walls typically includes water supply and waste management connections to and from other areas in the house, such as the bathroom and kitchen. D. Kitchen: The kitchen does have a significant amount of plumbing, including connections to appliances like dishwashers, refrigerators with water dispensers, and sink faucets. However, the plumbing system in a kitchen is typically less intricate than that found in a bathroom, as there are fewer plumbing fixtures located in the kitchen. In conclusion, based on the presence and complexity of multiple plumbing fixtures, the most plumbing in a house is likely to be found in the bathroom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Elizabeth Short (July 29, 1924 - January 14 or 15, 1947), known posthumously as \\"the Black Dahlia\\", was an American woman who was found murdered in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Her case became highly publicized due to the graphic nature of the crime, which entailed her corpse having been mutilated and severed at the waist. A native of Boston, Short had spent her early life in Massachusetts and Florida before relocating to California, where her father lived. Context: In late 1942, Phoebe received a letter of apology from her presumed-deceased husband, which revealed that he was in fact alive and had started a new life in California. In December, at age eighteen, Elizabeth relocated to Vallejo to live with her father, whom she had not seen since she was six years old. At the time, he was working at the nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard on San Francisco Bay. Arguments between Short and her father led to her moving out in January 1943. Shortly after, she took a job at the base exchange at Camp Cooke (now Vandenberg Air Force Base), near Lompoc, California, living with several friends, and briefly with an Air Force sergeant who was reportedly abusive to her. Short left Lompoc in mid-1943 and moved to Santa Barbara, where she was arrested on September 23, 1943 for underage drinking at a local bar. The juvenile authorities sent her back to Medford, but she returned instead to Florida, making only occasional visits to Massachusetts.  While in Florida, she met Major Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr., a decorated US Army Air Force officer at the 2d Air Commando Group. He was training for deployment to the China Burma India Theater of Operations of World War II. She told friends that he had written to propose marriage while he was recovering from injuries from a plane crash in India. She accepted his offer, but Gordon died in a second crash on August 10, 1945, less than a week before the Japanese surrender ended the war.  She relocated to Los Angeles in July 1946 to visit Army Air Force Lieutenant Joseph Gordon Fickling, whom she had known from Florida. Fickling was stationed at the Naval Reserve Air Base in Long Beach. Short spent the last six months of her life in Southern California, mostly in the Los Angeles area; shortly before her death, she had been working as a waitress, and rented a room behind the Florentine Gardens nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard. Short has been variously described and depicted as an aspiring or \\"would-be\\" actress. According to some sources, she did in fact have aspirations to be a film star, though she had no known acting jobs or credits. Question: Did she stay in Florida long before returning to California? Answer:","output":"Yes, Elizabeth Short stayed in Florida for a significant period before returning to California. After leaving California in mid-1943 and moving to Santa Barbara, she was arrested for underage drinking and sent back to Medford. However, she chose to return to Florida instead, where she had previously lived for some time. While in Florida, she met Major Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr., with whom she developed a serious relationship. Her connection to Gordon played a major role in her life during her time in Florida. She accepted his marriage proposal in 1945, but unfortunately, he died in a plane crash in August of the same year. After Gordon's tragic death, Short continued to stay in Florida for some time. It was not until July 1946, nearly a year later, that she relocated to Los Angeles, California, to visit Army Air Force Lieutenant Joseph Gordon Fickling, an acquaintance from her time in Florida. Upon her return to California, she spent the last six months of her life in the region, primarily in the Los Angeles area. During this time, she worked as a waitress and rented a room behind the Florentine Gardens nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard. Although there are varying accounts of her acting aspirations, it is suggested that she hoped to build a career in the entertainment industry. In summary, Elizabeth Short stayed in Florida for a substantial duration before returning to California. Her relationship with Major Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr. played a significant role in her life during her time in Florida. After his death, she continued to stay in Florida for almost a year before moving back to California in July 1946."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Commentary: Liberals let loose on Palin and Joe the Plumber By Ruben Navarrette Jr. Special to CNN Editor's Note: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union-Tribune. Read his column here. Ruben Navarrette says liberal attacks on Sarah Palin and Joe Wurzelbacher are unfair. SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- I thought liberals were supposed to be good-hearted, open-minded and non-judgmental. Tell that to the angry Left's favorite piñata, Sarah Palin. As far as liberals are concerned, Palin can do no right just as Barack Obama and Joe Biden can do no wrong. In fact, Biden is catching more passes than an NFL wide receiver. As Palin herself pointed out in a recent CNN interview, imagine if she had been the one to imply that electing Obama would invite calamity. Biden does it, and the media shrug. I also thought the Democratic Party was supposed to go to bat for the little guy, the everyday Joe the Plumber. Tell that to Joe Wurzelbacher, the Ohio resident who got his 15 minutes -- and 40 lashes -- because he dared question Obama about his tax plan. Obama insists that the plan would raise taxes only on those Americans earning more than 250,000 per year. It was then Obama made his clumsy \\"spread the wealth\\" comment. What was Joe thinking: that we live in a democracy where everyday Americans who pay the salaries of elected officials can dare question their policies? That just isn't done. To prove it, the elites who run the Democratic Party -- along with their surrogates in the media and organized labor -- went after the plumber. We now know that Samuel Joe Wurzelbacher owes back taxes, doesn't have a plumbing license (he told the Associated Press he doesn't need one because he works for someone else's company), and may not be registered to vote. Commenting on a CNN.com story, one condescending reader wrote that Joe the Plumber should pipe down and \\"get back in my bathroom and unclog the toilet.\\" Even Biden and Obama got in a few licks. Biden quipped to Jay Leno that Democrats wanted to take care of \\"Joe-the-real-plumber-with-a-license,\\" and Obama sarcastically asked supporters, \\"how many plumbers do you know making 250,000 a year?\\" The implication being that Joe the Plumber isn't who he pretends to be. What worries me is that the Democrats aren't what they pretend to be. Obama supporters like to talk about how the Democratic presidential nominee has lived the American Dream. So why is it to so hard for them to conceive of a situation where someone dreams of earning more money a few years from now than they earn today. Has Barack Obama consumed all the social mobility this country has to offer, so there isn't any left for the rest of us? Now, the Obama-Biden boosters have refocused their attention on their earlier irritant, Sarah Palin. The latest media template is that the vice presidential nominee is a drag on the GOP ticket. Pundits detect a backlash, not just among Democrats who love to hate Sarah Palin but also among women, independents and seniors. They cite polls showing Palin with an unfavorable rating of 50 percent. So what? We're in the post-Clinton, post-Bush era of polarization where any politician with a pulse -- Sorry, Joe Biden -- will be loved by half the country and hated by the other half. It's surreal. Before McCain put Palin on the ticket, he was getting 200 people at campaign rallies, and now, when he appears when Palin, he gets 20,000. Yes, definitely a drag. iReport.com: Rock star welcome for Palin in Ohio McCain oversold it when he said Palin was the most qualified vice presidential candidate in recent history. Better than Dick Cheney? Could she be worse? Obama might have paid Biden the same compliment if his running mate hadn't already told supporters that Hillary Clinton would have been a better choice. Then there is the faux-scandal that the Republican National Committee shelled out 150,000 in the past several weeks on Palin and her family for campaign wardrobe, accessories, makeup, etc. Many Americans don't see why it's a story. Fellow hockey mom Page Growney of New Canaan, Conn., asked The Associated Press, \\"What did you want to see her in, a turtleneck from L.L. Bean?\\" Still, we're told, this tempest in a Gucci bag has some Republicans worrying that shopping sprees at Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue might undermine Palin's everywoman image. To think, just last month, the criticism was that Sarah the Moose Hunter wasn't sufficiently sophisticated or glamorous. Now her wardrobe signals the hockey mom is high-maintenance. Just how many more caricatures -- some of them contradictory -- can we expect the left to throw at Sarah Palin before time runs out on this election? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr. All About Sarah Palin • Taxes • Joseph Biden What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how liberals have been attacking Sarah Palin and Joe the Plumber unfairly. The author, Ruben Navarrette Jr., points out that liberals are criticizing Palin and Joe the Plumber while giving pass to Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points.  Please answer this question : Which student learned more about how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has? Answer:","output":"Jane learned more about how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. This is evident from the given situation and hint, which indicate that Jane decided to know more about alkanes, which are saturated hydrocarbons. The hint further explains that the name of specific alkanes always ends in -ane and the first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was alienated from Johnson due to doubts concerning the 1965 bombing of North Vietnam? , can you please find it?   Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the 1964...

What are the best ways to lose a lot of weight as quickly as possible? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"The fastest way to lose weight successfully involves a combination of multiple approaches, including dietary changes, exercise, and lifestyle modifications. Here's the step-by-step process and justification for each step: 1. Consult a professional: Before starting any weight loss program, it is essential to consult a doctor, dietitian, or nutritionist. This will allow you to receive personalized guidance based on your unique health conditions and needs. 2. Cut caloric intake: Reducing the calories consumed is a primary step in losing weight. To achieve this, focus on incorporating nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods, making portion control a priority, and eliminating or limiting empty calorie foods. 3. Balance macronutrients: Ensure your meals contain a balanced mix of macronutrients, including lean protein, whole-grain carbs, and healthy fats. This assists in regulating hunger and supporting muscle preservation while losing weight. 4. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water throughout the day can help with metabolism and appetite regulation, making it easier to manage calorie intake. 5. Exercise regularly: Engage in both cardiovascular (aerobic) activities and strength training exercises on a regular basis. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity, spread throughout the week. 6. Make lifestyle changes: Adopting sustainable lifestyle habits, such as getting enough sleep, reducing stress, and staying accountable through a support system or tracking app, will help maintain a long-term weight loss plan. 7. Monitor progress: Regularly assess your progress and adjust your plan accordingly. This may involve making changes to your diet, exercise routine, or other behaviors, as necessary. These questions are similar but not exactly the same. Both questions inquire about ways to lose weight quickly, but the first one emphasizes successful weight loss, implying that the method should lead to lasting results.

Answer:","output":"The product review provided clearly conveys a negative sentiment. A detailed analysis of the review reveals several reasons for this negative perception.  Firstly, the title of the review, \\"Eww,\\" is a colloquial expression that signifies disgust or dissatisfaction, immediately setting a negative tone.  Secondly, the reviewer notes that these are their first Skullcandy headphones, implying that they had some expectations or interest in the brand. However, their experience was disappointing, as evidenced by their choice to describe the sound quality as \\"bad.\\" Poor sound quality in headphones is a significant downside, as the primary function of headphones is to provide a pleasant and enjoyable audio experience. Thirdly, the reviewer experienced physical discomfort while using the product, as they mention developing \\"blisters in my ears\\" while using the headphones. This suggests that the product may be poorly designed or manufactured, and could potentially be a risk to the user's health. The discomfort experienced by the reviewer further emphasizes their dissatisfaction and negative sentiment. Lastly, the product had a short lifespan, with the reviewer stating that the headphones \\"died in a month of light use.\\" Customers generally expect their electronics, particularly portable ones like headphones, to have reasonable durability and to withstand general wear and tear. A product failing within a month is, therefore, greatly disappointing and contributes to the negative sentiment surrounding the product. The negative sentiment is reinforced by the reviewer's final advice to \\"Pass on these,\\" urging others not to purchase the product due to their unsatisfactory experience.

Dear Vince,  Just to remind you, I will be graduating this May with an MBA from Rice. My concentration is in finance, but I'm also an undergraduate engineer from Cornell University and an IT specialist. I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search. I've been somewhat frustrated trying to explain why I'm more effective than my peers. Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year. This was probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into program code quickly and reliably. I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and show quick success. What I can't say in my resume is that I'm the best in my class at finance, statistics, and information technology. However, this combination is also my biggest crutch. I'd like to engage all my skills, but typically, interviewers are only looking for one. Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in my skill set? I'm indifferent to moving anywhere in the U.S.  Vince, in any case, I appreciate your time and any suggestions you could offer. I had a wonderful time working for you, we really had a good team. If you have any questions for me, please call or email me at any time.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage. A:","output":"\\"What is 'El Nino'?\\" A) A Spanish celebration that takes place around Christmas season. B) A type of storm that only affects fishermen. C) An event of nature represented by a huge area of warm water in the Pacific Ocean that affects the world's weather. D) A dangerous weather condition that can be prevented by stopping the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The correct answer is C as stated in the article, El Nino is a large area of warm water in the Pacific Ocean that affects worldwide weather. It is an event of nature and not specific to any one group like fishermen, nor is it a celebration. According to the text, stopping the greenhouse effect and air pollution might help the world's weather but it isn't directly preventing El Nino. The passage indicates that El Nino is a natural event that cannot be prevented."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

With every step, brown water surfaces between the bags.      It's like that until you get to the flat surface of her cement driveway, then the sandbags become a wall holding back Red River.      Several of her neighbors at the back of Les Maisons Sur La Rouge Subdivision are in a similar predicament.

Their large houses look like islands in a little sea of reddish-brown water.      \\"We're holding back the river,\\" she said. \\"They're holding back the river, and we're praying that we don't get any bad rain or storm. I know this should crest soon. We're holding our breath.\\"      RELATED:River passes 37 foot mark      Simpson's house sits on the slope of a hill. Her dock is at least 22 feet under water. Within the last four days, the swollen Red River inched closer to her home. The water rose, swallowing Simpson's fence, butterfly garden and a rose bush planted near a century-old cypress tree her grandchildren run around.      White sandbags form a low wall. Pumps catch water breaches in the makeshift barrier wall.

A generator rattles loudly. Cool air is being pumped into the home. The bottom of the house is empty. Simpson said the living room furniture was moved upstairs as a precaution.

According to CBS station KSLA's Adria Goins, the waters crested at more than 38 feet in 1945. Today, the river peaks at 37 feet, seven feet above the flooding stage. Twenty-four-hour sandbag stations have been set up and officials are urging people to pick them up day or night to protect their homes from the rising water.      The flooding is swallowing dozens of houses, turning them into islands and submerging them up to their roofs.      Louisiana's National Guard worked late into the night filling sandbags, the white satchels serving as a line of defense against the overflowing river.      For Caddo Parish Sheriff Steve Prator, the devastation is personal.      \\"The glass is beginning to break from the pressure of the water,\\" Prator said.      He's trying to save his home from the two feet of water that's already crept in, surrounding and destroying his family's belongings.      \\"It's devastating,\\" he said.      On Sunday, a man and his dog were evacuated by boat and Black Hawk helicopters were used to deliver a pair of water pumps to a water treatment plant that's been isolated by the flooding.      Lt. Terrell Hamilton cannot believe just how high the river is.      \\"Wow. One word, wow,\\" Hamilton said.      The waters are supposed to stay at the 37-foot mark for the next few days and aren't expected to dip below the flooding stage until the end of the month.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Whose other entries were preferred by the judge awarding the prize? is inside the article: Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism..., can you guess it ?

One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is HMS Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian, the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti, and his daughter, Tehani, and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language.

Would \\"Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, universal constants emerge from scientific laws.\\" be a reasonable answer? pick from the following.  A). No;  B). Yes; Answer:","output":"A). No; While the statement you provided showcases the significance of universal constants in scientific laws, it does not directly answer the question about the top three laws in science. Here's a more suitable and detailed response: The top three laws in science are subjective, as different fields and perspectives may emphasize different principles. However, in terms of their historical importance and widespread application, the following laws are considered fundamental: 1. Newton's Laws of Motion (physics) - These three laws form the basis of classical mechanics and govern the motion of objects.    a) First law: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an external force.    b) Second law: The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration (F = ma).    c) Third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 2. The Laws of Thermodynamics (physics/chemistry) - These laws describe the relationships between heat, energy, and work.    a) First law (Conservation of Energy): Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.    b) Second law: In any energy conversion, some amount of energy is lost as heat; hence, the entropy of a closed system always increases.    c) Third law: As the temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum. 3. The Laws of Mendelian Inheritance (biology) - These laws, proposed by Gregor Mendel, are the foundation for understanding genetic inheritance.    a) Law of Segregation: Each individual organism has two alleles for each trait, which segregate during gamete formation, so that each gamete contains only one allele for each trait.    b) Law of Independent Assortment: Alleles of different genes are transmitted independently of one another from parents to offspring.    c) Law of Dominance: When two organisms with different alleles for a trait are crossed, the dominant allele can mask the presence of the recessive allele in the offspring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals? Title: Doomsday Movie plot: In 2008, an unknown killer virus, dubbed \\"The Reaper Virus\\" infected Scotland. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, The UK government built a massive 60-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Britain. The quarantine was deemed a success; however, the extreme method employed by the government destroyed diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia. In 2035, 27 years after the quarantine, during a raid, police discover several people infected with Reaper Virus. The Prime Minister John Hatcher shares with domestic security chief Captain Nelson satellite footage of survivors in Scotland. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses Major Eden Sinclair to lead the team. Sinclair's team crosses the wall and goes to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the real name of the person whose father worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's? from the following article ?  Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another...

He saw his neighbor's beautiful, big, red and white kite. It was tied to a tall tree so it wouldn't fly away. Johnny was always fascinated by this kite. He loved how it soared and danced in the wind and wished he owned one just like it. Even though he knew he wasn't allowed to touch other people's things without asking, Johnny's desire to play with the kite overpowered his sense of rules. He thought, \\"Maybe just once wouldn't hurt,\\" and with a quick look around to see if anyone was watching, he untied the kite.  The moment Johnny took the kite in his hands, it caught a gust of wind and began to fly high up in the sky. It was even more magnificent close up. However, Johnny didn’t realize that flying a kite was harder than it looked. Suddenly, a strong breeze came, and the kite jerked out of his hands. Johnny tried to reach for it, but it was too late. The kite flew away, lost, maybe forever.  Some of the older kids and grown-ups saw this. They knew whose kite it was and how much it meant to the neighbor. So, they told Johnny's parents about his misadventure. The news spread across the neighborhood and soon reached the owner of the kite. Some people noticed and Johnny got in trouble.

Movie plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt has ordered the death of all the firstborn Hebrew male infants after hearing the prophecy of the Deliverer, but a Hebrew mother named Yoshebel saves her own infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\". Moses defends himself against the charges, arguing that he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier and proves his point with the impressive progress he is making. Rameses had earlier been charged by Sethi with finding out whether there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer. Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. Nefretiri kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of Levite cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses goes... Answer:","output":"Yoshebel saved her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He amassed a fortune of 1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education.  And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies.  Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity.  Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity.  A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: What is the name of Bradley's guide? Movie plot title: Il Paese del Sesso Selvaggio Movie plot: John Bradley is a British journalist and photographer on vacation in Bangkok, Thailand. He is first seen taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a kickboxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native Thai tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, Luhanà, is told that the group has captured a large fish-man. At the village, Bradley is hung in the net from a high pole, where a group of young children hit him with bamboo stalks. While hanging, Bradley witnesses the execution of two war criminals by his captive tribe. The tribe is at war with another, even more primitive Burmese tribe of cannibals, whom are... The answer to this question is:","output":"Tuan"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that \\"I, Robot\\" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too). I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as \\"retread\\" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others). \\"I, Robot\\" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to true winners. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The person who wrote this review feels disappointed and sad about the movie \\"I, Robot.\\" They think that the movie is not great or terrible, just a mix of old ideas and cliches. They find it depressing that people seem to enjoy this kind of movie with a simple plot, catchy dialogue, and fast-paced action. They also think that Will Smith's acting in the movie is just okay. Overall, the sentiment of this review is negative but with a hint of sadness about the current state of action movies and what people enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 1: Viruses cannot reproduce by themselves.  Fact 2: Often viruses are the cause of myocarditis.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"the cause of myocarditis cannot what?\\" with the following options:  - They may not survive.  - direct damage to the lungs  - A compound that donates proton  - live by the shore  - microorganisms  - survive in a body  - reproduce by themselves  - eat by themselves The answer to this question is:","output":"The cause of myocarditis cannot \\"reproduce by themselves.\\"  Given the two provided facts, it is essential to recognize that viruses rely heavily on host organisms to replicate. A virus invades host cells, hijacks their reproductive machinery to make identical copies of themselves, and then causes the host cell to burst, releasing the newly created viruses. This process allows the virus to infect other cells and spread throughout the host body. Myocarditis refers to the inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium), which often results from a viral infection. The second fact implies that viruses are a common cause of myocarditis. Once inside the host organism, the viruses responsible for myocarditis attack and damage the myocardial cells, leading to the heart's inflammation. This can result in symptoms like chest pain, fatigue, rapid or irregular heartbeats, and shortness of breath. Though some of the provided options may not be directly related to the question, it is crucial to use the given facts to accurately answer the query. Consequently, the statement that coincides with these details is that the cause of myocarditis (viruses) cannot reproduce by themselves.
